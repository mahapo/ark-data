He had been struggling for several weeks with the problem ofhow to approach it.“My first thought,” he told us, “was to write a slim volume, as in fact I calledit in the first introduction I wrote. I had long been wanting to tackle thewhole Gita, but that project, though it held paramount importance for me, alsofrightened me both because of its magnitude and because of its supremeimportance. The prospect that your coming,” he said to us, “might possiblydisrupt my line of thinking was what ‘put me over the edge,’ in the sense thatit brought me to a resolution of my dilemma! I felt I must begin work, or elselose whatever clarity I’d arrived at for the project already.”Actually, it was only a week or more after our arrival that he came to realizethat, instead of writing the “brief overview” he’d first intended, he hadactually launched (or been launched!) on writing the whole Gita.Throughout our visit, Swamiji, while playing the loving host—chatting with usfor hours, going out with us to shops and to dinner—spent all his free timeworking on this manuscript. In answer to our concern that he must be finding ourpresence a distraction from this work, he replied, “On the contrary, it ishelping me! I find the whole project so awe-inspiring that I’ve felt almostoverwhelmed by it. Your presence helps me to approach it simply, one day at atime. Getting feedback from you has helped also, even if it doesn’t clarifyideas I have already fairly clearly in my mind, for at least it keeps my feet onthe ground, mentally, while I wrestle with concepts so subtle that I must findways to make them relevant to everyone.” After our departure, others came tovisit Swamiji. He kept up the same schedule, and assured them all that theirpresence, far from distracting him, helped to “ground” him by relating what hewas writing to actual needs and realities.Unbelievably, he finished this work—comprising as it did, in its first draft,six hundred pages—in less than two months! To everyone, himself included, itseemed a miracle.“Fortunately,” he told us, “I have a very clear memory, and can recall vividlythe days I spent in Master’s company, reading his entire manuscript, and helpinghim with its editing. I said to him at the time, ‘Sir, this is the mostwonderful thing I have ever read!’” We too, in reading this manuscript, feelthat it is the greatest thing we have ever read. One day, Swamiji said to us, “Ifeel as though Master were working as I write—not only through me, but with me.”To us, this book—of the some eighty-five books Swami Kriyananda has written inhis life—is his masterpiece. That it is inspired will be evident to the readerwithout our saying so. What author, otherwise—especially one who has alwayslabored hard to make all his thoughts simple and clear—could have finished sucha book as this in less than two months?! He himself said to us, “I actuallythought I would have to devote ten years of my life to writing this book.” Addto that his present age—he is now in his eightieth year—and what we arediscussing amounts almost to a “labor of Hercules.” He told us, “My one fear wasthat I might not live long enough to see this work completed.”It was in May, 1950, while he was still twenty-three years old, that his guru,Paramhansa Yogananda, asked him to come over to his retreat to begin work withhim on the job of editing his commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita. Swamiji hadbeen staying five miles away, at the monks’ retreat, working on “editing” (healways puts the work he was doing then in quotes, reflecting how young he was atthe time!) the Master’s work on The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. The Master hadkept Swamiji with him during the first days of his dictation of his Gitacommentaries. He had then sent him to work alone, however, while he himselfconcentrated all his time on his commentaries. Now he was ready to begin workingwith Swamiji (whom he himself always called “Walter”) on the editing of his newmanuscript.The Master had told his monk disciples in January of that year, when he took“Walter” with him to the desert, “I prayed to Divine Mother and asked Her whom Ishould take with me to help with the editing. Your face appeared, Walter. That’swhy I am taking you.”After completing the manuscript, he asked his young disciple to come over andhelp him with the editing. For two months they worked together. The day “Walter”came over, his guru exclaimed to him ecstatically, “A new scripture has beenborn! Millions will find God through this work. Not just thousands—millions! Ihave seen it. I know!”During this period he told his disciple, “Your job in this life is lecturing,writing, and editing.” Later he added, “By editing my words, you yourself willgrow spiritually.” He then repeated something he had said to him already severaltimes: “You have a great work to do.”It seems clear, in retrospect, that Yogananda knew from the beginning thatKriyananda was destined to edit his Gita commentaries. Yet, despite manyindications that the Master knew Kriyananda would do this work, he could not sayso at the time: Another editor, much senior to “Walter,” was working on it.Meanwhile, Kriyananda was given many other things to do. His guru placed him incharge of the monks and asked him to write letters for him. The young monk endedup doing much reorganizing within his guru’s organization, went on widespreadlecture tours, taught, and guided the activities of centers throughout theworld. Many years were still to pass before all his guru’s predictions about hislife’s work would be fulfilled.Yogananda must surely have seen that his Gita commentaries would not come outthat year, as he wanted them to do. The urgency he expressed for their immediaterelease must have been prompted by his knowledge that, if they did not come outduring his lifetime, their publication would be delayed for many years. In fact,they finally came out only in 1995—forty-five years after their completion.During that time, Kriyananda fulfilled all his guru’s other predictions. The“great work” the Master had foretold included writing some eighty-five books,composing over 400 pieces of music, and founding seven communities in which,today, some 1,000 people live lives of dedication to God. In addition, he tooksome 15,000 photographs, many of which have appeared in his published works.In 1990, after forty years of writing spiritual books, composing spiritualmusic, and lecturing to and teaching thousands around the world, he felt guidedto take up the task of editing his master’s words. From then on, he created suchbooks as The Essence of Self-Realization (a book of his guru’s sayings); TheRubaiyat of Omar Khayyam Explained (an edition of Yogananda’s writing on thesubject); God Is for Everyone (a rewrite of Yogananda’s book, The Science ofReligion); and a final book of his guru’s sayings, Conversations with Yogananda.In the year 2003, Swamiji felt his guru’s call to found a new work in India. Helives now in the land of his guru’s birth, has a daily (prerecorded) televisionprogram on Aastha station, has written a correspondence course (Material SuccessThrough Yoga Principles), and has written several other books, besides. Hischief ambition for many years, however, has been to write this book.“When the first version of this book was finally published in 1995,” he told us,“I was disappointed. I remembered well the material my Guru had dictated in1950. But how different it was, now, from that original! It lacked the simplebeauty and clarity I remembered. It gave repeated evidence of drasticoverediting. I longed to offer at his feet a new version of the work he himselfhad done when I knew him. I don’t have access to the original, but fortunatelyhe has blessed me with a very clear memory. Could I, just possibly, reconstructfrom memory what he had done? Certainly I could not recall the actual phrasing,but it astonished me how much I did recall of the context. Perhaps . . .perhaps! Well, I could at least try!”And so, finally, on October 7, 2005, he felt the time had come to at least beginthe work on Paramhansa Yogananda’s Gita commentaries for which his guru hadbegun to train him during the winter and spring months of 1950—fifty-five yearsago. What began as an “overview” soon became a stanza-by-stanza commentary. Heskimmed lightly over the published version, primarily as a jog to his ownmemory, since the labored explanations were not as he remembered them. It wasmore helpful to him to tune in to the consciousness of Yogananda, which laybeyond what he read.For us, it was a great blessing to be present in India during the first weeks ofthis project, which he had finally undertaken. He told us, “Master’s thoughtspoured effortlessly into my mind, helping me to fill page after page with deepinsights and inspiration.”With a radiant look on his face, Swami Kriyananda often worked late into thenight. Sometimes he began work again in the early hours, long before dawn. Withquiet humility and deep inner joy, he told us who were with him. “I am filledwith such bliss as I write, it is hard to think of anything else! I feel thedeep delight my Guru takes in this work.” He finished the work on December 5th,less then two months later!Here, then, is a book that is a living tribute to two of India’s great spiritualcontributions to the world: the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita, and the importanceof the guru-disciple relationship. Through a long life of dedication to, andattunement with, his guru, Swami Kriyananda has—we deeply feel—presented thevibrant truth and power of his master’s original explanation of this belovedscripture. Yogananda has guided his disciple’s life and thoughts for nearlysixty years in such a way as to enable him to fulfill that commission, given somany years ago.It seems to us that this great scripture, known for ages as simply the BhagavadGita (the “Lord’s Song”), had to await this age of renewed consciousness thatmatter is energy, and that the need of religion in this new age is a teachingbased both on revelation and on common sense. Now the full story can be told.As it says in the Bhagavad Gita (10:11), “Out of pure compassion, I, the DivineOne who dwells in all, set alight in their hearts the blazing lamp of wisdom.”May you, too, find God’s light within you through this great new revelation ofancient, timeless scripture.Jyotish and Devi NovakDecember 14, 2005"},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]EXPLANATORY NOTEThe numbers of the chapters in this book have no particular correlation to theeighteen chapter numbers in the Bhagavad Gita itself. In the text that follows,all chapter references are to the Gita, and not to the thirty-one chapters ofthis commentary.Thoughts on Pronunciation and SpellingSanskrit words that are generally written with a “jn” but pronounced with aslightly nasal “gy” are treated more phonetically in this book. The following isan excerpt of a conversation I had with my Guru, Paramhansa Yogananda, in 1950.He was going over some of his writings with me when we came upon the word, gyana(wisdom). “Jnana,” he remarked, “is how scholars usually write it. I can’t seewhy. It isn’t pronounced ‘J-nana.’ And how else are you going to pronounce it,if you find it transliterated in that way? This is a simple example of scholarlypedantry.” Gyana is more correct, though in pure Sanskrit there is a nasalsound, which scholars have tried (futilely) to catch, with their “jnana.”“Another transliteration scholars prefer,” my Guru continued, “is to write ‘V’instead of ‘B.’ Instead of Bibaswat they write ‘Vivaswat.’ Instead of ‘Byasa’they write ‘Vyasa.’”In many languages, actually, there is only a slight difference, hardlydiscernible to foreigners, between the “b” and the “v,” but the “b” sound, forSanskrit, comes closer to the correct one.The title “Paramhansa” itself I’ve written as he wrote it. Other editors haveinserted another “a” between the “m” and the “h,” insisting that to do so isgrammatically correct. As a result, Westerners have come to pronounce that “a”lingeringly. In India, if occasionally pronounced, the sound is almostinaudible. Once again, I have avoided this bit of scholarly pedantry."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]PREFACEWhy This Book?This book, which comes after the publication of Self-Realization Fellowship’s(Yogoda Satsanga Society’s) God Talks With Arjuna, has been written in answer toa publicly expressed need for something simpler and clearer.The first version was not published until forty-five years after its writing wascompleted. It is exhaustive and comprehensive. Can a thing be comprehensive,however, and yet not be complete? Certain teachings, and even certain stories,important to me in the original, do not appear in that first published edition.I should state that I worked personally with Paramhansa Yogananda during themajor portion of his writing of this work. He had told the monks in 1950, beforehe went out to his desert retreat to begin this labor, “I asked Divine Motherwhom I should take out there with me to help with the editing, and your faceappeared, Walter [the name by which he called me]. To make extra sure, I askedHer twice more, and each time your face appeared. That’s why I am taking you.”I read the original manuscript, and worked on it with him (though notextensively). The copy I worked on still exists in SRF’s archives; it containsmy handwriting. I was in my early twenties then, however, and a “greenhorn”without proper experience as an editor. Now that I have reached nearly the ageof eighty, I might be described as somewhat seasoned in this field—especiallywith some eighty-five books to (what I hope are) my credit.What he dictated was fluent, easy to understand, and beautiful. I rememberexclaiming to him at the time, “This is the most wonderful work I have everread!” For many years (since 1995, with SRF’s publication) it has been mydeepest desire to present a version that was closer to the original. The actualmanuscript, however, is not available to me.Fortunately, I have an exceptionally clear memory, which I have drawn on inwriting other books, most recently Conversations with Yogananda. I have alsobeen teaching these truths for nearly sixty years as a devoted disciple of myGuru, and have the teachings, so to speak, “under my belt.” Although I had, ofcourse, to refer to their book, I only skimmed over it lightly. This book is inno way a paraphrase or copy of theirs.What it represents is my earnest endeavor to reproduce the book I readfifty-five years ago, and loved with all my heart. His was a great work. I havetried to reproduce it in such a way that, I think (and certainly hope), has beenpleasing to my Guru, with at least some of its impact of immediacy. His insightsare the most amazing, thrilling, and helpful of any I have ever read on theBhagavad Gita."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]INTRODUCTIONThese pages contain an exposition of the hidden meanings in the Bhagavad Gita asthey were explained by my great Guru, Paramhansa Yogananda, and (before him) byhis line of gurus.The reader today is confronted by an almost bewildering array of translationsand commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita. The very universality of that scriptureinvites people to see it in terms of their own diverse approaches to truth.Those who by nature are primarily active find wise guidance in the Gita for howto act in such a way as to free themselves of emotional involvement in thisworld. Those whose natures are primarily rational find in the Gita supremeguidance on the impersonal attitudes needed for living with wise and calmnon-attachment. Those of devotional inclination find in the Gita the inspirationto love only God. And those, finally, who seek God through calm meditation findin this scripture deep teachings on right attitudes in meditation.Truth is one. People try to slice it like a pie, but even the slices of a pienarrow to a single center. What the Gita shows is that, however many aspectsthere are of truth, all of them radiate outward from a single center.Yogananda emphasized in his writings, and especially in his commentaries on theBhagavad Gita, that man is a triune being: physical, mental, and spiritual. Allparts of human nature need to be developed, lest any one of them obstruct theothers.My Guru once mentioned to me, with regard to one-sided approaches to theBhagavad Gita (of which there are many), “Even Swami Shankara, profound thoughhis commentary was, denied the importance of physical reality. What he wrote wasoverbalanced on the spiritual side. He was right in saying that all things areonly an appearance, but it should be added that in this realm of appearancesmaya does have its own reality. Everything is a dream, but even dreams, asdreams, are real.”The Bhagavad Gita teaches every important aspect of the spiritual path: duringactivity, Karma Yoga (the yoga of right action); during thinking anddiscrimination, Gyana Yoga (the yoga of wisdom and discrimination); when feelingand experiencing emotion, Bhakti Yoga (the yoga of devotion). There is a centralteaching in the Bhagavad Gita, however, which unites all paths even assubsidiary streams unite in a larger river.“That river,” Yogananda said, “is the energy flowing in the spine. Thesubsidiary paths of yoga offer guidance to people of different basictemperaments: the active, the discriminating, the ‘heartful.’ The central riverto enlightenment, however, is shown by Raja Yoga, the royal yoga: the pathway ofthe spine.“Raja Yoga,” he continued, “takes one straight up the central pathway of thespine into the inner silence of divine communion. It is the teaching of thisyoga, finally, that makes the Bhagavad Gita truly a scripture for all mankind.It is why Krishna stated in the Gita, ‘O Arjuna, be thou a yogi.’”One thing that sets Paramhansa Yogananda’s commentary apart from others is itsall-inclusiveness. He himself said to me after he’d finished writing hiscommentaries, “I now understand why my Guru told me not to read othercommentaries on the Bhagavad Gita. He didn’t want my mind influenced by humanopinions. Instead, what he wanted, and what I did, was tune in to Beda Byasa,the author of the Gita. It was Byasa himself who wrote this great scripturethrough me.”Over the years since then, I have come to understand more clearly how that greatsage, who lived thousands of years ago, might have been able to cross theyawning chasm of time that separates his day from ours. I knew even then that myGuru had not intended a merely poetic image, as if to imply that all he had donewas honor the spirit of Beda Byasa. Rather, what he did was tune in to theever-living consciousness of that great sage.I was able to accept this much without difficulty. The question remained in mymind, however: Did Byasa literally dictate this commentary to Yogananda? Or wasthe communication effected by some other means?Superconscious communication is never confined to mere verbal expression; deepintuitions are conveyed, always, that words alone could never express. InAutobiography of a Yogi Yogananda tells of how his great guru, Swami SriYukteswar, appeared to him after his own death. His guru, on that occasion,described many details of the astral and causal universes. In Chapter 43 of thatbook, “The Resurrection of Sri Yukteswar,” Yogananda states, “My mind was now insuch perfect attunement with my guru’s that he was conveying his word-picturesto me partly by speech and partly by thought-transference. I was thus quicklyreceiving his idea-tabloids.”Masters have direct, inner ways of communicating with one another. I witnessedthe effect of such communication many years ago in Sydney, Australia. I hadpublished my edition of Paramhansa Yogananda’s book, The Rubaiyat of OmarKhayyam Explained. The Theosophical Society of Sydney had invited me to speakabout this book to their members. After the lecture, a man in the audienceraised his hand and asked about a particular quatrain, and my Guru’sinterpretation of it.“It seems to me,” he said, “that what Yogananda wrote here doesn’t relateclearly to the words of the quatrain itself.”“I understand your problem,” I replied, “for I faced it several times in editingthis book. I would meditate on the quatrain, however, and on my Guru’sexplanation of it, and always I saw the connection, no matter how tenuous itseemed at first.”At this point a lady in the audience raised her hand and stated, “I am fromIran, and I am familiar with ancient Persian. I am also familiar with theparticular quatrain to which this gentleman has referred. His problem is that heis trying to compare the translation by Edward FitzGerald to ParamhansaYogananda’s commentary. I agree, that connection is unclear. I’ve compared hiscommentary, however, with the original Persian, and I have found that the two,the words of Omar Khayyam and those of Paramhansa Yogananda, correspondexactly.”As I’ve suggested, superconscious communication is rarely verbal, and is neverentirely so. It is instantaneous, conveying deep, direct intuitions that couldnever be expressed in words alone. Ordinary minds are hemmed in by theintellect, which must ponder the pros and cons of every issue. Most people findit difficult to understand this higher level of communication. The further doubtis natural for them: “If Yogananda’s words were inspired by superconsciousness,why have they required editing?” The simple answer is, these are two verydifferent levels of communication. Communication by words is slow andcumbersome, especially if one tries to express himself clearly and exactly.Words have also an endless potential for being misunderstood.I myself am very familiar with the writing process, having spent more thanseventy years trying to hone my ability to convey my meanings in written form. Ithink of Coleridge’s poem, “Kubla Khan”—a tour de force of great beauty fromwhich, when I was young, I memorized many passages. This poem however, for allits wonderful rhythm and imagery, in actual fact conveys no message at all! Itwas a marvelous example of a drug-induced, false inspiration. I, for my part,have tried always to write meaningfully. Generally speaking I have found, inspite of my most conscientious efforts, that even when the writing has flowed asit were on its own, the job still needed editing. I’ve had to edit every bookI’ve written, though sometimes very little. Editing is rather like plumbing:fitting words, phrases, and sentences together in such a way as to make theideas flow smoothly.Bringing spiritual truths down to the material plane is rather like bringing adiaphanous cloud down to where its vapor becomes a surging, wind-tossed ocean.The very process of descent hems in the process of creativity. When the creativeflow is powerful, one cannot give primary attention to perfecting his outwardmode of expression. I can understand very well why great masters rarely phrasetheir words with the care demanded by a careful and elegant stylist. It is fortheir disciples, usually—if any are competent—to “pick up the pieces.” Indeed,as my Guru himself indicated to me, this would be the way I myself would grow,spiritually.God Himself created the universe in a comparable manner, by manifesting Hisconsciousness down through the layers of ideas, energy, and subtler levels ofmatter until the grossest minerals were manifested.Before dictating, Paramhansa Yogananda would turn his eyes up to the spiritualeye in the forehead. Then, speaking slowly to give his secretary, DorothyTaylor, the time she needed to type out what he was saying, he spoke as theguidance came to him from within. Seldom did I see him descend from that highdivine level to make a comment—or (as he did from time to time) to check what hewas doing against another published interpretation by Swami Pranabananda, aliberated disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya. I imagine that that swamiji’s book servedhim as a means of making sure there wasn’t some important detail he might haveomitted from what was flowing through him.When the work was finished, he exclaimed to me again and again, with ecstaticexhilaration and joy, “A new scripture has been born!”“Millions,” he added, “will find God through this work. Not just thousands:millions! I have seen it. I know!”I was privileged to read the manuscript, and to help my Guru during the editingprocess, with which he himself took serious pains. Unlike most philosophicalworks, this book was, as I expressed it in my autobiography, The Path, “freshand alive, each page a sparkling rill of original insights. With the sure touchof a master teacher, profound truths were lightened occasionally with gracefulhumor, or with charming and instructive stories, or highlighted with brieftouches of new, sometimes startling information. . . . Best of all, the truthsexpressed in the book were constantly clarified . . . with illustration afterillustration.”As my Guru also put it: “This book came entirely from God. It is not philosophy(the mere love of wisdom): It is wisdom.”Again he exclaimed, with a beatific smile, “A new scripture has been born!”"},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter OneWHAT IS THE BHAGAVAD GITA?The Bhagavad Gita means, “The Song of God.” It is indeed a song: a work of art,as well as a deep statement of truth. I would, indeed, call it the perfectscripture. I make that statement as a Westerner, raised in the Christiantradition, though now a devout believer in Sanaatan Dharma.The “Gita,” as it is lovingly called in India, is the most widely known and bestloved scripture in India. Concise, profound, poetic, and deeply inspiring, ithas been fittingly called “The Hindu Bible,” for it is the definitive statementof the ancient religion of that oldest of all countries on Earth.The truths taught in the Bhagavad Gita are stated with extraordinary clarity.Interestingly, however, because of their very clarity they open up vast vistasof insight. Hence the value of commentaries on it, of which there have been alarge number. There are levels of meaning in the Gita for which the Gita is alsoan allegory. I base the contents of these pages on the commentaries by my greatGuru, Paramhansa Yogananda. I was with him in 1950, as I said in theIntroduction, at his retreat in Twenty-Nine Palms, California, while he dictateda major part of those commentaries.Paramhansa Yogananda began his writing by stating that the Bhagavad Gitapresents the quintessence of India’s ancient teachings, of which the oldest andmost complete are the voluminous Vedas. To understand the Vedas is not easy. AsSwami Bharati Krishna Tirtha, the Shankaracharya of Gowardhan Math in Puri,stated, many of their words have changed their meaning over the many centuriessince they were first written down. (And they were only written down after thearrival of a lower age, when people could no longer recite the words frommemory. The invention of writing was not a sign of civilization’s advancement,but of a decline in human awareness that made it necessary to record thoughts inwritten form.)Bharati Krishna Tirtha stated that many words of deep meaning have acquired, intime, more superficial meanings. Words do, of course, change. The word, “knave,”he pointed out, once meant simply a young man, not a bad one. Indeed, “knave”comes from the German knabe, which means “boy.” Similarly, then, the word “go”in ancient Sanskrit meant “light,” not “cow” as it does today. Western scholars,taking words like this, have made a hash of the inner meaning of the Vedas.Only people of deep spiritual understanding can penetrate to the heart of thoseancient scriptures. The Brahmin caste, who are supposed to be (but seldom are)deeply versed in the scriptures, often proclaim their traditional scripturalknowledge with names suggestive of their supposed degrees of Vedic scholarship:Chatturveda (four Vedas); Trivedi (three Vedas); Dubey (two Vedas).A summary of the Vedas is contained in the Upanishads. Even these greatscriptures are obscure—especially for modern minds.The quintessence of the Upanishads, again, is contained in the Bhagavad Gita.The timeless glory of Sanaatan Dharma, “The Eternal Religion,” which is theancient and true name of what we know as Hinduism, is most succinctly andmovingly revealed in this timeless spiritual masterpiece."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter TwoWHAT IS SANAATAN DHARMA?Sanaatan Dharma comprises those timeless truths which are rooted in eternity.They predate the forming of the world, and cannot be confined to any one earthlyreligion. Sanaatan Dharma embraces, indeed, all of manifested existence. Itsmanifestation in India is unlike other religions in that it was not a teachingby any one master, but expresses the essence of age-old, revealed wisdom.Christians consider themselves to possess the only divine revelation, which theyname The Holy Bible. This belief shows a misunderstanding of the very word,“revelation.” The Bible, which is a mere statement, cannot convey the experienceof truth, which alone is the real meaning of revelation.Wisdom does not contradict itself. All great masters attain the same vision oftruth: one and eternal, which we call God. Divine vision transcends sectariandifferences; it is this direct vision of timeless truth which forms the basis ofSanaatan Dharma. That truth reminds man of who and what he is: a divine soul,forever indestructible. The true purpose of scripture, then, is to show man howto find eternal freedom in God.Jesus Christ said it for all truth seekers: “Be ye therefore perfect, even asyour Father which is in heaven is perfect.” (Matthew 5:48) Perfection is thegoal of every true religion. Perfection is a state of existence, not of merebelief. The Bhagavad Gita, from this point of view, is a revealed scripture, butit emphasizes the need for inner revelation, without which no words can sufficeto explain wisdom. Great masters in every religion, having perceived God (theSupreme Being) directly, have emphasized again and again in every language thatthe Supreme Spirit is the essence of everything there is.Many true masters have pointed out that there are countless paths to divineattainment. Indeed, the paths may be described as numbering as many as there arehuman beings in this world. For everyone must begin his search for enlightenmentfrom his own point of understanding, an understanding determined by his humancharacteristics, which the Bhagavad Gita expounds. Briefly, they are devotion,right action, meditation, and wisdom (or discrimination). The names of the greatworld religions—of which Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, and Islamare the main ones—can be misleading if they are not seen to express thespiritual “needs” of their times. Truth needs to be explained according to theunderstanding of the people for whom it is taught.Buddha came at a time when the people had come to depend on Vedic rituals to thepoint where they expected divine favors by merely repeating rituals andword-formulae, without any effort devoted to personal purification forself-transformation. Their belief might be classed as mere superstition. Buddhadid not speak against the Vedas as such: He spoke against people’s excessivedependence on their outward practices.Jesus Christ came when the Jewish people thought that only by obedience toreligious rules—again, without self-purification—would they please God.Mohammed came to a people who were steeped in superstitious idolatry—again,without belief in the need for self-purification.Within Hinduism itself, great masters have come repeatedly with the mission ofcorrecting misunderstandings and distortions of the subtle truths of SanaatanDharma. Swami Shankaracharya came to correct the misunderstanding prevalentamong Buddhists of his time that there is no God. God exists, he declared, butHe has no eternal form: He is Satchidananda—ever-existing, ever-conscious,ever-new Bliss (as Paramhansa Yogananda translated the term).In every religion there are various “moods,” as they might be called: deeplymeaningful to certain people, less so to others. There is the sad longing foreternity expressed in the Gregorian chants. There is the simple, pure kindnessexpressed in Buddhism. There is the joyful, powerful, but intensely personaldevotion in Hindu chanting. There is the Jewish dedication to living in harmonywith God’s law. We see in Islam also a heroic surrender to the will of God. Allthese might be described as coming, in a sense, under the heading of whatYogananda called the “romance” of religion: the heady spirit in which devoteestry to live divine truths, without necessarily knowing what truth, itself, is.The paths to God vary widely according to the natures of individuals, and onlysuperficially according to their different religious beliefs. Thus, Christiansand Buddhists with a devotional nature direct their devotion differently, butthe upward flow of energy from the heart is the same. Those with an active,serviceful nature may serve in the name of Jesus Christ, Buddha, or some othergreat teacher, but the principle of service, rather than centeredness in one’slittle self, is the same. People with a discriminating nature develop calmnessand dispassion according to their religious systems, but in all cases the wisdomin the attitude they develop is one of calmness and dispassion.In every case, devotional people of the different religions resemble one anothermore closely than they do members of their own religions who follow thedissimilar paths of service or of discrimination. Christian monks feel a greaternatural affinity with Buddhist or Hindu monks than with fellow Christianhouseholders. The prayers and music, the serviceful attitudes toward others, andcalm attitudes of dispassionate wisdom more easily cross the apparent barrier ofdifferent religious beliefs within each group than even the differences betweenthem and their fellow religionists.One extraordinary aspect of the Bhagavad Gita is its universality. Whatever theneeds of any particular time or people, this great scripture addresses them allfrom the highest point of view.In Hinduism as a whole, indeed, no aspect of the truth is rejected. The Hinduteachings emphasize the universal way of living for high spiritual attainment.The Hindu teachings concern themselves much less with beliefs than withpractices. They portray the struggles common to each ego on its long upwardjourney from ignorance to the light of Self-realization.Thus, the teaching of the Gita is not specifically Hindu: It is all-embracing.Not only is it completely non-sectarian, but it shows people how even theirworldly experiences can help them in the end, spiritually—perhaps after manylifetimes—by weaving the threads of diverse human experience into the vasttapestry that comprises the story of every soul’s journey to ultimate perfectionin God.For this journey contains innumerable twists and turns. There is but oneguideline that can give it right direction: the polestar of one’s own innatedivinity. The Bhagavad Gita points in this universally true direction."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter ThreeTHE ALLEGORY OF THE GITAThe story on which the Bhagavad Gita is based is a brief episode in the longestepic in the world, the Mahabharata. The Gita presents two main characters ofthat epic, Arjuna and Krishna, as they move between two great armies, ranged forbattle on the field of Kurukshetra.Arjuna symbolizes the devotee—the person, that is to say, who seeks divinesalvation and union with God. Krishna symbolizes God Himself, the divine Selfwithin every human being. Hence, in the Indian teachings, Self-realization isdescribed as the true goal of all spiritual striving, whatever one’s religion.The two concepts, Self-realization and the knowledge of God, are synonymous.In the story of the Mahabharata, Arjuna invites Krishna to be his charioteer.The Bhagavad Gita is the story of the dialogue which takes place as Krishnadrives Arjuna in his chariot between the two armies, in response to Arjuna’srequest to observe the two armies directly.Arjuna, his brothers the Pandavas, and all the forces on their side symbolizethe champions of virtue. The enemy are the Kauravas, cousins of the Pandavas,led by Duryodhana, who has usurped the throne. The confrontation is, as we havesaid, allegorical—a fact which is suggested by, among other things, Arjuna’svery request. He is the leading general of his army. Would the general of anarmy request something so apparently foolhardy as to be driven between the ranksof the opposing armies, so close to the enemy, and on the very eve ofhostilities? Surely, in practical terms, his request was absurd!As Krishna and Arjuna pass between the two hosts, Arjuna voices his doubts aboutthe righteousness of the forthcoming war. “It would mean destroying my ownkinsmen!” he exclaims. “How can I commit such a sin?” Krishna replies to thisvery understandable doubt, dispelling it. He then proceeds to expound theessence of the teachings of Sanaatan Dharma itself.Obviously, this account is allegorical. The opposing armies represent theopposition within every unenlightened human being between his upward- and hisdownward-inclining tendencies. The upward tendencies are his good qualities; thedownward ones are those which induce him to seek delusion, or evil. The war ofKurukshetra does not take place literally on any battlefield, though the fieldof Kurukshetra actually still exists in India. That historic site, and the storythat grew out of the war, represent the eternal conflict within man himself.At the same time, the truths propounded in the Gita are applicable at all levelsof life: material, mental, emotional, and spiritual.Paramhansa Yogananda makes the point that every great scripture ismulti-leveled, addressing the vast variety of human needs from a standpoint ofdivine wisdom. Thus, Krishna’s teaching is also true in a literal sense, for iturges the need for courage in righteous warfare. For righteous causes do ofcourse exist.Krishna turns a righteous outward cause, however, into a description of theeternal conflict within all men between high aspiration and ego-indulgence. In adeeper sense, the war of Kurukshetra is the unending struggle in the mindbetween good and evil. Its end lies only in final liberation. Krishna himselfmakes clear the allegorical nature of his timeless dialogue with Arjuna. In alater chapter of the Gita he states, “This body is the battlefield.”Arjuna, seeing the enemy up close, confronts the distressing fact that many ofthose he is about to fight are members of his own family! After all, thePandavas grew up side by side with their cousins, the Kauravas. They studiedunder the same teacher, Dronacharya. As children, they played together, arguedand squabbled together—after the manner of growing boys everywhere. The bondsthey formed, though not all of them friendly, were nevertheless deep and strong.The first chapter of the Gita is not, as most commentators have considered it, amere description of the leading warriors on both sides of a coming conflict.They are the opposing forces within human nature itself. Their very names,traced to their Sanskrit roots, become the names of psychological qualities.Those opposing Arjuna, therefore, are his cousins, well known to him, even lovedby him. The Mahabharata is the full story behind this impending war, telling howthe material desires and the ambition of Arjuna’s oldest cousin, Duryodhana,head of the Kauravas, forced the conflict by refusing the Pandavas their throne,which was theirs by right. Now Arjuna, seeing these two related families gearedup for mutual destruction, laments the need to fight at all. “Surely,” he criesout to Krishna, “it would be a sin to slay my own kith and kin! Would it not bemore just for me to surrender our kingdom?”This war is no mere conflict of ambition, however. It is described in theMahabharata as a righteous war between good and evil. Were Duryodhana, whousurped the throne, to remain the king, the people would suffer under hisunrighteous rule. The war of Kurukshetra, which is to begin on the morrow, willpit high principles against proud ambition, and soul-aspiration againstqualities in human nature that keep the ego in bondage to delusion.Krishna comforts Arjuna in his distress. Death itself, he assures him, would bepreferable to a life spent in unrighteousness. At stake here is not merephysical life or death. Pitted against each other are the life of the spirit andthe abandonment of those qualities which lead to soul-bliss. Death of the body,Krishna reminds Arjuna, is nothing: the mere doffing of a garment. It doesn’taffect a person’s consciousness, which continues throughout eternity. To rejectspiritual principles, however, means to embrace spiritual death. “Fight!”Krishna urges his disciple. The war is not one of mortal, physical combat, butof courageous inner struggle toward the victory of soul principles overspiritual sloth and material ease. This is the first and central message of theBhagavad Gita.Krishna goes on to say that there are several paths to God, according, not topeople’s beliefs, but to each person’s own temperament. He delineates the rightattitudes for the devotee, the various delusions that can prevent him fromfinding God, and the way to overcome them. In one supreme chapter is explained,in a highly metaphorical manner, the supernal experience of God.Although the battle setting is allegorical, the advice given in this scripturemay be taken as valid for every level of life, including righteous warfare. Atrue scripture, Paramhansa Yogananda stated, addresses human needs in theirentirety.The story of the Mahabharata is also, in fact, historical, and although many ofthe characters in it are fictional, others actually lived on Earth. Inhistorical fiction today it is common to include known historical figures, tolend verisimilitude to the story. Byasa (or Vyasa), the author of theMahabharata, differed from this technique primarily in making his maincharacters the historical characters, while his lesser ones served todemonstrate the great array of characteristics in human nature. His maincharacters lived, as I say, historically. They include the Pandava brothers(Yudhisthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva), some of the Kauravas, and anumber of others. The rest of the characters Byasa fictionalized, and presentedepisodes in their lives in such a way as to conform to the allegory he wasweaving like a tapestry.The over-all theme of this great epic is the soul’s first separation, aeons ago,from God: the soul’s long voyage through the barren land of delusion; and itsfinal return, after countless trials and tribulations, to the Great Source ofall life. This is the story through which every soul must pass, once it entersupon the outward path of life and once it chooses to follow the inward path ofdivine awakening.The war of Kurukshetra describes the soul’s final struggle to become liberatedfrom the clutches of maya, or delusion. The war itself, though also a historicalevent, illustrates the struggle with which every spiritual aspirant, sooner orlater, is faced."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter FourALLEGORY IN SCRIPTUREThe mixture of fact and fiction for allegorical purposes is common in scripture.It suggests the same blend in life itself: the dreamlike quality of life onearth mixed with the deep truths of the soul. An example of this literary devicemay be seen in the Book of Exodus of the Bible, and the Jewish people’s escapefrom years of bondage in Egypt. Their escape is a historical fact. In Exodus,however, the details of that escape are elaborated on, and contain muchallegory. Exodus describes the Jews, for example, as wandering for forty yearsin the Sinai desert. Surely they cannot have literally spent forty years in thatsearch. A simple glance at the map of the area shows a desert far too small forsuch a long trek—unless, indeed, the whole people were under a dense cloud ofdelusion. To believe that it took the Jews forty years to cross it demands toogreat a stretch of the imagination! The time can only have been so stateddeliberately in order to suggest a deeper meaning behind the quest for thePromised Land.Wilderness, in spiritual writings, is often used allegorically to describe theinner silence, enjoyed in soul-communion. In that silence, no cultivated flowersof sense-pleasure bloom. The forty-year journey through the Sinai desertdescribes the long quest required to attain spiritual enlightenment.In Exodus, all who had been born in captivity had to die before the newgeneration could enter the Promised Land. The meaning, here, is that everycharacteristic that was born in the “captivity” of ego-consciousness needs to betranscended. Only soul-qualities, developed in the expansion of divinecommunion, are able to enter the Eternal Kingdom. The Promised Land described inthe Bible is union with God: the land of Cosmic consciousness.Delusive qualities, born of ego-consciousness, are rooted in the consciousnessof separateness from God. The ego is not the true Self. All of us are made inthe image of God. The Bible, in the first chapter of the Gospel of St. John,tells us that we are all the sons of God. If we define ourselves as beingdifferent from Him, we must transcend this self-definition before we, as puresouls, can enter into the divine realm. Such egoic qualities as selfishness,hatred, passion, greed, personal ambition, covetousness, jealousy, and anger areweights that prevent the balloon of awareness from soaring up into the sky ofSpirit. St. John therefore tells us also, “No man hath seen God at any time.”Never, in other words, by human, egoic consciousness can the Divine beperceived. The divine truth is far above human realities. As the Bible statesalso, “My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saiththe Lord.”[1]The Promised Land is the reward bestowed, eventually, on all who seek Godearnestly. Exodus contains an esoteric hint which reinforces this truth. ThePromised Land is described as a “land of milk and honey.” The Bible tells us,“And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are inEgypt . . . , and I am come down to deliver them . . . and to bring them up outof that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk andhoney.”[2]Indeed, certain aspects of the spiritual path are subtler than ordinaryknowledge—that is, than what can be comprehended by anyone who lacks personalexperience of inner realities. Those aspects are familiar, however, to yogis andto others who meditate deeply. These truths are hinted at in both the Bible andthe Bhagavad Gita.Let us consider momentarily this specific anecdote in the Bible. In deep ecstasyit so happens that the tongue turns automatically upward toward the brain. Atthe tip of the tongue there is a positive magnetism which, when united with itsnegative complement in the nasal cavity, “short-circuits” (in a manner ofspeaking) the flow of energy in the body and keeps it in the brain. With thisphysical union is formed a kind of “nectar,” described by yogis as the innercounterpart of outer sexual union. The Hindu scriptures describe this nectar ashaving the taste of a blend of clarified butter, or ghee—milk in its purestform—and honey. The Hindu Vedas named this “nectar,” soma. An entire scripturewas named Soma Veda. This soma nectar is able to sustain the body forlongperiods of time while the soul remains rapt in ecstasy, known in the yogateachings as samadhi.The Promised Land, then, is no mere earthly location. Israel symbolized thesoul’s true land: Cosmic consciousness.It must be stated here that the Jews were not, as a whole race, the chosenpeople of God. For of course there were and always have been good Jews and badJews: the same mix that one encounters everywhere on earth of saints andsinners. The Jews in this story symbolize the sincere aspirants in every countryand religion who forsake sense-slavery, and commit themselves to realizing thekingdom of God within. As Paramhansa Yogananda often put it, “God chooses thosewho choose Him.”The story of Moses and the exodus of the Jews from Egypt contains other mysticalsymbols as well, yogic in nature since they relate to truths more oftenconsidered part of the yoga teachings. Moses, for example, is described asraising the serpent power of Kundalini: “And the Lord said unto Moses, Make theea fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass, that everyone that is bitten, when he looketh upon it shall live. And Moses made a serpentof brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent hadbitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.”[3] Here twokinds of serpent energy are described: the downward moving force, which drawsthe consciousness toward worldly and sensual indulgence; and the upward flow,which liberates one’s consciousness from delusion.The “pole” described here is the spine. Many swamis in India carry a danda,which is a staff they use to remind themselves to remain ever centered in thespine. This “pole,” so described in the story of Moses, is made of brass. Theserpent upon it is fiery, suggestive of the inner light which ascends withspiritual wakening. Only when this light, or Kundalini energy, is uplifted canthe “poison bite” of delusion be healed.Thus, Jesus Christ said also, “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in thewilderness, even so must the son of man be lifted up.” (John 3:14) Jesus was notspeaking of his coming death on the cross. That was an event which no one, asyet, could anticipate. It had to be a later commentator, therefore, whosuggested this meaning. What Jesus was saying, rather, was that humanconsciousness must be lifted up, even as Moses lifted up his own consciousnessin the “wilderness” of inner silence, by raising the power of Kundalini in thespine.The present author once asked Paramhansa Yogananda whether Moses was a spiritualmaster. “Yes, certainly,” Yogananda replied in an affirmative tone of voice.“The Bible says he ‘lifted up the serpent [that is, the Kundalini power] in thewilderness.’”These brief excerpts from the Bible are offered here to prepare the reader,especially if he is Jewish or Christian, for similarly deep teachings in theBhagavad Gita. Even Hindus, after pondering the universality of those teachings,may find it easier to relate to the deeper aspects of this great Hinduscripture.[1] Isaiah 55:8.[2] Exodus 3:7,8.[3] Numbers 21:8,9."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter FiveTHE GENESIS OF THE STORYThe key figure of the Mahabharata, and therefore of the Bhagavad Gita, is LordKrishna, whose actual life is shrouded in legend. That he was a real person inhistory is certain; the basic facts of his life are known. The legends,however—his boyhood days, for example, among the gopis and gopals (cowherd girlsand boys) of Brindaban—should be taken as allegories.There is, for instance, the story of when his foster mother, Yasoda, wanted totie him up, as a little child, to keep him from getting into mischief. (He lovedto steal fresh cheese from the kitchen!) She took a length of string which shethought was quite long enough for the job. Inexplicably, it proved too short.She fetched another length and tied it to the first string. This extension, too,proved insufficient! Several more lengths were added. No matter how long thestring was, it was not enough to do the job. At last she understood her mistake:The Infinite cannot be tied by anything! How can the human mind encompass God’svastness? Humbly, then, Yasoda prayed to Bala (the little boy) Krishna, “Lord,please let me tie You so that I can finish my chores!” Sweetly then, on being soprayerfully addressed, the divine child let her have her way.Obviously this story is allegorical. Even if it had really happened, it would beallegorical in the sense of containing deep meaning. When all of the boyhoodstories about Krishna are added up, it becomes clear that they were meant toinstruct devotees rather than to report actual, historical events.The entire epic of the Mahabharata is, similarly, one long allegory. For thepurposes of this present volume it would be confusing to condense the over-allstory of that extremely long and complex epic, which describes the descent ofSpirit into the ego and the delusion of separateness—from God, from other egos,and from everything—and the struggle to rise again into oneness with Spirit.Suffice it here to give a brief overview.The Pandavas were the children of Pandu: the oldest three, the offspring ofPandu and Kunti; the two youngest, of Pandu and Madri. The main characters inthe epic actually lived. Beda Byasa wove his allegory around actual people andevents in history. Lesser characters, however, had no historical counterparts.They represent psychological qualities in man.Pandu represents the discriminating intelligence, or buddhi. He is described asbeing white in color (his name derives from pand, or “white”). White is intendedmetaphorically to signify purity; a pure intelligence demonstrates cleardiscrimination.Kunti, the mother of the first three Pandavas, represents “the power ofdispassion.” Her three sons, born of Pandu, are Yudhisthira (divine calmness),Bhima (control of the life force, or prana), and Arjuna (self-control).Madri, the mother of the two youngest Pandavas, who are twins, represents “thepower of attachment to dispassion.”To understand why there were two mothers for the five Pandavas, it is necessaryto be familiar with the symbolism involved here. Each of the Pandavas stands forone of the five chakras, or spinal centers. The yoga teachings explain—as isexplained at length in God Talks With Arjuna—that the path of divine awakeningis, as I’ve indicated, the spine. Energy enters the body through the medullaoblongata at the base of the brain. From this point the sperm and ovum, afteruniting, begin the process of creating the embryo. Energy, which then solidifiesas matter, passes through the nerves (after creating them) into the brain, downthe spine, and out to form the body. When the consciousness withdraws from thebody at death, the energy withdraws first from the extremities to the spine,then up the spine, and at last emerges through the medulla oblongata again,leaving the body.In ecstatic meditation, the yogi (or saint, as he would be called in otherreligions) withdraws his energy and consciousness by the same route. Deepmeditation is a process of “dying” consciously—with the possibility, however, ofreturning to the body after meditation and resuming its normal activities. AsSt. Paul declared in the New Testament of the Bible (Paramhansa Yogananda oftenquoted this passage), “I die daily.”As the yogi withdraws his energy and consciousness from the senses into thespine, he seeks to raise them up the spine to the brain. A curious differenceoccurs in the brain between the superconscious yogi, or saint, and theunenlightened worldly person. The medulla oblongata has two poles, a negativeand a positive. The negative pole (the agya chakra) is in the medulla itself.The positive pole—reflecting the medulla—is the Kutastha, the spiritual eyebetween the eyebrows.The unenlightened man sinks back, at death, into the negative sleep state. Hemust swim the waters of lethe, as the ancient Greeks called it: the waters offorgetfulness. After a time he may, if he is not wholly materialistic, awake inthe astral world and for a time enjoy its beauties to varying degrees, beforematerial desire draws him back to earth again, to reincarnate in a physicalbody. Questions of the degrees of enjoyment in the astral world must be shelvedfor a later discussion. For now, we are concerned with the spinal highway toenlightenment.The yogi who can fix his concentration on the spiritual eye leaves his bodyconsciously, whether in deep ecstasy or in death. Is the spiritual eye, one mayask, merely symbolic? No, it is actually beheld, and is, in fact, a reflectionof the light in the medulla, through which the energy moves down the spine inthree nadis, or subtle channels of life force, called the sushumna, the vajra,and the chitra. The brahmanadi is the “spine” of the causal body, so calledbecause it is the primal channel through which Brahman—the divineconsciousness—descended into the body. The spiritual eye, when seen clearly, isuniversally the same: a field of dark blue light surrounded by a golden halo, inthe center of which is a five-pointed star. The golden aureole represents theastral world; the blue field inside it, the causal world and also theomnipresent Christ consciousness; the star in the center, the Spirit beyondcreation.Paramhansa Yogananda pointed out that man is made, as the Bible says, in theimage of God, because that five-pointed star resembles the body of man: Withparted legs, and the arms stretched out to the side, the head at the top, manhas the very shape of that star. Symbolically (it should be added) afive-pointed star with the fifth point turned downward is inauspicious.The spine is the primary channel through which the energy flows. The energy’supward flow is blocked by certain plexuses in the spine, from which energy flowsout into the nervous system, and through that system into the body, sustainingand activating the different body parts. When the yogi in deep meditationwithdraws his energy from the outer body to the spine, and then up the spine tothe brain, he finds that passage blocked by the outward flow of energy fromthose plexuses (called centers in English translations of the yoga treatises; intheir Sanskrit original they are called chakras). The energy at each chakra mustbe withdrawn into the spine in order to continue its upward journey.Each of the Pandavas in the Mahabharata represents one of the spinalchakras—from the base up to the medulla oblongata. In the allegory, Draupadirepresents the Kundalini power. Draupadi, through a concatenation ofcircumstances (not necessary to be described here), becomes the wife of all fiveof the Pandava brothers. What, then, is Kundalini?As the energy enters the body and descends the spine, it becomes locked, so tospeak, at the lowest pole (its opposite pole being the anahata chakra in theheart). In order for the energy to be raised in the spine, Kundalini must firstbe “awakened”—that is to say, its grip on matter-consciousness must be released.The strength of that hold is determined by the degree of material attachment inthe mind. Non-attachment to matter frees the energy to rise up the spine. As itthen passes through each chakra, it finds itself blocked as if by a “closed”door. The blockage is caused by energy’s outward flow through those plexuses.The rising Kundalini must spiritually “awaken” each chakra. As the portal ofthat chakra is opened, a fresh surge of awareness and spiritual power isreleased, enhancing one’s clarity of awareness.In the muladhara, or coccyx center (the lowest chakra in the spine), theawakened energy, as it moves upward after being awakened by Kundalini, issymbolized by the youngest of the Pandava sons, Sahadeva.The next chakra upward, the swadisthana or sacral center, is symbolized in itsupward-moving energy by Nakula, the older of the twin brothers. These two twinsare the offspring of Pandu and Madri, Madri representing “the power ofattachment to dispassion.”From the second chakra, once awakened, the energy flows up through each of thehigher chakras, the awakened energy of which is symbolized by the sons of Panduand Kunti—Kunti representing “the power of dispassion.” The difference betweenthe qualities of Madri (the power of attachment to dispassion) and Kunti (thepower of dispassion) is the degree of ego-involvement. In attachment todispassion there is more of the lower thought, “I am dispassionate”; indispassion itself there is the abstract quality, without a personal sense of“doership.”As the energy flows upward from the swadisthana, or sacral center, it is againimpeded in the manipura, or lumbar center opposite the navel. This chakra issymbolized by Arjuna. The next chakra upward is anahata, the heart (or dorsal)center, which is symbolized by Bhima. Finally, the last and highest chakra inthe spine is bishuddha, the cervical center, symbolized by Yudhisthira.Each chakra, when it has been awakened, bestows with that awakening a certainspiritual insight. Sahadeva, the upward-moving energy in the lowest chakra,bestows the divine power of resistance (to temptation). Nakula, the risingenergy in the next chakra, bestows the power of adherence to virtue. These twoqualities are the yamas and niyamas listed by Patanjali in his eight-limbed pathto enlightenment: the power to avoid wrong action, and the power to cling toright action. These two powers form an essential foundation for any seriousspiritual development.Arjuna, the “Prince of devotees” as he is called by Krishna in the Gita, residesin the manipura or lumbar center, and represents fiery self-control. Thisself-control develops when the yogi is able to follow the proscriptive andprescriptive rules of the spiritual path.Bhima, the second-oldest brother, represents the heart quality and, also,control of the life force. In the Srimad Bhagavatam, another deep scripture bythe same author, Beda Byasa, the devotee is told during meditation to visualizehis heart as a lotus. He should mentally turn the petals upward, to enable theirenergy to flow up toward the brain. The desires of man are centered in theheart. The yogi must direct every ray of desire-energy upward in divineaspiration to the spiritual eye between the eyebrows.The highest of the spinal chakras is the bishuddha or cervical center, justbehind the throat. When the energy gathered at this point is directed upward,the mind acquires divine calmness and expansion. Here is representedYudhisthira, the oldest of the Pandava brothers.The young twins, offspring of Pandu and Madri, representing the ego wholesomelydirected toward inner freedom, provide support to the aspiring yogi for hisspiritual practices. The three older brothers, sons of Pandu and Kunti (thepower of dispassion), provide dynamic strength and inspiration for inner,spiritual upliftment.Thus, it is important from the beginning to understand that the Bhagavad Gita,and the Mahabharata on which it is based, provide deep spiritual guidance andinspiration. It is much more than a scripture of pious maxims, but a deep,practical guide to the attainment of union with God.Were it even a guide to mere goodness however, and to the way to livespiritually in the work-a-day world, it would already be a great and importantscripture. What makes the Bhagavad Gita so outstandingly helpful on thespiritual path is that it offers guidance on many levels, as we shall see in thepages that follow."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter SixWHY COUSINS? WHY ENEMIES?The descent of Spirit into matter is explained allegorically with great care inthe Mahabharata. Here we bypass much of the elaborate symbolism of that descent,since it predates the story of the Bhagavad Gita. Instead, we shall begin atthat point where we ourselves, as human beings, enter upon the scene. For thisgreat scripture is a work, not of history, but of human spiritual development.Man’s actual need, as explained in the Bhagavad Gita, is not to understand howhe got into delusion, but rather to understand how he can get out of delusion.Dhritarashtra, the father of the Kauravas or Kurus, has Ambika (Negative Doubt)for his mother. He is born blind, as one is, spiritually, when his understandingcomes to him only through the senses. Pandu, the father of the five Pandavas, isborn of Ambalika, co-wife with Ambika, who represents the positive,discriminating faculty.These, the two wives of Bichitrabirya (the divine ego, or sense of divineindividuality), are the balancing opposites to one another: Negative Doubtpitted against the Positive Faculty of Discrimination. Dhritarashtra (the blindmind) through his first wife, Gandhari (symbolizing the power of desire) begetsDuryodhana and his ninety-nine brothers. (Dhritarashtra’s second wife, Vaishya,symbolizes the attachments that are formed in consequence of desires; these givebirth to Yuyutsu, who represents the eagerness to do active battle in order toprotect one’s selfish desires.)Duryodhana, the first son of Gandhari, represents ego-inspired desires.Paramhansa Yogananda in his Gita commentaries called him King Material Desire.All the sense tendencies are subordinate to the ego’s supreme desire to feed itsown importance.Pandu is Ambalika’s son. Ambalika, remember, represents the positivediscriminating faculty. Thus, Pandu symbolizes the active application of thatpositive faculty: that is to say, the positive, discriminating intelligence.The Kurus, or Kauravas, children of Dhritarashtra (the blind mind), are firstcousins to the Pandavas (the children of Pandu). Theirs is a cousinlyrelationship, for they are offspring of the same human consciousness. They arealso enemies, however, for their interests are in diametric opposition to oneanother’s.The field of battle is, as I said, the spine. Here the war rages between thedownward-moving tendencies (on the one hand), which take one’s consciousnessoutward into the world of the senses, and those tendencies (on the other hand)which lift man’s consciousness toward his true source in Spirit. That these twoforces flow in opposite directions in the spine can be observed in many commonrealities of life.Many of the words people use show these differences. Probably there areequivalents in all languages to the expressions in English, “I feel uplifted”;“I feel high”—or, “I’m feeling downcast”; “I feel low.” In Italian (to take oneexample) these expressions translate as, “Mi sento su, [I feel up, or high]”and, “Mi sento giù [I feel down].” These words owe their existence to simplefacts of human nature: When the energy and consciousness rise in the spine, onefeels happy; when the energy and consciousness move downward, one feelsdepressed or unhappy.When one’s feelings impel him to indulge in material desires, his energy flowsdownward in the spine, and then outward from it—into, and through, the senses.Spiritual inspiration uplifts both energy and consciousness in the spine,directing them toward the spiritual eye. In either case the energy is the same,and influences the self-same consciousness. Negative characteristics, such ashatred, jealousy, anger, and lust, form part of the same “family” ofconsciousness as those qualities which, being positive, lift the awarenessheavenward. Such positive characteristics, or qualities, include love, kindness,forgiveness, compassion, and self-control.Most people have a mixture of positive and negative qualities. They identify, intheir egos, with both groups.The Bhagavad Gita presents a fascinating picture of human nature. It shows thatevery individual is a nation unto himself, his “population” consisting of allhis qualities, both good and bad. Verily, every human quality may with perfectjustification be likened to an individual. In essence, none of us is hischaracteristics: We merely manifest our character traits. As ParamhansaYogananda wrote in Autobiography of a Yogi, “Thoughts are universally and notindividually rooted.” Different characteristics develop in us according to theway we act and react repeatedly in this world in response to people andcircumstances. No one, in his true nature, is essentially angry or jealous orlustful. He allows these qualities to develop in himself by identifying his egowith things that happen to him in his life.If his ego feels threatened, and he considers that he must meet that threat withaggressive courage, he may gradually develop both those qualities:aggressiveness and courage. If, on the other hand, he considers himself unableto meet the threat successfully, he may gradually develop a fearful outlook, orbecome jealous, or acquire a resentful attitude. Over time, the innumerableexperiences he encounters in life, and the way he encounters them, may developin him innumerable “complexes.” In other words, certain aspects of his naturemay insist on attack, while other aspects plead, tortoise-like, for aself-protective withdrawal. Still others may mutter helplessly in the backgroundabout “the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,” while still others spread awhispering campaign of malicious gossip to get “the world” to side with them,while another whole group of mental citizens may stand, figuratively speaking,on soapboxes pleading for tolerance, forbearance, amused acceptance, or calmnon-attachment.“Circumstances,” Paramhansa Yogananda commented, “are always neutral. Theyappear positive or negative according to the corresponding reactions of theheart.” The possible reactions to virtually every circumstance are legion innumber. Every reaction may (and does, for most people) seem passing and notbinding on one’s self or on one’s nature. People—to give an example—may saysomething unkind about others, then chuckle lightly as if to imply, “See? myunkind words haven’t affected me personally!” Action never takes place in avacuum, however. Every act, every thought, has its specific consequences.There is another aspect to human nature, which forces passing thoughts to becomeimbedded as firm characteristics. This is the power of habit. Thus, in theMahabharata, and in that relatively brief excerpt from it called the BhagavadGita, there is the fascinating role played by Drona, who is known also asDronacharya (acharya meaning “teacher”).Dronacharya was the guru, or teacher, of both the Kurus and the Pandavas. Hisrole in the epic was to teach them the martial arts, including that mostimportant skill of his time: archery.The bow, in the Mahabharata, symbolizes the spine. When a bow is strung, thestring resembles the spine itself; the arched front looks somewhat like thefront of the body. The arrow, as it is loosed from the bow, symbolizes the powerof concentration. In this respect one can visualize also the eyebrows as the twocurving halves of a bow, wherein the point between them stands for that part ofthe bow where the arrow is firmly placed.Dronacharya’s best pupil was Arjuna. There is a story about Drona’s proposing atest for his students. He asked them, each in turn, to strike off the head of abird seated on the highest limb of a tree. Each pupil, as he approached theteacher, was asked, “What do you see?”Each reported the many things within his range of vision. A typical answer was,“I see the bird, the tree, the passing clouds.” Dronacharya knew, in each case,that the archer would miss the head of the bird. In fact, so it proved.Finally, Arjuna stepped up for his turn. “What do you see?” asked Drona.“I see the head of the bird,” replied the young warrior.“Nothing else?” asked the Guru.“Nothing else!” came the answer: “only the head of the bird.”“Loose your shaft!” said Dronacharya proudly, certain of Arjuna’s success.Arjuna alone passed the test.Dronacharya was, as I have indicated, the guru of both the cousinly families. Inthe war of Kurukshetra, however, he fought on the side of the Kurus. Why, onewonders, would he do that? Wasn’t Arjuna his best and favorite pupil? There is asubtle reason for that choice.Psychologically, what happens in any struggle between high aspirations inoneself and one’s worldly tendencies is that habit sides with worldliness. Ourneed is to replace our bad habits with good ones. Good habits, however, yield toa higher power, which is what gives us our true strength.The power to concentrate, shown by Arjuna, and all other good qualities neededfor spiritual development, depend initially on good habits. What gives thosegood qualities their real strength, however, transcends habit: It is a strengththat comes from superconscious inspiration. Thus, it isn’t so much our goodhabits that guarantee our spiritual victory as the inflow of divine grace,guidance, and intuition. Meanwhile, the power of habit itself usually rangesitself on the negative side. Indeed, even good habits need to be transformed bydivine inspiration; otherwise, if one lacks a higher understanding, he may slipback again into bad habits.Drona sided with the wrong side. This means we should not depend on our goodhabits alone to see us through psychological and spiritual tests. Habit born ofpast actions may give us good karma, but karma itself must be transcended indedication to the truth.Meanwhile, all our qualities assume the characteristics of individualpersonalities, as we become steeped in them by a repetition of the acts thatinvolve us in them. Because of habit, they become entrenched as true “citizens”of our own nation of consciousness. Each person, as I said, is a nation untohimself. Thousands or millions of “citizens” mill about, each one bent onfulfilling his own desires and ambitions. Sigmund Freud hardly scratched thesurface of human psychology with his investigations. He worked primarily withabnormal psychology, but in truth every human being, so long as he lives indelusion, is a mass of conflicting qualities, or complexes. Freud saw only theconflict between personal desire and the expectations of society. In reality thecase is infinitely more complex."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter SevenTHE SPINE: PATHWAY TO SALVATIONThink of a bar magnet. What differentiates it from other bars of metal—of iron,particularly—is that its molecules are turned in a single direction, producing anorth-south polarity. In most bars, the molecules, each with its own north-southpolarity, are turned every which way, in effect canceling one another out. It iswhen the molecules are oriented in one direction that, with many of them actingtogether, they acquire magnetic power. Magnetism is generated, not created. Itspresence is latent in every piece of metal—indeed, on subtler levels ofmanifestation, in everything. Thus, people can be magnetic; their magnetism cancause others to feel toward them a strong attraction or repulsion.There are many kinds of magnetism. Our individual qualities resemble the ironmolecules in the sense that, if they are focused on a single goal, they canproduce seemingly miraculous results. On the other hand, when they are directedhaphazardly they can render us ineffective. Magnetism is the key to success ineverything.People will often say, “I keep trying to be good. Why, then, do I constantlyfail?” or, “I work so hard to become competent in my own field of endeavor; whycan I not succeed?” or, “I try so hard to overcome my bad habits; why do theykeep on coming back, like weeds?” To all of these questions the answer, whileperhaps unfortunate, is, “You have created failure magnetism in yourself: Youneed to get enough of the citizens among your inner population to support you;then only will you be able to make the over-all change you desire. The good sideof the problem is that, when you succeed in converting enough mental citizens tothe side of goodness, they will outnumber the unruly ones and will gradually winthem over, resulting in your rapid spiritual progress.”We must transform our faults into virtues. Angry outbursts, uncontrollable atfirst, need to be rechanneled into positive behavior. Incarnations—many of them,perhaps—may be required for complete self-transformation. Nevertheless, ajourney of thousands of miles must begin with a single step. Never should onebecome discouraged. Discouragement itself is simply a characteristic to befought and conquered by the steady, indomitable pressure of resolute courage. Ifone thinks, “I simply don’t have that kind of courage,” know that you candevelop it, in time. Every human trait begins as a simple thought. There isnothing man can achieve or even conceive that, as an idea, is inaccessible toany other human being.The Bhagavad Gita, however, teaches more than the need to overcome ourindividual faults and weaknesses. It also gives practical methods for sweepingevery obstacle out of the way. One such method is described in Chapter 4, Verse35, where Krishna tells Arjuna of the importance of the guru, or spiritualsavior. A guru is more than merely a teacher. The power of the guru can transferhis magnetism to disciples who tune in to his consciousness. Thus, his magnetismcan help to transform every fault in them into its opposite virtue, byrechanneling the energy in their spines—in a sense realigning the “molecules” oftendencies and helping them, ever increasingly, to flow upward. A river, whenits flow is strong, dissolves any eddies lingering along the bank, and causesthose eddies and any debris swirling in them to enter the river’s powerful flowdown to the ocean. In similar fashion, a strong upward flow of energy in thespine can dissolve all the “vrittis,” or eddies of feeling, and carry them up tothe spiritual eye. Hence Patanjali’s definition of yoga: “Yogas chitta vrittinirodha (Yoga is the neutralization of the eddies, or whirlpools, of feeling inthe consciousness).” The subtle help of a true, or Sat, guru can help thedisciple to transform his own tendencies and direct them all toward God.None of this can be accomplished, however, without the disciple’s activecooperation. This process, too, can be hastened scientifically by yogatechniques, and particularly by the great, ancient science of Kriya Yoga. TheBhagavad Gita emphasizes repeatedly the importance of yoga, and hints more thanonce at this highest of all yoga sciences. Indeed, the scientific aspect ofenlightenment underlies every teaching in the Gita. We have already hinted atthat aspect.When an unmagnetized bar of metal is placed next to a bar magnet, it graduallydevelops a magnetism of its own as its molecules realign themselves, similarly,in a north-south direction. Such is the real power of the Satguru, or savior, anessential aid to which my Guru referred constantly. He completely endorsed theIndian tradition that one must have a guru to find God. The part played by theguru is not to make his disciples over in his own image, but, by sharing hismagnetism with them, to uplift their consciousness. That influence helps torealign the “molecules” of energy in their own bodies, and most particularly inthe spine, toward the “north” of the spine at the spiritual eye and in the topof the head (the sahasrara).Apart from the guru’s help, the other thing needed for Self-realization is, as Ihave said, cooperation with him in the help he gives. This above all is what isintended by working spiritually on oneself. Self-transformation can beaccomplished not so much by laboring painstakingly to purify and spiritualizeevery flaw, but above all by directing all one’s energy toward the spiritualeye. That upward flow of energy is like a river, in this case flowing upward(not downward) to the “mouth” of the spiritual eye, where the soul merges atlast into the sea of infinity.None of this is to belittle the need for making painstaking efforts to transformoneself. Indeed, the Bhagavad Gita begins by recognizing the state of constantwarfare in all human beings between vice and virtue.When one considers, however, the vast undertaking one faces in overcoming evenone deep-seated flaw, the task seems endless. Think how long it takes for analcoholic to overcome even that single trait. Once he conquers that oneweakness, it is an occasion for celebration. The number of faults every manneeds to conquer seems almost overwhelmingly vast.Think of that bar of iron. It contains, probably, billions of molecules. Theycancel one another out by the fact of being turned every which way. Now then,supposing one could labor minutely on each molecule: Think how long it wouldtake to turn them all in a north-south direction. By the time one had reachedonly a short distance in the process, and was ready to start on (so to speak)the next level, it is quite within the bounds of possibility that the firstmolecules would be already turning randomly again. There would not yet be themagnetism to keep them pointed in the right direction."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter EightTHE SCRIPTURE BEGINSThe Bhagavad Gita begins with Dhritarashtra, Duryodhana’s father, wanting toknow how the battle at Kurukshetra has been faring. Dhritarashtra is blind, aswe saw earlier. His blindness represents that aspect of the mind which canperceive reality only through the senses. The war of Kurukshetra is not foughtliterally on an earthly battlefield, but takes place within every individual.Dhritarashtra consults Sanjaya, who represents introspection. Introspectionalone can tell the blind mind which side is winning.Sanjaya has the spiritual power to see things at a distance. Thus, through himDhritarashtra, who naturally wants to know what is happening on the battlefieldeven during the time of battle, poses his question. He does so, however, in amost interesting manner. He doesn’t ask (as one would expect), “Which side iswinning?” but rather, “Which side has won?”—past tense.Paramhansa Yogananda pointed out that this question, asking for introspection onsomething already past, gives a clear hint that the entire Bhagavad Gita isfocused on the field of consciousness, not of martial battle. On an earthlybattlefield it is natural to ask, “Which side is winning?” One expects immediatenews as to which way the tide of war is flowing, which ranks are standing firm,which are yielding to aggressive pressure, and which are making inroads into theenemy ranks. In a psychological battle, on the other hand, it is only after thestruggle has ended that the question arises: “Which side was victorious?”Stanza 1, Chapter 1, of this great scripture states:“Dhritarashtra posed this question to Sanjaya: ‘On the battlefield ofKurukshetra, where my sons and those of Pandu were ranged against one another,eager for battle, what was the outcome?’”This apparently simple inquiry constitutes the basis of the Bhagavad Gita.Victory over delusion is absolutely crucial to man’s true happiness and freedom.It is very difficult to discern what is true victory, however; what is merely ahollow victory; and what, though it wears the appearance of victory, will provein the end to have been a crushing defeat.My Guru told me this story: “A certain man in ancient India was being harassedby a demon. He decided to use a Vedic mantra to banish this pest. Taking ahandful of powder, he uttered the mantra over it, infusing (as he thought) thepowder with mantric power. He then cast the powder on the demon. The demon onlylaughed. ‘Before you could even recite your mantra,’ it mocked, ‘I got into thepowder myself. How, then, could your mantra harm me?’“So you see,” my Guru continued, “the very mind with which you would banishdelusion is already steeped in the very delusion you want to overcome! It is notalways easy, even, to know right from wrong. Introspection helps, and is,indeed, essential. Even more important, however, is the intuitive guidance of awise guru, especially from within.”What lamp has man to guide him through the long night of ignorance? “A blindunderstanding!” was Omar Khayyam’s reply. The blind mind must consultintrospection, but introspection must be treated cautiously, for it is alreadytainted by the very ignorance it seeks to dispel.There are certain guidelines that can help one to understand which side has beenthe winner in any psychological battle. One guideline is an inner expansion ofhappiness and freedom. Another is an expansion of consciousness. A third andeven more important one is an expansion of sympathy. Fourth, but equallyimportant as all the others, is inner calmness.The mind plays many tricks to convince man that he has found these treasures.Happiness and joy are guidelines to right behavior, but delusive emotions canmasquerade as both of these. One key to the fact that their nature is delusiveis that they convey a sense of excitement, instead of a deepening calmness.An expansion of consciousness may seem to accompany any increase of power, ordominion, or even knowledge. Yet these accomplishments often give one, insteadof an expansion of consciousness, a swelling sense of self-importance andself-involvement—a “swelled head.”An expansion of sympathy can be binding if it provokes one to hold expectationsof others, to become possessive toward them, or to become centered in theiremotional demands rather than in wisdom.Even calmness can be delusive, if it begets indifference.How is one to know what course in life is right or wrong? The first rule is, “Dowhat works.” That is why the question, “What was the outcome?” is more importantthan, “What are they doing?” Only from the outcome of a course of action can itbe known with any certainty whether the act was justified or not. The maxim,“The end justifies the means,” is true only as long as the end is visualized intheory, in advance. Once it has been actually reached, however, it will showwhether the means to it were right or not. Wrong means to an imaginary good endwill produce, at last, disharmony and failure.“A blind understanding!” Alas, it isn’t easy for man. He can only stumble alonglife’s way. Time alone will tell for certain whether a course of action wasright or not. Therefore the Gita says here, in effect, “What are the results?”Basically speaking, a right course of action will produce harmony, good health,a balanced state of being, and an ability to keep moving sensibly withdiscrimination toward whatever fulfillment one seeks.Where there is joy, and an expansion of consciousness, sympathy, and innercalmness, one will always experience a rising energy in the spine. The oppositesof those states—sorrow, contractive awareness and feeling, and restlessness—arealways accompanied by a descending energy in the spine. A person’s very postureindicates any changes in the flow of energy, for when his energy is “up” he sitsstraight, with his shoulders back, his chest high; he even tends more naturallyto look upward. But when his energy is “down” he slumps forward, his shoulderssag, he holds his chest in as though there were a hollowness there, and he tendsto look downward.“What did they?” asks Dhritarashtra. One way of measuring the degree of anyinward victory or defeat is to test it by the above indications. Do you feelyou’ve succeeded, under enemy fire, in remaining calm? If your answer is, “Well,I’m calmly committed to really slaughtering them, next time!” we must conclude,“You didn’t do all that well!” Or perhaps we can say, “The answers aren’t all inyet.”One way to tell if you’ve handled a situation well is to judge by other people’sreactions. Even those reactions, however, are unreliable. What people like is noguide to what is right, and most people are guided by their likes and dislikes,by self-interest, by what pleases or displeases them. This is one reason whyintrospection (Sanjaya) is the wisest course to understanding. Provided one issincerely committed to finding the truth, and God, above all, if byintrospection one canvasses the reactions of his own mental citizens, he willhave a clearer understanding of what he ought or ought not to have done and ofhow he ought to behave in future.Ranged against his upwardly directed aspirations are innumerable downward-movingtendencies which he himself created by past wrong actions, and developed intobad habits. A few stanzas later (Stanza 10) the statement is made that theforces for error are “innumerable,”[4] whereas the forces of righteousness are“few in number.” Countless are the ways one can slip into error, even as theoutside of a large circle has room for taking many approaches to the center.Uplifting virtues are few, for they lead into, and are already close to, thecenter of our being. Hatred can be defined in terms of countless objects capableof being hated, whereas kindness springs from the inner self, and bestows itsbeneficence impersonally on all.Thus, when Dhritarashtra says to Sanjaya, “What did they?” or, “What was theoutcome?” the sincere truth seeker is being told, “Judge your thoughts andactions by their effects—on yourself, first; then on others. Are theypeace-inducing? Are they as universally beneficial as possible? Do they help toexpand your understanding and sympathies? Have they brought greater harmony toyour environment?—or have they produced disharmony? Do they inspire you andothers? or have they brought less hope generally—even despair?”These questions are not always easy to answer. Anger in a righteous cause can beproductive of good. Indeed, such anger, if it is spiritual, is not anger at allbut only a strong flow of energy toward the promotion of justice. Thus, calmfervor may sometimes look like anger, yet in fact be anything but that. Kindlysmiles, on the other hand, may sometimes look virtuous, when in fact they aredesigned only to tempt others—and perhaps oneself!—to do evil.This first stanza forms the basis of the entire Gita. Much remains to beunderstood, however, before one can safely say he is following the upward pathto goodness, truth, and divine love in God.[4] This word has been wrongly translated in certain texts as “unconquerable.”Inasmuch as the Pandavas win in the end, that statement would be proved false.“Innumerable,” however, is the translation my Guru gave."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter NineSANJAYA SPEAKSSanjaya (Introspection) then describes the scene he beholds with his distantvision. Beginning with the army led by Duryodhana (Dhritarashtra’s son), Sanjayatells how Duryodhana, on beholding the Pandava forces ranged against him,repairs anxiously to Drona, his preceptor (Habit, or samskaras: pasttendencies), and seeks his encouragement and reassurance.The Bhagavad Gita takes us immediately to meditation as the shortest route toGod. Naturally, when the devotee first sits for meditation all his old worldlytendencies, stirred up by material desire, rouse themselves in protest.Duryodhana (King Material Desire) fearfully notes the enemy’s power, whichstands ranged against his army. Dhristadyumna (the calm inner light), the son ofDrupada (extreme dispassion), is a brother student of his under Drona, and isthe first one to range the Pandava forces in battle array. Dhristadyumna it iswho finally slays Drona (not in his role of guru, but as the influence of pasthabit). Dhristadyumna is also described, however, as the “skilled” disciple ofDrona, for the calm inner light is seen only after repeated meditative practice,resulting in the meditative habit.Duryodhana is not prepared to see ranged against him so many disciples of Drona,his guru, whom he hopes to see lead his forces of material desire to victory.It should be emphasized that the Bhagavad Gita plunges right from the beginninginto the inner life of meditation, which, it becomes clear bit by bit, is foreveryone. This is not a scripture of pious platitudes. It urges people right atthe outset to seek deep soul-communion through their own direct, innerexperience of God.Duryodhana goes on to lament his perception that many other great warriors areranged against him, warriors as fear-inspiring as the Pandava brothers Bhima andArjuna. Anxiously he lists some of the most prominent among them.Next, he seeks courage by listing the warriors on his own side. They consist ofDrona (habit), Bhishma (the essential self, or ego), Karna (attachment), andothers too numerous to list in this exposition, which only concerns the Gitaitself and not the Mahabharata. Duryodhana then says, “Our forces, protected byBhishma, are difficult to count (because so numerous), whereas their forces,defended by Bhima, are easy to count.” Encouraged by his superior forces,Duryodhana exhorts his troops to gather round Bhishma and protect him. As longas one’s essential sense of individuality is safe—such is the belief of KingMaterial Desire—their cause is secure.Meditation, however, takes one’s consciousness into inner realms where the gripof separate consciousness begins to loosen. The breath itself becomes calm, andthe energy begins to withdraw from the senses. Then (in Stanza 12) “GrandsireBhishma, with a view to encouraging Duryodhana, blows his conch with a loud,lion-like roar.” The meaning here is fascinating: Bhishma’s “conch” is thebreath. When Ego feels its consciousness of individuality slipping away in deepmeditation, and even more so as it approaches breathlessness, it suddenlythinks, “Wait! What about me?!”Ego is the linchpin; it holds material desire in place. Ego may be described asthe center of the vortex around which all material desires revolve. Suddenrecollection of one’s accustomed “reality,” the body, and of the desirablenessof the material world, causes subconscious habit to activate the sense of“I-ness.” At that moment, the strong inhalation of breath is suggested by the“loud, lion-like roar” of Bhishma’s conch, which returns the meditating devoteeto outward consciousness.Swami Sri Yukteswar likened the mind of man to a little bird that has been keptin a cage for twenty years. If you open the door of the cage, the bird willcower at the back, fearful of the “threat” that seems to beckon: the vast opensky, where it was designed by nature to fly. After a time the bird may hoptentatively outside the cage, but it will hurry back almost immediately, fearfulof this experience of freedom for which habit has made it unprepared. Onlygradually, by longer and longer sorties, will the little bird stand at lastoutside its cage, rustle its wings, and after a further pause fly up freely intothe sky.Stanza 13 describes the response of the other Kuru soldiers to Bhishma’s conch:drums, tabors, cow horns, trumpets. These signify not only the sense-transmittednoises of the surrounding world, but the inner reawakening of physical sounds:the thumping of the heart, the rush of blood in the veins within the ears, andother familiar bodily sounds.In answer to the lure and agitation of material sounds, the inner world callsthen to the devotee, insistently, with alluring music: the sound of a honey bee,for example, emanating from the muladhara chakra or coccyx center when theenergy is stimulated at that point to rise upward in the spine; Krishna’s flute,the sound emanating from the swadisthana chakra or sacral center; the sweetsound of a harp, emanating from the manipura chakra or lumbar center; the deepbell sound of the anahata chakra, or heart center; the soothing, expansivesound—like soft wind in the trees, or like distant thunder—emanating from thebishuddha chakra or cervical center; and above all pranaba, the mighty sound ofAUM (of which more will be written later).This mighty sound pierces the heart of Material Desire and his supporting army,causing great consternation.At this point, Arjuna (“he whose flag bears the monkey emblem”) lifts up his bowand addresses a request to Krishna, his charioteer. The bow, as we have seen,symbolizes the spine. The monkey is a symbol of restlessness; raising the“monkey emblem” signifies that Arjuna has brought his restless mind undercontrol, and is able to commune consciously with the Lord (Krishna).“O Changeless Krishna,” he says (as I mentioned earlier), “please direct mychariot between the two armies, that I may see them ranged against one anotherand know better with whom I must fight.”We see here also, quite clearly, that the Gita is allegorical. No army generalwould be so foolish on the very eve of battle, as to ask to be driven betweenthe two armies for a better glimpse of the enemy. The most that a general wouldask, if he wanted such a view, would be to be taken onto a high hilltop or someother point from which he could see without exposing himself to the danger ofenemy arrows, spears, and other projectiles.There is a beautiful story of how Krishna came to be Arjuna’s charioteer. Arjunaand Duryodhana went separately to Krishna to try to enlist his help in theforthcoming war. Krishna was asleep, so they waited patiently, Duryodhana seatedproudly by Krishna’s head, Arjuna humbly at his feet. When Krishna awoke, hefound them both there. To be fair, therefore, he gave them a choice: either thehelp of his entire army, or himself, inactive in battle and giving only advice.Arjuna was given first choice, since on waking Krishna had seen him first.Arjuna chose Krishna, even though he would be inactive on the battlefield.Duryodhana, the materialist, was well content with having a whole army, of whichhe himself would in any case be the general.Krishna became Arjuna’s charioteer. Symbolically, what the chariot represents isthe human body, the horses representing the five senses (in fact, there are fivesubtle senses also: hearing and the power of hearing; seeing and the power ofseeing, and so on). Arjuna invited the Lord to guide the chariot of his life,holding the reins of his senses and steering his course through the comingbattle. Thus, the devotee also must try always to see God alone as the Doer ofall his actions.Driving the chariot of spiritual endeavor between the two armies signifies thewithdrawal of energy into the spine, and the awareness which comes to themeditating devotee that there are actually two forces within him, vying togetherto draw him in opposite directions: downward and upward. The purpose ofmeditation, according to yoga practice, is to raise the energy in the spine, inso doing to transfer all the lower energies into higher energies in the spine,and finally, then, to focus them at the point between the eyebrows, uniting themultimately with the highest pole in the body at the top of the head (thesahasrara).Arjuna, as Krishna and he pass between the armies, is filled with grief in therealization that he must fight against, and actually kill, people so closelyrelated to him: cousins, uncles, grandfathers, fathers-in-law, and also hisfriends and his esteemed preceptor. His mighty bow slips from his grasp, meaningthat he can no longer hold a firm meditative pose.“How can I fight these people, all of them dear to me? Even if they desire toslay me, I cannot commit the great sin of fighting against them.” He goes on inthis vein, pleading the cause of ahimsa (harmlessness) to justify his ownunwillingness to proceed with the war. Dropping his bow and sitting back in hischariot, his eyes bedimmed with tears, he cries at last, “I will not fight!” Thefirst chapter of the Gita and the beginning of the second portray hisdiscouragement."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter TenTHE NATURE OF DEATH—ALLEGORICAL AND LITERALSri Krishna, in the second chapter, responds on two levels of truth. First, hespeaks of the occasional need to engage literally in a righteous war like thisone. The country under Duryodhana has known hardship and suffering. Under itsrightful rulers, the Pandavas, it would know peace. Not only are most wars ofself-defense righteous, but, here, the welfare of the populace is concerned.Mahatma Gandhi’s belief of the rightness of ahimsa (non-violence) is both validand not valid. One should always, certainly, hold an attitude of ahimsa. That isto say, one should never wish harm on anyone or anything. As Swami Sri Yukteswarsaid, however, “This world is inconveniently arranged for a literal practice ofahimsa.” Sri Yukteswar’s advice concerned the killing of mosquitoes. Manyinsects are harmful to human life, and should therefore be kept under control.It would be difficult, moreover, if not impossible to avoid treading on andkilling small insects; when driving one’s car to avoid killing the insectsflying against one’s windshield; when cooking, not to kill harmful bacteria;even when inhaling, not to destroy tiny, invisible creatures. The scripturalproscription against doing harm refers, Sri Yukteswar explained, to one’sattitude. One should not wish harm to anything, but one may be obliged to killharmful creatures. Indeed, to protect them at the expense of human life would bea sin, for man’s body is more highly evolved spiritually than that of any loweranimal.If a lunatic were to enter your neighborhood and start shooting at people,assuming there was no other way of restraining him it might be karmically right,as well as necessary, to kill him. Better one deserved death than many that areundeserved.There are times, as I said, when war is right, because necessary. Krishna,representing the voice of God, had declared at Kurukshetra that the side of thePandavas was right and just. For Arjuna to refuse his duty as a warrior in thatwar would have been, not a virtue, but a sin.Krishna then reassures Arjuna that the soul in any case never dies. It is a partof God, and is therefore indestructible. He then portrays reincarnation as afact. The soul doesn’t continue its existence only in a higher world, butreturns to this world, body after body, until it achieves liberation.Krishna then, however, goes on to explain a deeper side of death and rebirth.For the Bhagavad Gita is, above all, an allegory of soul-evolution. (Actuallythe soul doesn’t evolve, for it is ever perfect. It is the jiva, or ego—the soulattached to the body—which evolves toward liberation. To speak of the soulevolving, therefore, is a convenience, merely, referring to the ego’s spiritual,as opposed to its physical, evolution.)Krishna says, “The energy invested in a fault cannot be destroyed: It can onlybe transmuted.” The energy that went into hating people, being angry with them,trying to hurt them, and lusting after the pleasures of this world cannot everbe destroyed. The energy invested in them becomes simply, as I said, redirectedtoward spiritual pursuits.The fear of worldly people, which Arjuna phrased in noble language though he wasin fact speaking possessively of his own inner “citizens” (in ego-consciousness,that is to say), is that in giving up their worldly habits, they will losesomething precious to them. Krishna is saying, “Arjuna, nothing is ever lost.What you relinquish on the material plane you will rediscover a thousand timesmore wonderfully in God.”Thus, in 2:11, Sri Krishna said to Arjuna, “With words of love you have beengrieving over those who deserve no lamentation. The wise mourn neither for thosewho live on earth nor for those who leave it.” Life, Krishna is saying, is notdetermined by the existence or non-existence of a physical body. It was neverthe body that gave us life. We, rather, gave life to the body. The soul isever-existent, and that soul is what we ourselves are: manifestations of EternalSpirit.Even after we have shed the physical body, it is not as though we had no body.This body is only an outer shell encasing our astral body, which in turn is onlyan energy-condensation enclosing our ideational, or causal body. None of thesebodies supplies man with his life and consciousness: Rather, it is he whoanimates them.(2:12) Nor are we here in this world for the first time. I, you, these royalones whose (possible) death you lament: None of these has not lived here before,nor shall any of them ever cease to be.(2:13) As the ego keeps the thread of self-awareness unbroken through infancy,childhood, youth, and old age, so also the embodied soul (which gaveconsciousness to the ego) maintains its awareness uninterruptedly, not onlythrough the stages of earth life, but through the appearance of successivebodies.(2:14) O Son of Kunti, sensations such as heat and cold, pleasure and pain aregenerated through the senses in (their) contact with the world. They are ideasonly: transitory, each with its beginning and end. O Descendent of Bharata, bearwith them patiently.The way of wisdom is to be non-identified with anything outside the Self.(2:15) O Flower among Men, one who is calm and even-minded, never ruffled duringpain and pleasure: he alone gains consciousness of his eternal existence.(2:16) That which is unreal does not exist. That which is real cannot cease toexist. Those who possess wisdom know the final nature of reality: of what is,and what is not.(2:17) He alone, the Unchangeable Spirit, pervades all, and is imperishable.Nothing can destroy His eternal reality.(2:18) That indwelling Self is ever changeless, imperishable, and withoutlimitation. Only these fleshly garments can be destroyed. Therefore, O Offspringof Bharata, accept your duty (in this body), and fight!(2:19) One who considers his true and eternal Self to be the slayer (ofanything), and who believes that he himself, in essence, can be slain, does notknow the truth. The true Self can neither slay nor be slain.(2:20) This Self is not born, nor does it perish. Self-existent, it continuesits existence forever. It is birthless, eternal, changeless, and ever the same.The Self is not slain when the body dies.(2:21) How can one who knows the true Self to be imperishable, everlasting,unborn, and unchanging imagine that this Self can cause destruction to anotherSelf? O Partha (Arjuna), who is slaying whom?(2:22) Just as a person removes a worn-out garment and dons a new one, so thesoul living in a physical body (removes and) discards it when it becomesoutworn, and replaces it with a new one.(2:23) Weapons cannot cut the soul; fire cannot burn it; water cannot drown it;wind cannot wither it away!(2:24) The soul is never touched; it is immutable, all-pervading, calm,unshakable; its existence is eternal.(2:25) The soul cannot even be pondered by the reasoning mind. It (the Self) isunmanifested and form-less. Realize this truth, and abstain from lamentation.(2:26,27) Even, however, if you prefer to think of the Self as perishable, whygrieve? What is born must die. Whatever dies must be born again. Why lament thatwhich cannot be avoided?(2:28) (The periods) before birth and after death are veiled from your gaze. Youare conscious only of that which is visible to your senses. Why lament a thingyou can’t see?(2:29) Some (people) behold the soul in amazement. Others describe (theexperience of it) as marvelous. Still others, hearing it, listen, and proclaimit wonderful. The rest, even if they hear all about it, comprehend it not atall.This last stanza describes some of the ways by which the soul can be known: asan amazing, cosmic, and wondrous light; as cosmic wisdom; and, finally, asCosmic Sound: the vibration of AUM.There are false lights—projections of the subconscious mind. These have acertain vagueness to them, and are hazy and indistinct. The soul-light is“amazing” in its power to transform the consciousness of the meditating devotee.There is false wisdom, usually associated with mere intellectual knowledge.Paramhansa Yogananda remembered times during his youth when he would wonder,unnecessarily, “Who was this person or that one in other lives? Who, forexample, was Jesus Christ, Krishna, Shakespeare?” If you visit a castle,wouldn’t it be wiser (he asked us rhetorically), instead of roaming about thegarden and wondering what everything is, to befriend the lord of the castle andlet him show you around? He will explain everything to you, and will give it itsproportional importance.The sound of AUM will be described later: what it is, what it sounds like, andthe important role it plays in deep meditation.(2:30) O Bharata (Arjuna), there is one Self dwelling in all. That Self isinviolable. Grieve not, therefore, for anything (that occurs) outwardly in themanifested world.(2:31,32) Even when viewed personally, from a standpoint of one’s dharmic duty,there is no occasion for (either) grief or hesitation. Nothing is morepropitious than for a Kshatriya, whose duty it is to fight for righteousness, tobattle for what is right and true. Blessed and fortunate are you, if you mustgive even your life for such a cause. Such a death will open to you the gates ofheaven.A slain warrior who has fought fearlessly in a good cause goes to heaven as aresult of having held to an ideal higher than material existence. Hiswillingness, in a righteous cause, to sacrifice his lower reality for a higherone entitles him to enjoy the beautiful astral regions after death.(2:33,34) But if you refuse this opportunity for righteous combat, in rejectionof your duty, you will incur sin. Other people (far from honoring you) will heapyour name with ignominy. To a man of self-respect, dishonor is, verily, worsethan death.(2:35,36) Other warriors will assume that you have avoided fighting out of fear.Those who have thought highly of you heretofore will come to regard youslightingly. Your foes will speak your name with contempt, and will ridiculeyour prowess. Could anything (for a warrior) be more painful?(2:37,38) If you are killed in battle, you will attain heaven. If you win thiswar, you will obtain earthly glory. Arise therefore, O Son of Kunti (Arjuna).Determine to fight! Be even-minded in the face of pleasure or pain, gain orloss, victory or defeat. In this way, you will incur no sin.(2:39) I have thus explained to you the ultimate wisdom of Shankhya. Now hearthe wisdom of Yoga, equipped with which, O Partha, you will break the shacklesof karma.This last passage appears variously translated in different texts. In fact,however, the version given by Paramhansa Yogananda is clearly the most accurate.The word, “wisdom,” which appears in the original, is conjoined with “Shankhya,”and does not mean Gyana Yoga as some have it (spelling Gyana according to thepedantic, but unphonetic, tradition, as “Jnana”—a version my Guru deplored inpersonal conversations with me). Other translations refer to Karma Yoga, whichdoesn’t even appear in the original text. What the Gita does speak of is thatwhich “will loosen the bonds of karma.” I have rendered the English translationmore poetically by writing, “break the shackles of karma.” The meaning is, ofcourse, the same.Paramhansa Yogananda discussed the three main philosophies of India: Shankhya,Yoga, and Vedanta. He explained that the wisdom taught in Shankhya underscoresthe need to escape from maya, or delusion. Yoga tells the sincere seeker how tomake good his escape. And Vedanta (literally, “Summation,” or “End,” of theVedas) describes the nature of Brahman.Classical Indian scholarship describes these three “philosophies” as differentand even incompatible with one another. Yogananda explained that all of them arerooted in the same basic truth: Sanaatan Dharma. They simply emphasize the threebasic aspects of the spiritual search: briefly, the why, the how, and the whatof it. All three aspects are needed. One needs to know why it is necessary toseek truth, how best to go about it, and what one may expect (stated with asmuch intellectual clarity as possible, though emphasizing that direct experiencealone conveys true understanding).The Bhagavad Gita teaches all three “systems.” In fact, as Yogananda explained,these are not “philosophies.” Philosophy literally means “love of wisdom”—in theancient Greek: philos (love) and sophia (wisdom). He explained that Westernthinkers deserve the label, “philosophers,” but that the great rishis and yogisof India have never been so much philosophers as “seers,” who in every age havenever been satisfied with merely theorizing about truth, but have seen andexperienced it directly, themselves. No Immanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer, orFriedrich Nietzsche could demonstrate a fraction of the control of life,objectively as well as subjectively, that has been demonstrated from the mostancient times down to the present by the great “yogi-Christs” of India."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter ElevenKRISHNA’S CONSOLATIONChapter 2 of the Bhagavad Gita begins with Arjuna’s deep distress at the thoughtof having to make war on his own kinsmen. Most of the succeeding stanzas quoteKrishna’s timeless words of consolation, wisdom, and encouragement.Thus it sometimes happens that the devotee, disappointed with his spiritualprogress so far, grows discouraged. He may think, “I gave up tangible pleasuresfor intangible joys. Now I am left with nothing!” Essentially, this despondencyis rooted in a longing for spiritual freedom. Arjuna did not say—like a hoarybut undevotional ascetic in a delightful story Paramhansa Yogananda liked totell—“Goodbye God and all your crazy crowd!” He did not look back with longingon the false “delights” of the world. He was discouraged, rather, because hishopes of spiritual experience had not yet been fulfilled. Torn between twoworlds, but believing in the upward path, he sat back in his “chariot” andcried, “I can do no more!”Krishna, who represents the Divine Presence within—the soul, in otherwords—comforts the devotee inwardly and thrills him with loving reassurance.Spiritual growth is rarely sudden, unless an individual is already blessed frombirth with exceptionally good karma. The Lord does not necessarily speak withhuman lips, through vision, though He manifests himself in physical form throughthe human guru. Even the guru, however, teaches primarily through the disciple’sown intuitive perception.Even Arjuna’s tears of despondency are spiritually wholesome, for they alsoexpress an unfulfilled longing for divine truth, and rivet the mind on higheraspiration: his unquenched longing for the indescribable joy of divinecommunion.From thinking rationally, the devotee passes to complete surrender to theunreasoning but clear-sighted perceptions of intuition. This is a necessaryattitude for further spiritual advancement.It must be understood that even such encouragement from silent intuition is asign of much spiritual work in former incarnations. It may seem cruel on God’spart not to respond instantly to human doubts, fears, and hesitations, but thinkhow many lives the ego has wandered away from God, spurning every hint of Hislove, and resolved instead to seek fulfillment once again in the world of thesenses. Arjuna no longer feels attracted to the world. Rather, he has reachedthat stage where the world no longer appeals to him, but still he hesitates tospurn it altogether. That God, at this stage, would offer strong hope andconsolation of insights and intuitions to be attained, in time, is already anindication of considerable inner progress.Does Arjuna’s pity for his enemy-“kinfolk” indicate that he desires again thepleasures he has renounced? Because the Gita is written as a guide for everyonewho seeks God, it must be allowed that this nostalgia might be Arjuna’s problem,too, though the text doesn’t indicate that it necessarily is. His despondencycould be due only to his lack, so far, of spiritual fulfillment. In any case,the Lord says to him, “They are your foes. Don’t be ‘soft’ on them, for theirtrue intent is to destroy you.” Pity for past pleasures can bridge once againthe gap one has created between himself and them. It is a great mistake on thespiritual path to toy even idly with thoughts of what has been left behind.Renunciation of the world in thought as well as in deed is essential.Watch the heart for any ripple of attraction there. You may feel safe fromworldly desires, but if in your heart you find the least tremor of excitement,even on hearing about the pleasures of the senses, or on listening to storiesabout them—to “dirty stories,” for example—shun them like the infection theyreally are. People may scoff, saying, “It’s just in the mind.” Exactly so! Themind itself is the battlefield. There is no other.Sense delights seem pleasurable only by an act of the imagination. A mother, forexample, might be able during a food shortage to convince herself that byfeeding her children she was also sustaining herself. In time, however, eventhat self-denying act would no longer be possible for her. Such vicariousidentification is comparable to imagining that one is sustaining his happinessthrough the senses. The true Self can be sustained only by spiritual states ofconsciousness, such as divine love, calmness, and bliss.Sense pleasures are not even experienced on the surface of the body, as theyseem to be. The nerves transmit sensations from them—visual and musical beauty,fragrance, taste, and touch—to the brain. Whether they are greeted with pleasureor distaste depends entirely on one’s mental conditioning. The human mind,unlike the minds of lower animals, can train itself to like anything. Thesaying, “There’s no accounting for tastes,” is essentially mistaken, for the“accounting” depends on repeated mental association. Even sensations that formost people are unpleasant can be pleasing to some—if, for example, they grew upin environments where those sensations were common.The bliss of the soul, experienced especially in deep meditation, is Self-born.That is why the sage Patanjali writes of enlightenment as a process of smriti,or memory. The instant that soul bliss, or love, is felt, it is recognized. Itdoesn’t have to be learned, and the taste for it doesn’t need to be acquired.Again, when the Cosmic Sound, AUM, is truly heard, one knows with intuitivecertainty that he could hear it through eternity and never grow tired of it. Themost beautiful music, by contrast, grows tiresome, even irritating, after atime.“Heaven,” referred to in Stanzas 32 and 37, means more here than the astralheavens where noble warriors go after death. The Bhagavad Gita is a scripture.As in the teachings of Jesus Christ, most of whose references to heaven meantthe state of oneness with God, so what Krishna means more deeply here is thelimitless sphere of divine consciousness. For the devotee, the laurel of victoryis soul-freedom in infinite bliss.Unlike ordinary church preaching, or the compromise with the highest ideals thatis offered by mere pundits, the Bhagavad Gita is very firm concerning the hightruths it teaches. Rarely heard in Christian churches is the admonishment ofJesus: “Love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.” And when hisstatement is quoted, “Be ye therefore perfect even as God is perfect,” itsmeaning is diluted either by telling people, “Be good,” or else, “Be goodbecause God, in His perfection, expects goodness of us.” Hindu teachers atsatsangs in India rarely admonish their listeners to live up to the highesttruths expressed in the Gita. “Give Me thy heart; adore Me” becomes translatedas, “Love Me also.” Sukdeva’s statement, “All time is wasted that is not spentseeking God,” is conveniently forgotten, as people are reminded that wealth andnormal human pleasures are sanctioned by the scriptures. Yes, they are—if one issatisfied with only good karma, and with continually rising and falling on thewheel of reincarnation! Krishna’s higher teaching, however, is uncompromising.At the same time it must be added that the Gita is for everyone—as are also thecomparable teachings of Jesus Christ. As Krishna says later in the Gita, “Even alittle practice of this religion will free one from dire fears and colossalsufferings.” (2:40)Stanza 10, which was not quoted above but was contained by implication in theover-all summary, states that Krishna, before exhorting Arjuna to do battle,spoke “as if smiling.” This phrase, Yogananda said, is important, because itindicates that God is no stern judge of human behavior, but is “on our side.” Hewants us to advance spiritually, and forever forgives us if we err. The words,“as if smiling,” indicate that Arjuna had already advanced far on the path towin such an indication of God’s love. As Krishna remains inactive during thewar, and participates only to guide Arjuna’s chariot, so He often seems remoteto the devotee, and even indifferent to the most earnest efforts to attain Him.Krishna’s “smile,” however, is ever there for those who seek Him earnestly. Itis not easily won, but loving reassurance is given from time to time, in oneform or another. The devotee feels God’s loving support in his heart. In time,he is conscious of that inward smile. It is with this smile that Krishna givesHis discourse in the Bhagavad Gita. It is with sweetest love that God exhortsthe devotee to seek Him unconditionally, as the only source of fulfillment thereis.The devotee, meanwhile, should not await, as if anxiously, God’s smile ofreassurance but should proceed even-mindedly toward his goal by performing evercalmly his karmically assigned duties. To be “even-minded and cheerful” underall circumstances is the first duty of the yogi. This obviously does not meanbeing cheerful about other people’s suffering! One must respect, and evenempathize with, their pains—as Krishna did. As regards one’s own pains, however,the aspiring yogi must firmly banish all thought of ego-identification with bothpleasure and pain. Pain may in fact be “happening,” but he must not think of itas his own. The more he can resist the oppositional states of Nature—maya’sdualities (dwaita)—the more he will find that he can remain inwardly calm underall circumstances. In that calmness, moreover, apart from not suffering whenothers howl with pain, he will find himself not suffering personally, even whenhe must endure the same pain as they. He will be at that calm center from whichappropriate movement can be made instantly, in any direction.A (to me) astonishing feature of my Guru’s life was how he would instantlyreflect the appropriate response to any circumstance. I have to say that, in thethree and a half years I lived with him, I never saw him give exactly the sameglance or reaction twice.A good practice for the devotee is deliberately to submit himself to extremeopposites: heat and cold, pleasure and pain, etc. He should be careful not totest his powers too far beyond their proven ability so far. To do so would befanaticism. Indeed, it might prove counter-productive: One could stand too longunder a cold shower, and find himself hardly feeling warm again for months! Onecould even endanger his health. Along with the counsel to be even-minded andcheerful is an equally important one: Use common sense.For even-mindedness, an important practice is to give up likes and dislikes. MyGuru used to say, “What comes of itself, let it come.” Again, deliberatelyeliminating those peaks and troughs of feeling can be a useful practice. Eat afood you don’t really like (provided the food isn’t bad for you!), or give afood, or perhaps some other pleasure, to someone else that you mightparticularly enjoy for yourself.Remember, the opposites of duality are inseparable from one another. The fartherforward a child’s playground swing goes, the farther back it must go also.Excessive sense-pleasure produces a “hangover” of many kinds—perhaps a headache(in the case of too much drink), a stomachache (in the case of too much eating),a depressed mood (in the case of too much hilarity), a sense of loneliness(after being too much with people).Happiness lies in being centered calmly in one’s self, even when that “self” iswritten with a lower-case “s.” One who is inwardly calm is able to see things asthey are. He might be described as the only sane person, when all around him areinsane!Important to an attitude of being “even-minded and cheerful” is to confront athought Krishna raises in Chapter 2 of the Bhagavad Gita: the natural fear ofdeath and dying. All must die, sooner or later. Life itself is a preparation fordeath’s “final exam.” It would be helpful to face this event matter-of-factly,not morbidly. When bathing your body, for example, tell yourself, “This arm I amwashing will be ashes or dust someday. It isn’t me, myself!” At night beforegoing to bed, make a mental bonfire of all your possessions, your desires, yourattachments. Cast them one by one into the flames, then watch as they cracklemerrily and disappear. Nothing belongs to you—not even your own ego! Firmly tohold this attitude is the way to inner freedom. Enjoy yourself as you watcheverything disappear in those mental flames. Nothing—not even death—can touchyou as you really are, inside.Meanwhile, meet your responsibilities conscientiously in the world the next day,with an attitude of inner detachment. Give everything to God, and try always toplease Him. Don’t wait anxiously for His smile of approval, but live in thethought that you have it already, for the freer you feel in yourself, thehappier you will be.Live in the Self: Be centered in it as your abiding reality. Everything else issimply a dance around the “maypole” of that inner Self. Don’t be caught up byanything. Whatever you do, be free inside. Inner freedom may be described as thehighest of all moral virtues.The most important practice on the spiritual path is whatever will help to freeyou from the sense of ego-involvement. You cannot refrain from acting, asKrishna makes clear later on. Even the refusal to act is a kind of activity.People sometimes give the false counsel, “If you see someone lying helpless in aditch, do nothing to help him, for if you do so you’ll incur karma.” What absurdadvice! First of all, by helping others you’ll get good karma, which will offsetto some extent any bad karma you’ve incurred in the past. Secondly, in thiscase, by not acting you are already creating karma—bad karma! The decision notto act is like restraining a horse by the reins: It takes an effort of will, andtherefore implies an act of some kind.What is the ego? Imagine the moon reflected in many vessels of water. Eachvessel contains the same reflection, yet the reflection seems, in each of them,to be individual. When we look up at the sky, however, we see that thereflections are all of the same, one moon. At the same time, they may alsodiffer from one another: for example, if the water in one vessel is agitated, orif it contains floating debris, or is colored differently. The soul of everyhuman being reflects the same bliss of Spirit, but because that bliss isreflected in the individual ego, its appearance and character may seem greatlyaltered. If a mind is restless, its natural bliss will be distorted; if greatlydistorted, it may even appear as suffering and pain. To the degree, also, thatone’s feelings contain the “debris” of desires and attachments, the actual blissreflected by the ego will be distorted—though the distortion is only in thereflection. If one’s awareness is colored, moreover—as water may be—byprejudices, likes and dislikes, and mistaken notions, these hues, too, willaffect the clarity of one’s underlying soul-bliss, which otherwise would shineclearly in one’s consciousness. Indeed, spiritual progress consists not inactually achieving anything, but in simply removing the distortions that obscurethe nature of reality. All those distortions are contained in the confusedreflections we produce of the true bliss of our own being. In the end, when weoffer up our little reflection to the moon itself, we find in that transcendentbliss that even our old and seemingly discarded ego remains always with us—as adeathless memory.One may ask, Why cannot the ego, after death, merge back into the oneness ofSpirit? The truth is, we have other bodies to transcend. Imagine a corked bottleof sea water floating on the ocean. If the bottle breaks, then naturally thewater inside it commingles with the water around it and becomesindistinguishable from the rest of the sea water. If, however, that bottle iscontained in another corked bottle, and that second one is placed within a thirdbottle, the breaking of the outer bottle will not free the water in theinnermost bottle.The physical body is like that outer bottle. Inside it is what might be calledthe original model of that body—the astral body of light and energy. As long asthe astral body is “polluted” with material desires, it must create anotherphysical body to encase it once again.Of course, no image is perfect. In literal fact, the outer bottle would be inclosest contact with the sea, the water of which would be touching it on allsides. In spiritual “fact,” however, body-consciousness is farthest removed fromcontact with the Supreme Spirit, and to live consciously in the astral bodybrings one closer to that ultimate contact.Even in the astral body of energy, however, there remains a final casing: thecausal body, made of ideas.The physical body is made of blood, flesh, and bones. It consists, ParamhansaYogananda tells us, of sixteen elements. Comparing the astral and causal bodiesto the physical, he said that the astral body contains nineteen elements, whichconsist of various energies: five instruments of knowledge (the subtlecounterparts of the five senses); five of action; five of life force; and mind,intellect, ego, and feeling (mon, buddhi, ahankara, chitta). It is interestingto find the ego itself mentioned as an “element” of the astral body. The causalbody, finally, consists of thirty-five “elements,” which are a composite of thesixteen physical and nineteen astral “elements.”The word “element” appears, interestingly, in classical tradition in both Eastand West. It applies to the stages, not to the chemical elements, of physicalmanifestation: ether, air, fire, water, and earth. Interestingly also, thesestages are identified with the five spinal chakras, and therefore with the fivePandava brothers.When matter is first manifested, there is space, which Yogananda said is itselfa distinct vibration, and which may be identified with ether. The nextmanifestation into matter consists of huge galactic gasses, the nebulae. Thesegradually condense as balls of fiery matter; next, as “water,” or liquids(flowing lava, for example, which is matter in a liquid state); and finally as“earth,” or solid matter. As the yogi raises his consciousness through the fivespinal chakras, he gains a certain power over the elemental stages ofmanifestation: the ability to make himself as immovable as a rock, and extremelyheavy. He can walk on water, then on fire. He can levitate. He can expand hisconsciousness outward into space.All reality can be visualized, ultimately, as an infinite ocean: the infinity ofSpirit. Waves appear on that ocean, manifesting individual forms. Every ego isrepresented by one of those waves. The goal of sadhana (spiritual practice) isto withdraw one’s wave of manifestation back into the ocean, that it become,literally, infinite.Yogananda used this example to explain what I have said about the ego’s returnand reabsorption in the infinite Spirit. He spoke of a man named John, who hasbeen manifested for aeons in many-shaped waves on the ocean of Spirit. Always ithas been Spirit manifested in that form. It has seemed separate, however. WhenJohn’s wave of individuality merges back into the ocean, he is no longer thatwave, but realizes himself as God who became John for many incarnations until,at last, he understood that his separateness was an illusion. When he becomesGod again, however, “John,” the individual, doesn’t cease to exist. The memoryof who he was through all those incarnations is retained. Because of thatmemory, the ego itself continues to exist in Infinite Consciousness, and can bere-manifested whenever the Infinite so decrees.Thus, Krishna, who was considered even while he lived on Earth to be God Himself(He is thus symbolized in the Gita), was not only the infinite God taking onthat little form of manifestation, but also the same individual memory of theego who manifested in countless human forms, until achieving final liberation.Tradition holds that Krishna was an incarnation of Vishnu. Vishnu himself,however, is only an aspect of Infinite Consciousness. Indeed, Vishnu is anaspect of one of the triune vibrations of AUM—of which, however, more later.It is interesting to contemplate the fact that ocean waves are not fixedrealities. Anything floating on a wave will rise and sink as the wave passes on.The wave is real only as a kind of vibration. Even the ego is only a vibrationon the surface, so to speak, of infinity.God sent man to earth to be entertained by the cosmic movie. Alas, attachmentand desire darkened human consciousness. Immersed in the seeming reality of themovie, man forgot that it all was nothing but a ray of light in the projectionbooth, passing through artificial images imprinted on a strip of celluloid. Ifman could live in this world with perfect non-attachment, he would again becomeaware that this is all a show: only shadows and light. The only reality is thatchangeless light which produced those fleeting images, and the bliss within thatlight.An important point in the consolation Krishna gives to Arjuna is that his is nota teaching to be heartless. Human love is a part of divine love. It only becomesa mistake when it fixes in attachment on one, or on a few, particular forms. Ourloved ones must be separated from us in death—whether by their deaths or by ourown. Therefore we should always, with discrimination, keep in mind that allhuman beings, and everything in existence, come from the same one God, Who aloneshould receive our first love.Thus we come to Stanza 40, and the beginning of Krishna’s teachings on thesubject of yoga."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter TwelveTHE NATURE OF RIGHT ACTIONYoga is inseparable from action, for it provides the “how to” of the spiritualpath. It is not, however, action with a beginning and an end, like worldlydeeds. It contains no unfinished act, like worldly actions, the consequences ofwhich can be diverted by what Yogananda called “the thwarting cross-currents ofego.” Every ego-inspired act, moreover, inspires a reaction, but to yogapractice there is no such dualistic reaction, for it is directed toward thetermination of karmic activity. This is the teaching of the next stanza:(2:40) In this path (of yoga action) there is no danger of “unfinishedbusiness,” nor are there latent within it the opposite, canceling effects ofduality. Even a little practice of this religion will free one from dire fearsand colossal sufferings (which are inherent in the unceasing cycles of death andrebirth).It is important to realize that in yoga practice as well as, of course, in anysincere search for God (the one Self, beyond all duality), there is no wastedeffort, and no karmic rebound. There is, in other words, no “catch” to seekingGod. With any other effort, no matter how glorious the outcome, it is alwayslegitimate to ask, “What’s wrong with it?” Only with the divine search is theanswer a resounding, “Nothing’s wrong!” Even to fail in this quest brings onlygood karma.Think of other fulfillments in life. Fame? One famous man said, “I enjoyed fameat first, but it wasn’t long before it turned to ashes. Now, it means nothing tome.”Money? Howard Hughes, the wealthiest man in the world at the time he lived, wasasked if he’d found happiness, and responded bitterly, “No, I can’t say thatI’ve found happiness.”Human love? What a compromise is the most beautiful love story with infinite,divine love, which the soul experiences at the end of its search for God!Power? Joseph Stalin, the all-powerful dictator of Russia’s Soviet Union, wasvirtually mad toward the end of his life, fearing that everyone around himwanted to encompass his destruction.Knowledge? Look at the dry faces, the furrowed brows, the bent shoulders ofpeople who have pursued intellectual knowledge all their lives. Hear thebrittleness in their voices!No, nothing on earth brings lasting fulfillment. And even if a few people seemto have found fulfillment for a time, none would say that what they’ve attainedis the summum bonum of life. In only one field does perfect unanimity exist: inthe search for God, and especially in those who have found Him. In everyreligion, in every country, in every people, those who have found God are incomplete agreement: This is the goal of all human striving. Without exception,those who have found Him have willingly accepted even persecution and painfuldeath to bring this realization to their fellowman. God, they aver, is the onlyworthwhile goal in life.Yet, how often those who seek Him are ridiculed—and worse than ridiculed!Later on in the Gita, Krishna answers beautifully, in words full of hope, thequestion put to him by Arjuna: “What happens to those who fail?” Already in thepresent stanza Krishna is saying, “No effort on the path to God is ever wasted.”This is not to say that there cannot be wrong practices in the service of God.When people practice yoga (or other forms of religion) with wrong orself-serving motives—whether to develop spiritual powers, or to obtain controlover others—they must pay the karmic price, for they have devoted their energiesto dualistic ends, and must accept the consequences of pitting their ownenergies against the energies of others. When there is pure longing for truthand God, however, this stanza of the Gita offers a shining reassurance foreveryone.To desire salvation sincerely, even once, is to enter upon the path to eventualfreedom. For all desires must be fulfilled. Even so, this one desire, onceentrenched in the heart, cannot but lead eventually to liberation.Thus, this passage contains one of the most deeply inspired and inspiringpassages in all scripture.(2:41) In this yoga there is only that one direction (with no polar opposite).The reasonings of the undecided mind, caught up as it is in duality, areendlessly variegated and ramified.Krishna is not only saying that the path to God is undeviatingly straight, butalso that one should follow only that path in life! For there are many detoursfrom the search for God in religion, also—not to speak of the supreme “detour”of delusion itself. Religious spokesmen hold out pallid explanations for“perfection,” saying that all God really expects of man is that he be good.Heaven is usually offered as bait: a place where people spend eternity in abeautiful, idyllic environment of great natural beauty, surrounded by “angels.”To the sincere spiritual aspirant, little could seem more like hell than to bestuck for all eternity in an ego, even if the body in which one lives is foreverhealthy, supple, youthful, and full of energy.Few people can think in terms longer than a thousand years—the millennium whichChristians have, in fact, held before them as the promise of supernalperfection. Now that we know, through the science of astronomy, that all thestars seen in the sky constitute only the outskirts of a single galaxy, and thatthere are at least a hundred billion galaxies in the physical universe, thatfigure, one thousand, seems paltry indeed! Even so, how many people are able tovisualize even a million years. A billion? A hundred billion? It isinconceivable. Yet divine consciousness is eternal. It is also “centereverywhere, circumference nowhere,” and therefore omnipresent—meaning that it isas consciously present in the largest star as in the smallest “mud ball” of aplanet in the most distant galaxy—indeed, as in the smallest pebble in your ownyard—and, in fact, in just one atom of the countless number of them whichcomprise a speck of dust on that pebble.It is amazing to contemplate how far divine truths have been distorted byso-called religious leaders and spokesmen—priests, imams, rabbis, pundits, andthe numerous dignified holders of religious titles—all over the world. Indeed,only Hinduism (and I say this as one who was, himself, raised in orthodoxChristianity) formally teaches moksha, or liberation from the very ego, in unionwith the Omnipresent, Divine Consciousness. Jesus Christ taught it. Few however,if any, of his self-declared followers believe that when he spoke of heaven hewas referring to that same state of moksha: complete liberation. When Christianpreachers in church on Sundays speak of the parable of the grain of mustardseed, how many of them understand the comparison Jesus Christ drew betweenheaven and that little seed: a comparison which has no perceptible relationshipto the astral heavens they speak about? The heaven Jesus described as resemblinga mustard seed grows from minuscule proportions to the size of a great tree, onwhose branches “the birds of the air come and lodge.” In the next verse, Matthew13:33, he compared the “kingdom of heaven” to the leaven used in making bread,which swells the dough that was first formed. Growth—expansion: He was speakingof expansion into omnipresence. Because most religious teachers offer acompromise of lower spiritual truths, they betray their own religion.Paramhansa Yogananda used to say, “Jesus Christ was crucified once, but histeachings have been crucified every day, throughout Christendom, since thattime.” At first the dilution may have been deliberate, with a view tomaintaining control over the “flock.” Now, the churchmen themselves haveforgotten—if, indeed, they ever knew—that the perfection preached by Jesus wasnot human perfection (veritably a contradiction in terms!). What he said was,“Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.”Judaism seems more preoccupied with following the law of Moses than with thesoul’s eternal salvation, or with finding bliss in God-communion. Do Jews evenbelieve that it is possible to reach heaven after death? Many of them consider,along with the materialistic scientists, that such questions cannot be answeredrationally and therefore should not even be addressed. Suffice it, they say, tolive a good, God-pleasing life here on earth.Buddhists have gone the same route. Because Buddha refrained from speaking ofGod, but rather tried to impress on people’s minds their need to make a personaleffort to purify themselves, his followers soon fell into the fallacy ofatheism. True, God doesn’t really have a human form: He is pure, absoluteBliss—infinite, eternal, and ever-conscious, as Shankaracharya later claimed.Shankara wanted to persuade people that the forms in which they had clothed Godwere purely for their own devotional upliftment: They were not literalrealities. The nirvana of official Buddhism, according to an official documentpublished some years ago in Thailand, is mistakenly explained. That documentclaimed that the bliss of which Shankara spoke lasts only a moment, and isreplaced immediately by eternal nothingness. Could anyone sincerely strive toattain nothingness?! Surely, when the moment arrives for the choice finally tobe faced—whether to embrace a complete void, or to await a later“opportunity”—the ego will pull back in fear, electing rather to be a“bodhisattwa” indefinitely, out of “pure compassion” for mankind. Compassion,maybe, but it seems natural to prefer this compassion to becoming nothing!Self-preservation is the deepest instinct of life. It cannot be, and indeed isnot, founded on a delusion, for if it were, how could delusion itself arise outof total non-awareness? The very idea defies all logic.What about Islam? How can any pious Moslem believe that his soul will go toheaven for killing an “unbeliever”? And what is that “heaven”? Has it ever beendescribed in terms resembling the absolute liberation in omnipresence that ismoksha?If only Hinduism declares this highest spiritual truth, surely it is becauseonly Hinduism has not been confined in the “straitjacket” of a religiousorganization! It has grown naturally, rather, and has not been suffocated in themusty air of official decrees regarding what is, and what is not, the highesttruth.Yogananda was quite caustic on the subject of religious rituals for priestlyprofit. The Gita, he said, warns against the desire even for an astral heaven asthe reward for living a holy life on earth. One who desires any “heaven” shortof oneness with God—the one supreme Source of Absolute Bliss—is in delusion. TheBhagavad Gita teaches the very highest truths, but how many Hindus, even, getthis message? Most of them hope also to reach some limited plane such as Swarga,or Vaikuntha—images, all, of a “paradise” pleasing to the ego.Many people believe the Gita teaches only Karma Yoga—how to be good, do good,and serve one’s fellowman. No uplifting action is bad, of course, but it must bestrictly understood that what Krishna teaches in these passages of the Gita is atruth beyond duality—a truth to which there is no opposite, no possibility of afuture fall, and no limitation in ego-consciousness of any kind, but absolutefreedom in the Infinite Self. Even samadhi must be sought in a spirit of utterrejection of lesser identification with body, ego, family, and earthly or astralsatisfactions. Indeed, to the true yogi the astral heavens themselves are alesser ideal, and something rather to be shunned than sought.Finally, as my Guru wrote, “A chronic wanderer in the path of theology seldomtastes even a sip of the pure, divine water of truth. He craves only newlyflavored, ideational concoctions! This desire for untried novelties merely leadsone into a desert tract of intellectual doubts.” The God-thirsty seeker,Yogananda concludes, busies himself with imbibing the nectar of absolute,infinite bliss.(2:42) O Partha (Arjuna), fixity in the state of samadhi cannot be theirs whocling to personal power and sense-pleasures. Those whose discrimination isblunted by the specious promises of teachers who, ignorant themselves, promiseheaven as man’s highest reward, imagine that nothing higher exists.(2:43) Vedic rituals (and other outward practices) lead not to oneness with God,nor do promises (or the hope) of superior pleasures in the astral world. Allthese lead, rather, to repeated earthly rebirths.(2:44) Those who, incapable of discriminating between right and wrong, seekpersonal power and superior sense-pleasures (whether on earth or in the astralworld after death) by the practice of Vedic rituals, deepen theirego-attachment. They cannot achieve the inner equilibrium that comes throughmeditation, and miss also the (one) true goal of life: union with God.Even those who follow superficial religious practices may make great sacrificesin their quest for ultimate fulfillment, whether earthly or astral. Alas, theymiss the only true goal there is: union with God. Not even the best of karma canbring one to God, for it comes from actions performed with ego-consciousness,with its attachment to the results of action. Those results, because of thatattachment, must return to their source. Good deeds alone cannot win spiritualfreedom, for as long as the ego is involved in doing them—as long, in otherwords, as one thinks, “It was I who did it”—there is bondage. More importanteven than good deeds are the motives behind them.The results of everything one does should be given to God. The doing itselfshould be given to God. Indeed, in the last analysis it is He alone who doeseverything. This is not a counsel to passivity. One should do his best always,but at the same time he should hold the thought—which alone leads toSelf-realization—that a Higher Power lives in him, works through him, and enjoyseverything through him. As Yogananda said, “Pray in this way: ‘I will reason, Iwill will, I will act, but guide Thou my reason, will, and activity to the rightpath in everything.’”Attachment and desires are like radio static: they prevent the clear receptionof the programs one is trying to hear. The mind should be free of such static,which keeps it constantly restless.Reincarnation for any reason other than, as a free soul, to return here to helpothers is a cause for deep regret. Think of the virtually lost years in aperson’s life: infancy, childhood, adolescence, youth—much of which time isusually wasted in merely preparing oneself for another struggle to achievesuccess, to learn a few lessons (how very few, usually!), before one retires,sinks to physical, then perhaps mental, incompetence, and then dies. Spiritualkarma does impel one upward, but environment also exerts a strong influence.Will one’s karma be strongly spiritual enough, under every circumstance, to keepone arrow-straight on the path to God? One cannot be wholly sure. Detours maytake one temporarily off the path! What person in his right mind, once he knowsthat the goal of life is the realization of God, would want to risk a renewal ofignorance in yet another body before good karma reawakens him to theunderstanding that what he really wants in life is God alone? Unless a person isalready highly advanced spiritually, the likelihood of getting caught to such anextent that extrication becomes difficult, even if possible, is simply toogreat. Think of the weeping mothers (life after life!), scolding wives,domineering husbands, wayward children, and outraged neighbors—all of themconspiring to hold one to the wheel of rebirth! Wise is he who, when the chancecomes to seek God, seizes it with both hands.(2:45) The Vedas teach that the universe is a mixture of three basic qualities,or gunas. Your duty, Arjuna, is to free yourself from all three, as well as fromthe dualities of Nature. The way to this achievement is to remain ever calm inthe Self, free from any thought of either acceptance or possession.Between the opposites of duality there is a middle state, which both divides andunites them. Every ocean wave has a crest, a base, and a middle part. Thatmiddle part separates even as it unites. Large waves produce towering crests:Such are the egotists of this world, boasting of their prowess, striving toout-do all others, and combatting one another in fierce competition.During a great storm, the ocean surface is greatly agitated and knows no peace.The waves not only rise high: They crash against one another as if each onewanted to beat down the waves around it. In life, too, large egos know no peace.The farther they try to distance their egos from the calm ocean depths,emphasizing their individuality, their likes and dislikes, their ambitions, andtheir zeal for victory, the more restless and agitated they become in theirhearts.Even the tallest wave, however, has its base in the vast ocean. Every humanbeing, similarly, is fundamentally part of God, and is therefore, in essence,divine. God dwells in every ego, though many try to avoid any reminder of Hisinner presence by affirming their own importance. Thus, the part that is closestto the ocean is covered over and unobserved, as people’s egos tower high andsend energy out eagerly through the senses in the search for pleasure,excitement, power, and dominion over others.The part closest to the ocean represents sattwa guna—that quality which mostclearly suggests the ocean’s calm depths. For any protrusion to exist on theocean, however, there must always be those three portions of the wave: thelowest part, which is closest to the ocean; the middle part, which rises ineagerness for self-definition; and the highest part, or crest, which acts asthough it wanted to affirm its independence from the ocean altogether. In thehumblest saint there cannot but still exist all three parts to his wave ofmanifestation, for everything in manifestation is a composite of the threegunas, or qualities: sattwa, rajas, and tamas.Tamas, or tamoguna, is that part of the wave of manifestation which projectsfarthest from its basic reality, and which most obscures the very existence ofthat reality. In this sense, spiritually darkened souls, blinded by egotism,possess what they think of as an entirely separate reality of their own.Rajas, or rajoguna, represents the main portion of the wave: the central part,which gives substance to the wave and supports the towering arrogance suggestedby the crest. The farther a person projects his consciousness away from hissource in God, preening his ego and inflating it, as if like a balloon, thefarther he divorces himself from his true source of power. Egotists usuallyproduce a great deal of “sound and fury,” but in their very pride they cutthemselves off from their inner strength, narrowing it down to a littlecrest—which often becomes a mere whitecap—and thereby grows weak. We all haveheard the saying, “Pride goes before a fall.” As a wave projected too far fromits base loses supportive power, it crashes. Tamoguna is dullness and inertia: aconsequence of the spent force of ego.This image is not perfect; no image can be. There are also, for example, egosthat are not so much projected outward from the ocean bosom by pride as simplytoo dull to perceive any reality deeper than the ego. Their waves, therefore,may be sluggish rather than over-exuberant. Such might be the case, for example,on the ocean surface after an oil spill. Nevertheless, the reality of their vastsource is least apparent at the top of the wave, and most obvious at its base.The strength of a wave to rise comes from its central portion: from theagitation produced by the wind, and from the inner, upward push of the water.Rajoguna is active, restless, ambitious, “pushy.” It is that which, thrustingitself upward toward ego-affirmation, ends in the dwindling power of a wavecrest falling, or the rounded but still greatest separation from its source. Inall cases, the crest of a wave represents tamoguna.Sattwa guna is, as we’ve seen, that part of the wave which provides its base—notthat power which surges upward, but rather that one which hugs the ocean, knowswhence it derives its power, and, if the wave is only a low swell, seems hardlyseparate from the ocean at all. Saintly people may be described as little waves,or even ripples; they are ever conscious of being close to God. Even they,however, to the extent that they retain individual awareness, manifest all thethree gunas, even though their principal manifestation is sattwa guna. That partof their nature which is farthest from God represents their insignificantmeasure of tamoguna. For even saints must manifest tamoguna to some extent. Ifthey didn’t, they would not be able to be manifested at all. They may do so, forinstance, when they sleep, or when they rest idly. The degree of “tamas” theymanifest might even be considered sattwic in some people, for all creationexpresses the directional relativity of appearing closest, farther, and farthestfrom the Source.Rajoguna is the middle ground. Thus, also the duality of Nature is implied inthe universal blend of the three gunas.Arjuna was urged to rise above identification with the three gunas, andtherefore also with the oppositional states of duality. Krishna told him toseparate himself from outward identity by attaining absolute calmness within.Inner detachment involves laying to rest the ego’s urge to keep on definingitself as a separate, individual reality.Ego-consciousness is the inner urge to push the wave of one’s individuality everupward, hoping finally to tower above other waves. Again, no image can beperfect. In the case of the ocean, it is the wind, primarily, which raises waveson the ocean surface. In the case of the ego it is the “wind” of delusion, whichin a sense sweeps over the world, confusing people as to the essential nature ofreality. The power of delusion, however, comes primarily from within eachperson, not from outside him. It is inner delusion which causes him to err inhis response to outer circumstances.The primary need on the path to wisdom is to overcome the ego’s urge to declareoutwardly, and affirm inwardly, its own, separate individuality. Later on in theGita Krishna proposes important ways by which this urge can be diminished, andthen overcome. All of these ways, he suggests here also, require one to seek hisanswers primarily within himself. Scripture itself is no substitute forself-effort.(2:46) To the knower of Brahman (the Supreme Spirit) the Vedas are of no moreuse than a well when the land all around is in flood.There is a story from the life of St. Francis of Assisi, in Italy. An old,nearly blind beggarwoman asked him for alms. She couldn’t see that he wasdressed as poorly as herself, and unlikely to have anything to share with her.It distressed him, however, that he had nothing to give her. And then herealized that he still had one thing in his possession: his well-thumbed copy ofthe Holy Bible. This he gave her in the hope that she might be able to sell itfor a few coins.He then prayed almost apologetically, “Lord, to help this poor old woman I haveeven given away Your word!”A voice within him replied, “Francis, I have planted My word in your heart. Youhave no need for that merely printed copy of it.”Whether it be the Vedas, the Gita, the Bible, or any other great scripture, theimportant thing is that God’s truth be written on the pages of one’s own heart.For of course Krishna is speaking here not only of the Vedas, but of truescripture generally. His reference to the Vedas, however, provides anopportunity for writing about them specifically without breaking the flow in thecommentary, by including the thoughts Yogananda expressed about them.The Vedas are unique among the world’s scriptures, in that they were composed ina high age when there was not the division that exists today between religionand daily existence. The people then had no need for separate places or times ofworship. All life to them was, in a sense, worship, and every act an offering toGod. As people’s understanding declined in a descending age, it became necessaryto write down in words the truths people had been able to memorize effortlessly.At that time an explanation for the gunas, for the duality inherent in allthings, and for how everything came into existence became necessary.In the descending age it was seen to be necessary also to offer people religiouspractices that would help them satisfy their increasingly worldly andego-affirming needs: rituals that would enable them to gain what they wanted interms of power, mates, children, and success. Although people’s consciousnesswas diminishing in clarity, there was still a spiritual bias in everything theydid. Rituals were therefore created that would enable human beings to work incooperation with the devas, or astral beings of higher (angelic) nature, as wellas with lower sorts to accomplish their ends.Today, mankind has all but forgotten those higher, or at any rate subtler,entities, which otherwise would help man in the production of food, of goodweather, of energies for success, and of countless other benefits. More awarepeople, living in tune with Nature, seek their help as a matter of course.People scoff at nature spirits such as fairies, but, as Swami Sri Yukteswar isquoted in Autobiography of a Yogi as saying, they actually exist. Man’sindifference to them has been causing those energies gradually to withdraw fromour planet. This is a natural consequence of the fact of those beings findingthemselves ignored. Scientists have actually said that there is less energy intoday’s food than there was a century ago. People who try to boost theirproduction by chemical means don’t understand that life depends on the lifeforce, and not on that which is lifeless.The astral entities, in past ages, were objects of worship. An attitude of aweis unnecessary; it is quite enough to give them appreciation—even love, as oneought indeed to love all God’s creatures as His outward manifestations. Toworship them, however—as began to happen during the declining ages when humanunderstanding weakened—is to enter, bit by bit, into the merchant consciousnessthat says, “I’ll give you what you want provided you give me something inreturn.”Thus, the nature spirits, not themselves without ego, enjoy the special,worshipful attention they get from people who look to them for particularfavors.Krishna, during the time when he taught the Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna, needed toaddress also this defect in popular consciousness. Buddha, who lived possiblysome two centuries later, warned people even more strongly against dependence onVedic rituals as alternatives to self-purification.Krishna is saying in this stanza, essentially, not to propitiate the lesser“gods” of natural forces, whose attitude is still “quid pro quo” in the sense ofwanting some sort of ego-payment for favors rendered. The Lord is no merchant!Those who sincerely want Him ask for nothing in return, but pray selflessly onlyfor His love.What Krishna is saying, then, is, “Seek the direct experience of God. Don’t besatisfied with anything less.”As Jesus Christ said also, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and Hisrighteousness, and all these other things shall be added unto you.”It is the true seeker whom Sri Krishna addresses in this passage, as indeed inmost of this great scripture. Those who seek lesser favors from God are askingfor a teaspoon of soil when they might have the whole kingdom.The problem in people’s minds is, of course, that they think to possess. WhatKrishna is asking of them is that they become. The ego alone can own things—atleast in imagination! The soul becomes one with God and, in that oneness,“possesses” the whole universe.A great woman saint in India was once asked to visit another country. “Whyshould I travel there?” she replied. “I am there already!”(2:47) Action (in this realm of vibration) is a duty, but let not your ego cravethe fruits of action. Be not attached to either action or inaction.Be like a divine lark, which enjoys singing without trying to impress or to gainanything from anyone. Those who act with ego-motivation become caught in the webof maya. The universe was brought into existence through the power of CosmicVibration, the great sound of AUM. So long as one lives in the realm ofmanifestation, and is not merged in Spirit, he cannot avoid acting altogether.The important thing is to act rightly.To attain God-consciousness, it is necessary to release all attachment tothoughts of “I” and “mine.” The infinite consciousness appears finite in theego, as in the atom. That is merely an appearance, however. The atom cannot helpwhirling in its own minuscule reality, but the ego, being conscious, can aspireto be released from all vibratory manifestation. As Patanjali wrote, “Yogaschitta vritti nirodha: Yoga is the neutralization of the (whirling) eddies offeeling.” The spiritual duty of every ego is to stop the movement it generatesby releasing itself from such “whirling” thoughts as, “Everything I do is for myown personal benefit!” Bondage to delusion consists of nothing but the constantreference of everything one does (and thinks, and enjoys, and suffers) back toone’s own self. Not only action, but all one’s enjoyments in this world—indeed,also one’s sufferings—are tainted by the simple thought: “I am the doer. I amthe enjoyer, and I am the sufferer”—and then the outraged demand: “But why am Ithe sufferer?”The solution is not to refrain from acting. Some people—many hermits, forexample—think to develop spiritually by refraining from all action. That idea isa delusion. As long as one must breathe, think, and move, he cannot rightlyclaim to be inactive. The yogi who sits breathless and motionless in samadhi isa different case. To go beyond action you must merge your consciousness in theCosmic Sound of AUM, allowing it to act through you and around you until youmerge in that infinite vibration, and then pass beyond vibration itself into thecalm consciousness of the Supreme Spirit. As long, however, as you are consciousof having a body, you will only be deceiving yourself if you try to achieve theactionless state by not acting. All you will become, in time, is lazy anddull-minded!To reach God, one must first learn to act without selfish motive: for God, notfor personal reward. Indeed, it is necessary to be intensely active for God ifone would develop that intense awareness which alone lifts one tosuperconsciousness. Lazy people will not find God!In everything you do, feel that God is acting through you. Wash your body, feedit, give it rest—do everything needful to maintain the body in good health andglowing with energy—but always tell yourself, “It is God I am serving throughthis physical instrument.” The very enjoyment of good food, beautiful scenery,and the good things of life can be offered up to God. Share those enjoymentswith Him, rather than depriving yourself of them. What need to be released arethe thoughts, “I am doing, I am enjoying,” and even the delusive consciousness,“It is I who am suffering.”Even in meditation, it is important not to meditate with desire for the results.To eliminate the strain and tension of trying to concentrate, release also thethought, “I am meditating.” Think, rather, “The Cosmic Vibration is reaffirmingits own reality, through me. Cosmic love, through me, is yearning for God’slove. Cosmic joy, through me, is rejoicing in our Infinite Beloved.”(2:48) O Dhananjaya (Arjuna), immerse yourself in the thought of yoga (unionwith God), inwardly non-attached and even-minded in both success and failure.Perfect evenness of mind and feeling is itself the definition of yoga.The only way to achieve the perfection here described is by meditation.Affirmations of calmness in the midst of stress often have the contrary effectof creating more tension! In any case, calmness can be affirmed effectively onlywith inner calmness. Such calmness can hardly be established without alsostilling the thoughts in meditation.(2:49) Action performed with desire for the fruits is greatly inferior to actionguided by wisdom. Therefore, O Dhananjaya, seek in everything to be guided bywisdom. Misery attends actions performed for their fruits.(2:50) One who lives united to cosmic wisdom passes beyond the effects of bothvirtue and vice even while living in this body. Therefore devote yourself,through wisdom, to achieving the oneness of yoga. Such alone is right action.(2:51) Those who have mastered their thoughts escape the confines of the mindand become engrossed in cosmic wisdom. They (realizing the illusory nature ofego) become freed from the chains of rebirth, and attain that state whichtranscends all suffering.Sorrow was not deliberately a part of God’s plan. Inherent in the plan was thatactions performed in contradiction to it would cause pain. This was animpersonal necessity, for if the heat of a stove, for instance, did not burn uswhen we touched it, we would have no protection against possible damage to thebody. Our pain is also our protection, and is not a sign that God wants us tosuffer.Legend has it that when God first manifested the universe He made it perfect.Men and women, realizing the need for living in perfection, sat in meditationand soon merged back into Brahman.One or more similar attempts were made, all of them with the same result. God atlast decided, “I must impose delusion on mankind. People must struggle, advanceby trial and error, and discover that kind of action, and that attitude, whichwill lead them to bliss and freedom.” Thus it is that we find ourselves in thislabyrinth. Scriptures like the Bhagavad Gita were written to lead man out ofmaya’s labyrinthine ways into the free “air” of communion with the InfiniteSource of all Bliss.(2:52) When your perception pierces the dark mists of delusion, you will becomeindifferent to everything you have heard about this world and the next.You will, in other words, have become firmly established in the perception oftruth.(2:53) When your discrimination is no longer tossed about by opinions, butabides unshaken in soul-bliss, then you will attain final union with God.(2:54) Arjuna said: “O Keshava (Krishna), what are the signs of one who hasattained calm wisdom and is established in union with God? How does he speak,sit, walk?”The question Arjuna asks is a natural one for those who are not yet enlightenedto ask: How does the man of God behave? Can his saintliness be discerned fromhis way of speaking, of sitting, of walking? Are there other ways (Arjunaimplies) in which such a person differs from ordinary people?Krishna’s answer, as we shall see, refers to the cause of saintly behavior,rather than to its effects. A divine person is not essentially different fromanyone else. It is his inner consciousness which creates whateverdissimilarities there are.The yogi (since Krishna doesn’t answer this question directly, though the factsmay well be of interest to many people) reveals a joyful magnetism in the verytone of his voice. In my Guru’s case, whether he scolded or encouraged, lecturedto a crowd (sometimes in thundering tones) or spoke quietly with small groups,there was always vibrant in his tone of voice a quality of calm bliss andwisdom.The yogi sits straight, as my Guru always did, allowing the energy to movefreely in the spine. When he walks, he walks calmly, not restlessly or withjerky movements. His walk reveals a consciousness of living centered in thespine.(2:55) O Partha (Arjuna), one who has put away all desires, being whollycontented in the Self, may be considered settled in wisdom.His very movements and gestures, in other words, reveal the inwardness of hisstate of consciousness. His voice vibrates with calm wisdom. His posture iscalm, not restless, and demonstrates perfect contentment. His walk is relaxedand serene.One day Yogananda, as a young man teaching the principles of yoga in America,was late for a lecture he was to give and set off at a run to make theappointment as soon as possible. Someone cautioned him, “Don’t be nervous!”“One can run nervously,” the Master replied, “or one can run calmly, but not torun when one needs to is to be lazy!”(2:56) He whose consciousness is unshaken by affliction and is not excited bygood fortune; who no longer hungers for earthly affection and is without fearand anger: such a man qualifies to be considered a muni of steadydiscrimination.Muni means one who has dissolved his ego-consciousness in God. He has withdrawnhis consciousness from the distorted testimony of the senses.Fear is born of the thought of failure when one is attached to success. Anger isborn of frustrated desire. The muni is beyond all ego-centered emotions.(2:57) He who, under all circumstances, is without attachment, and is neitherelated by goodness nor depressed by evil, is a man of established wisdom.As the swan’s body gliding over water is untouched by the wetness, so the man ofwisdom glides unaffected over the waters of life.Paramhansa Yogananda often used the analogy of the movies, pointing out how theycreate an illusion of reality by simply mixing shadows and light—and, morerecently, by adding colors—all of which are only projections of the one lightshining from the projector. An enlightened sage is unaffected inwardly by the“movie” of life. This doesn’t mean he is heartless or indifferent. Hisimpersonality derives from not desiring anything for himself. Otherwise, becausehis perception of everything and everyone is from within, he feels keen sympathyfor all, and rejoices for their sake in their good, and grieves with them intheir sorrow. He also grieves for their evil, and for what it will do to them.His only desire—if, out of compassion, he still has any desire—is to help othersto know God.(2:58) When the yogi, like a tortoise withdrawing its head and limbs into itsshell, is able to withdraw his energy from the objects of sense-perception, hebe-comes established in wisdom.Control of what Yogananda used to call the “sense telephones” is essential fordeep meditation. Sense control by withdrawal of the energy is the true meaningof pranayama: “yama (control) of the prana (energy).” Pranayama is a condition,not a technique. The practice of pranayama is to achieve energy control.This stanza offers one proof out of many that the Bhagavad Gita, while embracingall paths to God, places special emphasis on Raja Yoga in that it teaches how toachieve the goal, union with God, and doesn’t merely say, “Seek God.” Prana isoften equated with the breath, and pranayama, with breathing exercises. In fact,there is an intimate connection between the breath and the flow of energy in thebody. Paramhansa Yogananda often said, “Breathlessness is deathlessness.” Yogicbreathing exercises have the purpose of enabling the practitioner to rise abovethe body’s normal need for breath.Breathlessness is not kumbhaka in the sense of forcibly retaining the breath.Rather, true kumbhaka comes when the body no longer requires air for itsmaintenance. The purpose of respiration is to expel carbon dioxide from thelungs, and to take in oxygen. In pranayama exercises, the breath is used toproduce a state of equilibrium in the body, in which state the physical activityof breathing is no longer required to maintain it in a condition of equilibrium.When one rises above the need to breathe, the heart pump also slows down, thenstops altogether.There is a subtle connection, through the medulla oblongata, between the breathand the heartbeat. When breathing becomes unnecessary, the heartbeat, as justindicated, slows down and then stops. Between these two phenomena—the breath andheartbeat, on the one hand—and sensory awareness, on the other, there is a closeconnection.The energy in the senses, as in the whole body, relaxes and withdraws—ashappens, indeed, to a lesser degree in sleep. A sleeper may be called—he mayeven be shaken—before he is even aware of being wanted. This diminishedinvolvement with objective reality occurs because, during sleep, the energy ispartially withdrawn from the body and from the “sense-telephones”—even as thetortoise withdraws its head and limbs into its shell.It is only when the “sense telephones” have been “switched off” that the mindcan become wholly absorbed in the inner world of meditation. The energy in themotor nerves, too, must be withdrawn, as happens naturally when the senses arestilled.The center of the body’s energy is in the spine. In deep meditation, that energymust be relaxed from the surface of the body, as we saw earlier, and withdrawnup the spine through the chakras to the brain. The normal outward flow ofenergy, as it works to sustain the body, must be reversed to flow upward.It may be helpful at this point to pause briefly and consider the relationbetween breath and the flow of energy in the spine. First, where the spine isconcerned, come the two superficial nerves known as the ida and pingala, whichare located, respectively, on the left and right sides of the spine. Fish eaterswill be familiar with the two nerves that run the full length on either side ofthe spine of a fish. The energy flowing in these superficial nerves is connectedwith the reactive process of the emotions, which, in turn, is connected with thebreath. The upward flow of energy in the astral spine, through what is calledthe ida nadi (nerve channel), in the astral body, is the cause of inhalation. Adownward flow through the pingala nadi is the subtle cause of exhalation. It isthis flow of energy in the astral spine that results in the physical breath.Otherwise, there would be no physical compulsion to breathe; one wouldn’t knowwhat to do about the body’s need to expel carbon dioxide and bring inrevivifying oxygen.Causing the inhalation, then, is the upward energy-flow. This upward flow in thesuperficial spine is reminiscent of the deeper flow upward, in deep meditation,toward spiritual enlightenment. The upward flow through ida, therefore,accompanies any positive emotional reaction. Thus, with a positive reaction ofany kind—joyful, hopeful, triumphant—to some outward stimulus, the energy flowsautomatically upward in the spine, causing the lungs to inhale.When, by contrast, one’s reaction is negative—pained, sorrowful, despairing—theenergy automatically flows downward through pingala, and exhalation ensues.Thus, when, for whatever reason, one reacts with emotional delight to anystimulus—physically, emotionally, or mentally—he automatically inhales. Andwhen, on the contrary, one reacts negatively, he exhales. That is why, when wefeel emotionally pleased, we automatically inhale deeply, and when we feeldisappointed, we automatically sigh.Obviously, the breathing process is not invariably accompanied by positive andnegative emotional reactions. It would be ridiculous to smile and frownalternately every time one inhaled and exhaled! The consciousness restsordinarily in one or more of the spinal chakras. Worldly people—those, that isto say, whose interest is primarily in sense-enjoyments, and particularly in thethought of sensual pleasure—have their consciousness centered in one or more ofthe three lower chakras—especially in the two lowest ones. Spiritually mindedpersons, on the other hand—especially those with devotional natures—feel theirconsciousness centered in the anahata chakra, or heart center.Even when one is centered in the anahata, one must be careful, if he is aspiritual aspirant. He must try to keep his energy flowing upward from the heartto the spiritual eye. Unless he is careful, his energy—suddenly attracted bysome wakened desire (however unexpected)—may rush downward again suddenly fromthe heart into the lower chakras. The energy must be continually drawn upward bythe magnetism emanating from the Kutastha, where the spiritual eye is beheld,lest it descend inadvertently in response to some worldly stimulus.In the Srimad Bhagavatam, a scripture which also was written by Beda Byasa (theauthor of the Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita), the counsel is given tovisualize the heart as a lotus, the petals of which must be turned up toward thebrain.The best point on which to keep focused is in the spiritual eye at the pointbetween the eyebrows. The center of the ego is the agya chakra in the medullaoblongata; hence, the advice is also given to center one’s mind there (itsnatural position), and from that point to gaze forward, so to speak, at thespiritual eye.Life begins its involvement with the objective world with the baby’s first cry,or, rather, with the first quick breath required to make that first cry. Thisfirst breath starts the reactive process, and therefore begins the baby’sinvolvement in the objective world. This moment is crucial to the baby’s earthlyexistence. The moment of its first cry, therefore, is the point from which thehoroscope for the baby should be computed.At death, by contrast, there is what is known as the “death rattle”: the finalexhalation which occurs as energy enters the pingala nadi, and the ego’s energyflows inward more deeply, and back to the medulla. Thus it prepares for itsdeparture from the body, exiting through the same “doorway” by which it firstentered when the sperm and ovum united to create the body.The spiritually advanced yogi’s energy enters the deep spine on exhalation, andflows up through the sushumna to the spiritual eye in the forehead. TheKutastha, where the spiritual eye appears, is the positive pole, of which themedulla oblongata is the negative. Yogis, and saints in other religions who areable to exit the body through the spiritual eye, need not pass through what theancient Greeks, as we said earlier, called the “waters of Lethe.” In otherwords, yogis do not sink back temporarily, as ordinary human egos do, intosubconscious rest, but soar out into superconsciousness.The yogi learns to withdraw his attention from the reactive process: first ofall by calming the feelings in the heart, which initiate the reactive process.One then detaches his feelings from the ups and downs of reactive energy in thespine: from the subjective influence of success and failure, fulfillment anddisappointment, attraction and repulsion, love and hatred, pleasure and pain,joy and sorrow, triumph and despair. It is helpful, when trying to developemotional detachment, to concentrate one’s energy in the spine, and there toequalize the upward and downward flows of energy, which produce emotionalreactions and are inextricably united to those reactions as long as the heart’sfeelings remain restless.Finally, the yogi withdraws his energy into the deep spine, the sushumna. Withthis withdrawal he awakens Kundalini, which, being magnetized to flow upward,now begins its slow ascent through the deep spine toward enlightenment.Beginning yogis should try to become conscious of the connection between theirreactive emotions, both positive and negative, and the corresponding upward anddownward flow of energy in the ida and pingala nadis. This practice ofcenteredness in the spine will minimize their preoccupation with whatever occursoutwardly in their lives, and with what has already occurred in the past. Thepractice will focus their attention on the simple movement of energy in thespine. Thus, where most people’s first thought is, “How wonderful!” or, “Howdreadful!” the yogi, even if he is a beginner in yoga practices, finds itrelatively easy to cease from defining outer occurrences as either good or bad.If, for example, one is sitting in a dentist’s chair having work done that mostpeople might find quite painful, he should concentrate at the Kutastha—or, if heis conscious of feeling any emotional reaction, concentrate on the energy-flowin the spine. First, calm the heart’s feelings. Then, breathe in the spine withdeep, slow inhalation and exhalation—silently, so as not to disturb the poordentist!—bringing the energy upward and downward, and seeing that flow as thecause of any emotional reactions one might feel.Again, when anything or anyone threatens you in any way—not only physically, butby speaking angrily or, perhaps, insulting or accusing you—center yourself inthe spine. At that center you will become confident that nothing can touch you.As Yogananda said, “You must be able to stand unshaken amidst the crash ofbreaking worlds!” The above practice will help to ready you for facing anycircumstance in life.(2:59) The man who (merely) abstains from sense enjoyments may forget them for atime, but the taste for them will linger. That person, however, who beholds theSupreme Spirit loses the taste for anything but the Infinite.An example Paramhansa Yogananda often used was a person who is accustomed tostale cheese and has acquired a liking for it. If he is given good, fresh cheeseto taste, however, he automatically abandons the liking he had for stale cheese.(2:60) O Son of Kunti (the power of dispassion), Arjuna, even the wise man,devoted to self-control, may sometimes be swept away by the turbulent senses.No devotee should underestimate the formidable power of subconscious tendencies.Their tentacles are farther reaching than anything the conscious mind canperceive or even imagine.Paramhansa Yogananda warned that as long as ego-consciousness persists, oneshould not consider himself safe from delusion. “Remember, you will not be safeuntil you reach nirbikalpa samadhi.” Even in the lower samadhi stage known assabikalpa, the ego must return from its infinitely expanded consciousness tooutward awareness. One who reaches sabikalpa samadhi, therefore, can still fall.My Guru told me of more than one case in which this had happened. “Sadhu,beware!” the great master Sri Ramakrishna once warned a disciple, whosubsequently did fall from the spiritual path.The thing to watch out for is the slightest flicker of excitement in the heart,in the contemplation of any aspect of delusion. That little stir of energyshould be seen as the first warning signal. The slightest stirring in the heartshould be a sign to the aspiring yogi to withdraw immediately from even thethought of delusion.Maya is very subtle. Never try to “tough it out.” You cannot by any means besure you’ll win—if only because the very discrimination with which you think todo battle is already infected by the disease of maya.(2:61) He who, having subjugated his senses, becomes united with Me remainsengrossed in the infinite Self, knowing it as the Supremely Relishable. Onlymastery of the senses can bestow the steadfastness of true wisdom.There are two requirements, above all, for the attainment of wisdom. One, towithdraw the mind not only from sense objects, but from the senses themselves;and, two, to remain merged in the consciousness of God as the most desirable ofall goals.Yogis who seek only to control their bodies and physical senses, and those alsowho seek only the abstraction of divine union without proper physical and mentaldiscipline, can never achieve true fixity of purpose. Uprooting the weeds ofego-gratification, on the one hand, to their last tendril, and, on the other,becoming lovingly absorbed in the Infinite: Both of these are essential.Many yogis seek ego-gratification not only through sensory pleasures, but in thedevelopment of spiritual powers. Many others (again) seek the ego-gratifyingabstraction of intellectual wisdom. The true yogi seeks only to unite his soulwith the Divine Beloved.(2:62,63) Dwelling mentally on sense objects breeds attachment to them. Fromattachment arises craving. From craving (when frustrated) springs anger. Angerproduces delusion. Delusion causes forgetfulness (of the Self). Loss of memory(as to what one is, in truth) causes decay of the power of discrimination. Fromloss of discrimination ensues the annihilation of all right understanding.Every step in this descent has a single linchpin: the ego. To rise again towardwisdom, the deluded ego must reach the point where it realizes that what it hasunderstood of life so far has brought it nothing but pain. Its first question,then, must be, “Do I like suffering?” (No, obviously!) Next it should ask, “Whatincreases suffering, and what, on the other hand, lessens it?” The answer isthat suffering diminishes when there is a decrease of self-interest. Thediscernment of this truth leads to the first faint stirrings of recollectionthat a reality exists that is more than the ego and the body. The fog ofdelusion begins to lift from the mind, and one no longer strikes out at theworld in anger for not giving him what he wants. From acceptance of what iscomes a gradual decrease of worldly attachment. From lessened attachment comeslessening interest in the objects of the senses, and an increase of longing fortrue wisdom—a longing which awakens devotion in the heart, love of truth, andintense aspiration to know true and everlasting bliss.(2:64) The man of perfect self-control is able to act in this world unaffectedby it. Inwardly free from attraction and repulsion, he has attained unshakableinner calmness.That state, as we have seen from what Yogananda said above, comes only whenone’s consciousness has passed beyond conditioned (sabikalpa) to unconditioned(nirbikalpa) samadhi, when one’s consciousness has become so established inoneness with God that there is no possibility of a return to outwardness and thelimitations of the ego.(2:65) With the attainment of soul bliss, every vestige of sorrow disappears.Bliss gives perfect discrimination, and soon establishes one’s consciousnessfirmly (in the Self).(2:66) Those with unsettled consciousness have no discrimination. Those who areunmeditative cannot know peace. And for those who lack peace, how is happinesspossible?(2:67) As a boat moving on water may be swept off its course by a gale, sodiscrimination may be swept from its path by the vagaries of sensory influence.The words to a favorite chant of Paramhansa Yogananda’s go as follows:I have made Thee polestar of my life.Though my sea is dark and my stars are gone,Still I see the path through Thy mercy.The spiritual seeker may, on occasion, find himself swept off his upward courseby outward temptations—not only sensory pleasures, but a desire for the lesstangible temptations maya offers to the individual to feed hisego-consciousness: name, fame, power, self-importance, and a host of otherego-boosting delusions. Instead of agitating himself with feelings of guilt andwith self-accusation (which can only increase his susceptibility to delusion),he should return calmly to his pre-established course.Mistakes on the path are always possible. The devotee should acknowledge themsincerely and openly (at least to himself), and then simply forsake them. Heshould avoid the further mistake of becoming upset with himself. He should keephis mind focused steadfastly on the polestar of his true goal: union with God.Since the ego is a delusion, anything that tempts it to affirm its own separatereality is a delusion also. And so too, indeed, is any distress one may feelwith oneself for having succumbed to delusion.When a rock is dropped into a pond, waves are formed. Similarly, when anythingoccurs in one’s life to cause an emotional reaction, waves of feeling appear. Asthose waves created by the rock flow outward to the bank and then return, theyonly gradually subside to calmness again. Even so, one’s reactions to anythingoutward may flow back and forth, compounding the mistake made by reacting in thefirst place.One should make it a practice, indeed, to separate himself mentally fromidentification with anything—even with thoughts—and to return to theaffirmation, “God alone is the Doer.” By thus dissociating oneself from anyerror the ego commits, the tendency to err will gradually subside, the gale willcease to blow, and the mind will become calmly centered and focused on itsdivine goal once again.Otherwise, what can happen when one errs spiritually is that, byego-identification with the error, one may wander for further incarnations,straying into other dead ends, and struggling all the while to find his way backto the true course on which he once embarked.(2:68) Therefore, O Mighty-armed (Arjuna), withdraw your sense-faculties (thepower to see, hear, etc.) from the senses themselves, and from sense-objects.Thus will your wisdom become firmly established.(2:69) That which is night for the unenlightened is day for the yogi. And thatwhich is day for ordinary people is night for the yogi-seer (who perceives theinner reality).This passage contains more than one meaning. Superficially it recommendsmeditating at night, when the minds of worldly people are stilled in sleep, whenthe sounds they make during daily activity no longer fill the air, and when theyogi finds it easier to achieve inner calmness. Thus, the time when worldlypeople bestir themselves once again is when the yogi may find it more convenientto get his few hours of sleep.On a deeper level, what seems real to the worldly person, living as he does inthe conscious mind, is seen to be unreal at a superconscious level. The eageractivity of the worldly person holds no interest for the man of wisdom. Evenwhen the wise person, in order to sustain his existence, engages in outwardactivity and is thus, in a sense, in the world, he is not of it, for the worldno longer defines his reality.(2:70) Contentment is his who, like the ocean, calmly absorbs into himself allthe rivers of desire. One (on the contrary) whose desires trickle outward (as iffrom a pond) is soon drained (of energy).Generous desires—for example, to bring joy to others—do not drain your reservoirof peace, but add to it by the joy they awaken inwardly.Whenever you feel pleasure, let it remind you of soul-bliss. Whenever you seebeauty, take into yourself the joy you feel in it. Let every worldly happinessremind you of the much greater happiness of the Self.Some yogis recommend complete indifference to the world. What a dry outlook! Farbetter is it, my Guru taught, to enjoy with God the beauties and the puredelights of this world, by focusing on the inner joy you feel during experiencesthat uplift the heart’s feelings. Raise those feelings toward God, rather thansuppressing them with dry, intellectually “inspired” apathy. In this way, too,one can absorb into himself, instead of leaking outward, whatever joys andpleasures the world gives him.(2:71) That person knows peace who, relinquishing all (energy-draining) desires,and fully satisfied with his state of desirelessness, no longer sees himself asa separate, individual ego.The ego lies at the root of all delusions. Producing the plant of materialdesire, it is like a noxious weed, choking and killing the more wholesome plantsof devotion, self-control, kindness, and other uplifting soul-qualities. Whenone is fully satisfied in the Self, desireless and free from every attachment,one no longer sees himself as a separate wave on the ocean of Spirit, butrealizes his true Self to be infinite and therefore one with the ocean.(2:72) O Partha (Arjuna), this state is known as Brahmisthiti: absolute onenesswith the Infinite. Anyone who achieves this state will never again fall intodelusion. Even at the moment of death, if one concentrates whole-heartedly onthis state, he attains perfect, eternal Bliss.Dr. M. W. Lewis, Paramhansa Yogananda’s first Kriya Yoga disciple in America,once asked the Master, “Can you resolve a dilemma for me? Is liberation a stateone achieves only for this Day of Brahma? Will we, when Brahman manifests itselfagain in creation, be obliged to emerge from that oneness once more and gothrough the whole, long struggle again?”“Never fear!” the Master replied. “Once the soul has achieved final freedom inSpirit, it is free forever.”Such is the aim of the Bhagavad Gita: to help the sincere seeker to find the wayto perfect union with Satchidananda: ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-newBliss.Thus ends the second chapter, called “Shankhya Yoga,” of the Upanishad of theholy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna discussingyoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter ThirteenWHY FIGHT?(3:1) Arjuna said: “O Janardana (Krishna, the Divine Liberator), if (as itseems) You consider understanding superior to action, why, O Keshava, have Youbeen urging me to this terrible action?(3:2) “This apparent contradiction confuses me. Please tell me clearly: Whichpath will help me toward the highest good?”Arjuna is speaking on behalf of “Sadhu Everyman,” and playing the part of“Devil’s Advocate.” Calling Krishna his guru and “Divine Liberator,” he says, “OJanardana, I am torn between the two duties You’ve given me. On the one hand,You tell me to become absorbed in the stillness of Spirit. On the other hand,You say I must fight against my natural foes—my evil tendencies—both for my owngood and for the benefit of others. Why can’t I simply rest calmly and joyfullyin the Supreme Self—as you’ve also enjoined?”Unfortunately, what is “natural” for the ego is far from natural for the Self,or soul. Spiritual progress is achieved not by the tense effort demanded formaterial success, but rather by a process of upward relaxation. Spiritualprogress may be compared to a rising helium balloon: its ascent is natural, andcan be prevented only by ropes or by heavy ballast. Devotion and divineaspiration lift the consciousness toward its source in God. Worldly desires andattachments, and the habit of directing one’s energy-flow outward, are the ropesand ballast that resist the upwardness of soul inspiration. Effort on thespiritual path may be compared to cutting the ropes which hold the balloon, andpushing ballast out of the basket underneath.It seems contradictory to say that effort should be required at all, since theidea is to attain effortlessness! In fact, however, the divine state can beattained only by serious application, which is a kind of effort. Interestinglyhowever, that effort also implies relaxation upward with the energy-flow in thespine, which rises by a natural buoyancy toward the brain, and—were it not forworldly samskars (ballast)—would take one ever deeper into meditation. Becauseworldly achievements generally require stressful effort, many people, when theytake up the practice of meditation, try “hard” also to reach inner calmness. Infact, the key to right meditation is relaxation—physically, emotionally, andmentally. The energy is drawn up the spine in response to another kind of“gravity”: the upward pull of Spirit, which one feels first in the heart, andthen at the Kutastha between the eyebrows, the seat of the spiritual eye. Thisis the pull of divine love. Its upward pull requires effort on the devotee’spart only in the beginning, to release it from the downward pull, or “ballast,”of material desires.Thus, the symbolism of Kurukshetra as a war is to “fight” and conquer one’s ownevil tendencies. The “war” fought, however, is primarily to rechannel upward theenergy in the spine which, so far, has activated those downward-pullingtendencies. The upward flow of energy releases it from whatever tendencies, inthe worldly person, have been pulling it downward. All the effort one investsspiritually should be in the direction of effortlessness—“When efforts end inease,” as Paramhansa Yogananda expressed it.Sometimes it takes a very great effort of will to resist some particular habitor temptation and throw it out of the mind altogether. A certain man (a truestory) wanted for once and for all to overcome his tendency toward alcoholism.One day, finding himself on the point of succumbing once again to that old, evilhabit, he suddenly became so enraged at himself that he removed from the cabinetall his bottles of whiskey, rum, etc., where he’d been keeping them, carriedthem out of doors, and hurled them furiously onto the ground. Every bottle wasbroken, and with their shattering, every attachment to drinking vanished foreverfrom his consciousness. The vitreous devastation was only an outward expressionof his inner, and very firm, emotional renunciation.Usually, such renunciation is accompanied by deep inner calmness, but in thisman’s case, evidently, emotional revulsion was needed first, to break hisdeep-seated habit.A thorn, the Indian scriptures suggest, can be used to extricate another one,after which both thorns may be discarded. Emotional rejection enabled this manto uproot the deeply imbedded “thorn” of alcoholism. After his emotional“purging,” both the emotion and the habit were discarded. The point, in thiscase, is that emotion worked, and was just what the man needed to free himselfforever of his habit.That emotional act too, however, though it demanded both physical and mentaleffort, may be compared to simply heaving the ballast out of the basket underthe balloon so that the balloon can rise of its own buoyancy. Sometimes, as wasstated in The Imitation of Christ (a great Christian work which my Gururecommended), one must “do violence” to his lower nature in the name of ultimateease. Such “violence” does not create an increase of tension, for it releasesdesire and attachment instead of suppressing them.It should be added that the balloon may, after long disuse, have lost some ofits buoyant gas. The spiritual aspirant must “pump” his balloon of aspirationagain and again with fervent devotion and ever-deeper meditation. He mustrepeatedly return the compass needle of his attention to the polestar ofultimate divine attainment. Admittedly, to do so requires effort, especially inthe beginning. His efforts will be increasingly successful, however, the more hefeels that what he is doing is a relaxation upward into the higher Self, ratherthan a process of driving his thoughts higher by grim will power. Theexpression, “When efforts end in ease,” should be held aloft in the mindconstantly like a banner by every meditator. It is the “monkey standard” whichArjuna held high to symbolize his control over mental restlessness.The need is not so much to develop love for God as to receive His love: torecognize love and joy as supremely relishable, and as, therefore, the onlything in life worth having. Divine bliss is the most fulfilling of all possibleattainments, and therefore the only “thing” worthwhile to desire. Devotion issimply a response to God’s call in the soul. High truths cannot be learned: theycan only be remembered in the Self. As the ancient sage Patanjali stated, divineenlightenment is attained by a process of smriti: divine recollection. When Godis experienced, the soul recognizes what it has always known, ondeeper-than-conscious levels of consciousness: its own, eternal reality.The spiritual path is full of apparent contradictions. Yogananda told the storyof a master who said to a disciple, “You should eat, and you should not eat.”The disciple quite naturally objected, “Master, what you’ve said seems to meself-contradictory.”“The contradiction,” replied the Master, “is in your understanding; my advice issound. You should feed your body healthfully to keep it alive and well, but youmust resist the thought, born of ego, ‘I am eating.’ Tell yourself, rather, ‘Godis eating through me.’”Thus, too, must a person act in this world: not with ego-motivation, but as aGod-given duty, and with the feeling that He alone, through His instrument, isindeed the Doer.(3:3) The Cosmic Lord said, “O Sinless One, at the beginning of creation, Iestablished two means by which man could achieve salvation. The first was bywisdom; the other was by right action.”True wisdom means one thing only: the perception of Brahman, and oneness withHim. Those who are blessed with this perception have no need for action at all.Yogananda told a story of Draupadi, to whom Krishna once addressed the question,“Why don’t you practice the yoga meditation techniques?”“I would love to, Lord,” she replied, “but how can I take my mind away from Youlong enough to do them?”“Hearing those words,” the Master concluded, “Krishna only smiled.”The path to yoga through wisdom begins truly with the vision of God. As onesaint put it, “I used to think that when I achieved nirbikalpa samadhi my workwould be done. Instead, I discovered on reaching that state that it had onlybegun!”Once one has realized oneness with God, and understood that in everything onedoes God alone is the Doer, he must still recall, and having recalled, releaseinto the Infinite all the deeds he performed in ego-consciousness through thelong succession of countless past lives. The sum total of those lives may bemany millions: incarnations spent, let us say, as a pirate, a farmer, a stockbroker, a housewife, a warrior, a king, a beggar.The task of releasing the ego-motivation for billions of past deeds may seemoverwhelming—somewhat like turning each molecule in a bar of metal in anorth-south direction to produce a bar magnet. As we saw pages ago, relatingthat example to the magnetizing of the spine for spiritual unfoldment, twoelements in the task of inward release are infinitely more important thanturning each molecule individually north and south, or than releasing, one byone into the infinite, all the deeds one ever committed in past lives.Paramhansa Yogananda said that the deeply meditating yogi, even during onemeditation, can release the deeds performed in delusion of an entire lifetime.The yogi sweeps the light of superconsciousness, so to speak, over the entirepanorama of that incarnation, beholding God as the One who acted in all ofthem—even in his misdeeds. Thus, the yogi doesn’t have to view every deed.Rather, he sees the sweep of energy that moved throughout that incarnation. Godit is, in reality, who acts even when the parts He plays are villainous. Satanhimself is—when the whole tale is told—an instrument of God. As my Guru put it,“The villain is needed in a play, to make us love the hero.” And villainy isneeded, over one’s own past many incarnations, to bring one to the point wherehe realizes that doing harm to others never succeeded in bringing him happiness;nor was there any real fulfillment for him until he’d learned to offer up hisego into a more expanded peace and harmony.The jivan mukta (“freed while living”), having become released forever fromego-consciousness, must recall all those lives when he lived inego-consciousness, and must see himself as never having been anything but anindividual manifestation of the Lord Himself. This path of wisdom leads to thehighest state, kaivalya moksha, complete liberation.I once asked my Guru, “How long does one remain a jivan mukta before he achievesfull liberation?”“In that state,” he replied, “you don’t care. Indeed, there is no ‘you’ to care!You may use your need to clear your karma of the past as an excuse to come backand help others, or you may say, simply, ‘I am free,’ and be free in Godforever.”At this point a brother disciple of mine, as I mentioned in Conversations withYogananda, said, “But if I myself said, ‘I’m free,’ I wouldn’t be free, wouldI?”“Oh, yes,” the Guru replied. “But the thing is, you answered your own question!You said, ‘I wouldn’t be.’” He then told the story, also quoted earlier, aboutthe man who tried to rid himself of a demon by chanting a Vedic incantation overa handful of powder, then casting it onto the demon. The demon mocked him,saying, “Before you could even say your incantation, I got into the powdermyself.” Yogananda then explained, “The very mind with which you would affirmfreedom is already infected with the disease of delusion. That is why you mustfirst reach that high state of consciousness. Only then can your affirmation offreedom be effective.”At that stage, it is no longer one’s ego saying, “I am free.” Of the saintsdescribed in Autobiography of a Yogi, very few had attained full liberation. Ispent several days with one such param mukta (so my Guru described him, thoughhe had not included him in his autobiography). I said to this saint, “With allthat you have attained, why have you so few disciples?”“God has done what He wants to do with this body,” was his simple reply. In thatstate, there is no “I” to care one way or another about anything. The goal hasbeen reached.Intellectuals may consider it their nature to incline toward the path of wisdom.It takes more than intellect, however, to enter even the lower samadhi state ofsabikalpa. As my Guru stated in the chapter “An Experience in CosmicConsciousness,” in Autobiography of a Yogi, “The experience can never be giventhrough one’s mere intellectual willingness or open-mindedness. Only adequateenlargement by yoga practice and devotional bhakti can prepare the mind toabsorb the liberating shock of omnipresence.”Yogananda’s great mystical poem, “Samadhi,” which will be quoted in full lateron in this book during our discussion of Arjuna’s divine vision, had omittedfrom later editions, by an inexplicable editorial emendation, a number ofimportant lines. Among these were the following:By deeper, longer, thirsty, guru-given meditationComes this celestial samadhi.Salvation comes—as, indeed, does every manifestation of creation—through aninstrument of God, and not directly from Spirit. The divine instrument of thatsupreme gift is one’s guru.Thus, for practical needs, Krishna tells the devotee to follow the path of yoga.As he declares later on in the Gita, “Arjuna, be thou a yogi.”Meditative activity, and not a more randomly selected set of religiouslymotivated actions, is implicit in what Krishna says here. As the apple blossomalready contains the apple, and is inseparable from that final product, so yogapractice is inseparable from its ultimate fruit: union with the Infinite.It must be strictly understood that the term yoga is not limited to specificmeditative practices, taught initially thousands of years ago in India by greatrishis, or sages. Spiritual seekers in any religion, if they pray and meditatesincerely, may rightly be termed yogis. A certain great Roman Catholic mystic inItaly was approached by a friend of mine who, during his traditional“confession,” told the mystic he practiced Kriya Yoga.“Hush!” the mystic replied. “It is better not to let anyone [other priests,especially] know! However,” he added, “you are doing the right thing!”The eightfold (more literally, the “eight-limbed” ashtanga) path of yogaoutlined by the ancient sage Patanjali was not describing one particular path toGod. All who would unite their souls with God must follow that same path: yamaand niyama (right action); asana (firmness of posture, and keeping the spinestraight to enable the energy to flow freely through it); pranayama (controlover the energy of the body); pratyahara (interiorization of the mind); dharana(one-pointed concentration); dhyana (absorption in deep meditation); and samadhi(oneness). Samadhi, as we saw earlier, is both conditioned and unconditioned:conditioned (limited), first, in sabikalpa, for the subtle bonds ofego-consciousness still remain to be wholly severed; and nirbikalpa,unconditioned by limitation of any kind.One who attains nirbikalpa samadhi has reached the highest state possible. Hehas only to free himself of memories of ego-identification with pastincarnations. Otherwise, he is like Christ, Krishna, and Buddha. From onenesswith God there is nowhere higher to rise. Religionists often claim for their ownfounders a state above that of any other saint or master. No such state exists.As Yogananda once put it, “When you become one with God, you are God.” Indeed,there is no “you” to be anything else!Thus, when Krishna told Arjuna to be a yogi, he didn’t mean necessarily to be aHindu yogi. All those in every religion who sincerely seek God walk the samepath, ultimately speaking, for their devotion turns them inward to experienceHim. It cannot be otherwise.The benefit of the “path” of yoga, as it was taught classically, andspecifically the path of Kriya Yoga, is that its scientific techniquesaccomplish more directly what the most earnest devotion can only accomplishindirectly.Yogananda once met a sincere Bhakti Yogi (a follower of the path of devotion),and, seeing his sincerity, urged him to accept initiation into Kriya Yoga. Theman demurred, saying that he had been following the path of Bhakti Yogasincerely for twenty years, and was loyal to that way—“Although,” he admitted,“I have yet to experience God.”Yogananda explained to him, “You have been in a room for twenty years, trying toget out through the walls, the ceiling, the floor, but no one has shown youwhere the door is. Kriya Yoga will take you by the ‘door’ of the spine. I am nottrying to change your allegiance. I am only saying, ‘Here is the door: Open it,and walk out into the “free air” of divine attainment.’ Finally he accepted mysuggestion. Within a very short time he attained the experience of God which hehad been seeking for so many years.”It must be understood that the Bhagavad Gita is for everyone, and not only forthose who can meditate deeply. It is, indeed, for even the most worldly of humanbeings. It points the way for everyone to find the fulfillment of happiness,then joy, then perfect bliss that all men seek—most of them, alas, blindly,groping in darkness with no sense of direction. The Gita says, “This is the wayyou are all seeking! Nothing sought in any other direction will ever give youwhat you yourself so ardently desire! Blindly though it be, and in ignorance ofwhat life is all about, what you seek is the mystery of your own being!”Thus, this chapter on Karma Yoga, the Path of Spiritual Action, deals with allaction, and with the way to direct that action toward the realization of God.The important point to remember is that the goal of Karma Yoga is not to pleaseGod: it is, in a true sense, to please one’s higher Self: That is to say, it isto find bliss in one’s own, divine Self! This is also the message of every truescripture: Do that which will bring you, not pleasure, and not even mere humanhappiness, but bliss! To emphasize the ego and its narrow self-interests is thepathway to hell. To de-emphasize it by expanding one’s sympathies and awarenessis the pathway to heaven. Ultimately, the true heaven which all seek isSatchidananda: ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss.Thus, that action is spiritual which minimizes one’s emphasis on the ego and oneverything that feeds ego-consciousness: desires, attachments, and all thewarriors in the army of the Kauravas.(3:4) Actionlessness cannot be attained by mere inaction. One who forsakes work(in the name of divine aloofness from activity) cannot reach perfection.It is to set an example for their disciples that fully liberated masters, whoreturn to this world as avatars (incarnations of God), engage themselves invarious spiritually uplifting activities. Sometimes, indeed, they evenparticipate in world-emancipating tasks, such as Krishna assumed in killing thedemonic Kangsa. Avatars live as willing participants in the divine drama ofcreation. Their lives are also intended, however, to serve as examples todevotees by showing them that it is important for everyone to be activelyengaged in self-liberation, each one according to his own complex network ofkarma. My Guru explained that a liberated master, whatever his role on earth,never loses his inner awareness of freedom.(3:5) No one can remain actionless for even a moment; all are compelled (byNature), whether willingly or unwillingly, to be active, driven by the gunas(the three qualities) of Nature.(3:6) The person who restrains his organs of action, but in whose mind rotatethe thoughts of sense objects, is (rightly) regarded as a hypocrite, and isself-deluded.Imagine utter motionlessness: no wind; no passing clouds; no ocean waves; norising or setting sun and moon; no changing of the seasons; no growing things;no decay; no breath of life; no thoughts; no whirling atoms; and, because nomovement exists, therefore no space—and, finally, since no movement, thereforealso no time.What utter folly in so-called philosophers, sophisticated thinkers, and aspiringtruth seekers to imagine that the actionless state of Supreme Spirit isattainable by merely not acting! Can they cease from breathing by merely notbreathing? Can they refrain from thinking by merely not thinking? Can theyachieve silence by merely not speaking? One wonders how any aspirant to wisdomcan conceive such absurdities!All creation exists in a vibratory state. The very atoms are constantly inmovement. Prakriti (Nature) forces man to be active. Anyone who tries to beinactive becomes merely lazy. Anyone who pretends to be disinvolved in the worldaround him is being merely hypocritical.In order to achieve the actionless state it is utterly necessary to actconsciously—not merely driven by Nature, but deliberately and intelligently,like a surfer going with the waves of circumstance.(3:7) That man, however, succeeds supremely, O Arjuna, who disciplines hissenses by an effort of mind, who remains inwardly non-attached, and who engageshis organs of activity in God-reminding activities.What (let us first consider) are “God-reminding activities”? They include everydeed and thought which lifts the mind toward superconsciousness. Mere pietyexpressed prayerfully in church, temple, or synagogue; mere “holy” sentimentsdisplayed to impress others (or even uttered fervently to “impress” God)—inshort, any show of religiosity is acceptable only according to the depth ofinner sincerity involved. The wish to impress indicates a desire for results,rather than true sincerity of feeling.Krishna’s expression, “. . . disciplining his senses by an effort of mind”suggests the importance of not adopting merely outward means of self-discipline:standing or sitting, for example, with one hand upraised until it withers fromdisuse; standing, but never sitting nor lying down, as a mode of penance; lyingon a bed of thorns: these, plus long fasts, sleep-deprivation, and other meansof sense starvation designed for learning self-control, but without acorresponding attempt at intelligent discrimination, are not what Krishna isrecommending here. Similar austerities in other religions include such practicesas self-flagellation, self-starvation, and many practices similar to ones usedin India. To list them all would be futile, inasmuch as all of them are intendedto subdue the senses without the proper use of the will. For inner freedom, thewill must give its active consent to inward release: It is useless to beat thebody in an effort to force it into submission.Sense-control is never a question of bullying the senses. What must be done iswithdraw the energy from them. The will acts directly upon the flow of energy.Yogananda stated, “The greater the will, the greater the flow of energy.” Thedirection of that flow can be inward as well as outward—upward as well asdownward.Therefore also Krishna speaks of inner non-attachment. Depriving oneself ofmaterial things may, and often does, feed the hidden fires of attachment! Noactivity engaged in merely to impress others (or even God) will, in the end,bear divine fruit. Spiritual progress is achieved above all by desiring itintensely, and not by inflicting violent discipline on the body.With a willing attitude, with joy and devotion, it is possible to find God.Without the whole-hearted assent of one’s will and of one’s whole consciousness,that noblest of all ends—the pure consciousness of Bliss itself—cannot beachieved.(3:8) Perform those actions which your duty dictates, for action is better thaninaction. Without action, in-deed, even the act of maintaining life in the bodywould not be possible.The duty of every man is that which is particularly his own, ordained for him bythe karmic bonds he himself has forged, and must untie to release himself fromattachment to the ego. Only thus can his consciousness soar in infinity. One’sdutiful actions are not necessarily the activities for which he has specialskill. The spiritual duty of a person with a talent for acting, for example, maynot be to become an actor. He may be very good at pretending to be someone else,yet have an active need to be wholly sincere as to who he himself is. He mayhave the magnetism to win plaudits from his audiences as an actor, yet may inthe process bind himself more firmly to pride by his very success. This is notto say that acting is universally a dangerous career, karmically speaking. Itmay help some people to become less identified, and therefore less limited by,their own personalities. Acting may help some people, also, to realize moredeeply that life itself is a play, in which nothing, in the last analysis, isreal.The complexity of karmic patterns in human life makes virtually every honestactivity a dharmic duty for someone. The menial task of street sweeping may, formost people, be simply a paying job and a social necessity, but for some peopleit may be a karmic duty—if, for example, the sweeper lived in a past incarnationin idle squalor. The exalted job of president of a large corporation might bemerely a burden for some people, and a cause of further karmic involvement,owing (perhaps) to a lurking desire for self-importance. For one, however, whotreats that position as an opportunity to serve others, or to promote a goodcause, it can be a step toward liberation from ego.How is one to know his own karmic duty? Few people, it must be admitted, areeven close to recognizing the abyss that separates the ego from Cosmicconsciousness. With innumerable karmic battles remaining to be fought beforetheir mental “troops” can make any significant advancement into enemy territory,it may be best simply to tackle whatever challenge lies closest to hand. Again,it is often best to undertake first those battles which one can be moreconfident of winning.For example, suppose someone is unable, at present, to conquer his sex drive. Inthat case, to try to overcome it may only weaken his will all the more, for eachtime he fails will become, for him, a reaffirmation of his weakness. Far betterwould it be, then, in his case, to undertake an easier challenge which, onceovercome, would strengthen his will power and prepare him gradually for the muchgreater challenge still awaiting him.For one who is fortunate enough to have a true (God-realized) guru, the sageadvice given by him is precious beyond any chest of diamonds and rubies.Obedience to his slightest word will be your raft over the roiling seas ofdelusion.(3:9) Actions performed for selfish gain are karmically binding. Therefore, OSon of Kunti (that is to say, of dispassion), perform your duty withoutattachment in a spirit of religious self-offering.The religious rite of yagya (my Guru preferred this transliteration over thescholarly version: yajna) symbolically offers the ego-self into the sacrificialfire for purification. One who aspires to liberation should do everything in aspirit of self-offering to God. God’s power itself, then, is symbolized by thefire of yagya. Visualize yourself every night, before going to sleep, offeringevery thought and feeling that is centered in the ego (self-congratulation, forexample, self-abasement, and any self-justification), along with every desireand attachment, into the blazing fire of God’s love."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter FourteenDIRECTIONAL DEVELOPMENTIn this age of democracy it is easy for people—especially for those who lackrefinement—to think, “I’m as good as anyone else.” All growth is directional,however. Values themselves, though relative, are directionally so: They are fromone level to another level. There is good, better, and best; or bad, worse, andworst. Behavior that is acceptable in a little child may be suspect, or evenunacceptable, in an adult. If the child points a toy gun at someone and cries,“Bang! Bang!” people may smile at his behavior, knowing that there is no animusbehind it. If an adult does the same thing, however, people might not feel soeasy about his behavior.We have seen that there is realistic justification for the caste system—not forthe way society has hardened it, but for the simple fact that there isobviously, in human nature, some kind of upward evolution. There are boors andthere are saints. Society is a mixture of all types. One of the inducementspeople have for seeking God is the very fact that they are exposed to so manydifferent levels of human refinement, some of them more inspiring than others,and many of them, rather, stern warnings of the consequences of wrong action.Some may inspire one to rise spiritually. Others may “inspire” one in a verydifferent way, and cause him to recoil from delusion itself as from a venomoussnake.Life evolves upward from levels lower even than apparent animation. Thewriggling worm—relatively high on the scale of consciousness—may become next amoth, then a bird, a mammal, and, after a long upward journey, a human being.Only after a very long time, and many further incarnations, does the human ego,which needs first to become focused on its humanity, evolve upward to the pointwhere it craves liberation from the limitations of ego-consciousness, and fromits imprisonment in a human body.People who rise out of their selfish impulses by sharing generously with othersascend, after death, to an astral heaven. There, only a few of them arespiritually aware enough to advance further. Surrounded by “their kind ofpeople,” they feel no incentive to meditate or to try in other ways to evolvehigher than the level they’ve so far achieved, which is vastly more enjoyablethan the material plane. They get to live in the company of angels, or devas.They are, however, more in the position of the recipients of blessings than ofgenerating blessings to others, themselves.Animals evolve more rapidly if they mix closely with human beings. This is thebenefit to them of being pets. Shudra types of human beings, similarly, canevolve more quickly if they are able to serve in the homes of higher types ofhuman beings: Vaishyas, perhaps especially, to whose outlook on life theythemselves may be better attuned.Vaishyas, following the same rationale, might do well to mix especially with—orat least to seek the custom of—Kshatriya types. And Kshatriyas will gain themost from mixing with those of Brahmin temperament.When higher types mix with those of lower consciousness in a spirit of sharingwith them, out of a wish to uplift them, they themselves gain spiritually.Otherwise, to mix with lower types may be to their personal disadvantage, for itmay pull them downward. They must keep a guard especially on their affections,which must always be impersonal.Women, whose role in society is more particularly that of preserving socialvalues, may marry above their natural caste, but ought not to marry beneath it.It must be recalled, here, that “above” and “beneath” have nothing to do withpeople’s families at birth, but only with the individual type of human being.Thus, it is by no means demeaning to serve those whose company can uplift one. Aperson of Brahmin temperament who longs to know God may have the greatest goodfortune of meeting, and being accepted by, a God-realized guru. In the Indianscriptures it is said that even brief contact with a saint can be a greatblessing. “One moment,” the saying goes, “in the company of a saint can be yourraft over the ocean of delusion.”Again and again we find emphasized in the scriptures the importance of satsanga:of good (and especially spiritual) company. Most people, surely, can look backover their lives and recall some one, two, or even several people who wereinfluential in their own mental or spiritual development. The boast of modernman, firm in his blind conviction that he’s “as good as anyone else,” extendsthat democratic outlook to religion also, and to the belief that even relativegoodness will earn an eternal place in a beautiful astral heaven. “Why, we’reall saints!” cries the Protestant Christian in protest, when someone proposes tohim that sainthood is an ideal to which everyone should aspire. To be confinedforever in a little ego, however, would surely be incarceration in hell, notfreedom in heaven!Man’s understanding of the universe has grown enormously in recent centuries.Geocentricity was replaced relatively recently, owing to the discoveries ofGalileo and others, by the belief that the sun was the center of everything.Only late in the nineteenth century was it discovered that our sun is only onestar in a vast star system. More recently still, in 1918, was it discovered thatthis system, our “Milky Way,” is only one galaxy among others. Now it is knownthat we live in a universe consisting of at least a hundred billion galaxies.Our view of human development, also, needs to be expanded. Matter, it is nowknown as a scientific fact, is only a vibration of energy. There are, accordingto India’s ancient wisdom, many kinds of energy, emanating from the astral levelof cosmic manifestation. We have discussed already some of these energies:conscious, egoic entities that produce and sustain life on this planet. Some ofthese entities are more highly evolved than others, and deserve the appellationdevas, or shining ones. Others are nature spirits—fairies and the like. Stillothers are lower spirits: demons and devils.Low types of humanity attract low astral spirits. High types attract guidanceand inspiration from devas, or angels, who can help them through their opennessto receiving assistance from above.A friend of the author’s was, in his youth, an alpinist who in that capacitymade several first ascensions. On one such climb he found, just when he wasalmost at the peak, that the mountain curved outward. It was impossible to climbany higher, and equally impossible to climb down again. He faced only tworeasonable choices: to remain on the ledge where he was and starve to death, orto make a suicidal leap off the precipice.Both choices, he decided, were unacceptable. Though reason shouted against thethird choice, he proceeded to climb higher. As the mountain began its curveoutward, he fell back again onto the ledge. “I might as well die trying,” hethought, “as die by starvation!” He therefore, tried again, and yet again. Eachtime, at the same point of the curve, he fell back onto the ledge again.On perhaps the twenty-fifth try, as he reached the same point of inevitablereturn, a force suddenly pushed him against the mountain, and held him thereuntil he reached the top. From then on the descent down the other side was easy.How to explain that miracle? Surely it must be attributed to angelicintervention.Very few human beings are ready for the highest spiritual blessing: the help ofa true guru. That all human beings need whatever help they can get, however, issurely very evident to anyone but the most arrant egotist. The fact is that man,having reached his high ledge on the evolutional climb and finding himselfclearly possessed at last of an ego, wants to enjoy that awareness of it for atime. Alas, he doesn’t realize how very long, probably, he has been enjoying it!A woman friend of mine was scolding her two-year-old son, “Come on, now, you’renot a baby any longer.” He replied, “But I like being a baby!” Such also aremost human beings: They like themselves as they are! They like being unique andseparate from all others, made a fuss over and coddled (when they can be). Theclimb, however, isn’t over for them until they can expand theirself-awareness—eventually to embrace infinity. Meanwhile, the “advantage” ofgreater awareness, especially of the egoic self, carries with it a disadvantagealso: a susceptibility to greatly increased suffering.The other “selves” whose help he may scorn to accept are, in fact, closelyrelated to his own self. In infinity they are all expressions of the same oneSelf! Man’s task in the great scheme of things is to learn that he is only asmall manifestation of Infinite Consciousness. The work before him of achievinginfinity is colossal! If he has any wisdom at all, he must surely see that heneeds all the help he can get!By helping others, he helps himself by expanding his sympathies. By helpingthose below him on the mountainside, he reinforces his appreciation for his ownmore advanced position. By accepting help from those above him, he finds iteasier to climb. Without help from above he may think, smugly, “Why climb anyfurther? I’m satisfied with this plateau, where I enjoy the expansive view.” Andso, then: shall he starve to spiritual death up there, lacking nourishment fromever-subtler levels of joy? Many people, smugly centered in their egos, arecontent simply to settle in for the long wait until death. Life must becontinuously progressive. If it tries to remain stationary, it is already livingdeath.There are devas, or angels, to whom we can appeal, or with whose energies we canwork in cooperation. As with other human beings, we gain much more by giving tothem than by trying to snatch our gain from them. Even in the ashrams of greatgurus, those disciples receive the most spiritually who, by their appreciation,give energy and don’t try to draw God’s blessings self-centeredly to themselves.When Buddha spoke against the karmakand of Vedic rituals (when offered forself-gratification and egoic gain), he did so in an age when people generallyhad lost the sensitivity to appreciate anything higher than themselves and theirown needs. The age we now live in is an upward-moving age (not Kali Yuga, aspeople generally believe). Paramhansa Yogananda taught for people in this newage of ascending Dwapara Yuga. The time has come again, he saw, for people totry to relate once more to higher energies and entities.Mankind has cut itself off, in its materialism, from those subtle energies.People thinking to succeed by their efforts alone often die prematurely of heartproblems and other ailments. Our very planet seems to be losing some of itsvital force. I mentioned earlier that the food we eat today has scientificallybeen found to contain a significantly smaller quantity of nutrients than it dida scant hundred years ago.It is time people included subtler beings in their reckoning. For they arethere, willing to help us. What attracts their help is not flattery (if theytruly are higher than ourselves: devas, or shining angels). Rather, what theyrespond to are lofty qualities like courage, selflessness, generosity, and—aboveall—love.In our love for others, it is best always to give impersonal love: to see God inall, and not to look to anyone for personal gain. Love should be expressed as aconcern for their well-being; its impersonality should be without self-interest.The same is true for man’s attitude toward the gods, or astral deities: Itshould be self-giving. They should be loved as messengers of God, and certainlynot flattered, ego to ego. Above all, God Himself should be loved through them.The Vedas were first revealed to mankind in a higher age than this one. Theyrevealed an understanding also of the power of the devas. As a way ofencouraging mankind to look to subtler energies for help, rather than dependingsolely on one’s own strength and ingenuity, mantras were also given in the Vedasfor purely personal gain: wealth, power, an increase of family, etc. The thoughtwas that, if people seek such things (which most of them seek anyway) fromsources subtler than material their gratitude, in success, would go to thosesources, and would cause people to depend more on higher help than onego-generated power.All things exist in a state of vibration. That is how the Supreme, ever-unmovingSpirit brought about the appearance of a reality separate from itself. As theblades of a fan, rotating rapidly, give the appearance of a solid circular disk,so Cosmic Vibration, in its infinite number of intensely rapid vibrations, givesthe appearance of substance, variety, even of solidity. Thus we have, forexample, the rocks, which to our senses appear very solid but which are nowknown to be only vibrations of energy, and which, even as material substance,are composed largely of space.The ancient rishis, or seers, understood how certain vibrations could place onein harmony with levels of consciousness that would lift one to higher levels ofawareness. Those rites and ceremonies are effective when they are recitedcorrectly, and especially when recited with understanding. To imagine, however,that any mantra excuses man from the need to make a personal effort to improvehimself is why Buddha, in the descending age of Kali Yuga, denounced theirrecital.Krishna in the next stanzas of the Bhagavad Gita, and speaking in the name of anunderstanding that had come down from a higher age, seems to be recommending thevery thing which Buddha denounced. All the great masters speak, however, fromthe same state of perfect realization. When they place different emphases intheir teachings, it is because they must address the special needs of theiraudiences. Krishna also said, in fact, what Buddha taught: Men themselves muststrive for self-liberation; otherwise, the grace of God, the help of a trueguru, and the blessings of higher beings will never descend.Do not imagine, then, that you will gain very much spiritually by simply payinga pujari (priest) to perform some Vedic fire ceremony for you with the correctlyintoned mantras. The blessings derived from that path, which is known askarmakand, can be real (depending also, of course, on the power of the priest),but they will still keep you wandering on the delusive paths of duality andkarma.A final question comes up in this regard: to whom should one’s prayers andchants be directed? Why should anyone whose goal is union with God offer chantsto lesser deities—Ganesha, Indra, etc.? There are sentiments involved here, ofcourse, which should be respected. Images of Ganesha, the god of good fortunewith his elephant head, are to be found in virtually every Hindu home. Upliftingsentiments of all kinds should be not only respected, but encouraged. Man couldnot really live a life of any inspiration without images of some kind to inspirehim. They remind him of higher truths. Even Moslems, as Guru Nanak pointed out,bow in the direction of the sacred stone at Mecca. Without images, people’sdevotion becomes dry.Ganesha is a sweet image. He has been “frozen,” so to speak, for centuries intoan abiding reality by the devotion of millions of worshipers. Certainly a Hindushould feel “safe,” philosophically, in praying to him!On the other hand, one’s highest worship should always be directed toward theInfinite Lord. Therefore it may be said that, as the devotee is taught to seeGod in everyone, so he should see God in every lesser god, and chant only tothose forms, using only those names, which remind him of the Infinite.For even the recognized gods only represent the posts they hold, not theirindividual names. In an ancient Hindu legend Krishna says to Uddhava, “See thatbeetle on the ground? It was once Indra.” Indra, obviously fallen far from theaugust position that particular entity once held, was now a name, or title, heldby another entity. The fall of anyone who engrosses himself again in maya—whichcan happen at any time prior to one’s attainment of the very highest state(nirbikalpa samadhi)—is fear-inspiring. It will be a subject of discussion lateron in the Gita.The angels are not higher, as some Christians imagine, than God-realized masterswho live here on the earth. The angels, too, are still working toward theirsalvation and can fall, if they direct their interests toward personalgratification. Satan is said, notoriously, to be a fallen angel, although thatstory belongs more in the realm of allegory than of literal history.(3:10) Prajapati (God in the aspect of Creator) brought mankind intomanifestation, and in so doing gave man the potential for self-offering into ahigher (than human) awareness (through yagya). Along with this gift He enjoinedmankind, “Whatever you desire, seek it by offering energy back to the source ofall energy. Let this sacrifice (yagya) be your milch cow of fulfillment.”(3:11) (Prajapati continued:) “With this offering, commune with the devas(shining angels), that they may commune also with you. Through such mutualcommunion you will arrive at the highest good.”(3:12) (Prajapati concluded:) “By communion with the devas you will receive fromthem the (earthly) fulfillments you desire. He who enjoys the gifts of the godswithout returning due offering (of energy) to them is, verily, a thief.”For meditating yogis seeking oneness with God, there are subtler meanings to bedrawn from these passages. For the energy in the body should be offeredcontinually back—for “fine tuning,” so to speak, to its source. In the body, thenegative pole of that source is the medulla oblongata; the positive pole is theseat of superconsciousness (in the frontal lobe of the brain, centered betweenand behind the two eyebrows). The true yagya is Kriya Yoga, as we shall seelater on. Kriya Yoga leads one up the spine, enabling the little self—the ego—tobe united with the Infinite Self: God.Raising the Kundalini power is the ultimate “fire rite,” leading to a completewithdrawal of energy from the body and an offering of that energy into theInfinite. Kundalini begins this ritual by withdrawing energy from thebody-sustaining energy in the chakras. Finally, the yogi offers himself forperfect purification in the blazing light of the Infinite.(3:13) Spiritually minded people, offering up the food they eat to its source indivine energy (the devas), incur no sin. Those, however, who make no suchoffering (eating only for taste and pleasure) are verily feeding on sin.Matter, as modern science has learned, is a vibration of energy. The moreconscious one can be of the energy in his body, the easier it is for him to risespiritually. When he moves his body, he should try to feel that it is energywhich gives strength to his muscles, allowing them to move. When he inhales, heshould feel that with the air he is taking in energy. In everything he does, heshould try to be conscious of energy as his next step upward in awareness, onhis way to divine union.Next, he should feel that the energy which enables him to move and breathe isnot his own, personally. Sin (delusion) begins with the smug thought, “All thisis mine!” It is easier to imagine matter as something that can be possessed. Itis more difficult to think of subtle energy, and even air, as one’s possession.When energy can be offered up (whether to the devas or to God) it is easier toraise one’s consciousness also.The food one eats, too, is energy. Its substantiality can stimulate grosspleasure also in the thought, “I, myself, am eating, enjoying, and delighting inall these pleasurable tastes.” It is not “unlawful,” spiritually, to enjoy one’sfood, but it is better to turn that pleasure into a reminder of the changelessjoy of the soul. Thus it helps, while eating, to let the enjoyment one gets fromfood nourish the joy in the heart, by concentrating in the heart whateverdelight one feels in the taste.To gorge one’s food gluttonously is to feed not only the body but the ego. Whatmakes gorging a sin is that it affirms, erroneously, the body as one’s own, veryspecial reality.“Sin,” here, means simply the error of ego-affirmation. It is one more bar, soto speak, in the prison cell of ego-consciousness.(3:14) Creatures require nourishment from food; food must be nourished by rain;rain is sustained, in turn, by fire (heat from the sun, which causes bodies ofwater to evaporate), and heat is produced by the vibration of AUM.The Bhagavad Gita here is subtly suggesting the elemental stages of divinemanifestation, which are, in truth, our entire sustenance: earth, water,fire—these visible stages issue from the vibratory power of the cosmos: AUM.Vibration is action, which is to say, karma.(3:15) Know this divine vibratory activity to have been produced by Brahma, thecosmic creative force. Yagya, or sacrificial self-offering, brings the greatcycle of cosmic manifestation back (at last) to itself.AUM, the Cosmic Vibration, has three aspects, each of which produces a distinctsound: Brahma, the creative vibration, gives the highest sound; Vishnu, thepreserving vibration, gives a medium-pitched sound; and Shiva, the destroying orall-dissolving vibration, gives a low-pitched, rumbling sound. This Trinity isnot the same as the Christian Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as manyscholars claim. That Trinity is expressed, rather, in the Sanskrit threefold“AUM-Tat-Sat,” three words that indicate the basic aspects of God: Sat being theeternal Truth from which issues all creation; AUM, the Cosmic Vibration, fromwhich proceeds cosmic manifestation; and Tat, the reflection, at the heart ofall vibration, of the motionless Spirit, forever untouched by vibration.AUM is properly written with three letters. The first letter signifies Brahma;the second one, Vishnu; and the third (properly pronounced as a slightlydrawn-out hum), Shiva. The threefold AUM is for that reason chanted on threetonal levels: high, medium, and low. AUM, in English, is generally written “OM,”because that vowel in English is not pure, but consists of two (and even more!)vowels: in America at least, a short a (as in “uh”) and the universal u, whichshould be pronounced oo. In other languages—Italian, for example—there is noclear way of transliterating AUM. People in Italy pronounce the A long (oropen), as in “ahm,” not short as it should be. AUM should properly bepronounced, “Uh-oo-mmm.” Tat and Sat also are pronounced with short a’s, likethe a in “about.”All things are manifestations of the Cosmic Vibration. The meditating yogi firsthears the sound of AUM in his right ear. As he deepens the experience, he comesto hear it in his whole body; as the whole body vibrates with that sound. Thus,feeling AUM all through the body, he loses identification withself-consciousness, centered in the medulla, and gradually expands with the AUMsound until he is identified with that vibration in all creation. This stage isknown as AUM samadhi.His next perception is of Kutastha Chaitanya, or Tat, the Christ consciousnessbehind the vibrations of his body—and the center of every vibration of the body,reflecting the motionless Spirit beyond creation. Gradually his consciousnessexpands with the Christ consciousness, or Tat, until he perceives it asinfinite. It is after reaching that stage, my Guru explained to me, that one maybe called a master. Thus, in the Sanskrit expression, “Tat twam asi,” meaning,“Thou art that,” the word “Tat” has a deeper meaning than most people realize.What it really means is, “Thou art ‘that’: the Infinite Consciousness.”Beyond Christ consciousness, in the eternally watchful state, resides theSupreme Spirit, Sat.(3:16) Whoever resists this great rotating cycle, liv-ing in sin and preferringthe (ego-centered) enjoyment of the senses, lives in vain.Krishna has been speaking of the great cycle of outward cosmic manifestation andinward return. Man’s ego, similarly, is created by the soul’s particularizationin, and identification with, a bodily form. Its return to oneness with Spirit isaccomplished by yagya (self-offering) to God, the aim of which is for the ego tobecome absorbed again in absolute oneness.Elsewhere in the Gita, Krishna pleads with Arjuna (who represents “everyman” asdevotee) to escape the ever-rotating wheel of birth and rebirth. Here he speaks,by contrast, of the eternal cosmic plan, in which all souls need to participateconsciously. He has recommended yagya: offering up of the little self into unionwith the cosmic Self. Thus, he says that when one clings to littleness, out ofattachment to the separate, individual ego, one lives in vain! One may describesuch a life as scarcely different from that of a grub. The ego-defined “great”deeds of mankind amount to nothing at all, relative to the universal reality.Their only merit lies in whatever they accomplish for man himself, by refininghis consciousness."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter FifteenFREEDOM THROUGH ACTION(3:17) For him whose only love is the Supreme Self, who delights in the Self andrests contentedly in the Self, no duty remains.(3:18) Such a person has nothing to gain by performing action in this world, noranything to lose by not performing it. He is dependent on no one and nothing(outside the Self).Ego was defined by Paramhansa Yogananda as “the soul identified with the body.”That identification drives one to action in the false belief that this world isreal. These stanzas are not meant to imply that enlightened souls cease fromacting. God Himself (the Divine Playwright), after all, wrote, staged, directed,and acts all the parts in His great drama of the universe. The purpose of thedrama is to lead everyone gradually to the denouement of realizing that it wasall simply a show, in which all acted, but were never really involved. He issatisfied if they want to become reabsorbed in Him after the curtain closes andoneness with Him has been achieved. He needs “workers in the field,” however,and is therefore pleased also with those who want to stay on here out of a“desireless desire” to help Him with the production of the play.The important thing is not to act with ego-motivation. Our separateness from Godis an illusion. Every thought we think, every deed we perform, every desire weharbor is only a reflection of His infinite consciousness. The human playwrightcreates all the parts in his drama. His play may need a villain; if not, it willcertainly need characters who are antithetic to others. Without dramatic tensionthere can be no drama, and the work won’t hold the audience’s interest. Indeed,if the playwright is good at his métier, he actually enjoys writing also theparts of villains, for it takes skill to show the inherent logic of evil (fromits own point of view)! At the heart of everything that happens anywhere, thereis a hidden secret: divine joy, without which the universe could not have beenmanifested. People who are attached to their bodies cry out in anguish, “Butthere can’t be joy in suffering!” What stories they tell later, however! Almostproudly they speak of those very times when in their own lives they suffered themost!Everything is, to varying degrees of manifestation, bliss itself! The verycapacity to suffer is an indication of the more refined capacity to experiencebliss. Suffering comes primarily from the thought, “Things ought not to be likethis.” Inherent in suffering itself, in other words, is the thought of howthings ought to be, and (so the soul whispers to them) can be, eventually.(3:19) Therefore, strive conscientiously during the performance of all actions,whether physical or spiritual, to act without attachment. By activity withoutself-interest, one attains the Supreme.Physical actions are performed by engaging the life force on a material level ofreality. Spiritual actions are performed by withdrawing the life force from thephysical body. To act spiritually in this world means to be conscious of theindwelling Self, and to radiate that inner consciousness outward to others, andto the world. Attachment is the rope that binds. Non-attachment slices the rope,and bestows liberation. I once asked my Guru, who had told us that in pastincarnations he had performed roles of major importance in the world, whether amaster always retains the high state of nirbikalpa samadhi when he is sent to doan active work in the world. His answer was significant: “One never loses theinward consciousness of being free.”(3:20) By the path of right action alone, (Raja) Janaka and others like him(karma yogis) attained perfection. To offer guidance to others, you, too, shouldbe active.King Janaka was, in fact, already an enlightened yogi and a liberated soul fromprevious lives. His mission was worldly, but it was to set an example of rightaction for unenlightened souls: to do one’s duty conscientiously, but withoutattachment.Lahiri Mahasaya often quoted the great rishi Ashtavakra’s teaching: “If you wantto achieve freedom from reincarnation, abhor sense pleasures as you wouldsugar-coated poison, and be as devotedly attached to acts of forgiveness, pity,contentment, and love of truth and God as to drinking nectar!”The highest sattwic attitude, of course, is to be impersonal: to forgive, pity,feel contentment, and love truth and God—all these, impersonally, withoutreferring anything back to your own ego. In forgiveness, for example, neverthink, “I am the one forgiving.” In that thought, pride can enter the mind.Direct your flow of energy and attention outward, toward the person whom youforgive.(3:21) Whatever the superior being does, lesser beings imitate. His behaviorsets the standard for right living in the world.The arrangement of this scripture into separate stanzas makes it possible fromtime to time to interrupt its flow with extraneous ideas. In this stanza we findnot only a reason offered to spiritual people for living by high principles, butan answer to the common reproach worldly people often address to them: “If youare so concerned with doing right, why don’t you do more for the upliftment ofmankind?”This very common criticism is a rationale that often dissuades idealistic peoplefrom the spiritual search. “Why don’t you do more for others?” It is astonishinghow many ways there are of “doing good” in this world without reallyaccomplishing anything worthwhile at all! Think of the “war chests” of politicalparties: money accumulated by people who believe this person or that will“change everything” for the better. Is any lasting good ever accomplished? Thatquestion hardly needs an answer! “Plus ça change,” say the French, “plus c’estla même chose: The more things change, the more they remain unchanged.”Think of the ardor with which people campaign to get others to behave “as theyought to.” People shouting slogans angrily, mounting huge parades, spending vastamounts of money to persuade everyone to stop fighting. Will anger make anyonepeaceful? Will merely “banning the bomb” bring a stop to war? Even if people hadnothing but pitchforks, so long as their emotions could be aroused to anger theywould continue to fight. And people who are eager to fight will certainly seekthe best ways of winning they can find.As an example of almost ridiculous folly—at least, it would be ridiculous if ithadn’t also caused so much suffering—think of modern communism: Russia andChina, between them, have slaughtered an estimated one hundred million of theirown people with a view to imposing on them a philosophy supposed to promote “thegreatest good for the greatest number.”What needs changing is no social system, but human consciousness. The best wayto change society, surely, would be to create little societies that can inspireothers to make the recommended changes, individually, in themselves, rather thanforcing everyone to march in lock-step togetherness toward some general “good”that often ends in disaster. If an example works, others may be inspired by it,and may want to change. Without the desire to change, no one will ever do betterat anything.The first responsibility the universe places on every person’s shoulders isthis: “Change yourself.” One moon, it has been pointed out, gives more lightthan all the stars. One transformed human being has a more beneficial impact onothers than a thousand people campaigning for “improvements” which, when theshouting is over, often leave everything no more changed than when a deck ofcards is reshuffled.Even a brief overview of history shows persuasively that in only one field ofendeavor has there been consistency. The one and only impact on society withlong-lasting, beneficial effect has been in the field of religion. There have,of course, been wars and persecutions in the name of God. These can and must beblamed on human nature, not on teachings that seem to inspire them to love Godand to be at peace with one another. Imperfect human beings, eager for battle,will use the name of God—as a slogan, not as an expression of devotion, and,therefore, in vain. God never endorses such “piety.” People all too easily,however, infect one another with their own imperfections. The true saviors ofhumanity have ever brought to this world the one and only influence that haspermanently improved anything.All great teachers have stated that man’s first duty is to improve himself,rather than inflicting his own opinions about self-improvement on others. Theyhave also said, however, that true improvement is really possible only in ahigher, unitive consciousness. Most of them (with the exception, that is, ofBuddha, who—as we have shown elsewhere—by no means disagreed with them) haveadded that permanent upliftment is possible only with divine assistance andinspiration. One way to improve oneself is to offer to others (without imposingon them) whatever genuine inspiration one has found. To share that inspirationwith others is the best “good work” one can do, provided one does it in a spiritof inner freedom. If one seeks God alone, without doing anything else forhumanity, he will in any case (like the full moon against a field of much dimmerstars) have done greater wonders for the whole human race than any politician,after winning his campaign for election!A sage who, after a lifetime—indeed, the task requires many lifetimes—arrives atthe direct perception of God, and achieves the state of oneness with Him, neednot make a single move to help anyone. Even without doing so, his life will be asupernal blessing on the world. One who acts in the world, however, as anexample of divine love, forgiveness, peace, and divine joy will be imitated bycountless others. His impact on society as a whole will be incalculably great.Every spiritual seeker must understand that there is nothing greater that he canaccomplish for others than that very thing he is already doing.When such a seeker attains final liberation—so my Guru told me—seven generationsof his family in both directions are freed also. Such is the immediate gloryharvested from his attainment. What, then, of the disciples? “Oh, they comefirst!” was my Guru’s answer to that question. The freedom of one’s familymembers is not final liberation; rather, it is something like what happens whena person becomes an emperor, and his close relatives rise higher in society.Those are greatest among human beings who help to bring masses to God. In thisway only can a master’s greatness be acclaimed. He is outstanding (among othermasters) only for the good he does on earth. Otherwise, every jivan mukta,having achieved nirbikalpa samadhi, is as great as the greatest siddha, orperfected being. He may have past karma to work out; even so, he is one withGod, and there are no gradations in that oneness.There is another distinction between one perfected master and another. One whois an “ascended master,” having attained that state in the present lifetime, hasthe spiritual power to free only a few others. A jivan mukta who returns toearth to continue working out his own past karma, and from that level also toguide his disciples, also has limited divine power to uplift the human racecompared to one who is fully liberated.One who achieves full liberation, on the other hand, yet preserves the unselfish“desireless desire” to bring understanding to the world, and is therefore bornagain in perfect freedom, comes back with limitless spiritual power. Such a oneis an avatar. Only he who achieved final liberation in a former life deservesthat appellation. An avatar is a universal savior—like Krishna, Buddha, JesusChrist. Thousands—indeed millions (at least in theory, though there are nevermillions at any one time who actually seek God)—can be carried to God by such aone, as a powerful railway locomotive is capable of pulling a long train behindit.(3:22) O Son of Pritha (Arjuna), no further duty compels Me. There is no stateleft for Me to attain, and nothing in the three worlds (material, astral, orcausal) for Me to gain, yet still I work on for the upliftment of others. There,where all uplifting work is done, am I.This passage contains two meanings: overt, and covert. Overtly Krishna issaying, “Free though I am, I still work in this body for the benefit of others.”More esoterically, he is saying, “I, the infinite Spirit, am at the heart of allspiritually uplifting work, everywhere.” The point is that, in any truly goodwork, God already is that work. The devotee who serves God sincerely and withloving devotion need never be anxious that God might possibly be displeased withhim.(3:23) O Partha (Arjuna), if I were to cease acting in creation for even amoment, man, too, would imitate My inactivity.How can an unenlightened person know whether God is active or not? Krishna issaying that he, the Divine, living as an avatar in human form, deliberately setsan example for how man ought to live. Many spiritual teachers counsel theirfollowers to consider, rather, the actionless state of the Supreme Spirit, andtell them, if they want to attain that state, to remain inactive, themselves.Such is not Krishna’s teaching in the Bhagavad Gita. Because this importantaspect of his teaching has been qualified by those who insist that all activityis delusive, the question may remain in some minds: Which is right—action, orinaction? Is what Krishna says merely an opinion? Or has it, perhaps, beenmisinterpreted? Is he talking to a more worldly state of consciousness? Is he,in other words, offering a compromise that people will accept more readily?One answer is to go to those tamasic places where activity is at a minimum:opium dens, for example, and bars where people go only to get drunk. The torpideffect of such inactivity can be deadening; it may turn even the energetic in ashort while into human turtles. This important subject will be addressed again,more than once. Here it may be emphasized that Krishna was speaking not toworldly people, but to Arjuna, whom he himself called “Prince of devotees.”The point here is that one need not actually behold God engaged in activity. HowHis avatars behave should be man’s best teacher, and although the teachingvaries in certain ways according to the needs of the times, all of them havetaught the same basic truths, and all have been, in one way or another, activesimply in order to set mankind an example. The examples of the energy theydevote to helping people are what inspire their followers to express full energyin their own lives.(3:24) If I were to cease being active in cosmic creation, the universe itselfwould cease to exist. Confusion would result, and mankind would be brought toruin.There are two kinds of Pralaya, or cosmic dissolution: partial, and complete.Complete dissolution, of which Krishna speaks only glancingly here (his maintopic, at this point, being the need for right action, which leads to releasefrom karmic involvement), means the total withdrawal of all vibrationalmanifestation, at the end of a “Day of Brahma” (the aeons-long period of cosmicmanifestation), which is followed by an equally long “Night of Brahma.”Here Krishna is speaking of partial dissolution. He is emphasizing the need forGod’s presence in man’s life, and the ruin that would result without divineinspiration. Partial dissolution is a diminished manifestation of God’sconscious manifestation, with waxing chaos and the gradual ruin of mankind. Thefirst sentence of this stanza touches only lightly on total dissolution, as ifto remind us that, without God, nothing worthwhile could be achieved. The secondsentence, in its reference to partial dissolution, makes it clear that, morethan anything else, people need God.God’s partial withdrawal from outward manifestation signifies a weakening ofthat magnetic power which draws people upward towards enlightenment. Were thereno such upward attraction, human nature itself would have little or nothing tolift it. Mankind needs divine grace; without it he might never turn togoodness—unless, indeed, temporarily, under the influence of suffering.These few stanzas remind the devotee not to depend on human power andintelligence alone. Ego-inspired activity, though seemingly justified by commonsense, is doomed to disappointment at the end of every attempt and leads in timeto disaster.Yogananda explained in his Gita commentaries that in an ocean there sometimesappear areas of relative calmness, where the surface may even appear, for atime, as smooth as glass. Normally the ocean’s surface shows agitation and,sometimes, great agitation.Similarly, there are places on earth where sattwa guna (the elevating quality)is predominant; others, where rajoguna (the activating quality) is pronounced;and still others where tamoguna (the darkening quality) reigns supreme. Wheresattwa guna is withdrawn or obscured, mankind sinks to ruin.There are ages, called yugas, during which people are relatively enlightened;others when they are primarily active in promoting their own interests; andstill others when spiritual darkness prevails and when warfare, hatred, andviolence are the norm.There are also whole galaxies that manifest predominantly one of the threegunas, or qualities. This is a fascinating subject, and will be given the deepertreatment it deserves later on.(3:25) O Descendent of Bharata (Arjuna), as foolish people, out of attachment toego, act in hope of rewards, so should the wise also (even if wisdom has liftedthem out of any personal need to be active), act with dispassion andnon-attachment, glad to be of service to others as their guides (on the path toenlightenment).(3:26) Never should the wise condemn the ignorant for the ego-motivation theymanifest. Instead, being themselves enlightened, they should seek only toinspire others in the direction of preferring to perform right, dutiful action.The condemnation so often encountered in religious works does quite as much harmas good. The way to help people out of their ignorance is to inspire them with alonging for understanding. To scold them for their ignorance would be likescolding a blind man for his inability to see. Judgmental attitudes endangeralso the persons who harbor them, for though the judgment may seem to proceedfrom wisdom, it is invariably tinged with an ego-inspired sense of superiority,which drags the “preacher” himself down into greater delusion.One’s thoughts are colored by the clothes he wears. Similarly, if he wears thegray even of gentle criticism, his own thoughts also may take on a gray hue. Ifhe wears the black of severe condemnation, his thoughts will themselves becomedarkened. And if he wears the cheerful colors of kindness, acceptance, andforgiveness, he will not only inspire others to be like him, but will alsoenhance those colors in himself.(3:27) The universal impulse toward activity springs from the three gunas, orqualities of Nature. Man, however, deluded by egoism, thinks, “I am the doer.”The ego in man tells him, “This is my body.” Yet the cells of his body changeagain and again over the years. “Which body,” it may then be asked, “is theperson, himself?”His ego tells him, “These are my thoughts.” Yet thoughts come to him unbidden,from who knows what source? Paramhansa Yogananda wrote, “Thoughts areuniversally and not individually rooted.” The person with a darkenedconsciousness can, with right effort and right influence, develop a lightconsciousness. Which mind-set, then, is truly his own? The characteristics wemanifest only seem to be ours. The quality of those characteristics depends onthe level of our own energy and consciousness in the spine.To drive a dark mood out of the mind, for example, try this simple method: Focusyour energy and attention strongly at the point between the eyebrows. Themagnetism you generate there will lift you out of the fogs of gloom to a higher,more spiritual atmosphere where peace, joy, and complete acceptance reign.Again, if sex temptation assails you, bring the energy up from the lower chakras(especially from the swadisthana, or sacral) to the heart by breathing deeply afew times. Then sit still, as has been suggested above, and focus deeply on theKutastha between the eyebrows.(3:28) O Arjuna, he who understands how the gunas work in human nature, and whoknows therefore that (even) what the senses perceive depends on their indwellingpower of perception, withdraws his mind and removes his attachment to things atthe very source of his perception.When a person sees (let us say) something ugly, he might close his eyes andsimply refuse to see it. On the other hand, he might withdraw mentally from theperception of it, and then deliberately project joy and a oneness of beauty ontoeverything around him. Thus, the ugliness will not affect him, for he will seeit as a manifestation of Eternal Bliss, which, in the last analysis, underliesall existence. He may even—as the great artist Leonardo da Vinci did when hebeheld ugliness—gaze at it in a new way and see it as an aspect of the DivineBeauty.I am not saying that one should be indifferent to ugliness, squalor, and evilwhen he encounters it. He should not, however, allow anything to disturb hisinner peace. Even if he sees wrong in the world, and accepts it as amanifestation of maya, he can remain inwardly undisturbed by it, and can workimpersonally to improve matters in this world. The practical point here is thatif one is himself affected by squalor or evil, he will be far less able toimprove anything than he will if he is able to remain inwardly attuned to theflow of God’s joy.Withdrawal of the power behind the senses enables one to influence for goodwhatever he perceives in the world, and to act always in a state of innerfreedom.(3:29) The man of perfect wisdom should not bewilder the ignorant with hishigher perception of the nature of reality. (He should bear in mind that,)deluded as they are by the gunas, they have no choice but to act under thatinfluence.Again it should be emphasized that one can help others more by inspiring themthan by criticizing them. Sometimes, it is true, when people are too obtuselyarrogant they may require a good shaking. Thus, even wise masters will sometimesdeclaim against delusions, if people have become too entrenched in them. Krishnaadvises persons of higher perception, however, never to let themselves benegatively affected by other people’s ignorance.(3:30) Offer to Me your every deed. Devoid of egotism and desire, inwardlycentered in the soul, (ever) calm and free from worries, be dutifully engaged inthe battle of life.(3:31) True devotees, focused on practicing My precepts and (the true teachingsof) others, achieve freedom from all karma.(3:32) Those, however, who scoff at this teaching of Mine and refuse to practiceit, deluded (by ego) as to the nature of wisdom, know such persons, in theirrejection (due to ignorance), to be courting doom.(3:33) Even the wise act according to the dictates of their own nature. Allliving beings obey the dictates of Nature. Of what avail would be meresuppression?Krishna offered to the world, through the Bhagavad Gita, not only the highesttruths, expressed comprehensively and at great length, but a teaching of supremecommon sense. This thirty-third stanza is a beautiful example of thereasonableness of his teaching. The Lord says to Arjuna, “Work with things asthey are.” History—indeed, perhaps especially the history of religion—is full ofpeople trying to convince others to be different from what they are. Wars havebeen fought, persecutions inflicted, and revolutions stirred up in the name ofmaking people think and become what others think they ought to be. Krishna, inthis passage, says, very reasonably, “Work with what is, not with what you thinkshould be.”All human suffering is due to the simple thought that things ought to be otherthan they are. Even great physical pain can be transcended by first accepting itas it is. Try this practice: First, calmly recognize its existence. Second,center yourself at the heart of that pain. Finally, simply release it! You willfind that complete acceptance of it empowers you to do that relinquishing.Don’t let others tell you what you, in their eyes, ought to be. On the otherhand, never dismiss their advice arrogantly. Try at the same time, rather, to bealways true to your own nature. You will never change yourself by suppression.Real change comes only by transcendence. If there is some quality in yourselfthat you don’t like, try to lift your awareness to a higher level. If you findthat you simply cannot ignore that pain, however, then try to get to the heartof it. When mentally you arrive at its very center, offer the pain up to God. Ifyou practice this suggestion with a strong effort of will, you may find that youcan become, in an instant, a very different person.(3:34) Attraction and repulsion (regarding) sense objects belong to the naturalebb and flow of duality. Beware equally of them both, for they are man’sgreatest enemies!Attraction and repulsion are extreme forms of likes and dislikes. To likeanything excessively is as great an error, virtually by definition, as todislike its opposite. The realization of God depends on neutralizing all one’sreactions, leveling out their peaks and their valleys, and seeing the one,changeless Spirit at the heart of everything.The secret is not to cease from enjoying anything—a “solution” which leads onlyto apathy, and consequently, to a deadened awareness. The secret, rather, is tocenter every enjoyment in the heart: to feel that its cause lies there, in yourreactions; and then to draw that energy consciously upward in the spine, fromthe heart to the brain.Ordinary likes and dislikes are not man’s enemies, as such. Rather, they arelike troublesome neighbors. Extreme forms of these emotions, however—any strongattraction or violent repulsion—can plunge one into violent storms of emotionthat toss him helplessly about on great waves of delusion. Never let yourselfbecome infatuated (infatuation is extreme attraction) with anything or anyone.Never let yourself hate anything or anyone. Develop an attitude, rather, ofaccepting the cosmic dream as it is, even when it becomes a nightmare! Your onlyhope is to escape to a higher level of consciousness.Some people do have ugly traits. Don’t waste energy in reacting to them, neitherby dislike nor by abhorrence. Don’t welcome them into your “galaxy” ofinterests. Move through life, rather, like a swan off of whose back the rainflows lightly, never touching its body.Protect your heart’s feelings from the excitement of all extreme reactions.Surround those feelings with emanations of peace and good will. Relax in theheart. Relax also outward from the heart, to the shoulders. Then direct theheart’s energy upward through the spine to the brain. When there are peoplearound you, for instance, shouting angrily—and especially when they shout at youpersonally—relax inwardly; be centered in the Self; smile in your heart, andremind yourself, “I love God alone!”(3:35) To do one’s own duty even unsuccessfully is better than to do someoneelse’s duty successfully. It is better to die while trying to accomplish one’sown duty than to settle for another’s duty (though safer and easier). Thatcourse is filled with danger and uncertainty.The supreme duty of every man is, of course, to realize the one Self: God. One’sown path to that realization, however, may be quite different from those ofothers, and from any that others urge upon him. If one hasn’t a true guru totell him where his own best direction lies, he should follow that innerprompting which tells him, “This is my course to true freedom.” Freedom fromfurther involvement in maya is the highest criterion of virtue. People maymistakenly say, “But I feel more joy going in the direction ofsense-satisfaction.” Since they haven’t yet experienced divine joy, they mayeasily be tricked by the mere excitement of sense pleasure. Others say, equallyerroneously, “But when I see this woman, or that man, I feel overwhelming love.Surely that feeling must be right!” The result, as they proceed along thetwisting thoroughfare between birth and death, often takes such enthusiasts veryfar from their first emotions of infatuation! Inner freedom is the safest moralguideline, therefore. Ask yourself inwardly, “Will I feel freedom in thiscontemplated enjoyment? Will I feel freedom in this desired love?”The next question, of course, is, “What will I feel free from?” Freedom from thepinch of desire is not freedom: It is merely momentary relief! One’s feeling offreedom must be calm and inwardly expansive.Even so, as Yogananda once exclaimed, “People are so skillful in theirignorance!” It is hardly safe for ordinary people to trust their own judgmenttoo far. The supreme need of every sincere seeker is the guidance of a trueguru.For those who have no such blessing, and who have, perhaps, no deep hunger forGod, how shall they recognize their highest duty? The only guideline that mayserve them is to ask themselves, “Will it take me toward greater inner freedomand a sense of having done what was right for me?”(3:36) Arjuna said: O (Krishna), by what is one impelled, even against his will,to do wrong, as if (he were being) forced to do so?Everyone, surely, has experienced times when temptation of various sorts seemsto be forcing him against his will to act in ways he knows he ought to avoid.Arjuna’s question is universally understandable.(3:37) Krishna replied: It is desire; it is anger, both of which are impelled byrajoguna. Know these to be mankind’s greatest enemies.The soul is drawn out of itself by attachment to the body, and by resultantego-consciousness and the sense of being a separate individual. Theconsciousness of separateness gives rise to feelings of incompleteness. Thus,the gunas, which caused the soul to feel that sense of separation in the firstplace, become more active as rajoguna.Fundamentally, it is the activating impulse which drives people to seekself-completion by doing and acquiring things outwardly. Desires come as aresult, and because desires, once activated, can become infinite in number, noone is ever able to satisfy them all no matter how wealthy he is. The result offrustrated desire is anger. Thus it is that desire and anger travel the path oflife together. Desire (the eagerness for fulfillment) is never perfectlyconfident, and is always accompanied to some extent, therefore, by the grimthought, “And if I don’t get it . . . ?” Rising to the surface of consciousness,with this thought, is always the potential for anger.These twins are mankind’s “enemies,” because they rob him of his peace of mind.Desiring things, he thinks, “I won’t be completely happy until I have them.”Following quickly in the wake of that thought is the agitated fear of possiblefrustration, anger, and the loss (rather than the gain) of happiness.(3:38) As fire is obscured by smoke; as a mirror is cov-ered by dust; as anembryo is enveloped by the womb, so is human understanding obscured by the threequalities.The reference here is to the three gunas. Sattwa guna (illustrated by the firstexample) is easily blown away by a light puff of the “breeze” of meditation,even as the smoke concealing a fire is easily dispersed.A dust-covered mirror may need a little “elbow grease” to clean it, but withthat rubbing it can reflect things clearly once more. Rajoguna, therefore,expressed in the right way and with energy comparable to the power of thedelusion, can be transformed without too much difficulty to reflect the pureimage of Spirit.The embryo, however, cannot emerge from its womb until its full time iscompleted. Even so, with the person in whom tamoguna is uppermost, no amount ofteaching and no self-effort will serve any purpose. Time must simply pass, asnature takes its course, and brings that person gradually to the point where,after repeated disappointments and the slight glimmering of hope for greaterunderstanding, the inner person finally emerges in the full dignity of a refinedhuman being.(3:39) O Son of Kunti (Arjuna)! The unquenchable flames of inner desire are theconstant enemy even of the wise.(3:40) The senses, mind, and intellect are declared to be their stronghold.Desire, through these (three), deludes the embodied soul and eclipses itswisdom.(3:41) Therefore, O Best of the Bharata Dynasty! begin by disciplining thesenses (withdrawing your energy from them into the spine), then destroy desire(by casting it from your heart). Desire is the sinful destroyer of wisdom and ofSelf-realization.(3:42) The senses are declared to be superior to the body (since they conveyperception); the mind is superior to the senses (both inner and outer, since itis the perceiver); the discriminating intellect is superior to the mind (sinceit understands what it perceives); and the Self is superior to thediscriminating intellect (since it is both perception and understanding).(3:43) O Mighty-armed (Arjuna)! thus cognizing the (indwelling divine) Self assuperior to intellectual understanding, discipline your lower self (the ego) bydwelling in the true Self, and (thereby) overcome the foe who, wearing the armorof desire, is ever difficult to conquer.Thus ends the third chapter, called “Karma Yoga,” of the Upanishad of the holyBhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna discussing yogaand the science of Self-realization."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter SixteenTHE SUPREME SCIENCE OF KNOWING(4:1,2) The exalted Lord said to Arjuna: I gave this imperishable Yoga toVivasvat (the sun-god); Vivasvat passed on the knowledge to Manu (the Hindulaw-giver); Manu taught it to Ikshvaku (founder of the solar dynasty of theKshatriyas). Thus, handed down in orderly succession, the Rajarishis (royalrishis, or sages) knew it. With the long passage of time, however, O Scorcher ofFoes (Arjuna), this knowledge of Yoga has become greatly diminished on Earth.These passages refer to the gradual loss of knowledge during a long cycle ofdescent in earthly time. When the Earth, gradually descending from a higher ageof relative enlightenment, entered (in 700 b.c., according to Swami SriYukteswar’s computation) the dark age of Kali Yuga, the majority of mankind lostmost of its former power, mental clarity, and understanding. The golden age ofwisdom (Satya Yuga), which was a time of divine brilliance in humanunderstanding, gradually diminished to an age of discrimination (Treta Yuga);from there to an age of energy (Dwapara Yuga); and from that it descended to thelowest age, Kali, when the general understanding of mankind was centered in thethought of matter as real and substantial.That cycle, in our own time, and since that time when the Bhagavad Gita waswritten, has begun its upward swing again. It was in the year 500 a.d. that theearth entered an ascending Kali Yuga. In 1700, it entered ascending DwaparaYuga. For the past three hundred years, man has been coming increasingly tounderstand that matter is really a vibration of energy. Electricity wasrediscovered in the early nineteenth century, and now, in the twenty-firstcentury, humanity is becoming dependent once again on a view of reality thatsees energy as fundamental to all its functioning.When Dwapara descended to Kali Yuga, the science of yoga, the essence of whichis based on an understanding of the subtle energies in the body, was lost.General understanding of this science degenerated to a definition of yoga asHatha Yoga: mere physical positions and breathing exercises. Hatha Yoga in factdeveloped out of the third “limb,” or stage, of Patanjali’s exposition on thestages of enlightenment, which people mistakenly call his “Ashtanga Yogasystem.” It is not a “system,” for what he did in fact was systematize theuniversal stages through which the spiritual seeker, whatever his religion, mustpass. Those stages entail a gradual withdrawal of energy and attention from theouter body to the spine; raising the energy in the spine; and the gradualabsorption of one’s energy and consciousness in the love and bliss of God untilthe absorption becomes complete.The third of these stages is asana, or perfect stillness of body, with an erectposition and a straight spine. Patanjali, to reiterate what we’ve said, wasdescribing the stages of withdrawal and absorption, and not specific yogapractices. The Hatha Yoga system was based on his third stage, and was intendedto help yoga practitioners to achieve calmness of body and mind, physical andmental relaxation, and centering the energy in the spine.That highest yoga was revived again by Lahiri Mahasaya of Varanasi, who receivedit from the great avatar Babaji in the Himalayas, giving it the name, KriyaYoga. The Himalayan masters had perceived that it was time, in this re-ascendingyuga, to resurrect the formerly held, deeper perception of man’s inner nature.Paramhansa Yogananda, an outstanding exemplar of this teaching, was sent to theWest to carry this ancient science to all mankind. After Swami Vivekananda, whomay be described as having “broken the ice,” Yogananda may be described ashaving taught people how to swim.Dharma, during Satya Yuga, has been described as four-legged; during Treta, ashaving three legs; during Dwapara, as having two; and during Kali, asfunctioning on only one leg. During Kali Yuga, in other words, dharma is stillable to stand, but only precariously. Man can enjoy (though with less energy,and therefore only relatively) his pleasures of the moment, but he cannotconnect them to their inevitable consequences: for example, a depletion ofenergy and premature old age from sexual overindulgence; a serious, permanentloss of mental clarity from overindulgence in alcoholic drink; a steady increaseof selfishness and self-indulgence (these being, simply, diseases of the ego)and an excessive attachment to wealth. During Kali Yuga, it is difficult for manto perceive that every state of consciousness already contains its opposite:that, in happiness, suffering is already present; and that (fortunately)suffering already contains at its center the seeds of joy.Thus, in these two stanzas we see hope also in the opposite reality: there existalso, in the gradual loss described by Krishna, the seeds of future renewal andreacquisition.(4:3) Today I have taught you, My devotee and friend, that ancient science ofYoga, the secret to the highest blessings for mankind.It is a thought wondrous to contemplate: As the devotee advances spiritually, heis accepted by the Lord Himself not only as a devotee, but as a friend. Therelationship with God as Friend is in some ways the sweetest. For even thethought of God as Mother, which many consider the sweetest of all relationships,carries a hint of the human presumption that God must take care of us and pardonall our sins. As Yogananda taught people to pray, “Mother, naughty or good I amThy child: Thou must release me!” When one is advanced enough, however, to thinkof God as Friend, there steals into the heart that sweet confidence by which onefeels, “But of course You love me! I am Yours; You are mine. How could either ofus ever turn away from the other? We are one!”The very science of yoga should be taught and practiced with love, and not as aninvitation to ego-boosting power. Love and devotion help the seeker to grasp thetrue essence of Yoga, which unlocks the inner door to the highest blessings thatare knowable.(4:4) Arjuna said: Vivasvat lived in far-off antiquity, whereas You are ofrecent birth. How am I to take this statement that it was You who first taughtthis sacred Yoga to mankind?Arjuna invited Krishna—for the sake of all devotees—to announce his formerincarnations on Earth: many times, for human salvation.Did Krishna really teach the yoga science from Earth’s earliest beginnings? Howlong has man been plowing earthly fields, raising cities, worshiping in loftytemples—and ever seeking the key to happiness, which only a few in every agediscover to be Perfect Bliss?Mahavatar Babaji announced to his disciple Lahiri Mahasaya that he himself wasKrishna in a former earth incarnation. My Guru told me that Lahiri Mahasaya wasRaja Janaka, of Ramayana fame. Paramhansa Yogananda said that he himself wasArjuna, to whom Krishna in that life delivered this most famous of alldiscourses, the Bhagavad Gita.I myself have come to feel, after years of editing Yogananda’s writings, thatour entire line of gurus—Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Swami Sri Yukteswar, andParamhansa Yogananda—have come back again and again for countless aeons—andperhaps even from the beginning of human history—as saviors of mankind. No doubtthere are other lines of great masters also who, in their compassion forhumanity in its suffering and confusion, have returned again and again to thisplanet.I once asked my Guru, “Have I been your disciple for thousands of years?” Hereplied, “It has been a long time. That’s all I’ll say.”“Does it always take such a long time?” I asked (wanting reassurance that Iwasn’t the only laggard!).“Yes,” was his reply. “Desires for name, fame, and so on take them away againand again.”How long has mankind inhabited this planet? Not the few thousand years claimedin modern tradition. My Guru once stated that the time span of human historycovers over fifty million years!(4:5) The Blessed Lord said, Many have been My births, and many also yours. Iremember all of Mine, though you remember yours not.Had Arjuna actually forgotten his former incarnations? I doubt it! In theBhagavad Gita he plays the role of earnest seeker. It is clear to me, however,that he was already a free soul. It was said even during his lifetime withKrishna that they had been together long before as the ancient sages Nara andNarayan.A story was told about Nara: One day Maya (Satan) tried to tempt him bymaterializing a supernally beautiful woman. As she stood alluringly before him,he gazed at her calmly, then materialized another hundred women, each one asbeautiful as the first. What could Satan do? He had to give up!(4:6) Though I (a fully liberated soul) am the Lord of all creation, and am inMy true Self—and abiding (ever) in My Cosmic Nature—forever unborn, yet I, by Myyoga-maya, assume (from time to time) an outward form.(4:7,8) O Bharata (Arjuna)! whenever virtue (dharma) declines, and vice(adharma) is in the ascendant, I incarnate Myself on earth (as an avatar).Appearing from age to age in visible form, I come to destroy evil and tore-establish virtue.There is a belief in India that the word avatar applies only to certain very fewmasters. Rama and Krishna are believed to have been avatars of Vishnu. Accordingto legend, Kalki avatar is supposed to be Vishnu’s next incarnation. I explainedearlier that avatar really has a much broader meaning. It might help here toreview these teachings of Sanaatan Dharma (the eternal religion).Vishnu, to begin with, is not literally a person, but is that aspect of AUMwhich acts as Preserver. No master can be an avatar of Vishnu except insofar ashe manifests God in the aspect of the Preserver of dharma.My Guru once replied to me in response to a doubt I had voiced. “When you areone with God,” he said, “you are God.” There is no higher state than onenesswith God.Some religious believers insist that this saint or that one never incarnated onearth before, or that he or she was always perfect even though having lived onearth before. These are pious myths, without foundation in truth. It is truethat even a master may sometimes make the statement, “I have not lived before.”His words must be understood correctly.Krishna states here that he was never born: He then goes on to say, however,that he has appeared repeatedly on Earth. It is similarly legitimate for anyonewho has transcended ego-consciousness to claim that he has never been bornbefore, for he sees clearly that it was always God alone who appeared, throughhim.Christians claim that Jesus Christ is the only Son of God. Yogananda said,“Jesus could legitimately say that, because he had attained oneness with theChrist consciousness, which is the only reflection of the Spirit (beyondcreation) and is therefore omnipresent in creation. Any soul that realizes itsoneness with Christ consciousness (the Kutastha Chaitanya) may rightfully beconsidered, in the same way, one with the only Son of God. He cannot, however,be less the Son of God than Jesus Christ was.”Hindus, similarly, think of Krishna as a special manifestation of God. Yoganandaexplained that creating one special manifestation of Himself and labeling itunique—whether as “God” Himself or as “the Son of God”—is simply not the divineway.Think of the vastness of the universe! A hundred billion galaxies, each one withan equivalent number of stars, and many of those stars, at least, supportingpopulated planets. (Hindu tradition states, and Yogananda fully endorsed, thatthe universe is filled with living, conscious beings. So-called UFOs, he toldus, are simply matters of fact.)Then think of this little mud ball, our Earth: It is not 6,000 years old, asChristian church tradition once averred: It is very, very old. Think of thehuman race also as ancient—possibly millions of years old. And think of God,then, as having one special son, or as becoming one special manifestation ofHimself, or even as becoming a limited succession of manifestations. God isInfinite Consciousness. Only Kali Yuga consciousness could have visualized Himas uniquely possessing a human form—as people believed the Earth was the centerof everything, and still believed as late as the end of the nineteenth centurythat our sun was the center.Once every soul encased in an ego prison realizes itself as the Infinite, and nolonger one little “sliver of glass” individually reflecting the cosmic light, itbecomes the Infinite—God Himself. There is no difference, in essence, betweenKrishna, Jesus Christ, Buddha, or any other great master. There is nodifference—again, in essence—between them and the rest of us, once we realizeourselves as the one God who, for a time, thought himself encased in these humanegos. Everything is God. In God, all comparisons and relativities cease. Thesoul of Everyman was never born; nor did it ever die. In Vedantic truth therewas always only one reality, one Spirit: the Supreme Lord.Thus, any soul that has achieved complete liberation, not only from present egobut also from the memory of all past egoic involvement, becomes that SupremeSpirit. Most souls, after many incarnations of struggling to reach that state,are satisfied to remain in blissful union with God for eternity. A few only, outof compassion for mankind, preserve that little “desireless desire” which bringsthem back to earth as avatars for the salvation of many. No avatar, however, inultimate Reality, can be greater than any other.What would be the sense in God’s creating a perfect being as an example toordinary human beings, who are struggling to attain perfection? It would be likesaying, “You yourselves (poor fools!) can never be perfect, but do try, anyway!”No avatar was ever created perfect. All of them were once like us, imperfecthuman beings who were finally washed clean in the realization of their owndivinity. Orthodox religionists call this concept impious, but no master evercame to earth to show people how great he was. All of them came to show us ourown divine potential. Jesus Christ is quoted, in the Book of Revelation, assaying, “Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, andhe shall go no more out. . . . To him that overcometh will I grant to sit withme in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in histhrone.” (Rev. 3:12,21; italics added)In this world of relativities, however, greatness is gauged in other ways. Thus,it is humanly acceptable to consider one master greater than another, or thanmany others, not by the standard of his inner greatness (his oneness with theInfinite, which is the same for all), but by the outer standard of the good hehas done in the world.My own Guru had a worldwide mission. In worldly terms, he was a very greatmaster. I met another master, however, who (as my Guru himself told me) hadachieved final liberation. This master had very few disciples, and was virtuallyunknown in the world. I asked this master why he didn’t do more for mankind.With beautiful simplicity he replied, “I have done what God wanted done throughthis body.” From a world-renowned master to one who was known by very few: theworld would say the one was a world wonder, and the other a non-entity. In God’seyes, however—the one Unbribable Judge, whose only standard is truth itself—bothmen were not only completely equal, but were one! Indeed, they shouldn’t even beconsidered human beings! They were the ever-blissful Brahman Himself.These stanzas of the Gita are often translated personally in another way also,to mean that God destroys evil-doers. God never destroys anyone! The only thingHe destroys—the only thing He can destroy, since He cannot destroy Himself—isevil itself: never the evil-doer.(4:9) One, O Arjuna! who by intuition comprehends the truth of My divinemanifestations and selfless deeds in this vibratory universe, will never again,after he leaves his body (at death), need to incarnate in outward (egoic) form.(Soaring in freedom,) He will attain Me.The terms, “ego,” and “freedom,” stand in mutual contradistinction to oneanother. The ego is endlessly constricting to the soul, for it insists onidentifying itself merely with petty expressions of its infinite potential. Thedelusive freedom to “do as one likes” is self-demeaning, for it keeps oneidentified with his little body, whereas one’s own nature calls out in longing,“Let me soar high above the conflicting ripples of likes and dislikes. Let merise in the endless skies of the joy of my true Being!”To know the ways of God is to identify with those ways, rejoicing in them as ourways.(4:10) Purified by ascetic wisdom, released from attachment, fear, and anger,and completely absorbed in Me, many have attained (oneness with) Me.“Many have attained Me.” Truth seekers must understand that finding God is notlike the supreme effort required, say, to climb Mount Everest, theaccomplishment of which is more arduous (if not life-threatening) at the endthan at the beginning. Finding God is the simplest, most obvious, and mostsupremely natural thing to do in the world! At the end, one doesn’t find oneselfstraining with desperate, heroic zeal to merge in Him. Rather, one relaxes,supremely, into perfect Bliss. Strain, tension, ardor, heroic zeal: these, forthe soul, end forever. What is left is Satchidananda: ever-existing,ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss.(4:11) O Partha (Arjuna)! In whatever way I am approached, in that way do Irespond. All men come, by whatever path, to Me.(4:12) Those who work to fulfill their earthly desires worship the gods (whichare ideals in various forms; they are not idols!), aware that success of thiskind can be reached with relative ease.Lower aims are achieved more quickly and more easily than supreme devotion toGod. To build a house, one consults an architect and a builder (lower gods, in asense); one doesn’t confine himself to his meditation room and offer up prayersto God that He manifest a house! If one thinks to achieve perfect happiness inan ideal home, however, he will eventually be disillusioned. Boredom will setin, termites will invade and destroy the building. Or else, neighbors will bealienated out of envy. Nothing works for long in this world. Whendisillusionment ensues, people turn away to seek their fulfillment elsewhere.This is a roundabout way to God, but it, too, reaches toward Him at least,inasmuch as repeated disappointments do, eventually, turn one’s heart to Him.Thus, even though material fulfillment, sought in material ways or inego-inspired appeals to some lower “god,” can bring relatively speedy results,those results are like cement walls built with too much sand and too littlebonding cement: they soon crumble to nothing.(4:13) An admixture of the three gunas (the essential qualities) with thediverse karmas of individuals produces the four castes. Though I am active increation through these influences, know that I (in My Self) am ever actionlessand unchanging.We have already discussed the gunas (qualities) and the caste system. Theadditional teaching, here, is the great truth that action itself is an illusion.God “acts, but doesn’t act,” for everything is a dream. A dreamer may do manythings—swim, climb mountains, go to war—yet, on waking, he sees that his bodynever stirred from his bed.As Paramhansa Yogananda explained (this point, too, was touched on earlier), themotionless consciousness of Absolute Spirit is reflected at the heart of everyatom. At the center of all movement, there is rest.(4:14) Though acting, I am without attachment; nor do I desire any particularoutcome from (any) activity. He, similarly, who is one with Me, and identifiedwith My nature, is unfettered by (the slightest) desire for the fruits ofaction.(4:15) Understanding this (the nature of right action), the wise since earliesttimes have acted dutifully. Be like them (acting without desire for the fruitsof action).(4:16) What, indeed, are action and inaction? Even the wise (can become)confused on this point. I will explain the distinction, (armed with whichknowledge) you will be freed from all evil.The “wise,” here, are those who have yet to attain the highest state, nirbikalpasamadhi, for actions performed with full divine awareness will obviously bedutiful always. With the wisdom achieved even in sabikalpa samadhi, however,from which one must still return to outward awareness, the ego can still holdthe thought, “I am the doer.” In this simple thought lie the seeds of all evil:dormant, but waiting.(4:17) The nature of action is difficult to comprehend. To understand it, knowthe difference between right action, wrong action, and inaction.One can act with great energy, and work himself to exhaustion, yet accomplishnothing: by pushing strenuously, for example, on both sides of a door. Rightaction, spiritually speaking, is action with that attitude which leads tosoul-freedom. That attitude includes non-attachment to the fruits of action, andacting with the consciousness that God is doing everything through one. Actioninspired by His consciousness and energy, with its results offered to Himwithout any ego-involvement, is right action.Right action is not necessarily that which other people consider right becauseit pleases them. It can be relatively right, however, if it is self-improving(either physically, emotionally, or mentally): for example, wholesome physicalexercise; efforts to develop concentration and will power; to acquire clarity ofthought; to develop calm upliftment and expansion of feeling. All these areright action, for they help to “prepare the troops” for the great “war ofKurukshetra.”Wrong action is anything that nourishes the ego, whether by contracting it inselfishness or by inflating it with pride. Clearly, in the relativity of things,there can be a mixture of right and wrong action. Developing one’s physicalstrength, for example, can help (as Yogananda put it) to prepare the body andmake it fit for God-realization. If, however, the mind has not been preparedalso by right understanding, one may become proud of his physical prowess. Inthis case, right action can be diminished in its good effects, or evennullified, by wrong action.Most activity in this world consists, in one way or another, of a mixture.Therefore, spiritual development, which ought to be simple, usually becomescomplex and difficult. An invading army may make great inroads on one or morefronts into enemy territory, but on other fronts may find itself beaten back.Getting all one’s forces aligned in the war against evil requires consummategeneralship.Inaction, as we have seen already, is impossible. It can seem inactive, however,like the example of two equal forces pushing on both sides of a door withoutever moving it. Thus, one may exercise physically and strengthen the muscles,but eat wrongly and thus, in other ways, weaken his body. As with right action,true inaction is possible only in God, in the perfect relaxation and rest ofecstasy.The secret, essentially, is quite simple: Since the goal of spiritual evolutionis to sublimate the ego by self-expansion into Cosmic consciousness, whatevertakes one in the direction of ego-sublimation is right action. And whateveraffirms the ego, or blocks efforts to sublimate it, is wrong action. And that,finally, which saps or otherwise dulls efforts at ego-sublimation, is inaction.(4:18) He is a yogi of true discernment who sees inaction in action, and actionin inaction. He is wise among human beings, for he has attained the goal of(all) action (and is free).(4:19) He who never acts motivated by personal desire, whose (ego-binding) karmahas been consumed in the fire of wisdom: such a one (alone) may be consideredwise.(4:20) The wise, having relinquished attachment to the fruits of action, (being)ever contented and free (in the Self), do not (really) act even if they appearto be intensely busy.(4:21) Even in doing physical labor (as opposed to meditative work) one incursno (karmic limitation) who has renounced all sense of possession, who is withoutpersonal desires, and whose feelings (chitta) are controlled by the inner Self.Performing good actions even with a wrong motive, my Guru used to say, is betterthan not acting at all. Inasmuch as everything in this world is relative, allaction must be adjudged good or evil according to the direction it takes one.What is good for one person might be bad for another.Were a Mahatma Gandhi or a Jesus Christ to awaken one morning with theresolution, “I’m tired of serving humanity. From now on I want to work hard andbecome a millionaire!” wouldn’t everyone, including the grossest materialist,exclaim, “That man has fallen!”? But were a lazy lout, on the other hand, torouse himself from his bed of inaction one morning with the same resolution,wouldn’t everybody—even saints—pronounce his intention to be right and good? Itis all a question of where one is coming from, and where one is going.Digging a ditch—mere physical labor, in other words—can be either good, bad, orself-stultifying depending on one’s attitude while working. Two people can workside by side at the same job, yet one of them, motivated by ego-inspired fearsor desires, acts in ego-bondage; whereas the other, having no other motivationthan to please God, acts in spiritual freedom.(4:22) He is free from karmic involvement who is contented with whatever comesto him uninvited; who is even-minded and untouched by duality; who is withoutenvy, jealousy, and animosity; and (finally) who views success and failure withequanimity.Though we have dealt with this subject before, it might be well to consider onceagain, briefly, the opposite case: one who allows himself to be upset by theunexpected; who is always jumping with joy or bowed down with disappointment;who is full of envy, jealousy, and hatred; and one, finally, who rejoicesgleefully in success and is emotionally devastated by failure. Do such peopleever know peace of mind? For one who has no inner peace, as Krishna statedearlier, how is happiness possible? What passes in worldly minds for happinessis usually nothing but emotional excitement, or (sometimes) a temporary releasefrom some cause of agitation or suffering. Excitement leads to fear, doubt, anduncertainty. Temporary release from excitement leads not to contentment, but toeventual apathy and boredom.It is interesting to notice how automatically people reveal, by their gestures,the way the energy is flowing in their bodies. See, when they are excited, howthey jump up and down. It is because of the upward movement in the ida nadi inthe spine. And see also how little children, who are the least inclined tocontrol their displays of emotion, may indicate a downward movement of energy inthe spine through pingala nadi by flinging their arms downward, stooping,stamping their feet, exhaling repeatedly with loud cries, even rolling on theground and pounding their fists: all these downward gestures indicating thedownward direction of their energy.Contentment is itself a virtue, and not merely a consequence. It should bepracticed consciously. One should tell himself, “I need nothing! I need no one!In my Self I am free!”(4:23) All the effects of karma (action) are nullified (in oneself), and oneachieves liberation, when ego-attachment ceases, when one becomes centered inwisdom, and when all one’s actions are offered up (in sacrifice) to theInfinite.(4:24) For such a person, (both) the act of self-offering and the offeringitself are, equally, aspects of the one Spirit. The fire (of wisdom) and theperson making the offering are both Spirit. In this realization, the yogi, freedfrom ego-identification, goes straight to Brahman (Spirit).Any karma (action) performed has consequences—no less so in the case of aliberated master than of the worldly person. The difference is that, since theactions of a master are not performed with ego-identification, the effects ofthat action are not bound to ego, and flow out freely into the world, bringingonly beneficial results. Their objective rewards are reaped by those who are intune with them and accept them lovingly.It is important for people when performing any religious ritual to understandthe hidden purpose of ritual itself. If it is truly religious in nature, itserves the symbolic purpose of offering the ego up into a higher reality. Even asimple bow is a gesture of self-offering. The ego, which is physically centeredin the medulla oblongata (at the base of the brain), becomes relaxed at thatpoint when one bows, and is offered forward. (Such at least, is the intention.)Properly, that offering should be directed to the spiritual eye in the forehead(the positive pole of the medulla). People generally, however, consider a bow tobe an outward gesture: to something, or to someone, before them. Arati (aceremony of waving light before an altar) is a symbolic offering of one’s ownlight and energy up to God. Puja is performed by offering all the five senses,signifying ego-consciousness, up to God’s representation on the altar. Yagyaoffers ghee (purified butter) and rice into the sacrificial fire—again, tosymbolize various aspects of self-offering.The Christian Eucharist, too, represents a commemoration of the Last Supper, andthe worshiper’s gratitude for what Jesus Christ brought to mankind. Thisceremony is traditionally followed by receiving bread and wine, symbolic of theblessings brought to mankind by Jesus.Hindu ritual is followed by the offering of prasad, to indicate—symbolically,again—the receiving of God’s grace. Arati, too, is ended by the light beingtaken around to everyone, that all may receive God’s light symbolically intothemselves.The entire spiritual path consists of offering up the ego to God forpurification, and of receiving His grace (kripa) in return. Only thus can oneeventually attain oneness with Him.Religious rituals should be performed with both interiorized consciousness anddevotion—not absent-mindedly, with mumbled words and vague gestures. The morewhole-heartedly one can immerse himself in the feeling as well as the meaning ofthe ritual he performs, the more he will absorb divine inspiration into himself,until his very life becomes a ritual of self-offering, or yagya, to God.The subsequent stanzas of the Bhagavad Gita all concern themselves with thevarious types of rituals that are performed by different spiritual aspirants.(4:25) Some yogis there are who make sacrifices to the devas (deities); otherssee sacrifice (yagya) as an offering of the self into the cosmic fire of Spirit.Most people find it difficult to love God as an abstraction. He is pureconsciousness, but they find it easier to endow Him with a form that representswhatever divine aspect or quality most attracts them. God is beyond all forms,and is supremely impersonal. At the same time, God has also taken on every formin the universe. He is impersonal in that He wants nothing for Himself. In eachof us, however, He has become personal by encasing His consciousness in ourforms. He loves us individually, on our own level of understanding. Thus, Hesuffers in (and for) those who suffer. Yet in Himself He is perfect Bliss. Herejoices in our earthly joys, yet in Himself is not identified with them. Thecase is similar to a mother and her children. When they weep, she feels theirpain, but at the same time, in her self, she feels no pain.Many people imagine that true sympathy for others means to suffer with them.True sympathy should, however, be useful. If someone were drowning, would ithelp him to jump into the water and drown with him? Obviously not! One can befar more useful to him standing on dry land and throwing him a rope.Alternatively, if one wants to help him more closely, he’d better be sure thathe himself is a strong enough swimmer. Truly to help someone who is sufferingmeans to give him a comfort he can accept: joy, above all, and kindness, andcalm understanding (from a point of wisdom higher than his own confusion andpain)—but to express such feelings outwardly only to the degree that thesufferer can receive them.God is impersonal. With mankind, however, He is also very personal—closer to useven than our thoughts. The reason He doesn’t always respond when we call Him isthat, as my Guru put it, “He knows most people only want to argue with Him!”Thus, to visualize perfect love, for example, in a form which the human mind cancomprehend may mean to worship “Him” as the Divine Mother, or as one’s IdealBeloved, or as one’s Perfect Friend. Whatever quality most attracts the heart’sdevotion can be mentally clothed in a form that, for the individual worshiper,epitomizes or expresses that quality.The deeper one goes in devotion, especially after receiving in his heart someanswer from God, the more that form which he has visualized fades intoformlessness, as the state of consciousness behind one’s visualization isgradually perceived to be the eternal Formless Reality.Paramhansa Yogananda gave further advice on this subject: “Whenever God comes toyou in form—as, let us say, the Divine Mother—try to see in those eyes, not ahuman personality, but the consciousness of infinity.”The fact that Krishna in this stanza refers to yogis, and not to ordinarydevotees, suggests that he is speaking of the various forms in which sincereseekers worship the Supreme Lord. He would not describe yogis, whose goal isunion with God, as worshiping astral gods, to whom ordinary people appealprimarily for ego-gratifying boons.There is also a deeper meaning in this passage. In yoga practice, the meditatoroffers his Kundalini up to the “devas,” or “powers,” residing in the chakras,that all his energy may flow up the spine toward unity with God in the sahasrara(thousand-rayed “Lotus”) at the top of the head.(4:26) Other spiritual seekers offer their inner power of hearing and of theirother senses into the fire of self-control. Still others offer whatever theyhear or experience through their senses into the fire of a higher understanding.More is involved, it must be said, in offering the ego into the fire of Cosmicconsciousness than the mere thought of doing so—even as more is involved in“conquering” a mountain than simply leaping to the top. This stanza and severalmore that follow it cover this subject in a variety of ways. Each one is a meansof offering up the ego into superconscious expansion.(4:27) Others, by discrimination, offer up their sense activities, and theenergy within those activities, in the fires of self-control. (They askthemselves, “Who is seeing? Who is hearing? Whose energy is activating theexperience of these sensations?”)This method of offering ego-consciousness up to cosmic expansion comes down tothe question, finally, “Who am I?” First one asks, “Who is this that is eating?”“Who walks, when my body walks?” “Who, really, is breathing?” “Who thinks?” “Whois reacting with positive or negative feelings?” “Who is asking thesequestions?”And finally, again, “Who am I?”This is the approach of Gyana Yoga (the path of discrimination), but it is onethat everyone should include in his sadhana (spiritual practice). Watch yourselfeating, walking, breathing, conversing, thinking. Stand mentally aside from yourown body and mind. Become the silent observer of your own self. Gradually youwill feel inwardly detached, and will accept that you are another realityaltogether: the divine soul merely dreaming everything that happens to itsindividual-seeming consciousness.(4:28) Some offer up their possessions as oblations; some, their actions; othersconcentrate on withdrawing their energy by yoga meditation (offering it up as anoblation); and still others, holding strictly to a vow of self-restraint, offerup all their thoughts to God, practice introspection, and seek wisdom throughstudy of the scriptures.(4:29) One practice of yoga offers the incoming breath (prana) into the outgoingbreath (apana), and the apana into the prana, thereby, through pranayama(control of the energy), rendering breathing unnecessary.The physical breath, as we saw earlier, accompanies the upward and downward flowof energy through the ida and pingala nadis in the spine. Indeed, it is thisspinal flow of the energies, known as prana and apana, which prompts the lungsto inhale and exhale. Actually, prana also, more broadly speaking, means energyitself. Prana is Paraprakriti (as opposed to Aparaprakriti, Nature); it isimmanent as opposed to overt Nature: the hidden reality behind the wholematerial universe.The slow, careful, conscious circulation of energy around the spine constitutesthe ancient science known (since the time of Lahiri Mahasaya in the nineteenthcentury) as Kriya Yoga. This circulation magnetizes the spine, and redirects themental tendencies, called samskaras, toward the brain in a way interestinglyreminiscent of the realigning of molecules in a north-south direction in a barof metal. Similar to the bar magnet, the spine becomes magnetized in the sensethat the energy, flowing ever more unidirectionally up toward the brain, isdrawn into the deep spine, the sushumna, where, with the awakening of theKundalini, it rises through the chakras, lifting all one’s energy andconsciousness upward toward God. Thus, the energy is brought to the spiritualeye, finally to become united with sahasrara (the “thousand-petaled” lotus) atthe top of the head. That this yoga was taught not only in recent times (in thelate eighteen hundreds) but anciently is evidenced by this stanza, and also by alater one, in Chapter 5 of the Gita (5:27,28), where Krishna describes the needfor neutralizing the currents of prana and apana.Sincere aspirants often wonder, “If Kriya Yoga is such an exalted science, whyhas it not been published in book form, so that all might learn it?” Areasonable question, certainly. The masters themselves, however, have decreed itshould not be published, precisely because it is a teaching that transcendsreason itself. Right understanding of it depends on the unfolding intuition.Kriya Yoga, in order to be wholly effective, must be received not onlyintellectually (in written or spoken form), but vibrationally, in the form ofinitiation. A magnet is created either by electrical realignment of themolecules, or by close proximity to another magnet. Attunement with aGod-awakened guru influences the samskaras (comparable to the materialmolecules) to flow upward to the brain.We are dealing here with a reality subtler, and much more difficult to master,than mere molecules of metal. Without an experienced guide, even mountainclimbing can be fatal—though death, in this case, only ends a singleincarnation. Spiritual mistakes can be costlier, in terms of long-rangesuffering.Guidance from the guru is not only helpful: It is essential. This does not meanthat Kriya Yoga is dangerous. Far from it. But to take up Kriya Yoga signifiesentering seriously onto the path to God. It is not a game, and should certainlybe treated as a lifetime commitment. To treat it lightly is certainly, we shouldadd, not the best of karma. Kriya Yoga initiation was formerly given only tosannyasis (renunciates) whose lives were already vowed to the divine search.This restriction was lifted by Babaji, when he gave this sacred initiation toLahiri Mahasaya. The inward reason for his relaxing the ancient proscriptionswas that the earth had already entered into a new age, Dwapara Yuga, and mankindwas becoming more conscious of energy. Humanity as a whole is even now morereceptive to a teaching that focuses on the body’s energy. Nevertheless, anyyoga initiation, and especially into the ancient science of Kriya Yoga, shouldbe looked upon as a very sacred step in one’s life.Spiritual progress without the help of a true, or Sat, guru, cannot but be slow,haphazard, uncertain, and sometimes dangerous. The ancient tradition in India,where spirituality has been studied for thousands of years—not as a religion,but as a practical science (“practical” in the sense of results actuallyaccomplished)—has always insisted that a true guru is the sine qua non forspiritual success. Many spiritually ignorant people, even in India, insist thatwith literacy widespread today, and with books so easily available, spiritualteachings are accessible to virtually everyone and a guru is no longer needed.Truly, widespread literacy has had one unfortunate effect: the dissemination,not only of knowledge, but of ignorance!True understanding comes not by intellectual reasoning, but by intuition. Inner,intuitive attunement with the consciousness of the guru is what most surely anddirectly brings spiritual awakening.Has not everybody experienced, in the presence of certain people, a greaterfeeling of peace, harmony, and upliftment? If relatively ordinary people canaffect one in this way, how much greater must be the effect of one who is,himself, spiritually enlightened!In the Christian New Testament it is written, of Jesus Christ, “As many asreceived him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.” That is exactlywhat everyone needs: the power to rise! Such power cannot be self-generated. Theego, as we saw earlier, is already infected with the very disease (ignorance) itwants to banish from its consciousness. Only one who has himself escaped theclutches of ego-consciousness can, with his expanded consciousness, infuse intothe disciple’s awareness new insight, new understanding, and new power to risespiritually.Were such a sacred science as Kriya Yoga to be shouted from the housetops (asRamanuja shouted the sacred mantra, “AUM namo Narayana!” from the roof of atemple) it would lack an essential ingredient of success. In all Indiantradition, initiation into the spiritual “mysteries” by a true guru isconsidered more important than the teachings themselves. Ramanuja’s love andcompassion for mankind notwithstanding, his guru had been right when he enjoinedsecrecy on him. Perhaps Ramanuja had the spiritual power thus to initiate somany, as Sri Chaitanya, centuries later, inspired thousands with mahamantra(Haré Krishna, haré Krishna! Krishna, Krishna haré, haré! Haré Rama, haré Rama!Rama, Rama haré, haré!). In Chaitanya’s presence, indeed, thousands wereinspired, as by no means all are who exuberantly chant that mantra in thestreets in modern times. The tradition is that mantra diksha, or initiation intoa mantra, should be spoken into the right ear, and conveyed, rather than onlyuttered, with spiritual power.Kriya Yoga diksha is much subtler than mantra diksha. It involves not only thatwhich can be spoken with the tongue, or uttered mentally. Required also is anawareness in the spine, which must come from inside. This is why attunement withthe guru is so essential, particularly with Kriya practice. One should invitethe guru’s consciousness to awaken one’s own energy within the spine. This canbe accomplished only by mental, intuitive attunement with the guru: receivinghim deeply, as it says in the Bible, into oneself.How can one attune himself with the guru? One method is to gaze deeply into hiseyes—a photograph will do—and, visualizing him at the point between theeyebrows, to call to him deeply, “Introduce me to God!” One should then listen,or feel, in the heart. The heart is the body’s “radio station,” where the divine“program” is received, and where the guru’s blessings and power are intuitivelyperceived.Can this blessing be received at a distance? Can it be received after the guruhas left his physical body? The answer—as my Guru himself told me in specificterms—is that one needs at least one physical contact with him. That contact canbe transmitted through a direct line of disciples from a true guru. If, likeYogananda, he is a world savior, it is both right and fitting that those whocome after him give initiation in his name. Thus, subsequent generations ofdisciples will always refer back to the supreme power of that savior (an avatar)for their ultimate blessing.Students who have claimed discipleship to a great master, without having had atleast one direct contact outwardly, show by their very auras that they have notreceived the same blessing in their lives as those who have honored thistimeless principle.What should one do, when he feels the guru’s vibrational presence in his heart?He should release it from mental identification with the guru’s physical form,and feel it radiating outward from his heart as love and bliss, until it fillsthe whole body. The disciple should then try to expand those blessings outwarduntil he feels his consciousness infused by the guru. Thus, he should expandoutward beyond the limited, physical identity of the ego.The reason mantra diksha (initiation) is traditionally given in the right ear ispartly because that is the positive side of the body. There is a specialcorrelation also, however, between the inner right ear and superconsciousexperience. Listening there helps to attune one with AUM, the highest mantra ofall, the vibrational sound of the universe or “music of the spheres.”Listening to the sound of AUM in the right ear, one should extend that soundgradually to the left ear—then, as I said earlier, to the whole body. As onereceives AUM into his whole being, he receives also the guru’s inner blessingsand guidance. These things cannot be accomplished by tense striving, but only bydeep, upward relaxation into the inner, higher Self.(4:30) Some, regulating the flow of energy in the body by correct diet, offerall their energies into the fire of that (upward) flow. All the above seekersunderstand the meaning of self-offering (yagya, or sacrifice), the inner firewhich consumes all the seeds of karma.The first part of this sloka is sometimes coupled with Stanza 29. Indeed,“correct diet” refers also to something deeper than mere food for the stomach.When the prana and apana are neutralized in breathlessness, the body issustained by a higher, cosmic energy. What happens is that the body’s energy isthen connected directly to the medulla oblongata, by which connection the energyflows directly from a higher source, sustaining the body cells from within.Paramhansa Yogananda developed a system which he called “energizationexercises.” These, when practiced faithfully, keep the body fit and sustained bythat higher energy.Correct diet, normally speaking, should consist of what is considered sattwicfood. Such food is vegetarian, to begin with, lightly cooked or raw, but notovercooked since overcooking destroys the life force in food. Fruits and nutsare excellent. It seems unnecessary to cover this subject here, as many goodbooks are available on the subject. An interesting story may be told here,however, to show that Paramhansa Yogananda was no food fanatic. Indeed, as henoted, health faddists are often incapable of discussing anything but thephysical body and diet! To express what he considered the ideal diet, he coineda word: propereatarianism!One time Dr. Lewis, his first Kriya Yoga disciple in America, when he was stilla young man in his late twenties, complained to him of mysterious aches andpains he was having. “I’ve been to a number of medical doctors,” he said, “butnone of them has helped me. What can I do?”The Master, after a brief pause, said, “The cells in your body are accustomed toeating meat. Now that you’ve adopted a vegetarian diet, they miss their formeranimal fare! Eat a little bit of meat therefore, once a week. Avoid beef, veal,and pork, but do eat a little lamb, chicken, or fish.” Dr. Lewis followed thisadvice, and his problem soon disappeared.(4:31) By eating the “blessed food” (prasad) left from any of these spiritualfire rituals, one attains Brahman (the Infinite Spirit). Even the blessings ofthis world come not to him who gives nothing of himself. How, then, can he hopefor happiness in a better world?(4:32) The many ways of offering up the ego are de-clared in the Vedas (as if)through the “mouth of Brahma.” Knowing their true purpose (which is an upwardself-offering), you will be freed from all karmic bondage.From whatever direction one approaches a mountaintop, as long as he continuesmoving upward he will eventually reach the peak. What is all-important is thedirection of one’s climb. In the spine that direction, of course, is upward. Thespine is central in the human body. Whatever else one does spiritually, he mustalso awaken and raise the spine’s energy. This remains true even if one’s pathis devotional chanting, or serving the poor and other ways of helping to relievehuman suffering. He may follow the path of mental discrimination, distinguishingwhat is true from what is false in this world. If, however, his energy is notraised in the spine even by these indirect means, he cannot achieve spiritualawakening. True religion—inner experience, that is to say, not mere belief—isnot a question of pleasing some deity “up there.” We ourselves must raise ourown awareness to the superconscious level, which for us in the physical bodyexists only “up there.”Thus, yoga, and particularly the science of Kriya Yoga, is supremely practical.This teaching is universal, since it addresses the central reality of whatoccurs anyway on the spiritual path for every sincere aspirant, whatever hisoutward beliefs. Therefore it is that Krishna later on in the Gita says,“Arjuna, be thou a yogi.”What is this “spinal highway,” as Paramhansa Yogananda called it, described inthe yoga teachings? It begins with the Kundalini power, which lies as if asleepat the base of the spine. This is (in one frame of reference) the opposite poleto the heart; in another, to the medulla oblongata and the spiritual eye, and(finally) to the top of the head (the sahasrara). All one’s energy must at lastbe united in the sahasrara.The first chakra, at the bottom of the spine just above the Kundalini, is calledmuladhara, which represents the earth “element.” The opening of the centralpassageway (sushumna) in the spine is referred to in this verse as the “mouth ofBrahma.” This important center is the start of the long upward journey. “Here,”Krishna is saying, “is where it all begins.”Certain occult powers are attached to this chakra, as to each of the others.People sometimes fear to meditate on the lower chakras, thinking it mightincrease their connection with materialistic consciousness. It is a fact thatsense-bound individuals live centered mostly in their lower three chakras. Amisconception needs to be clarified here, however. When the energy flows outwardfrom these centers to the physical body, it induces body-consciousness. When itflows inward to the chakras, however, and then upward, it leads to spiritualawakening. Every chakra—even at this lowest point—brings heightened spiritualawareness when its energy flows upward.(4:33) The inner, spiritual fire ceremony of raising awareness is superior, OScorcher of Foes (Arjuna), to any outward act of self-offering. In this wisdom(alone) is all action (karma) consumed.Outward spiritual acts, meant as self-offering, have two major disadvantages:First, they act only indirectly on the energy in the spine, and are thereforeless effective in the only spiritual “work” that really counts:self-transformation, which also results in the highest good for other people.Secondly, they involve the mind outwardly, keeping it restless, and causing oneto forget easily such spiritual essentials as deep devotion of the heart.(4:34) Understand this (above all): By surrender (of self-will to the wise), by(sensitive inward and outward) questioning (of the wise), and by service (to thewise), those who have realized the truth will (be able to) convey their wisdomto you.This stanza is meant to be applied especially to one’s own Self-realized guru,if one is so blessed as to have been drawn to one. The plural is used here,however, to indicate the need for devotees to honor all enlightened sages,generally. Surrender to the Infinite God in them, openness (whether byquestioning or by deep, inward appreciation) to their uplifting influence, andsupport for that influence (through service to them) are important in helpingthe devotee to rise above the naturally narrow outlook imposed by the ego.Paramhansa Yogananda encouraged people to add to the prayers they offerregularly to God and guru (and, perhaps, to a line of gurus) these words ofinvocation: “saints of all religions.”(4:35) Having (fully) received that wisdom from a true guru, O Pandava (Arjuna)!you will never again fall into delusion, for you will behold all creationcontained within your (expanded) Self, and then (behold it) in Me (beyond allcreation).First the fully enlightened being perceives the whole universe as made of wavesof vibration dancing on the surface of his oceanic consciousness. His next step,if he so wills it, is to withdraw his consciousness from involvement with Natureinto what Yogananda called “the watchful state” of absolute, ever-motionlessConsciousness.(4:36) Even the worst of sinners can, using the raft of wisdom, safely cross theocean of delusion.Krishna offers this supreme encouragement to all humanity: No matter how steepedyou are in bad habits, vice, self-degrading depravity, or evil, you are still achild of the same infinite Lord who created masters and saints. Divine blissalone is your final definition forever!Never tell yourself, therefore, “I am evil!” Never say, “I have failed!” If youaccept any failure as your reality, it will be so at least for this lifetime.But if after every setback you say, instead, “I have not yet succeeded!” youcan—even in this incarnation—win your private war!Pray to God as the all-forgiving and ever-accepting Divine Mother: “Mother,whether naughty or good, I am Thy child! Thou must release me! Cleanse me of allsin.”“God doesn’t mind your faults,” Yogananda used to say. “He only minds yourindifference!”(4:37) O Arjuna, as fire burns wood to ashes, so does the fire of wisdom burn toashes all one’s karma.Think of the long-abandoned Egyptian tombs. Darkness reigned in King Tut’s tombfor thousands of years, yet once it was opened light came flooding in, and thedarkness of centuries was dispersed in an instant. The case is similar withevery individual. No matter how deep one’s shadows of unknowing, the momentGod’s light enters his consciousness there is nothing but light!Karma is of many kinds, since karma means only action. Karma can be national,communal, family, individual: anything that proceeds from a coherent center ofintention, which attracts consequences back to that center. Karma is personal. Anational leader who does evil on his people’s behalf, however, will not have tobear the entire weight of that bad karma on his own “shoulders”: The wholenation must accept the responsibility. Good people in that country must bear italso, though their own good karma may offset for themselves, and perhaps for awider circle of people, any evil that must befall the nation as karmicretribution.When an airplane crashes, not everyone who dies in that disaster does sonecessarily because it was his own karma to die. The group karma of the majorityof passengers might outweigh an individual, neutral karma—if, for example, hiskarma to live was not strong enough. It does often happen, on the other hand,that when some great disaster strikes, certain persons, unaccountably at thetime, are called away or otherwise prevented from being on the scene.Group karma is highly complex. Everyone’s first duty is to improve his ownkarma. Indeed, the more good one does by contributing toward a generalupliftment of consciousness, the more greatly will the general karma be helpedalso. One must begin, however, by uplifting his own consciousness.For the individual, two kinds of karma need to be considered: purushakara andprarabdha. Purushakara karma is actions generated in this life under theinfluence, not of habit or desire, but of soul-guidance. Prarabdha karma, on theother hand, consists of present tendencies, and the results of past actionsbrought over from former lives.Prarabdha karma is also of two kinds: those actions which, owing to presentcircumstances, are likely to bear fruit in this life; and those, known aspararabdha karma, which are being held in abeyance until more favorablecircumstances bring them to fruition.A man may have the karma, for example, to be drowned at sea—or, of course, to besaved from drowning at sea. If he never goes near even a lake, however, andtherefore is never in a position that makes drowning possible, that particularkarma will have to await another life to be worked out.Sometimes an unfortunate karma can be deferred and even offset by an oppositekarma. An unavoidable temptation, for example, may be met by newly acquiredinner strength that renders the temptation impotent. Karmic periods also pass,or are dissipated by offsetting actions. For example, a karmically “destined”failure may be deflected if one develops a new, more creative energy, or forthat matter if one develops the wisdom to redefine the blow as a newopportunity, and not really failure at all!A bad karma may loom over one like a dragon, ready to strike, but if one canfind a way of either deflecting that blow or protecting oneself (like using anumbrella when it rains), even though the blow can’t be avoided one may stillavoid disaster. One may also, of course, do as Saint George of English legenddid: slay the dragon. Certain it is that no threat of misfortune need ever beaccepted with supine resignation! A powerful will can overcome, or can at leastmitigate, virtually any misfortune that may await one.Bad karma can, for example, penetrate a weak aura, but be unable to penetrate astrong one. Again the damage it inflicts may be minimized. If it’s your karma tolose a leg, but your will is strong and you have deep devotion, you may receiveonly a scratch. Karmic consequences are inevitable, but how they are receiveddepends on many circumstances, most of which arise in the individual.Bad karma can also be offset by creating good karma. Good karma can be augmentedby more good karma directed toward the same end. Events that affect others neednot affect oneself, or at least not in the same way: The secret, in this case,is to maintain an attitude of non-attachment, not reacting emotionally. Indeed,emotional reactions can greatly augment any karmic effects. My Guru told a(probably mythical) story about a village in India in which three people diedunaccountably of some disease. The villagers, distressed, repaired in a group toa solitary sadhu (holy man) who lived outside the village, and asked him tointercede. The sadhu meditated, and found that the disease had been caused by ademon. He summoned the demon and told him, “This village is under my protection.Leave it alone.” The demon promised to obey.A week later, at least a hundred other people had died. It seemed a veritableepidemic. Again the villagers approached the sadhu and cried, “Your prayers havenot helped us. There must be a terrible curse on our village!”The sadhu summoned the demon again and scolded him, saying, “I told you thisvillage is under my protection. You promised to leave it alone. Now it appearsyou have broken your promise.”“No, I haven’t, Holy One!” protested the demon. “It’s true I killed the firstthree, but all the others died out of fear.”The ultimate way to escape the results of all karma is to “evaporate” thecausative ego, with its consciousness of identification with the little “cup” ofthe body. In deep meditation, that vapor of ego may rise and disappearaltogether in the sky of infinite consciousness.If the dragon strikes, and you are no longer there for it to seize you in itsjaws; or if the rock falls from on high but you have removed yourself from thespot where it falls; or if the fickle multitudes acclaim you (and, inevitably,expose you later on to the dualistic opposite of public opprobrium) and you arenot there to respond: What happens? The same actions occur, but they will notoccur to you.The jivan mukta (one who is “freed while living”), having dissolved hisego-awareness in infinite consciousness, no longer develops any new karma of hisown. Any deed he does from then on will accrue to the benefit of others—whostill, by the vortices of energy created by their own egos, can benefit from thegood deeds he performs for them. He himself, however, remains untouched even bygood karma. His prarabdha karma must play itself out, but it can no longeraffect him.When the jivan mukta has finally released into the free skies of Spirit thecountless actions of all the incarnations that his ego lived in delusion, hebecomes a param mukta: a supremely free soul.(4:38) Verily, there is nothing in this world so sanctifying as wisdom. In duecourse of time every devotee who is successful in his practices will realize inhis own Self the truth of this statement.(4:39) The person of devotion who is engrossed in the infinite, having broughthis senses under control, achieves wisdom, and gains that which he knows at onceto be perfect peace.Devotees who think a conflict exists between devotional love, yogicself-control, and true (as opposed to merely intellectual) wisdom, fail torealize that all these paths (devotion, yogic practicality, and calmdiscrimination) lead to the same one goal, resulting in the same onerealization.The word for devotion in this sloka is shraddha, which usually translates as,“faith.” The reference is to that kind of devotion which doesn’t hold God at adistance by appealing to Him for divine favors, but which, like an arrow, fliesstraight to the bull’s eye of divine love as the heart’s natural inclinationtoward its own, intuitively perceived Source.The highest culmination of perfect shraddha is, in fact, not love, but bliss.Love without the further aspiration toward Satchidananda (ever-existing,ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss) carries with it the ego-induced danger ofbecoming tainted by personal motive. It is good, certainly, to seek God for Hislove, but that love must be impersonal in the sense of wholly unselfish. Withoutabsolute Bliss as one’s goal, even the search for Divine Love contains thedanger that it may awaken the seeds of desire for personal love. True, divinelove is always expansive: from the little self to infinity. Its only motive isBliss alone.(4:40) The ignorant, the person who lacks devotion, the doubt-ridden: all thesemust perish. The man of vacillating temperament finds no happiness in this worldor the next. For him, supreme bliss is not possible.To be truly ignorant is to reject with a dull heart any offer of a way out ofthe mud flats of nescience. The truly ignorant, in their stupor, ask noquestions of life, and recognize no opportunity for self-improvement even if itoffers them everything.Worse than being ignorant is the inability to feel devotion. High aspirationeludes such a person. Aspiration of any kind, indeed, seems to him foolish andunnecessary. To what (he asks) is there to aspire? Why strive for anything? Theless energy he expends, the less energy (he believes) will be demanded of him,the fewer challenges it will throw in his way, and the more, in consequence, hewill be left alone. How can those not ultimately perish who, buffalo-like,insist on wallowing in the mud of passivity? Stupidity, sloth, lack of any vitalinterest in anything: For people who cling to such mental sluggishness, themechanism of their life cannot but run down very quickly. They refuse theirminds and bodies even proper maintenance.The worst case, however, is that of the confirmed doubter. He has all theintellectual equipment he needs to rise to the heights, yet his compulsion is tokeep listing all the shortcomings, the drawbacks, and the mischief by whichothers might try to undo him. He has the devotion, and the desire to rise to theheights, yet a cynical inner voice keeps whispering in his subconscious, “Whatwill the end be—treachery? lack of appreciation? opposition? ingratitude?”Paramhansa Yogananda once commented, “The doubter is the most miserable ofmortals.” He was referring, not to constructive questioning, but to the naggingtendency to oppose every constructive idea, to prejudge it for no real reason atall, and to be disposed to reject everything wholesome or constructive. “Itcan’t be right—therefore it isn’t right! It can’t work—therefore no matter whathappens, it can’t really work—even if it seems to be doing so. People can’t knowwhat they’re doing—therefore they must be wrong!”To doubt a true teacher, especially if one is his disciple—owing to arrogance orsimply to a habit of mental rejection—causes seething turmoil in the mind. Oneassumes dejectedly that whatever the guru says must automatically be wrong: notbecause it has been proved wrong, nor even because one wants to disbelieve aconclusion that may simply be inconvenient, and not because one doubts theguru’s motives. . . . The doubter deeply desires something true in life, butcannot accept what he finds. A strange twist of mind rejects, not out ofdisinterest, but rather out of intense interest. His doubt is born of almost afear of finding himself deluded in the end, when he wanted so much to becertain.Were he indifferent, his condition might be better at least in the sense thathe’d then be able to direct his interest elsewhere. The tragedy, for him, isthat he desires—his whole being yearns for—the very truths which subconscioushabit impels him to reject. That habit proposes no acceptable alternative. Itsimply shakes its head and says, “No.” The truths he wants—so his habit tellshim—cannot possibly exist. The habit gives no reason. Darkly, instead, it posesthe dire warning, “What if . . . ?“What if all this should prove, in the end, to be chicanery? What if my guru’smotives be not so generous as they seem, and all he really wants is somehow tosqueeze others for his own benefit?” Such doubts quickly develop a life of theirown, and create for themselves an alternate universe: “What if—everything!?”One’s will power becomes paralyzed; hope withers away, and becomes in time a drytwig. The sweetness of friendship is soured by suspicion.For all the above reasons it may be justly said that the doubter is indeed “themost miserable of mortals.”Finally, the man of vacillating temperament can never accomplish anythingworthwhile. He will never commit himself to anything. He has no loyalties. Hedrifts through life as his whims waft him, settling on no truth, and foreveruncertain of anything.The determinedly ignorant person can only be left alone to his own ploddingrhythms. Eventually he will emerge from his self-woven cocoon: when he hassuffered enough, and when, through suffering, he begins to care and, in thecaring, to make the first, faltering attempts to develop his own latentabilities. Then he will emerge from his self-confinement.The apathetic may at least be aware that there are clouds of unknowing to beblown away. Although they’ve imagined that life has nothing more to offer them,when their dreams of passive contentment or resignation fade, they begin to lookaround anxiously for viable answers.It is the doubter, alas, who suffers the most. His thinking processes, despitehis longing to be good and to do right, become paralyzed. He yearns to findsomething on which he can fix as his ideal, but then tells himself that, for onereason or another, that ideal cannot exist. His tragedy is that he yearns forbliss, but finds bliss denied him by a compulsion in his nature that he can’tunderstand. How can he overcome this self-damning tendency?He must tell himself, “There is no road back. I have no choice but to goforward, even if it means only trudging heavily, one slow step at a time.” Hecan expiate his karma by helping others to resolve their doubts. He canconcentrate on his own yearning for truth, until the very yearning pulls him outof the dense fogs of doubt into the sunlight of a faith all the more certainbecause it has rejected gloomy speculation as a waste of time and energy.Helping others to resolve their doubts and uncertainties becomes, for him, a wayof affirming his own solution-orientation. For him at last, supreme blissbecomes the only possible solution to every problem and difficulty in life!(4:41) O Winner of (true) Wealth, Arjuna! one who has dissolved all his karmasin oneness with God, and has obliterated his every doubt by wisdom, becomescompletely self-possessed. (Ego-free,) no further action can entangle him.(4:42) Arise therefore, O Descendent of Bharata (Arjuna): Arise! Take shelter in(this greatest science of) yoga. Slash (to pieces) with the sword of wisdom thedoubt you feel in your heart as to the nature of the Self (and of who you are,in reality).Thus ends the fourth chapter, called “Gyana Yoga (Union Through Knowledge of theDivine),” of the Upanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue betweenSri Krishna and Arjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter SeventeenFREEDOM THROUGH INNER RENUNCIATION(5:1) Arjuna said: O Krishna, You speak of renouncing action, yet at the sametime You recommend it. I would like to know for certain, which of these two isthe better path?(5:2) The Blessed Lord answered: Both action and non-action, (when rightlyunderstood,) lead to salvation. Of the two, however, right action is better.In Chapter 3 of the Bhagavad Gita Krishna states unequivocally that it is notpossible, in this vibratory universe, to refrain from acting. Here he statesjust as unequivocally that both action and non-action lead to salvation. Is hecontradicting himself?It must be understood that non-action has a different meaning, here, frominaction. The meditating hermit is still acting, even though he sits for longhours in silent meditation—in some cases, even for days or months at a time. Thedifference is that physical immobility need not indicate mental inaction, orinactivity of the subtle inner energies. The deeply meditating yogi is certainlyactive, though in a very different way from most people. His action is inward:He is directing energy through the subtle nerves in the spine. He may, if he isa jivan mukta, be expiating the karmas of former incarnations by re-experiencinghis past deeds in vision, and offering them up on the altar of Spirit with therealization that, even while he was living in ego-consciousness, God alone wasdreaming his life and acting through his ego-delusion.The need to be outwardly busy disappears of itself when one attains the state ofjivan mukta, dissolving his ego in Cosmic consciousness. Even then, as Krishnahas already emphasized in the Gita, free souls who live in this world oftenperform outward actions in order to set an example of right living for others.They do so because ordinary persons would find it all too easy, once they takeup sannyas (the monastic path), to become mentally as well as physicallyinactive in the name of complete renunciation.My Guru said that many sadhus (“holy men,” persons dedicated to the spirituallife) go to the Himalayas for a life of “meditation,” but then, findingthemselves unable to meditate long hours at a time, spend the rest of their timesleeping, eating, and gossiping. Physical inactivity makes them becomephysically lazy. Having nothing to engage their minds actively, they graduallybecome also mentally lazy. Finally, having put their minds to sleep by mentalinactivity, they become spiritually lazy. What remains to recommend theirso-called “renunciate” way of life? Nothing! My Guru said, “Many saddhus becomebums!”Many such persons, he continued, allow “householders” to feed them, which thosepeople do willingly, having the means to do so and considering such service ameans of accruing good karma. Meanwhile, some of those “holy men” actually lookdown on the people who feed them and consider them merely worldly, bound to thewheel of samsara.It is sad that many renunciates in every religion, themselves “green” (in thesense of unripe) spiritually, tend to deprecate “householders,” when the entirepurpose of renunciation is to liberate ourself fully from ego-consciousness. Todeprecate anyone is to affirm one’s own ego. In fact, many sadhus, swamis,brahmacharis, hermits, and others, supposedly dedicated to living for God alone,allow their very life of spiritual dedication to feed their pride. Therenunciate should strive above all to sublimate his ego in self-offering to theinfinite.The practice of entering a monastery and being disciplined by monastic“superiors” (an unfortunate appellation, indeed!) has its good points, but italso has its bad. Submission to a true guru is essential in the search for God,for such a one knows the disciple’s karmic needs and can guide him in what hemust do, now, to escape the coils of past karma. The average monastery superior,however, has no such wisdom, and usually has the institution’s needs as hispriority, not the spiritual needs of the individual. Obedience to such a person,who is merely “the one in charge,” can controvert the subordinate’s real, butpersonal, spiritual needs, and may even ignore what the subordinate should do torise toward God-realization.The subordinate is commonly told, “The way to please God is to obey yoursuperior.” What, however, if the superior tells him to do something obviouslywrong, or against the subordinate’s conscience? The answer, for the subordinate,should be, Be careful! Obedience under such circumstances may be, or may beperceived to be, good for the community, but the consequences for the individualhimself (these were my own Guru’s words) is actually to weaken his will. Thestock answer given in monasteries is, “If your superior is wrong in what he asksyou to do, God will correct him.” Indeed? I have never seen this bit of“monastic wisdom” justified in real life.For many people, the monastic life is a wonderful way of serving and findingGod. The old model, however, of absolute obedience to anyone and everyone in thename of eternal salvation is archaic—indeed, it is medieval. What is neededalways, but especially in an age when people everywhere are becoming consciousthat the true nature of matter is energy, is for one to live more freely in theSelf—that is to say, in God. Those with some experience on the spiritual pathmay indeed be able to advise novices wisely; it would be ridiculous, indeed, inthe name of affirming one’s own free will, to ignore the voice of experience.Still, to be obliged to act merely to please someone who may, in fact, be not atall enlightened is to shift the burden of responsibility to where it cannot everbelong: onto someone else’s shoulders.Our responsibility before God is our own. As Krishna says in the Gita, It isbetter to fail doing one’s own duty than to succeed doing the duty of another.Whatever may truly be one’s own duty (and it is no easy task to discern whatthat duty is), one cannot accomplish it by simply handing that decision over tosomeone else.Many monks and nuns in monasteries become pale images of their former selves: ina negative way, unfortunately, not in a positive, egoless way. Many hermits andothers also, who justify non-activity by letting others feed them (while they“devote” their own lives to—well, to what? sleeping and gossiping?) become, insimilar fashion, shadows of their former selves. One encounters few lion- likesadhus and swamis anywhere: heroes who have risen out of the ashes offire-purified ego-consciousness to soar, like the legendary phoenix, in theskies of inner freedom.It would be well to consider also a word that is too often used in a deprecatorysense: “householder.” What is a householder? Many so-called householders have,to begin with, no houses to hold! They have no families (in the sense ofchildren of their own), no wives or husbands, no great attachment to theirpossessions. It is assumed that the term means they are involved in the struggleto acquire and exult over possessions and power, to dominate over others, and tonourish their own egos on the rich fare of worldly fame and admiration. None ofthese things add up to the word, “householder.” True saints, moreover, mayactually have the houses in which they live listed in their own names. Theycertainly are not householders, for they, in themselves, have no sense ofpossessing anything.The entire criterion must be raised to a higher level. The question is not whata person owns, or what he does. It is what he is, inwardly. Yogananda statedthat to fulfill one’s outward duties (as long as one still has duties toperform) is the higher path. It must be understood, however, that this is notintended as an excuse for running after worldly pleasures and“fulfillments”—which cease, in the long run, to be pleasures at all, and,instead of fulfillment, bring colossal disappointment!Whatever one does should be done not for egoic pleasure, but only to please God.Man’s duty in this world, once he develops even a little understanding of whatlife is really all about, is (as Krishna puts it) “to get away from My ocean ofsuffering and misery!” All else has one simply running in place and gettingnowhere. Worldly success and failure, triumph and disappointment, joy andsuffering—all these are mere waves that, occasionally, rise high on the ocean ofcosmic delusion, then sink back again to become equally deep troughs. There isno point to it at all! It is simply maya—God’s lila, or play. One who liveswithout ego-attachment gets to enjoy the show for a time, if he so chooses,before sinking back into the “watchful state” of Satchidananda: perfect bliss.Otherwise, the free soul acts in this world only to help others: thosestill-seeking travelers on the way, who aspire to eternal freedom as the only,eternal reality.To try to achieve union with God by serving others, while maintaining controlover one’s self, is what Krishna recommends here above mere non-involvement inactivity.The true nature of specific duty poses a more difficult question than thegeneral nature of right action—namely, without attachment to the results. It canbe defined broadly, however, as that action which leads toward calm, innerfreedom. Indefinitely continued involvement in that duty may come in time toresemble endless “forward movement” on a treadmill. The path of duty shouldnever be a downhill slide to mental stagnation. Always, whatever causes one’sconsciousness to rise in the spine is right activity.That, finally, is why Krishna emphasizes activity over non-activity.Non-activity leads ineluctably to mental dullness—unless one is able to engagehis energy positively in the performance of deep meditation.(5:3) O Mighty-armed (Arjuna), only that person deserves consideration as a truerenunciate who finds freedom from entanglement easy—having no likes or dislikes,and no attachment to duality.(5:4) It is the ignorant, not the wise, who speak of the paths of wisdom(Shankhya) and Yoga as being different from one another. One who is trulyestablished in either receives the benefits of both.(5:5) The state attained through wisdom (Gyana Yoga, the path of discriminationknown as Shankhya) is the same as that attained by action (the science of yoga).The two paths lead to one universal realization.(5:6) Renunciation, however, O Mighty-armed (Arjuna), is difficult to achievewithout God-uniting activity (yoga). By the practice of yoga, the muni (whosemind is absorbed in God) soon attains the perfection of oneness with theAbsolute.(5:7) No taint (of karmic entanglement) remains for him who has been purified byright action and, engaged in divine communion (yoga), has dissolved his ego (ininfinity), achieved victory over the senses, and realized himself as one withthe Self of all.(5:8) He who, in the state of union with God, has cognized the truth fullyunderstands: “I (myself) do nothing at all,” though he sees, hears, touches,smells, tastes, moves about, sleeps, breathes, . . .(5:9) . . . speaks, excretes, grasps (with his hands), opens or closes his eyes.Such a person knows at all times that (these) are but the senses engaging their(sense) objects.(5:10) As the lotus leaf is untouched by water, so the yogi who acts withoutattachment, self-offered to the Divine, is not affected by sensory experience(whether gross or subtle).The seeker must practice non-attachment to sensory experiences, for until hebecomes firmly established in the Self he may find himself drawn out of itinadvertently by the fascination of new experiences. Milk, when poured on water,commingles with it. The milk must be churned to butter before it can float onthe surface, undiluted. By practicing inner centeredness, the yogi is said to“churn the butter” of his awareness by separating the “curds” of firmunderstanding from the watery “whey” of sensory dependency. He can then goanywhere, do anything, mix with anyone and remain inwardly unaffected by theillusory attractions of maya.This stanza has a deeper meaning, which is why the common translations of“sensory experience” as “sin,” or as the perfectly logical “karmicinvolvement”—both of which versions seem to encompass the full meaning—are infact inadequate. Understood literally, and not figuratively to avoid what seemsotherwise merely an unnecessary repetition, the expression here becomes awonderful further explanation of the spiritual path.When the life force is withdrawn from outward body awareness during deepmeditation, the yogi beholds currents of energy trickling back through theflesh, like little rills of rainwater in a forest, to the great river of energyin the spine. When all of the body’s currents are in this way withdrawn, theythen pass successively into, and through, the three luminous nadis (channels) oflife force in the astral spine: the sushumna (which is outermost), the vajra,and then the chitra. Passing through the chitra, the energy and consciousnessenter the innermost channel, the brahmanadi, which constitutes the spine of thecausal body. It was through the brahmanadi that Brahma, the Creative aspect ofAUM, in His aspect of Creator of individual beings and their three bodies,descended into outward manifestation. It is through this final channel ofbrahmanadi, therefore, that the soul must once more ascend in order to becomeagain one with the Spirit. As the yogi withdraws his energy up through thisfinal channel, he is able fully to offer his separate, individual consciousnessinto Infinity.During this process, he beholds wondrous astral phenomena. This stanza of theGita is a warning not to be attached to such visions, either, lest they diverthim from his goal of complete union. The opening of brahmanadi is at the top ofthe head. On reaching this point, the yogi becomes reunited with omnipresence,for the last sheath has been removed that closes him off from Infinity.One who is tossed—let us say, in a rowboat—on ocean waves cannot see the broadsurface of that vast body of water. When he rises above it, however—whether bystanding on a cliff or by flying high in the air—he sees a vast panorama ofwaves. His attention is not necessarily drawn, then, to any one wave or smallgrouping of waves. The yogi, similarly, can behold the whole oceanimpartially—or, again, he can withdraw into the ocean depths, and, having nosingle specific point from which to gaze, but being rather one with all Spirit,he finds that in the very act of seeing he both is that act, and is that whichis beheld. Knowing, knower, and known become one.Meanwhile, remember something mentioned earlier in this book: If you go to visita castle, and pass through beautiful grounds, you can take the time to view thegrounds and wonder at all the plants, at the stream running through theproperty, and at the unusual trees and beautiful flowers, but that process maytake you so long that you’ll have to wait till another incarnation before youremember that you wanted to visit the castle! Far wiser is it to get to know thelord of the castle, first. He will show you around. Sharing its beauties withHim will be far more enjoyable for you, and you will fully understandeverything, instead of merely marveling.Powers, visions, and other phenomena can inspire, but if one allows himself todesire them, or to become attached to them, they can distract him from the pathto Supreme Truth.A disciple of the Master was experiencing his first Kundalini awakening, and wasenjoying the feeling of it rising joyfully in the spine. Pleased with thisphenomenon, he told the Master about it. The Guru, to prevent any foolishlypremature satisfaction on the disciple’s part, replied by exclaiming, “That’snothing!”From the above passages it must be understood that “action” and “non-action”convey meanings far deeper to the yogi than anyone can imagine who isspiritually asleep. All those meanings were intended by Lord Krishna in thesepassages of his great discourse, the Bhagavad Gita.A few disciples were lamenting that it takes so long to find God! To them theGuru said, “You have to live anyway! Why not live in the right way?”In truth, it takes no time at all to find God, since time itself is a delusion.In fact, moreover, it takes less time in this delusive world than people devote,at the beginning of their souls’ journey, to forgetting Him!(5:11) For purification of the ego, yogis merely work with the body, mind,discrimination, and sense organs: (They are) never attached to them.Yogis merely use the body; it never “uses” them. In other words, they never letany aspect of outward awareness exert the slightest compulsion on their will.In the way a carpenter, when using a hammer to drive nails into a board, maysay, “I am hammering the nail,” when in fact he is only using the hammer andknows very well that he himself is not the hammer—even so, people use theirbodies to work, their minds to observe consciously, their intellects todiscriminate, and their sense organs to perceive objective reality. Identifiedwith the body, they think, “I am doing whatever my body does.” Identified withthe mind, they think, “My awareness of what happens is defining the eventitself.” Identified with the intellect, they think, “I am thinking this thingthrough to its logical conclusion.” Finally, identified with the sense organs,they think, “I see; I hear; I taste; I smell; I touch. By these means I defineall that I experience in the world around me.”The yogi, by contrast, separates his self-awareness from what the body is doing,from what the mind observes, from what the intellect thinks, and from what thesenses tell him in any situation to be the case. He knows that he, himself, isnone of these, any more than the carpenter is his hammer or the nails he isdriving into a board.The distinction here is that, for the yogi (as opposed to the ordinary man),there is no thought of personal agency in anything he does. The yogi sees thebody not as his body, but only as something he uses. He understands that hismind is not his own: It, too, is something he works through. He perceives theintellect as separate from his true, inner perception. And he cognizes thesenses as cooperating with him, but independently from him.As the carpenter uses his hammer to drive nails into a board, so the yogi useshis very ego. He knows it is not his self, except in the sense that he, theinfinite Self, must keep that little unit of reality going.The body enacts his wishes as though it were a hammer: He himself, in hisexpanded reality, is not that body. He uses it impersonally, as an implement toaccomplish certain ends. He observes through his mind, but separates himselffrom the thought, “I am observing.” When discriminating, he thinks only, “Thisis the intellect discriminating: It is not I who draw these conclusions.” Heperceives through the senses, but never tells himself, “I am perceiving,” butrather is aware, “This perception is occurring.” He removes, from all that hesees and does, any sense of personal identification.The nerves are the main passages of life force in the body. They correspond tothe subtler, more refined nadis of the astral body. Ordinarily, the nervepassages of the human body are “clogged” with toxins owing to wrong diet, andare impaired in their functioning by unnatural living. Because man seeksstimulation from outside himself, instead of drawing on his inner, spiritualresources, he vitiates the nerves, which grow tired and become diminishinglyresponsive to the very things people look to for stimulation. An outward flow ofenergy soon becomes habitual, resisting meditative efforts to relax bywithdrawing into the Self. Yogis, therefore, advise purifying the nerves byproper diet, yoga asanas (postures), and the practice of yoga meditationtechniques, among which Kriya Yoga is pre-eminent.Asanas; mudras (asanas combined with special awareness of the flow of certaininner energies); pranayamas (breathing exercises that help to control the flowof energy); devotional chanting (for the very use of the voice in self-offeringto God can assist an upward flow of energy); prayers (which, apart fromappealing to God for an answer, help to focus one’s own thoughts and feelings);using consciousness and energy to penetrate through the spinal chakras;concentration on the Infinite; and the deep self-offering of heartfelt devotion:all these help to purify the heart’s feelings and the nervous system, making onefully receptive to divine inspiration.(5:12) The God-united yogi, relinquishing attach-ment to the fruits of action,attains unshakable inner peace. That person, however, who does not direct hisenergies (upward) toward union with God is ruled by desire. Attached to thefruits of action, he lives in (perpetual) bondage.The secret to divine freedom (this worthwhile thought cannot be repeated toooften) is to renounce ego-motivation. A person has no choice but to act,outwardly or inwardly, with thoughts and with subtle energy. He must in anycase, however, neutralize the vrittis, or eddies which draw the consequences ofevery action back to himself with the thought, “I did it; it is mine!”(5:13) When once the embodied soul has controlled the senses, and, mentallyreleasing every attachment to activity, remains blissful (and secure) in the“city of nine gates” (the physical body), he (himself) no longer acts, nor doeshe impose action on others (or on his outer senses).It is notable to how great an extent these slokas treat, not of the outer, butof the inner, “world,” which is “populated” by the thoughts, attitudes, andqualities of the meditating yogi. The very symbolism of the Mahabharata,emphasized from the beginning of the Bhagavad Gita, relates to the inner man: tohis “population” of millions of thoughts and tendencies.This last stanza might easily be taken to mean that the yogi who is completelytrue to himself will never impose his will on other human beings. Certainly thisis the outward, superficial meaning of this stanza. How we behave outwardly,however, is only a reflection of what we are in ourselves. The Gita is dealingprimarily with inner causes. Its assumption is that outwardly sattwic activitydepends on inner, sattwic attitudes. People who try to impose peaceful,harmonious behavior on the world without first changing themselves have graspedthe wrong end of the fire brand they flourish!Nevertheless, it is also true, and is a point never overlooked in the BhagavadGita, that outward right behavior helps to focus the mind inwardly on rightattitudes.The “city of nine gates” is, of course, a reference to the body with its twoeyes, two nostrils, two ears, two organs of excretion, and mouth. The yogi whohas renounced ego-consciousness dwells securely, at perpetual rest, within the“city” of his body. No enemy can attack him, for his energy (like the limbs of atortoise) has been withdrawn into the Self. He is no longer the body, but hasbecome like a certain yogi who, “saddled with” a nagging wife, told my Guru whenhe was a young boy, “She doesn’t know it, but I’ve escaped her! The ‘I’ shethinks I am is no longer there to be nagged!”(5:14) It is not God, the sovereign Self, who creates in mankind theconsciousness of acting in this world. God neither causes people to act, norentangles them in the (karmic) consequences of their actions. It is maya, thecosmic illusion, which acts through them.This stanza might seem mere casuistry: God might be taken as trying to shift theblame elsewhere by saying, “He did it!” In fact, however, it can be a great aidto the spiritual aspirant to realize how much a puppet of delusion he is. Godcreated the delusion, true. Yet God Himself remains unaffected by it, for in HisSupreme Spirit He is beyond all vibration. The yogi must feel, at his centerwithin, that he, too, is immovable and at peace. Maya (cosmic delusion) actsthrough him, but cannot define him.There is another “angle” on this teaching, however, which seems to contradictwhat has been taught above. Yogananda used to say, “It is better, if you docommit an error—whether slight or great—to tell yourself, ‘God did it throughme.’” He continued, “God likes that! For you will find it easier, if you do, torelease the feeling of guilt which makes people beat themselves, with thoughtslike, ‘I did that! Oh, how weak I am! How wrong of me! How sinful!’”My Guru used to say, “The greatest ‘sin’ is to call yourself a sinner.” Instead,if you don’t want to blame God (which Yogananda insisted, however, is perfectlyfine with God!), tell yourself, “Maya (cosmic delusion) committed this deedthrough me. I dissociate myself from everything connected with it. In my trueSelf, I am untainted and ever free!”“Of course,” my Guru added, “you must then act in such a way as not to committhat error again!”Every time you slip, instead of moaning, “I’ve failed! I’m a fallen soul!” tellyourself, “I haven’t yet succeeded!” If you do that, your words, instead ofaffirming negativity, will be an affirmation of eventual success.“The best time for sowing the seeds of success,” Paramhansa Yogananda used tosay, “is the season of failure!”(5:15) The All-pervading is not concerned about people’s sins or virtues. Wisdom(although the natural state of every man) is eclipsed by cosmic delusion.Mankind thus becomes bewildered (as to the difference between right and wrong).Yogananda often said, “God is not worried about your mistakes. All He wants fromyou is your love. Love Him ever-more deeply.” He used also to say, “God haseverything—except one: Loving you, He wants your love in return.”God (it should go without saying) is not affected by human errors. What is sin?It is only that: error! Because sin springs from delusion, it does not reallyexist. The thought that God could be “angry” with anyone is itself anerror—indeed, an absurd one! How could the ocean depths be affected by evenviolent storms at the surface?Imagine a young man brought up in a city slum, drawn almost inadvertently intosome local gang, then caught up in gang warfare during which he shoots someoneto death. He is then himself shot and killed. According to many traditionaldogmas (falsely named “orthodox”), he will be damned to hell for eternity.Imagine, then, some few billion years after the time of his death, some fellowinmate in that cosmic prison asking him, “What sin did you commit, to be downhere with the rest of us?”The “young” man scratches his chin awhile, then replies, “I don’t reallyremember!”Time and space are illusory. In God, neither exists. Billions of years are notessentially any different from one second. To human beings, a thousand years mayseem like “eternity.” Christian tradition promises a “millennium” as if thattime span meant something! Billions upon billions of years comprise, ineternity, not even the winking of the divine eye!The yogi should live mentally beyond time and space. How to do that? He canbegin by, in a sense, transcending space, becoming deeply aware of being righthere, wherever “here” is. As a diver at sea can plunge under the surface andfind himself in a medium where all seems one and the same, so even a travelerwho feels himself to be fully present, wherever he is at the time, thinks not ofwhere he came from or of where he is going. He is equally in both places, in asense, without being physically in either of them. The more he becomes centeredin himself, indeed—in his own depths—the more he feels that he is in contactwith things and with people who may even be far away. The best way to understandother people—and even abstract projects and problems—is to be centered withinoneself, first, and from that center to intuit realities with which he has nooutward connection. With practice, success can come to him with relative ease.The next stage is to try to live in the present moment. If one can do that—byliving behind the moment, as it were, in the Eternal Now—he will comprehend moreeasily what happened in the past, what is likely to happen in the future, andhow to condense into insights that require hardly a moment a labor that might,reasonably, take a person months or years.Paramhansa Yogananda could commune instantly—for in God, time is one eternalpresent—with people who lived thousands of years ago. Every person can achievecomparable feats, though he act from a lower level of realization. Try it:Withdraw deeply to your own center; then think of someone who lived long ago,and focus your mind at his center. You will see that, from your center to his, aconnection forms—as if your two islands, seemingly separated by ocean water,were connected more deeply by the earth underneath. Everyone who is not you issimply your own deeper Self, manifested differently, in a different form, andeven at different times.A sense of the oneness of all life helps the meditating yogi to approach Godwithout fear or tension: to relax completely in divine love. Whatever happens inyour life, you are one with the great ocean of Truth. Nobody, however viciouslyhe treats you, can take away your love for God, or, in all eternity, God’s lovefor you. God and God alone is your true treasure.The person living in delusion cannot banish that delusion by discriminationalone (for his mind is already hypnotized by the seeming reality of that whichhe wants to dismiss), but by offering it up to God. God then, in His infinite,divine compassion, will send the seeker an enlightened guru whose liberatedconsciousness will lift him out of the mire he struggles to escape.(5:16) In those, however, who have banished ignorance by wisdom, the true Selfshines forth with effulgence like the sun.(5:17) Their thoughts immersed in that One, their souls united with it, theirentire devotion and allegiance absorbed in it, their being purged of the poisonof delusion by the antidote of wisdom—such (liberated) souls achieve the stateof no return.(5:18) Such (freed) souls view with equal gaze a pious priest, a cow, anelephant, a dog, and an outcast.(5:19) Even on this (earthly) plane of existence the relativities (birth, death;pleasure, pain) are overcome by one who views everything even-mindedly. Thosewho can do so are verily enthroned in the unblemished,incapable-of-being-distorted Spirit.(5:20) Such sages, established in the one Supreme Being and unwavering in theirdiscrimination, are neither jubilant when confronted by pleasant experiences,nor depressed when confronted by painful ones.(5:21) Feeling no attraction to the sensory world (either subtle or gross), theyogi lives in the ever-new joy of his own being. United to Spirit, he attainsthe perfection of Absolute Bliss.(5:22) O Son of Kunti (Arjuna)! because sense pleasures spring from outside theSelf, they all have a beginning and an end and bring only misery. No one of anyunderstanding would seek happiness through them.(5:23) He is truly a yogi who, while living on earth, and up to the last momentof his earth life, can master every impulse of desire and antipathy. He (aloneamong mortals) is a happy human being.(5:24) Only one who possesses inner bliss, who is firmly centered in the innerSelf, and who is illumined by the inner Light (dependent for his understandingon nothing outside the Self) attains complete liberation (both while he livesand after death).(5:25) His doubts (and hesitations) removed, his karmas all obliterated, hissenses subdued, delighting only in the good of all, he (the sage) attainsemancipation in Spirit.(5:26) Renunciates who are without desire or anger, controlled in mind, andSelf-realized are inwardly free whether living in this world or merged in theInfinite.(5:27,28) The muni (one for whom liberation is the sole purpose of life)controls his senses, mind, and intellect, removing himself from contact withthem by neutralizing the currents of prana and apana in the spine, whichmanifest (outwardly) as inhalation and exhalation in the nostrils. He fixes hisgaze in the forehead at a point midway between the two eyebrows (therebyconverting the dual current of physical vision into the single, omniscientvision of the spiritual eye). Such a one attains complete emancipation.Yoga, it is well known, is not so much a philosophy as a science, offeringdefinite, practical techniques for raising man’s consciousness inwardly throughthe spine, and uniting its myriad directional tendencies (samskaras) with hisown highest potential in the Self.A fascinating aspect of this process is that one does not need to reach out tobecome one with the infinite: he has only to attain a level of perfectrefinement in himself, and thereby attain that level of consciousness whereseparations cease to exist. It is—as Swami Sri Yukteswar explained in his bookThe Holy Science—a matter of removing the koshas, or “sheaths” which limit andenclose each of us in individuality. Freed not only from ego, but from the lastcausal “vapor” of individual consciousness, there is nothing left to beattained. For we are, already, that Infinite One!Eternally we have been with God, in God, and immersed in nothing but God. Wehave merely been enclosed—at first as if by thin veils, then by shawls, then byheavy curtains, and finally by the heavy, solid armor of egotism—and have takenas our point of departure in everything that we are, do, see, and think, thislittle point of consciousness in infinite space: our little self.These two vastly different perceptions of reality—the one personal, confined,and even petty, and the other impersonal, unlimited, and omnipresent—cannot bespanned intellectually. Yogananda described divine attainment as “the liberatingshock of omnipresence.” Only by mental attunement with the consciousness of analready-liberated guru can one span the yawning abyss that separates ego fromInfinite consciousness.The attunement one seeks should not be with the guru’s personality, as such, butwith that deeper level of his consciousness which lies beneath the personalityin oneness with the Infinite.To prepare the mind for so vast an expansion, one cannot simply keep an openmind and “go along for the ride.” Only a spiritual hero can attempt the journey,even with the help of the guru who has made it already. The courage required isnot the “daredevil” type that declares, as if preening itself, “Just watch me:Of course I can do it!” It is of a different type altogether. It may seem, atfirst, to require a very feminine kind of surrender, one that says, “I trust youto do it right.” There is nothing, however, of either feminine or masculine inthis great leap of faith. The heroism required is the courage implied in thewords of a chant by Yogananda (paraphrased here): “I will drown myself in theInfinite to find my true Self to be infinite.” True faith, it must beunderstood, is very different from blind belief.The artist who paints a line on an almost completed work of art, knowing thatthe line will either make or hopelessly mar his work, must know what he isdoing. His knowledge must be intuitive, not intellectual. This kind of workisn’t something that could be done by a committee. Though the artist knows, hisonly way of showing his knowledge is by doing it. That is the meaning of faith:a sure intuition and an inner, complete certainty which no amount of reasoningcould either justify or demolish.What these two stanzas of the Gita teach is the importance of preparing oneselffor that supreme act of faith. This is where yoga enters the picture.To concentrate one’s gaze at the point midway between the eyebrows is not sostrange a practice as it may at first seem. Whenever one is inspired by any newinsight or idea, he lifts his gaze upward automatically. The seat ofsuperconsciousness is the forehead. (That of the subconscious is at the back ofthe head.) The frontal lobe of the brain, located just behind the forehead, isthe advanced portion which human evolution adds to the brain. In lower animals,the foreheads slant sharply back—for they have no frontal lobe.Yogis discovered in ancient times that that part of the frontal lobe which needsparticularly to be stimulated is that which lies just behind the point midwaybetween the eyebrows.We saw earlier in these pages that the physical act of breathing is intimatelyassociated with—and is, indeed, caused by—the energy rising and descending inthe spine through the ida and pingala nadis, or nerve channels. Ida begins onthe left side; pingala, on the right. Breathing in the astral body takes placein these two nadis. The breath in the astral body is in the spine, and consistsof energy, not of inhalation and exhalation with the lungs. The ascending energyis called prana; the descending, apana. One yoga technique (I once observed myGuru practicing it) involves alternately closing the right and left nostrils toallow air to pass only through the left, then the right, stimulating the pranaand apana in the spine. Stimulating that flow of energy by deliberatelybreathing with one nostril at a time is an indirect technique, however. Tocontrol those currents with the attention focused on the outward activity ofclosing and opening the nostrils directs one’s attention more to the breathingaspect of the exercise than to the energy-flow in the spine.Kriya Yoga is the science that was particularly recommended by my own Guru andby his line of gurus. Kriya Yoga was first given in modern times by the greatHimalayan master known simply as Babaji (“Revered Father”). According to myunderstanding, Babaji is himself an incarnation of the great Indian master ofancient times, Narayana, who, more recently, was Lord Krishna himself.Babaji told his disciple Lahiri Mahasaya, whom he initiated into Kriya Yoga in1861, that Kriya is the supreme ancient science of yoga, and that he himself ina previous body had given it to the world. This science may be called God’sgreatest gift to humanity for the soul’s salvation.Kriya Yoga helps one (as we discussed earlier in this book) to equalize theincoming and outgoing breaths, and to absorb one’s energy in the spine, whereone feels the currents as a cool (rising) and a slightly warm (descending)current.There is another simple technique, helpful to practice as a preliminaryexercise: With mental detachment, watch the breath flowing naturally in thenostrils. A mantra is uttered with the breathing process: “Hong” as the breathflows in (allowing the flow to occur naturally); and “Sau” as it flows out.Gradually the focus of attention should be transferred from the awareness ofbreath in the nostrils to the point, higher up the nose, where it enters thehead. This is also, of course, the point midway between the eyebrows.My Guru told me also to practice, after some time, feeling the energy flowing upand down the spine with the incoming and outgoing breaths—not controlling theflow, but feeling it as the subtle cause of the physical breathing. Thistechnique is not Kriya Yoga, but my Guru sometimes referred to it as the “babyKriya.”(5:29) He finds peace who knows Me as the Enjoyer of all offerings (yagyas) andausterities, as the Infinite Lord of creation, and as the Dearest Friend of all.Man usually thinks of himself as enjoying for himself whatever blessings hereceives from his spiritual practices. It is in fact, however, God’s blissenjoying itself! We love with His love. We enjoy with His joy.Thus ends the fifth chapter, called “Freedom Through Inner Renunciation,” of theUpanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna andArjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter EighteenTHE TRUE YOGA(6:1) The Blessed Lord said: The true renunciate and the true yogi are those whoperform dutiful actions without desiring their fruits, not those who, eschewingself-offering, act with ego-motivation, nor those who (in the name ofrenunciation) eschew action.Much of what Krishna says here he has said before. Here, however, his message isbroader. He is re-emphasizing that the essence of the spiritual life isego-transcendence, whether one lives in the world, or in a monastery, orsolitarily in a cave. Krishna has already stated that action, whether outward orinward, is essential for the aspirant. One who has transcended the need foroutward activity can do so only in the breathless state, for then alone can onework dynamically with the subtle inner energies. Until that point, whether he isa sannyasi (renunciate) or is obliged to live an ordinary life among worldlypeople, his essential need is for some kind of ego-freeing activity. The factthat a person lives an ordinary life and has a normal job may makeego-renunciation more difficult, but it does not make it less obligatory. Bothsannyasi (renunciate) and “samsari” must achieve the same results, with orwithout formal renunciation. The spiritual path is not a matter of “scoringpoints” in the game of pleasing God! The inner need of every human being whowould unite himself with the Infinite consciousness is the same.Let us consider the differences between being a yogi-renunciate and ayogi-samsari (one who must contribute to the outward play of maya). It should besaid at the outset that a “samsari” need not play his part with ego-attachment.It is indeed pleasing to God, and a great help to a person’s spiritualadvancement, to participate in the divine play without egoic attachment, insteadof scorning to involve oneself. This world was made by God, after all. HeHimself finds joy in His handiwork; otherwise, wouldn’t He have learned long agonot to create universes at all?! An expansive attitude is a natural part of thecreative process, and is therefore intrinsic to the “ever-newness” of divinebliss. The key to correct participation in “samsara,” then, is to “play one’spart” consciously non-identified with the ego.The scriptures say that God created the universe “in order to enjoy Himselfthrough many.” Certainly the Lord does not enjoy the fact that His creaturessuffer! His enjoyment, then, must come (outwardly) from seeing every story comeat last to a happy ending, as His human creatures attain final release, one byone, from ego-limitation in infinite bliss. He wants us to merge back eventuallyinto His ocean of Satchidananda. Those few in every age, moreover, who attainthat goal but want to continue helping the struggling mortals (among whom theytoo were once counted), are certainly pleasing to Him in a very special way. Thephilosophical question, “Which is greater?” doesn’t arise, since all are equallygreat in God. Certainly, however, His manifested creatures must be grateful forthe fact that a few liberated souls, feeling this commitment, actually come backand help them.It is supremely ironic that these few souls—outstandingly, indeed, among men—sooften attract the fiercest persecution for their earthly service to mankind!Inwardly they are untouched by the way others treat them, for they are aboveego-consciousness, but how sad it is that so many human beings should, in thisway, “bite the hand that feeds them!” The tragedy is not theirs who arepersecuted, but mankind’s, that man should again and again be offered divinelove, yet spurn it so contemptuously in preference to his own ego-degradation.All this is a part of the divine “plot,” with its myriad sub-plots, “redherrings,” and intricate distractions from the one, true theme.The essential difference between the joyful actor in the play of samsara and thehermit who disdains to participate at all in the play is superficial. Both typesof sadhakas (truth seekers) offer themselves up to God for Him do with as Hewills.The path of marriage, job, and involvement with family has certain obviousdisadvantages which make spiritual progress more of a challenge, outwardly. Anagging wife or domineering husband, obstreperous children, demanding relativeswho think blood ties entitle them to meddle in a person’s life (whether out offamily attachment, or out of concern for their own reputations): All of thesecan create powerful obstructions on the spiritual path.Sadashiva, a great sadhu in southern India, lived with his parents as a youngman, meditating in his room and earnestly studying the scriptures. One day heemerged from his room to find a commotion in the home.“What is happening?” he inquired.“We are preparing,” his parents told him, “for the arrival of your intendedbride.”Sadashiva reflected: “If my bride’s merely prospective arrival can create such adisturbance, what effect on my daily routine will her actually living herehave?” Quietly, that very night, he slipped out the back door and left theneighborhood, never to return.Consider the danger of ego-involvement for anyone who accepts the role of wifeor husband, parent, or dutiful member of a close or extended family, and hisneed to support himself and others by taking a job, or by creating and sellingfor a profit. All these factors certainly help to explain why anyone whose heartis filled with divine fervor would want to live “away from it all”—in forest orcave, or even in a populous ashram or monastery, which at least contains otherdedicated souls.Paramhansa Yogananda said, “Those who marry as a necessity will have to be bornagain, that they may learn to live for God’s love alone.” At the same time, itmust be said that many of my Guru’s own most advanced disciples either were orhad been married. The important thing for everyone is to reach that point,whether late or soon in life, where he wants God alone. My Guru told me that onedisciple of his, an old woman in her eighties, had been an atheist all her life.When they met, however, she was converted to the spiritual life. So intensely,thereafter, did she seek God that, as he told me, “She found freedom in thislife.”The desire for a companion has deep roots in human nature. It takes manyincarnations to understand that the “companion” one seeks has always been GodHimself. The Lord is our supreme Friend, our only and eternally faithful Lover,our ever-forgiving Mother, our firm but forever-accepting Father. God is, as myGuru put it, “the Nearest of the near, the Dearest of the dear: He is closer toyou than your very thoughts.”Marriage and family is, for some people, the best way of realizing to its depththe eternal need of the soul: its deeper-than-conscious longing for God alone.Those, however, who have understood to their depths that the only thing theywant already is God, are wise if they dedicate themselves to living for Himalone.One problem with giving this counsel is the fact that so many people seek thepath of renunciation not because of a wholehearted desire for God, but becauseof a wish to live an easy life of minimal responsibility. It is to such peopleabove all that Krishna addressed those words, “those who (in the name ofrenunciation) abstain from action.”Those who follow the renunciate path find it easier to direct all their energiesto God. That very path, however, imposes also the broader responsibility ofhelping others spiritually: One should not live for himself alone. A temptationsannyasis face is to center their attention too narrowly on their own spiritualsearch, forgetful of the needs of others. In their spiritual selfishness theystrengthen, instead of weakening, the fetters of ego-consciousness.One who would live entirely for God must first of all be sure in his own heartthat in so doing he is not merely shirking responsibility. The unfortunate truthis, few so-called “renunciates” embrace their calling with an entirely puremotive.The other side of this story is that one embraces a spiritual calling notbecause he is already pure and perfect, but in order to become so. Thus,whichever path you yourself embrace, let it be one in which you feel able todirect your energies more and more one-pointedly in the right way, toward finalliberation in God.(6:2) Understand, O Pandava (Arjuna), that what the scriptures call sannyasa(renunciation) is the same thing as yoga. Indeed, without renunciation ofselfish motive (sankalpa) one cannot be a (true) yogi.(6:3) The muni, aspiring to the (spiritual) heights through (scientific) yogaaction (karma), on achieving his goal finds perfect, vibrationless peace.(6:4) He who has overcome attachment not only to sense objects but to (sensory)activity, and who has achieved freedom from all ego-motivated planning, is said(by the wise) to have attained yogarudha: the firm union of soul and Spirit.Paramhansa Yogananda described at this point some of what that “scientific yoga”action, or karma, entails. It may help the aspirant here to understand somethingimportant: what is involved in spiritual awakening concerns far more than makinga clear philosophical resolution.The word “karma” in stanza three signifies the practice of specific yogapranayamas—exercises, that is to say, for gaining control of the inner energy,withdrawing it from the body, and centering it in the spine and its subtlechakras, which—with the inclusion of the medulla oblongata at the base of thebrain, and also of the brain (the sahasrara, or “thousand-rayed lotus”)—numberseven in all.The medullary center has two rays of energy, described in the Book of Revelationof the Bible as “a sharp two-edged sword” (Rev. 1:16). These twin currents,positive and negative, supply the two hands, the two feet, the two lungs, thedual-branched nervous system, the two eyes, two ears, the two sides of thetongue, and the two hemispheres of the brain. The brain stores the energyentering the body through the medulla oblongata. The energy then enters thespine, passes down it, and flows out into the nervous system. The dual currentsin the medulla pass down the spine through the chakras to nourish the body. Theenergy flows outward through the chakras in various directions: From thebishuddha, or cervical center, it flows out in sixteen rays; from the anahata,the heart, or dorsal, center, it flows out in twelve rays; from the manipura, ornavel (the lumbar) center, its rays number ten; from the swadisthana, or sacralcenter, six; and from the muladhara, or coccyx center, four.In the initial state, the yogi’s meditative “job” is to withdraw his energy fromthe physical body into the spinal centers. At this point he sees, through thespiritual eye, his astral body with its subtle chakras. Beholding the astralbody, he offers his ego—the central “element” of the astral body—up to itsideational origin of separate individuality in the causal or ideational body.Thence, reaffirming soul-consciousness wholly at last, he offers that separateidentity up to Infinity to be dissolved in Cosmic consciousness.Already at the causal level the soul cognizes all cosmic manifestation as adream of God’s. To attain yogarudha, firm or complete union with InfiniteSpirit, he must waken completely from the cosmic dream and realize himself asthe one Self beyond all space, time, size, and any other limiting conditions:behind manifested existence itself.(6:5) Let man uplift himself by his own effort, and let him not debase himself.Indeed, one’s self is his own greatest friend—or (if he so chooses) his owngreatest enemy.Useless is the human tendency to blame others for one’s own misfortunes. Indeed,there are no misfortunes. “Conditions are always neutral,” Yogananda said. “Theyonly appear good or bad, joyful or sad, fortunate or unfortunate owing to thepositive or negative attitudes [and expectations] of the mind.” The yogi mustlearn to gaze even-mindedly upon whatever happens to him. When the ego chooses,however, to refer back again and again to itself everything that can possiblyaffect it, it “debases” itself by becoming involved in downward- andoutward-flowing energy through the chakras to the senses, then through thesenses to the surrounding world.When others treat you unkindly, unfairly, or even cruelly, make it a definitepoint never to react with emotion. Never strike back; never complain; neverresist, out of ego-consciousness, either defensively or aggressively. Sometimesa wrong must be countered with a right, but even when duty calls you to suchaction, try always—as Krishna counseled Arjuna—to conduct yourself in such a wayas to ensure that your own attitude is ever impersonal.(6:6) For him whose (lower, egoic) self has been conquered by the (higher, soul)Self, that Self is the friend of his (lower) self. The true Self, however, isnot friendly to the false self, and is (in many ways) its enemy.People are often stunned by the severity with which great sages—who are ever thetrue friends of everyone’s higher Self—may sometimes treat them. A saint acceptsworldly people more or less as they are, without concerning himself particularlyover their foibles and defects. If, however, they show a glimmering of desire toknow God, he may sometimes treat them with unexpected severity. If, moreover,they place themselves under him as disciples, he may seem (to worldly eyes, oreven to the unprepared disciple!) to behave toward them quite harshly. His “job”is not to pamper their egos. It is to cauterize forever their egoic“shortfalls,” and make them pure vessels that can receive into themselves thesupernal blessings of divine love and bliss.(6:7) The tranquil sage who has conquered the (lower, egoic) self abides ever inthe Supreme Self. He views with equanimity all the dualities: cold and heat,pleasure and pain, praise and blame.(6:8) That yogi who is blissfully absorbed in the wisdom of the Self is known asbeing unshakably united to Spirit. Unchangeable, the controller of his senses,he views with equal mind a clod of earth, a stone, and a bar of gold.(6:9) He is a supreme yogi who gazes equally upon patrons, friends, enemies,strangers, peacemakers, those who cause trouble, relatives, the virtuous, andthe ungodly.These last two stanzas do not mean that the yogi isn’t capable of recognizingthe differences between one material object and another, or between a good humanbeing and an evil one. As my Guru once put it, “He is not dumb!” The differencebetween the wise yogi and the ordinarily ignorant human being is that the yogiaccepts with equanimity whatever is. To him, all things and all creatures aresimply plays of divine light and shadow on the screen of duality. He reactsappropriately to all, both virtuous and ungodly, but in his heart he sees bothas aspects of the eternal drama of God.(6:10) Free from the hopes (engendered by) desire, and untouched by any cravingfor possession, the (waves of feeling in his) heart controlled (by yogaconcentra-tion), the yogi, retiring alone to a quiet place, should try to unitehis little self with the Supreme Self.It is important to understand that Krishna, who has repeatedly stressed theimportance of right action over non-action, also recommends to Arjuna here theapparent “non-action” of meditation. Obviously, he is saying that meditation,too, is a kind of “right” action. An important saying in the Indian scripturesis: “When a duty conflicts with a higher duty, it ceases to be a duty.” Thatrarely accomplished yogi who is able to sit in deep meditation during all thehours when he is not performing necessary bodily functions—eating, sleeping,taking a little exercise, etc.—is fulfilling that “higher duty” which precludesthe necessity for engaging in any other activity. For most aspiring yogis,however, although they might well find unbroken solitude a mistake (leading togreater restlessness, then laziness and gradual inertia—as opposed to whatKrishna calls non-action), it would nevertheless be a great aid to them in theirsadhana (spiritual practice) if they could spend some time—a week or two, oreven longer—every year, and at least one day a week, in seclusion. Meditatingfor long hours, reading books that are spiritually uplifting, taking long walks“with God,” doing a little mental work such as writing in a spiritual diary: Allthese activities can provide a spiritually strengthening balance to constantoutward activity.During one’s periods of seclusion, one should maintain complete silence, and notspeak outwardly to anyone. He should make it a practice, instead, to talkmentally with God, or to carry on a mental dialogue with his guru (if he isblessed to have one). His guru will convey more understanding to him in this waythan he could teach, outwardly. (It is, indeed, fairly normal for true gurus tobe maunis, never speaking outwardly. Their method of teaching is in any casemore by thought transference than by outward speech.)It should be understood, finally, that true solitude begins when the energy iswithdrawn into the spine, stilling the senses, and when the mind contains not aripple of restless thought. One who can enter this state has no need for outwardsolitude.(6:11) The yogi should have a firm, clean seat, neither too high nor too low. Heshould cover his seat first with kusha grass, then (cover that with) a deer ortiger skin, and then (place upon that) a (wool and/or silk) cloth.A foundation mat of interwoven kusha grass is a way provided by Nature forprotecting the meditating yogi from dampness in the earth. There is no otherreason, nor any special, mystic meaning for using kusha grass. Its use is onlyits dampness-dispelling properties. Since this grass, though it grows abundantlyin India, is not available everywhere, its non-availability need be no excuse(as a few bigots have actually insisted!) for not practicing yoga in othercountries!To begin with, even sitting on a firm, flat surface in Padmasana, Siddhasana, orsome other yoga asana, while helpful for young yogis in keeping their bodiessteady and for calming their nerves, is not essential for older devotees. ManyWesterners, especially, find that sitting cross-legged forces them toconcentrate more on their aching knees than on the spine and in the spiritualeye! For such persons, and for those everywhere who are so completely accustomedto sitting on chairs that any other position would constitute an unnecessarypenance, Paramhansa Yogananda recommended that one simply sit on astraight-backed, armless chair, with the back upright (not touching the back ofthe chair), and the hands placed palms upward on the legs at the junction of theabdomen. The chin should be parallel to the ground, and the shoulder bladesdrawn slightly together (to hold the spine straight by “corrugating” the back).The chest should be held high, not sunken: there should be no forward stoop. Thestomach and abdomen should be relaxed, not held in, and should thereforeprotrude slightly forward.This position of the spine and chest is what is meant in the Gita by “Arjuna’sbow,” which (as we saw) Arjuna allowed to slip. What that means is that heslumped forward. The bow didn’t literally “slip from his grasp,” as Chapter 1 ofthe Gita symbolically suggests. The position indeed suggests a bow, with thefront of the body resembling the arch of the bow, and the spine resembling thestring.More is given on the meditative position in the next stanzas. In this stanzaKrishna says to cover the mat of kusha grass with the skin of a deer or a tiger.Traditionally, these animals should have died a natural death, though if onewants such a skin he must more or less take what he can get these days. (My ownGuru’s deer skin clearly displayed a bullet hole.) Animal skins are not easilycome by, and serve a purpose for which other coverings—woolen blankets, or silkcloths—can be substituted. Deer skins are said to be helpful in achieving peaceof mind. Tiger skins are said to generate will power, and are generallyrecommended only for those who practice sexual self-control, in the thought thatthe energy generated will conflict with that of people who don’t practiceabstinence, and will therefore cause tension between the upward-pulling energyin the spine and its downward-moving tendencies.All this is, however, quite arcane. The physical effect of these skins isnegligible compared with their more mundane purpose: to insulate subtle energiesin the body from other, downward-pulling earth energies.Perfectly adequate for general purposes, and for most people (so ParamhansaYogananda said), are the energy-insulating properties of wool and/or silk. Ifyou sit on the floor, place a woolen blanket beneath you. If you sit on a chair,place the woolen blanket in such a way that it comes under the feet, over theseat, and over the back of the chair. You may, if you like, cover the wool witha silk cloth.It is important that your seat be firm (not wobbly), and clean. Preferably, noone but you should ever sit there. Some of the benefits of solitude can beachieved by setting aside a room in your home for nothing but meditation. Byallowing no other activity to take place in that room, you will gradually buildup vibrations there that will tangibly help you to achieve inner silence. Youwill, indeed, feel those vibrations the moment you enter the room.If you cannot set aside a separate room for meditation, it will be possible tocreate some of the same effect by screening off a portion of some otherroom—perhaps your bedroom.One reason for having one’s seat (suitably insulated) on the ground when youmeditate is to protect your body, in case you should slip suddenly into a deepmeditative state, in which case your body might fall over and injure itself. Thebest position for this purpose, and one which presses on certain nerves that,Yogananda used to say, will help to steady the body, is Padmasana (the lotuspose).A firm seat need not mean a hard one! Hardness will not only soon becomeuncomfortable, but will cause the legs to go numb. Ease and relaxation areprimary considerations.Yogananda mentioned also, in passing, another, symbolic reason for the aboveadvice Krishna gave. The earth-grown grass, the animal skin, and the silkencloth symbolize the lower three chakras, above which the yogi’s energy shouldrise. The grass represents the earth element, which is the vibration of thelowest (muladhara) chakra. The animal skin (a coating for blood and flesh)represents the water element, which is the vibration of the next chakra up, thesacral or swadisthana. The silk cloth (which people sometimes use to generatestatic electricity) represents the fire element: the vibration of the thirdchakra up, the manipura or lumbar (navel) center. Since the purpose of all thesecoverings for the seat is to insulate the body from downward-pulling energies,it may be more than symbolically that they represent the lower three chakras.(6:12) Seated firmly there, with one-pointed concentration of the mind, andneither roaming mentally nor reacting to sense stimuli, let him seekself-purification by yoga practice (using the techniques prescribed by hisguru).(6:13) Holding the spine, neck, and head firmly erect and motionless, let theyogi focus his gaze at the starting point of the nose (nasikagram) between thetwo eyebrows; and let him not gaze elsewhere, but keep his gaze calmlyone-pointed.This stanza completes the Gita’s instructions on the right posture formeditation, including the position of the eyes. Translators have often takenthis stanza to mean, “Focus at the tip of the nose.” Nasikagram (the Sanskritword), however, means not only “front” (which has been taken to mean the tip),but also “origin.” As Swami Sri Yukteswar stated, “origin” is the right meaning.There is nothing spiritual to be gained by concentrating on the tip of the nose!Krishna is clearly referring to the point from which the nose protrudes from theface, where the air enters the head: the universally recognized seat of thespiritual eye, the Kutastha, which, as Krishna has already indicated, lies atthe point midway between the two eyebrows.Why gaze at this point? The direction of one’s gaze is an indication of one’sstate of consciousness. It also helps to induce the state of consciousness onedesires. A downward gaze is associated with the subconscious, and tends toinduce subconsciousness. Gazing straight ahead is not only associated withwakefulness, but helps one to be “awake and ready” if he feels himself growingsleepy. And an upward gaze is associated with superconsciousness. It is naturalfor a person who feels inspired by some thought, or if he is entertaining hopesfor the future, to gaze upward almost by instinct.There is more involved in the ideal meditative position of the eyes. First itmay be pointed out that saints in every religious tradition have been seen, andso depicted by artists, as gazing upward. Popular thought imagines thembeholding visions “in the clouds,” but the gaze in ecstasy is in fact drawnupward. For saints, this position is not a practice but a natural consequence oftheir being in a superconscious state.For the meditating yogi, a good practice is to gaze upward—not with crossedeyes, but with the gaze slightly focused on a point in the near distance—as iflooking at one’s thumb, held outward and slightly high, at arm’s length.It is best (but more difficult because of visual distractions) to meditate withopen eyes, the gaze (as we’ve seen) slightly upward, and the lower eyelidsslightly raised. Thus, closed eyes are naturally associated with sleep; wideopen eyes, with wakefulness; and slightly raised, finally, with the lower lidsin a “half open and half closed” position, is associated withsuperconsciousness.Interestingly, the eyes of worldly people, whose consciousness is heavy withtheir descending flow of energy, tend to show more white under the irises. Theeyes of yogis generally show none, or little, of that white area. This, too, isa result of the upward “lift” on the lower lids accompanying a raisedconsciousness.(6:14) Serene and fearless, steadfast in his vow of brahmacharya (sexualcontrol), his mind controlled, and his attention centered in Me, the seated yogishould meditate on Me as the ultimate goal (of all striving).A natural question arises (here as well as elsewhere in this scripture) in theminds of true seekers: Is absolute sexual self-control essential on thespiritual path? If so (many think), it means that most people, unless theyescape worldly society altogether and live far away from it as hermits, aredoomed to a path that, aside from all the other problems it incurs, is not onlydifficult but impossible.The great Himalayan master Babaji, however, who initiated Lahiri Mahasaya (amarried man with children) into Kriya Yoga, instructed his disciple to giveKriya Yoga initiation to all who “humbly cried for help,”—to people, that is tosay, who were living and working in the world, as well as to sannyasis. Those,in other words, who are unable to practice complete sexual abstinence are notdebarred from the yoga path.That complete abstinence is an aid on the path is well established in yogatradition and in many religions. Therefore it must be added that, the moreperfect the abstinence, the easier it is to rise spiritually. That much said,however, it must be stressed simply that being married should never be taken byany sincere seeker as license for sexual overindulgence. True seekers should allmake a sincere effort to be temperate. There are, on the other hand, degrees ofbrahmacharya: once a month, for example; or—the example set by Yogananda’sparents—once a year. Daily, or even more frequent, indulgence, is a clearindication that one is too worldly, and is not really serious in his spiritualsearch. It is impossible to run in two directions at once. The results ofoverindulgence are mental vitiation, weakened health, and premature old age.(6:15) The self-governed yogi, his mind fully controlled, attains the peace ofsupreme nirvana (the state of individual extinction) in union with My spirit.Nirvana, the explicit ideal of Buddhism, has been mistakenly identified withutter extinction of consciousness. Such could never be the case, since the onlyreality in existence is consciousness: Everything in the universe is amanifestation of consciousness. Even the atoms are conscious to a degree;otherwise they could not exist. Paramhansa Yogananda went so far as to declarethat every atom “is dowered with individuality.”Nirvana is the extinction of individuality. That is, in fact, the goal of everytrue spiritual path. Individuality is an aspect of maya, which makes all thewaves on the ocean of Spirit appear separate and real. Yet—continuing thismetaphor—they are made of water, and only appear real as the surface moves withpassing vibrations caused by the wind and by movement of the Earth. The waves,as such, have no individual existence. The same must be said for thoughts andtendencies, which appear for a time, merely, in the mind but have their roots ininfinity, and do not define the ego. An analogy would be a piece of flotsam onthe ocean, which rises and sinks with the passing waves without moving relativeto stationary objects on the shore, or on a ship at anchor. Flotsam works wellas an image because, being a different substance from water, it is visible.Actually, of course, there is only one “substance” in existence: consciousness.The ego really is more like an invisible drop of ocean water, enclosed, like themessage of a shipwrecked mariner, in a floating bottle of appearances. Thebottle might be thought of, in this context, as being made of ice, placed on aplate of ice, and the plate resting on an iceberg. That foundation (thephysical, astral, and causal bodies) must be melted before the drop itself, alsofrozen, can merge into the ocean. This image is labored, its logic forced by theanalogy of a wave, but the point of this exercise is that the drop of water (theindividual soul) doesn’t cease to exist: It merges, on liberation, into theocean of consciousness. Having nothing further to contain and confine it in thelimited space implied by individuality, it becomes the vast ocean ofconsciousness itself.(6:16) O Arjuna! Yoga is not for him who eats too much or who fasts too much,who sleeps too much or who sleeps too little.(6:17) One who is temperate in eating, recreation, working, sleeping, andwakefulness attains yoga, which destroys all suffering.Nowhere in the Gita does Krishna more clearly teach moderation than in these twostanzas. Moderation was taught also by Buddha, and by many other great worldteachers. If the teachings of Jesus Christ seem more extreme (“Take no heed fortomorrow”; “take no money with you in your purse. . . .”) it was because hetaught at a time when people were too much bound by rules, and too intolerant ofviews different from their own. They needed a stern teaching. Jesus alsocounseled compassion, however, as he showed, for example, in the story of thewoman taken in adultery.It is an interesting fact that the sterner approach to religion has been takenin India, where Krishna taught moderation, and that the more lenientapproach—often bordering on outright materialism—has been taken in the so-calledChristian countries of the West. It is ironic that, in this basic respect atleast, Christians have been truer to the teachings of Krishna, whereas Hindushave been truer to the teachings of Jesus Christ!Be all this as it may, moderation has also been a basic teaching of all thegreat masters. As Yogananda said, “It is better not to go to extremes inself-discipline until you have achieved at least some realization.” If a brittletwig is forcibly bent, it will snap.Nevertheless, the moderation counseled here by Krishna is hardly thematerialists’ idea of this concept. For worldly people, a few minutes ofmeditation every day may seem already to be bordering on fanaticism! Buddha, onthe other hand, who taught moderation, sat determinedly under the Bodhi tree anddidn’t move from it until he’d solved the mystery of life. “Let this bodydissolve, but until life’s mystery I’ve solved, I from this spot will never,never move!” He sat there for forty days and nights, until at last enlightenmentcame. The average person could only comment, “So that’s moderation?!” Moderationmeans doing everything you can to advance spiritually, without pushing yourselftoo far.Krishna’s mention of recreation is interesting and helpful. Too many spiritualseekers think that frivolity of any kind is harmful. The English saying, “Allwork and no play makes Jack a dull boy,” is significant in this context. Manymonasteries, with their strict daily routine and firmly imposed rules (allintended to make monks and nuns holy), often have just the opposite effect. Theinmates, under obligation to follow a routine too monotonously regular, tend tobecome dull-minded. With too many rules, moreover, they tend to becomeexcessively rigid, and lose any hint of the spontaneous creativity that is soessential for spirits who seek self-expansion.One imagines a bishop, abbot, or some other high churchman trying to justifysome light pleasantry with the comment, as he suppresses a light titter, “Alittle harmless merriment is not forbidden, I believe?” Without a wholesomebalance of sufficient recreation, one may come to resemble a stuffed frog,looking self-important, though unable to say anything of interest to anyone!In India there is less self-consciousness in that respect; still, the tendencyof religious figures everywhere to take themselves too seriously, and never tolaugh except drily, is (one suspects) a worldwide phenomenon.(6:18) When the chitta (feeling) is completely calmed and centered inwardly inthe Self, the yogi, freed from every attachment and desire, attains the stateknown as union with God.Entanglement with delusion begins not so much with the ego itself as with thereactions of feeling in the heart to the fluctuations of maya. Even a masterneeds to retain enough ego-consciousness to recognize that certain duties in hisworld, though God-ordained, are specifically his. He is not identified with hisego, but only works through it in somewhat the way a trumpeter blows his horn.What really traps people in delusion is the thought, “I like this!”—or, “Idislike that!” Even liberated masters need enough ego-consciousness to hold theatoms of their bodies together. In the illustration of the waves and the ocean,the master is the low, sattwic wave, the very crest of which remains close tothe ocean bosom.Therefore it was that Patanjali gave his definition of yoga as, “Yogas chittavritti nirodha: Yoga is the neutralization of the eddies (whirlpools, great andsmall) of feeling.”(6:19) A candle flame burns steadily, protected from the wind. Even so is theconsciousness of that yogi who has subdued his chitta (feelings).The moon’s reflection on a lake is distorted by ripples in the water. Such arethe ripples of feeling, which often grow and become waves of agitation,distorting the clarity of human perception. To calm the mind that it reflect thetruth as it is, one must calm the waves of reaction in the heart. Only when theflame of concentration burns steadily and one accepts calmly whatever is ratherthan trying to view it differently and wishing it were different, can oneachieve complete truthfulness. One must learn to remain unmoved by either goodfortune or adversity. Only then is the deep perception of Infinity possible.Yogananda often spoke of the “sense telephones”—sensations carried to the mindby the senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. These, he said, can be“switched off” during meditation, when the breath and heartbeat are stilled, andthe energy becomes withdrawn into the spine from the surface of the body.Krishna is not speaking here, however, of the meditative state only, but of theyogi in normal daily activity also, who can keep his feelings unruffled by theemotionally reactive process of human feeling.It is important to understand how central the emotions are to any involvement indelusion. Only consider an example we saw earlier: the uncensorable reactions ofa little child to any unexpected occurrence. The child jumps up and down withdelight, or stoops over, stamping his feet with displeasure. His emotional wavesprevent him from seeing anything clearly. To tell a child, “All this will beover by evening” would be useless! His entire “reality” is in his own reactionsof the moment. To him, things will never be different. Emotional moments arelike scenes captured with the click of a camera lens. Although that image willlast as long as the film or the print endures, the scene itself may changecompletely in a single instant.The wave crest has no permanence. The person rising and plunging on an agitatedsea in a rowboat cannot get a clear glimpse of anything on the land nearby. Evenso, people caught in the storm of delusion can comprehend no fixed truth, andare in fact too restless to think about it for even two seconds together.This very fact, though recognized, has been distorted by delusion! Scientistsbelieve that, in order to judge the facts clearly in any experiment, they mustrigidly exclude feeling as foreign to “scientific” objectivity. The truth isthat without true feeling—which is to say, intuition—any insight gained will besterile and lifeless. “Self-styled” Gyana Yogis, similarly, imagine that byeliminating feeling (which, again, means intuition) from their understanding oftruth, they will develop clear understanding. They deprive themselves, however,of real insight, for intuitive feeling is essential to true understanding. Itmust ever be calm, centered, and upwardly directed towardsuperconsciousness—which is located physically, as we have seen, in the frontallobe of the brain behind the forehead, midway between the eyebrows.The intellect can see, analyze, and explain: Only the addition of the heart’sfeeling, however, bestows understanding.Indeed, it may be questioned whether, without feeling, consciousness can evenexist.(6:20) The state of complete inner tranquility, (which is) attained by yogameditation, wherein the little self (the ego) perceives itself as the Self,enjoys itself as the Self;—(6:21) that state in which bliss, transcendent above the senses and accepted assuch by intuitive intelligence, can never be expunged;—(6:22) the state which, once attained, is considered the treasure beyond allother treasures: In that state (alone) does the yogi become immune to grief even(in the face of) the greatest tragedy.Paramhansa Yogananda has been quoted already as saying, “You must be able tostand unshaken amidst the crash of breaking worlds.” In these stanzas Krishnaexplains the state of consciousness in which so firm a stance becomes finallypossible.(6:23) That state is known as yoga, the condition in which one becomes immune toany pain. The practice of yoga should therefore be followed resolutely, withundaunted feeling.Stanzas 20–22 describe the progress from conditioned (sabikalpa, or sampragyata)samadhi to unconditioned (nirbikalpa, or asampragyata) samadhi: the state ofultimate union with God, referred to here in Stanza 23 as “the condition inwhich one becomes immune to any pain.” In the first state, sabikalpa samadhi,ego-consciousness, though dormant, is still present. Thus, the intuitiveintelligence (combining as it does, feeling with discrimination) is stillactive; the little self, filled with awe and wonder, recognizes the SupremeSelf. Gradually, as it becomes established in that state, the little self slicesthrough the last strand binding it to littleness.This, then, is “permanent extinction,” the state in which the yogi’sego-consciousness is slain and burned to ashes, to remain ever thereafter but amemory in omniscience. That memory can be resurrected, as happens sometimes whena liberated soul is sent back (by the will of the Creator) into manifestedexistence as an avatar, for the salvation of many souls still wandering indelusion. The consciousness of eternal, absolute inner freedom is never lost.(6:24) Relinquishing without exception every self-willed longing; restrainingmentally all sensory involvement in the world;—(6:25) patiently calming the intuitive intelligence, and absorbed in the Self,the yogi, relinquishing all other thoughts, gradually attains perfect peace.When one first sits to meditate, a million distractions come to dissuade himfrom the effort. If he meditates with half-open eyes (which is the idealposition), he may be distracted by circumambient lights or movements. In thiscase, it is permissible to close the eyes.Sounds, of all sensations, are the most likely to invade one’s inner“battlefield” of Kurukshetra. In that case, he may use ear plugs, or a“T”-shaped board on which to rest his elbows, lightly pressing the thumbs on thetragus of each ear. It is good in any case to find a silent place formeditation. If such is not available, then choose some place containing such aconfusion of sounds that no particular one stands out distractingly; or else aplace where one continuous sound drowns out all others: a waterfall, forinstance, or a flowing stream.Smells can be used to advantage by creating one scent (an obvious suggestion isincense) that not only diminishes other odors but becomes gradually associatedin the mind with devotional exercises and uplifted feelings.Tastes are relatively easy to dismiss, but if any taste lingers in the mouthfrom food recently eaten it may help to sip a little pure water before sittingto meditate.Touch, finally, can at least be made less distracting by wearing loose,comfortable clothing, sufficiently warm and sufficiently light for the occasion,so that the body neither shivers nor perspires unduly.The patience counseled in the last stanza is necessary for calming the mind.Paramhansa Yogananda likened it to a glass of water into which dirt particleshave been stirred. One cannot command the water to become clear, but if oneallows the glass to sit for awhile the impurities gradually settle to thebottom, or else rise to the surface of their own accord, to be skimmed off.The average man, whose thoughts (especially during activity) become completelyintegrated with his consciousness, doesn’t realize how restless his mind is.When he sits to meditate, he may be aghast to find how his consciousness seethesand roils with one idea after the other, one plan after the other, onesensation, one memory, one intention after the other. Discouragement may seizehim in a vice-like grip. Let him continue calmly to discipline this fractiouscolt, the mind! It will gradually come under control, and will behave as hedirects it to.(6:26) Each time the fickle, wavering mind wanders from its course, let himwithdraw it and redirect it toward (the task of) bringing it under control.(6:27) The yogi who has completely calmed his mind, whose passions (rajoguna)are at rest, and who is freed from every impurity truly attains oneness with theSpirit, and supreme blessedness.(6:28) The yogi, freed from imperfection, ceaselessly engaged in (activitiesthat lead to) divine union, easily attains the state of blissful union withSpirit.(6:29) United to the Supreme Self by the practice of yoga, he beholds his Selfin all beings, and all beings in that one Self.(6:30) He who beholds Me everywhere, and who beholds everything in Me, neverloses sight of Me; nor do I lose sight of him.My Guru very often quoted this last stanza. His tone of voice and his expressionas he did so were blissful. He was reminding us that God is ever near. Whatseems to hold the Lord at a distance is only our indifference. If we will do thework needed to calm our thoughts and feelings (above all), we will find Him,waiting for us. People who wail miserably over His continued silence, Hisseeming heedlessness of them in their suffering, need only apply principles thatthey know already from daily life.Do they want worldly success? They know—or learn soon enough—that it won’t bedropped into their laps: They must work for it! Do they want human love? Theyknow it won’t come to them if they simply sit, languishing at home. Do they wantrubies, diamonds, gold? These things are not found lying about on the ground:They must be mined with great effort by someone, and paid for by others at greatcost.How is it that people think God owes them an answer for their brief, restless,and usually shallow prayers? Anguished prayers? Well, sometimes—but the anguishpasses, and soon they forget Him again as they rush off in pursuit of some newwill-o’-the-wisp. God sees all this and says, “I will wait.” He wants to be sureof our love, which He has been seeking, with hardly ever a glance toward Himfrom man, for millennia!(6:31) That yogi rests forever centered in Me who, whatever his outward way ofliving, sees Me at the heart of all beings.An exercise worth practicing, whenever one sees another human being, is tothink, “My higher Self is in him, also. In him, too, our one Self strugglesthrough an ego to find its true nature: complete, perfect bliss through allhuman experiences; true love in a human companion; true, divine recognition inhuman fame; true, divine power in fancied dominion over others; true, innerwealth in property and a swelling bank account.” The fulfillment for whichmankind longs is basically one and the same. Try to see God everywhere. Neverexclude Him mentally from anything you behold, do, or experience. In this way itwill be easier for you to approach Him, who is everywhere, and to whom all soulsare equally dear and equally His own.(6:32) O Arjuna, the best yogi is he who feels the needs of others, theirsorrows, their joys, as though these were his own.(6:33) Arjuna said, O Madhusudana (Krishna), owing to my restlessness I’veachieved no lasting results in the attempts You’ve taught me to steady the mind.(6:34) Verily (Arjuna continued) the mind is restless, tumultuous, madlystubborn! O Krishna, I consider it to be as difficult to master as the wind!Consider how, in Autobiography of a Yogi, Paramhansa Yogananda, as a disciple inhis guru’s ashram, said one day of his meditative efforts, (My disobedientthoughts) “scattered like birds before the hunter.” That was the very day hisguru gave him his first experience in Cosmic consciousness.It is common to lament the slowness and difficulty of one’s spiritual efforts.Heroic courage is needed to win in this most challenging, but alsoquintessentially important of all struggles. Many devotees, after a littleeffort, flee the scene, returning to the life they lived before. Incarnationafter incarnation they try, fail, then return. Perhaps they return with renewedwill to try again, but often they struggle against discouragement anddisappointment. A common lament is, “But—it’s so difficult!” Well, of course itis! Can the “pearl of great price” be won without serious effort? Yet theresimply is no alternative! Whoever puts his hand to the plow must finish the job,as Jesus Christ put it in Luke 9:62, “not looking back, or he won’t be fit forthe kingdom of God.” Let him tell himself that even in the effort to succeed heis already among the “elect” of mankind. Few—indeed, very few—have acquired thegood karma to know that finding God is the only goal of life.The science of yoga is pricelessly important for the spiritual seeker. It offerstechniques that can aid the mind in its efforts to achieve calmness.The second of these stanzas itself hints at the answer to Arjuna’s problem. Hesays he considers the mind “as difficult to master as the wind.” Wind is,indeed, the clue to solving his problem, as a solution is often implied alreadyin the way a question is phrased!The solution, here, is the breath. “Breathlessness is deathlessness” is a commonsaying among yogis. In a recent stanza (6:19) we saw this image of the wind usedalready: “A candle flame burns steadily, protected from the wind.” As the windagitates a candle flame, so breathing agitates the mind. We see a reverse effectupon the breath: when the mind, and especially the feelings, become agitated,the breathing becomes restless. Any major shock causes the heart to beat fasterand the breath to heave in and out with corresponding excitement.The yoga science works backward from this natural effect. People understand thistruth, at least to some extent, naturally. When someone suffers a shock, theycommonly advise him, “Just sit down; breathe slowly and deeply for a fewmoments. Calm yourself. Now then, explain what happened.” Other people, wantingto help one another, naturally also begin by advising one to breathe slowly.Without realizing it, everyone knows more about the yoga science than herealizes!People, again, automatically look upward when they feel elated. On receipt ofgood news, they sit straighter. They place their hands automatically over theheart when their feelings are suddenly and deeply affected. They knit theireyebrows when they want to concentrate deeply. They try to breathe more slowlynot only when they are agitated, but when they want to concentrate on anythingdeeply.Breath is the mystic key proffered by the yoga science for gaining control ofthe mind.(6:35) O Mighty-armed Arjuna, the mind is undoubtedly fickle and unruly, but itcan be controlled by yoga practice, and by the exercise of mental dispassion.(6:36) Here is My promise: Yoga, though difficult for the ungoverned mind toattain, can be reached through proper methods if one strives (earnestly) toachieve self-control.Yoga practice (yoga abhyasa) implies working both outwardly and inwardly, makingrepeated efforts to return to one’s calm center within. Dispassion (vairagya)means disengaging the mind (again, by repeated efforts) from all forms ofsensory pleasure, subtle as well as gross. Avoid any stimulus that reminds youof worldly fulfillments, especially if you sense the danger that it mightdistract you from soul-bliss.(6:37) Arjuna said: O Krishna, what happens to one who is unsuccessful in yogapractice: who tries devotedly to meditate but finds himself unable to bring hismind under control?(6:38) Does he not become like a riven cloud, scattered and dispersed: unable tofind Brahman, and equally unable to return to the delusory world he rejected?(6:39) Please release me permanently, O Krishna, from these doubts! Who else butYou can banish my uncertainty?The discouraged devotee pleads with God as the Cosmic Physician to heal hisself-doubts. For not every aspiring yogi achieves the divine goal in onelifetime. There are three ways of failing in yoga practice. One of them, alas,is fairly common: to return to the world, wanly hoping to find somehow again thefulfillment that was denied him before. Such failed seekers, unfortunately, areall-too common. After such a fall, they may wander for incarnations until thedesire for God reawakens in their hearts. For although that desire may seemsometimes to have disappeared, once it has been wakened in the heart it cannever die.Another type of fall takes place, so to speak, on the battlefield. A personpractices yoga zealously at first, but after some time he relaxes his efforts.Having at first been carried along by his initial zeal, a lack of perfectnon-attachment in the heart may cause him to become discouraged and to lessenhis efforts, thereby making him lose his focus on soul-bliss. When death comes,his mind, influenced by past worldly karmas, looks back with reawakened interestupon the worldly pleasures he once enjoyed. Distracted, consequently, from hisone-pointed longing for God, he falls short of union with Him. Self-doubtsassail him: Does he really want God? Might it not satisfy him to attainsomething less challenging—a harmonious life, for example, in an astral heaven?Is he, perhaps, not fit to scale the heights? Is there, possibly, no hope forhim to rise higher?In such a state of mind, the aspiring yogi would do best not to be tooanalytical. He should simply love God, and leave the decision as to his fate inthe hands of the Divine. Nishkam karma—action without desire for the fruits ofaction—should be his motto all the way to and beyond the door of death.The third type of failure is simply to have fallen short, so far, of perfection.Such a person may remain for a long time amid the beauties of an astralheaven—which, when he returns to earth, will remain with him subconsciously as aconstant reminder that this world is not his true home. Or, he may returnquickly to earth, filled with the zeal to continue his search for God. In hisnext life he may begin his spiritual efforts again at a young age, and neverrest until the divine goal is attained.Alternatively, he may fail to reach God but be liberated, at last, from earthlykarma and continue his quest for perfection on the astral plane.My Guru often used the example of planting the seed of a tree. It takes time forthe seed to sprout. It takes more time for the shoot to protrude up out of theground; then for the sapling to rise—slender at first, then gradually strongerand taller. The seed must be watered. It must be protected from lower life-formsthat may threaten it. When it becomes a sapling, it may need protection within awire enclosure from larger animals. Once the tree has “grown up,” even a deermay be able to strop its antlers on the bark without devastating the trunk. Forthis long process, however, patience is required. Don’t keep digging up yourplant of faith to see if it is growing. Act as you should for the present, andleave the results in God’s hands. Whether you succeed in finding Him in thislife, or must find Him in another, or even wait several more lifetimes: thesethings should not be your present concern. Think only how many incarnations youbuilt up an opposite momentum. It takes time to break out into the vastness ofeternity from the hard shell you have created over many lives. Be content to doyour best, for now, and leave the results in God’s hands.The path to God is not like plodding wearily over a barren desert in hope offinding an oasis. Every step of the way becomes more beautiful: verdant,flowery, and infinitely varied. The longer one meditates with sincerity, themore his senses become refined. Colors become to him more beautiful; sounds,more thrilling; scents, more delightful. All life becomes, for him, increasinglywonderful. When he is able to penetrate behind the physical senses, the subtle,astral senses provide him with even keener delights. He must go beyond astralexperiences also, but it is encouraging to know that those inner sights andsounds are far more wonderful; smells, more pleasurable; tastes entrancing.Yogananda wrote once that God can come to the devotee as a thousand delectabletastes all crushed into one. As for the sense of touch, sex desires make oneseek pleasure in touching and being touched through the skin, but this touch isa pale substitute for the thrill of touching everything from within, throughexpanded consciousness.On should live more wholeheartedly right now, enjoying his yoga practices,thinking of this moment, not of the future, but simply loving God in the presentand offering oneself up to the Lord without any expectation of reward. Youshould remind yourself, indeed, that there is no you to be rewarded!The chief reason people get discouraged is their expectation of specificresults. Learn to expect nothing. Is it not joy enough to be at least seekingHim, and not running ceaselessly toward mirage images that, as you know fullwell, will evaporate even as you approach them?God is the only answer to man’s quest for happiness! What more do you need, thatyou think may satisfy you before you once again start seeking Him?(6:40) The Blessed Lord answered: O Arjuna, My son! One who performs rightactions can never be destroyed. Whether in this world or the next, his fate willnever be evil.As we saw above (after 6:34), everybody knows he must work to achieve outwardsuccess. What seems so difficult on the spiritual path is that God is so close,and yet so hard to perceive! Monetary riches are outside us, and need to beacquired. God is, as my Guru said, “the nearest of the near.” Why, then, does Heseem so far away?!There is a story Yogananda loved to tell about the musk deer of the Himalayas.At a certain season of the year this deer secretes in a pouch in its navel thedelightful fragrance of musk. The deer runs frantically about, trying to findthe source of this wonderful perfume. Sometimes, in its eager desperation, itplunges from a high crag to its death in the valley below. The huntsman thenfinds it, cuts out the pouch, and sells it for a high price in the marketplace.“O musk deer!” a poet once wrote, “Why could you not understand that thefragrance you sought was ever with you—in your very self?”This is the struggling yogi’s greatest difficulty: His energy is alreadyhabituated to flowing outward through the senses. My Guru pointed out that anyattempt to satisfy personal hunger by feeding someone else would result instarving oneself. To seek fulfillment by feeding the senses is to feed somethingone is not. As my Guru said also, “You have to live anyway. Why not live in theright way?” The failed yogi, despite the deep and unavoidable disappointment hefeels with himself, is much greater as a human being than the most successfulmaterialist.“So long as you continue to make the effort,” Yogananda said finally, “God willnever let you down. But if you tell yourself, ‘I’ve failed,’ it will be true—forthis lifetime at least—though your subconscious desire for God will bring youback to the spiritual path again and again until you succeed in finding Him. Butwhy delay? If you slip, or even fall, tell yourself, ‘I know what I want, and Iam going to keep on trying till I succeed!’”Remember the popular saying, “If at first you don’t succeed, try and try again.”God is your own Father/Mother, as Krishna reminds us all by addressing Arjuna inthis stanza as his son.(6:41) A fallen (but sincere) yogi gains entry (after death) into the world ofthe virtuous. He (may) remain there for many years. Afterward, he is reborn onearth into a good and prosperous home.The idea that one’s birth is decided only biologically is largely a myth. One’sgenes do have something to do with the shape of the physical body, but even thatshape and other characteristics are determined also by personal karma. It may bedetermined somewhat also by mass karma, which can dictate such matters as skincolor, racial influences, and even the sex of the body. The mental and spiritualqualities of a spiritual person, however, attract him to families that willencourage the advancing yogi to continue in his spiritual search. Prosperity isalso given him as a means of helping him to satisfy whatever lingering materialdesires he possessed.The fallen yogi described here is one who, as yet imperfect in his spiritualquest, has temporarily slackened or even abandoned his spiritual efforts.Otherwise, yogis who have been unsuccessful, but are still eager to continuetheir spiritual efforts may return to earth relatively soon. Spiritual progress,except for those who have attained a high state of advancement, is not possiblefor them in the astral spheres. Life there, for the virtuous, is so beautifuland harmonious that one who is only a visitor from the earth plane of existence,having still some material karma to work out, feels little or no incentive tocontinue his spiritual practices. The very realm to which he is attracted willbe inhabited by those alone whose tastes and interests are similar to his own,or they may contain beloved family members, or have such conditions as will helpto fulfill some deep personal desire. Refined earthly desires—such as forbeautiful music, “heavenly” scenery, a harmonious community of friends, orotherwise idyllic conditions—can be satisfied better in the astral world than onEarth.Thus, those yogis who attract a prolonged stay in the astral world—it may beeven for hundreds of years—live there in consequence of their spiritualpractices on Earth, even if, here, they fell away from their practices. Thosewho practice even a little bit of meditation in this life—its natural focusbeing on developing the intuition—are attracted to heavenly astral regions anddiscover there an increased power of enjoyment.Yogis, on the other hand, who leave their physical bodies at death with a deepdesire for God, but who still retain a few lingering (perhaps only subconscious)material desires, will often reject the attraction of astral delights, viewingthem as a detour on their upward journey. Such souls, aware that more incentivesexist for continued progress in a physical body, may choose to be rebornrelatively soon on Earth. (The time of their sojourn in the astral world willdepend, among other factors, on such things as how intense their desire is tocontinue their spiritual progress, and on their compatibility with karmicconditions on this Earth, or on some other planet, at the time.)There are countless inhabited planets in the material universe. People are by nomeans limited to reincarnating on Earth. As mankind advances into higher yugas,or ages, those souls who reincarnated here in darker times may be attracted toless enlightened civilizations on other planets, where the level of advancementis more compatible with their own actual state of refinement.The universe, considered by modern astronomy to be almost devoid of conditionsfor intelligent life, is actually teeming with it. Even the stars, ParamhansaYogananda declared, are peopled with intelligent beings with highly refinedbodies, whose “food” and “breath” is fiery light. Accounts of “UFOs” visitingthis world are (many of them) perfectly true. Such visitations come from manyplanets, some of them friendly, others with primarily self-serving interest. Inthe last analysis, the entire universe is a vast, interconnected web ofconsciousness. Modern science declares it would be impossible for theinhabitants of planets that are situated many light years away from us to makesuch a long journey. Yogananda’s answer to that declaration was that science isstill in its infancy. It is definitely possible, he declared, to travel overvast reaches by means other than those so far imaginable in materialisticscience.Those yogis who, leaving this world, are “fed up” with it but still have someearthly karma to work out, may have a very long stay in the astral world beforetheir earthly karma pulls them back, obliging them to cope with it again.(6:42) On the other hand, he may reincarnate on earth in a family of enlightenedyogis. Such a birth in this world, however, is difficult to attain.(6:43) (In his new family) he recovers the yogic discrimination he attainedformerly, and sets himself with even greater zeal to achieve (final) spiritualliberation.Krishna describes here what happens to the third kind of “fallen” yogi—fallenonly in the sense that, at death, he has not fully expiated his conscious andsubconscious ego-motivated desires.Rebirth in the home of advanced yogis is difficult to attain, for such peopleseldom marry, and those who do so may prefer not to have children. My Gururelated to me, in this connection, the story of Byasa (author of the BhagavadGita) and Sukdeva. Byasa was a realized soul. When his wife conceived Sukdeva,he taught the child, through the mother’s subconscious, while the unborn infantwas still in its mother’s womb. The child after birth was given the name,Sukdeva.Sukdeva, when he reached the age of seven, set out from home to find a guru. Hisfather, who was himself well fitted to play that role, followed after the littlechild, pleading that he remain in the family and pursue his spiritual practicesthere. The child looked back at him disdainfully.“Keep away from me!” he said. “You have maya!”—as if telling his father, “Youhave an infectious disease!” What Sukdeva disapproved of was the lingeringthought in his father’s mind that this child was his son.Byasa then sent him to another great yogi, who was also qualified to give himenlightenment. That subject, however, is not germane to our present discussion.One’s past-life spiritual attainments are retained enduringly in the astralbrain. Like seeds, they sprout when the conditions are right. What triggers a“right” condition may be almost anything. Sri Ramakrishna, the great master wholived in the nineteenth century, in Bengal, India, had his first spiritualawakening as a child on beholding a flock of cranes flying in graceful beautyagainst a gray sky.(6:44) The power of former yoga practice is sufficient to impel, as it were, thereborn yogi on his upward path. Even one who seeks only a theoreticalunderstanding of yoga is more highly advanced than one who is dedicated tooutward scriptural (Vedic) rites.Paramhansa Yogananda stated that the last few words of this stanza can betranslated alternatively to mean, “. . . than someone who is dedicated to merelyreciting the Vedic word of Brahman: the sacred AUM.”People of spiritual insight know that the main purpose of performing rituals,and even of chanting AUM, is symbolic. It can exert a kind of power thatattracts certain beneficial results. It cannot possibly, however, result infreedom from karma, being itself a karmic act that involves the doer in avariety of subsequent reactions, none of which can extricate the ego frombondage to the limitations of individuality.Infinitely more important than chanting AUM is it to listen to AUM in the rightear in meditation. Closing the tragi of the ears with the thumbs (the elbowsresting lightly on a crosspiece of wood), AUM is chanted mentally at the pointbetween the eyebrows while the mind concentrates on the sounds appearing (as hasbeen stated) in the right ear. One should concentrate on only one sound at atime. The very concentration on that sound will attune one to subtler levels ofsound, until one hears the Cosmic Vibration. This yoga technique should belearned personally in its various ramifications from a true teacher. It is animportant part of the path taught by Paramhansa Yogananda.(6:45) Diligently following his (chosen) path, and cleansing himself thereby ofall sin (karmic debts), the yogi after many births attains perfection, andenters at last into the Supreme Beatitude.Lahiri Mahasaya, who first reintroduced Kriya Yoga to the world in modern times,explained this passage in an esoteric sense also. When a man exhales and cannotinhale again, he dies. Later, when he is reborn in a new body, he inhales tomake his first cry, and thus resumes living in this world. Similarly, when ameditating yogi goes breathless, the breath is forcibly drawn out of his body.This condition is a kind of “partial death,” reminiscent of something Saint Paulsaid in the Bible, “I die daily.” In this sense, when the yogi returns tooutward consciousness and resumes breathing, his first act is to inhale again.Thus, during meditation in his present body he undergoes, in a very real sense,the process of death and rebirth.In this way he can fulfill even in one lifetime the promise of Krishna that willhasten his evolution—a process which normally requires “many births”—and cancomplete the long work even in his present body.There is a more superficial, but very helpful, practice that can be conjoined tothe breathing process. The time to affirm, or embrace, a new state ofconsciousness is after a deep inhalation. The time to expel from the body anyunwanted thought or habit is while deliberately exhaling—blowing that thoughtout of one’s being, so to speak. “Habits,” Yogananda used to say, “can bechanged in a day. They are simply the result of concentrated energy. Direct thatenergy in a new way, and the habit you want to overcome can be instantlydispelled.” The breath, when accompanied by strong mental affirmation, is thebest medium for bringing into one’s nature the thoughts and qualities one wants,and for ridding oneself of those which one wants to dismiss. In this case, too,each exhaling breath can be a little death (of the discarded quality, anyway),and each inhalation can be a little rebirth into some new quality one desires toadopt.(6:46) The yogi is greater than those ascetics who (strive for spiritualperfection through) discipline of the body, greater even than those who followthe path of wisdom (Gyana Yoga) or of action (Karma Yoga). Become, O Arjuna, ayogi!The goal of physical discipline is twofold: to bring the body under the controlof one’s will, and to rechannel the energy from the body so that the energy canserve a higher purpose. In Christian monasteries, self-flagellation (whippingone’s back, even to the point where blood was drawn) used to be a commonpractice (it is no longer allowed). The idea behind it was to “punish” the bodyfor its carnal desires, and thereby to discourage them from becoming tooinsistent in their efforts to sway the mind—as if the mind were ruled by thebody, instead of the reverse!As Yogananda, in challenge to the thought that the body causes nervousness,said: “Hold up a piece of paper in your hand. Will it shake on its own? Never!To shake it, you yourself must do the shaking.” The mind is influenced byphysical awareness, but its response, always, comes from the awareness itself.Carnal desires originate not in the body, even though they obviously areinfluenced by the body. The origin of temptation, however, is in the mind.Nothing inert can influence the mind without the mind’s willing cooperation,whether consciously or subconsciously. Thus, the Roman Catholic Church was rightto rule against self-flagellation. It is an indirect and fundamentally unsoundspiritual practice.In India the practice developed ages ago (Buddha encountered it in his ownspiritual search) to discipline the body for other purposes: to cause theenergy, by blocking its outward flow, to reverse that flow inward. We mentionedthis practice in the commentary following Gita 3:7. Certain ascetics, forexample, practice holding one arm continuously aloft until the muscles witheraway, and the arm looks like skin and bone. It comes easily to “modern” peopleto ridicule such a practice: It does seem extreme—to the point of fanaticism.Yet, one wonders: could such practices have endured for thousands of years hadthey not shown some benefits?An American soldier in India after World War II happened to come upon a sadhuseated with one shriveled arm raised high above his head.“Hey, there!” called the soldier mockingly. “Are you praying to God to dropfruit in your hand?”“Why don’t you try it yourself?” was the smiling reply.The American jokingly raised both arms to the sky. To his dismay, he found hecouldn’t take them down again.“Please, sir,” he cried. “Let me lower my arms!”“Why don’t you finish what you started?” replied the other.“What do you mean?”“Ask God to drop fruit into your hands,” said the sadhu.The American, feeling very foolish, called out, “Heavenly Father, please send mesome fruit!”Immediately, several fruits materialized in his hands. Later on, having loweredhis arms and returned to his friends, he commented, “They were delicious!”Physical self-discipline does “bear fruit” of a kind. Even self-flagellationcannot but have had some positive effect for it to have been practiced for somany centuries. What Krishna is saying in this stanza, however, is thatdisciplining the body is an indirect and incomplete way of freeing the mind frombody-consciousness.The same may be said of the other disciplines mentioned here: Gyana Yoga andKarma Yoga. (Karma Yoga, it should be mentioned, is also used by Krishna in theBhagavad Gita in reference to the yoga of inner action—Kriya Yoga.)For deep meditation, it is necessary to rise above body-consciousness bywithdrawing the energy from the senses to the spine. Outward, physical practicesmay be described as attempts to bludgeon the body into surrendering its grip onthe energy. Gyana Yoga tries—again, indirectly, and for most peopleineffectually—to separate the mind from the body by mental discipline: theexercise of calm dispassion. This practice is helpful too, and can be effectiveto some extent. It is indirect, however, insofar as it doesn’t work on theenergy itself to withdraw it from the body.We used the example in the commentary following Gita 2:58, of a visit to thedentist. One can separate his concentration from the pain in his tooth while thedentist is working on it. One way of doing so is to think of something else—forexample, to concentrate on solving some problem in one’s life. Another way is todivert the mind by calmly watching the breath (following the technique mentionedearlier). Still another way is to tell oneself, “I have lived for x number ofyears, and have had many happy hours and days. What, by comparison, are thesefew minutes of pain?” Thus broadening his base in time, the pain he endures forthose minutes will seem insignificant and, with sufficient will power, will beeasy to endure.Karma Yoga, also, is an indirect way of withdrawing the energy. By nishkamkarma—renunciation of attachment to the fruits of action—one withdraws hisenergy from avid feeling toward anything outward, and mentally centers hisconsciousness in the Self. By meditating with the same attitude of offering thefruits of meditation up to God, one becomes less anxious about results, andachieves, to that extent, a degree of inner peace.None of these methods, however, nor any other among the countless religiousmethods in the world for uplifting the mind, is as effective as working directlyon the energy itself. Once a person understands the true purpose of chanting toGod; dancing in God; offering oblations (of ghee, rice, etc.) to God; of beatingdrums during worship (reminiscent of the sound emitted by the lowest, muladharachakra); of playing the flute at religious ceremonies (reminiscent of the soundproduced in meditation by the next higher center, the swadisthana chakra); ofplucking harp strings in reminder of heavenly harp music (reminiscent of thesound produced by the lumbar, or manipura chakra); of ringing bells (reminiscentof the sound of the heart center, the anahata chakra)—once one understands thehidden reason for why these sounds actually inspire and uplift the mind, it isan inescapable conclusion that the mind is really uplifted by raising the energyin the spine, and that this effect can be produced even more effectively whenone’s concentration is directly applied to the energy itself.Again, this is not to say that those outward practices are “mere superstition.”Dr. Lewis, Yogananda’s first Kriya Yoga disciple in America and a “staidBostonian,” cringed when our Guru pounded an Indian drum during group chanting.“Learn to enjoy it!” said Yogananda. “It helps to loosen the karma in thespine.” (He may have meant “the samskaras,” a term with which Dr. Lewis was lessfamiliar. Alternatively, the Guru may actually have said “karma,” to pair hisexplanation with the disciple’s understanding of Indian terms.) What he meantwas, “The drum, beaten with a sensitive rhythm—and not with the heavy poundingof a ‘bongo’ drum or similar primitive instrument intended to inflame theemotions—helps to release blockages in the lowest center so that the energy canflow upward in the spine.”(6:47) He who, full of faith and love, becomes fully absorbed in Me, I regard asbest attuned to My path to perfection.What is that path? It is the balanced, moderate path explained thus far in theBhagavad Gita.Krishna emphasizes faith not as blind belief, but as the certainty born ofcomplete intuitive understanding and acceptance. He emphasizes love because,without devotional love, the seeker cannot (as Swami Sri Yukteswar put it) setone foot before the other on the path to God.Raja Yoga is not a separate path to God. Other forms of yoga, and otherreligious disciplines, may rightly be spoken of (as Yogananda did) as bypaths,or as subsidiary streams contributing to the mighty river of energy which flowsup the spine to the brain.Gyana Yoga, or discriminative understanding, is essential for separating one’senergy-flow from outward involvement, and for keeping it moving upward, towardGod. Bhakti Yoga, which is the exercise of intense devotion, is essential as ameans of awakening and channeling all one’s feelings upward. Otherwise, withgyana alone, one might be like the man living next door to a famous restaurantwho never went to it for food, because he craved only “hot dogs” (sausages) andgreasy fried potatoes.Thus ends the sixth chapter, called “Dhyana Yoga (Union Through Meditation),” ofthe Upanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna andArjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter NineteenKNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM(7:1) The Blessed Lord said: O Partha (Arjuna), hear how, by following the pathof yoga and absorbing yourself in My consciousness, and taking shelter (wholly)in Me, you will realize Me wholly as I am (both in My Infinite, unmoving Self,and, outwardly, with all My attributes and powers). (Knowing Me thus,) you willtranscend every possibility of doubt.Paramhansa Yogananda was given a word of advice by Bhaduri Mahasaya when he wasa boy. He related the episode in the chapter, “The Levitating Saint,” from hisAutobiography of a Yogi:“‘You go often into the silence, but have you developed anubhava [actualperception of God]?’ [The master] was reminding me to love God more thanmeditation. ‘Do not mistake the technique for the Goal.’”In the above stanza, Krishna is implying the same truth as that contained in thewell-known saying, “The flower falls off when the fruit appears.” Yoga impliesmore than a set of practices: The word itself means union, which is the end ofall spiritual practices and the state of perfect realization.(7:2) I am about to unfold truth to you in its entirety, both as theory and asintuitively realized experience. (Armed with this understanding,) there will benothing left for you to know in all the world.An amazing aspect of omniscience is that its perception truly encompasseseverything. It is “center everywhere, circumference nowhere”—the knowledge ofeverything from within, and at the same time from without—in other words, inboth its theoretical and experiential reality. As Jesus Christ put it, “The veryhairs on your head are all numbered” (Matt. 10:30).The Bhagavad Gita, amazingly also, includes all three completely: the theory asto why one should seek God; the methods—those which are best, those which areindirect, and those which are least praiseworthy—for finding Him; and also thenature of the goal itself.All these things Krishna now promises to reveal.(7:3) Among thousands of men, scarcely one strives for spiritual perfection; andamong those blessed ones who seek Me, scarcely one (out of many thousands)perceives Me as I am.These words might seem to sound a discouraging note for the earnest seeker, whodoesn’t want to think his chances of success are all but non-existent! Thispassage should be understood also, however, in the larger context of the manyplanes of existence through which the soul must pass to reach absoluteperfection. Few there are indeed who, from the earth’s low valley, make itdirectly to the top of the mountain. Most souls climb by degrees. Once they riseabove the ordinary astral heavens, spurning its comparatively “gaudy” delights,they ascend to higher regions—Hiranyaloka, for example, on which Yogananda’sguru told him he had been born as a savior (see the chapter, “The Resurrectionof Sri Yukteswar,” in Autobiography of a Yogi).We saw earlier that the path to God in no way resembles a barren desert, overwhich weary travelers trudge until at last they reach the oasis of God-vision.Most seekers—even those who are highly advanced—go from earth to higher regionsfor further enlightenment. The path is long, but at every step it is extremelyrewarding. Even a few days spent in an uplifting environment among spiritualpeople, practicing regular meditation with them (or for that matter practicingit alone in one’s home, if one is content to proceed without such outerencouragement), produce in the eyes a newly radiant happiness, virtuallyimpossible to encounter among sensation-hungry kayasthas (body-bound humanbeings).In this stanza, Krishna is not trying to discourage people, but only to stiffentheir spines with a challenge not to dabble with one finger in shallow waters.The spiritual path is for heroes, not for cowards or weaklings. The commonargument, “Why should I try to be different from everybody else?” deserves to beanswered with another question: “Do you want to go on suffering, like ‘everybodyelse’?”That argument often continues: “I don’t see all that much suffering around me.People smile when they meet others. They bear up bravely under hardship. Some ofthem do suffer, but I also see a lot of gladness, many happy homes, and muchlaughter and general contentment.” What they really see, however, is people’shope for all these things, and the masks they wear hide their gnawing emptinessas they dream of a future when, they affirm, everything will change for thebetter. It never does.A survey was once conducted in America to find out if people were satisfied withtheir income. The survey covered people in most income brackets, from therelatively poor to the wealthy. A majority of the respondents replied that theywould be happy, if they had ten percent more. That ten percent represents thecarrot on a stick which draws the donkey forward pulling a heavy load behind it.Delusion leads one onward in the expectation of, finally, achieving happinessand contentment. It is the soul’s desire for bliss, really, forever prodding theego to think it can somehow embrace infinity! No one is really either happy orcontented. What passes for contentment among men is numbness! People think,“Tomorrow I’ll get (this, or that, or the other thing) that I want.” How veryfew people exclaim during the final moments of death, “I got all that I everwanted!”? Indeed, only those worldly people (samsaris) die more or lesssatisfied who settled in early youth for a pale compromise!My Guru sometimes quoted the first (Adhi) Swami Shankara, “Childhood is busywith toys; youth is busy with sex; middle age is busy with earning money; oldage is busy with regrets and illnesses: Nobody is busy with God!” My Gurucommented, “Well, he was bitter, but such is indeed the human condition. Howmany people try to find anything real in life?”(7:4) Earth, water, fire, air, ether, the perceiving mind (manas), discernment(buddhi), and causative self-awareness (ahankara): such are the Eightfolddivisions of My manifested nature (Prakriti).Krishna is speaking here in cosmic, not in limited individual terms. In so doinghe pushes outward the very edges of what mankind in this age is capable ofunderstanding.Again we should stress, as we have done before, that “earth, water, fire,” etc.are Spirit’s stages of manifestation into gross matter. Tradition calls themelements, but the “elements,” as the term was formerly used, were never intendedas chemical terms. The elemental stages of Spirit’s manifestation into matterbegin with “ether,” or space, which Paramhansa Yogananda declared to be adistinct vibration, separating the astral from the physical universe. Out ofether, gaseous clouds (nebulae) emerge: the “air element.” The atoms of space,wandering without any apparent aim, may be as far separate from one another assixteen miles. If two of them happen to collide, their gravity increases, andone might say that their “purpose” also increases, for it becomes increasinglylikely, as more atoms coalesce, that they will “amount to something,” in time.Gradually that growing clump may increase in size to exert enough gravity toattract atoms from far away—ultimately, from as far away as many millions ofmiles. Thus, as this mass develops, it becomes large enough in time to become anincandescent star (the “fire element”). If this mass is not large enough toachieve incandescence—or if, perhaps, a relatively small mass gets expelled froma star—it becomes a smaller, molten sphere: a planet. Thus is brought intomanifestation the “water element.” As molten matter cools, it becomes solid,whereupon it manifests the “earth element.”Nature (Prakriti) contains other “divisions”: mind (manas), which perceives all;intuitive intelligence (buddhi), which comprehends all; and the ego principle(ahankara) on a cosmic scale, which is the one Self in all outwardmanifestation. Egoism, in this case, is still a principle, but notindividualized as it becomes in man, with his sharpened perception of himself asliving in a particular human body. The ego is the soul identified with the body.Even so, cosmic (causal) Self-awareness, as distinct from Brahman, is that Selfidentified with the entire manifested universe as its body.It is interesting that Krishna in this stanza does not give the fourth aspect ofconsciousness that is classically listed: chitta. Chitta is feeling. We perceivewith the mind; define with the intellect; identify personally with the ego; andfeel one way or another about things with the chitta. Most people identify theircapacity for feeling with their emotions, and therefore with their reactiveprocess, both subjective and objective. Yoga itself is defined as theneutralization of this feeling process—not as its cancellation, but as (so tospeak) its subduing or pacification. Thus, one might expect Krishna to have notmerely listed, but stressed, this aspect of consciousness.On the other hand, chitta is more than an aspect of consciousness: It isconsciousness. In man, chitta is far more than the reactive feelings in hisheart: It is deep, intuitive feeling, which defines the very consciousness ofself. In divine consciousness, chitta becomes cosmic feeling: not that of theego, but of the divine Self: Absolute Bliss. Bliss is ever-existing,ever-conscious, and (as Yogananda added) ever-new. In the chapter ofAutobiography of a Yogi titled, “An Experience in Cosmic Consciousness,”Yogananda stated of his first experience of that state, “I cognized the centerof the empyrean as a point of intuitive perception in my heart.”In ordinary, unenlightened human beings, the ego is centered in the medullaoblongata. The yogi looks forward, as it were, from that point to the Kutastha,or “Christ center” between the two eyebrows. The more he concentrates on thatpoint, the more his consciousness becomes identified with it, until his centerof self-awareness shifts from ego to superconsciousness. Most people, inwhatever they do, radiate energy outward from the medulla oblongata at the backof the head—the seat of ego in the body. An enlightened master, by contrast,radiates energy outward from his transformed self-awareness, which is centeredin the Kutastha at the point between the eyebrows. This is still the ego, whicheven the enlightened man needs in order to keep his body functioning. The divineSelf, as differentiated from the enlightened ego, has its center in the heart.As the yogi raises his own consciousness through the spine, his awakenedKundalini passes upward in reverse order from that of its descent. First itpasses through, and awakens, the energy in muladhara, the coccyx (or “earth”)center. Next, it awakens the energy in swadisthana, the sacral (or “water”)center. Third, it enters and awakens the energy in manipura, the lumbar (or“fire”) center. The fourth center it awakens is anahata, the dorsal or heartcenter (“air”); then bishuddha, the cervical (“ether”) center. As each chakra is“awakened”—that is to say, as its energy is released to flow upward—a specificyogic power appears: an ability to become extremely heavy (the “earth element”);to walk on water (the “water element”); to walk on fiery coals without beingburned (the “fire element”); the ability to levitate or even fly (the “airelement”); and finally, the ability to expand his consciousness beyond theconfines of the body (the “ether element”).These powers are helpful in that they can assure the yogi that his attainmentsare not merely imaginary. They can also be dangerous, however, in the temptationthey create for the ego. Saint Teresa of Avila, in Spain, was a Christian saintwho often levitated as she knelt at prayer. So anxious was she not to drawattention to herself that she tried, ineffectively, to hold on to her seat so asnot to rise in the air. Many are the stories of saints in both East and Westthat describe the phenomenon of levitation.With the yogi’s rise spiritually, yoga practice purifies his ego to the pointwhere he perceives egoism as a general, impersonal principle, and not as limitedto his own (human) ego. His perception, then, is with the cosmic mind (manas),and is no longer limited to his individual self. His intellect, too, becomes auniversal, intuitive intelligence and understanding.The Supreme Spirit, in manifesting the universe, set a portion of itsconsciousness vibrating to produce the great sound-vibration of AUM. This is Godin His aspect of Divine Mother: Paraprakriti, the pure aspect of the CosmicVibration. In its outward manifestations that aspect becomes, simply, Prakriti,or Aparaprakriti: the outer “show” that we see through the senses: trees, hills,people—the whole star system around us. People who try to “commune” with Naturein beautiful sunsets, colorful clouds, and soaring mountains cannot enter intotrue communion with the Divine, even though these things do (or at least oughtto) remind one of God. True communion with Nature can be done only inwardly,through communion with AUM.The yogi, in deep, inner communion with AUM, after raising his consciousness atleast to the bishuddha (cervical), finds his awareness expanding—first to thewhole body, then outward to encompass all space. This state is described also asAUM samadhi. Next, he perceives the Kutastha Chaitanya, or Christ consciousness,behind the AUM vibration in his body. Gradually he expands that consciousness toencompass Christ consciousness in all manifested existence.I once asked my Guru, “What point must one have reached to be rightly considereda master?”“One must,” he replied, “have attained Christ consciousness.”Thus, this stanza of the Gita provides details regarding both Spirit’smanifestation in matter, and its ascent back to Spirit, through the deeppractice of yoga.The sense-identified mind is centered outside the spiritual eye. Intuitiveintelligence works from inside the spiritual eye. From this point a subtleconnection takes the yogi’s consciousness up to the many-rayed sahasrara (the“thousand-petaled lotus”) at the top of the head. Union with this point producesCosmic consciousness. Perfect inner union and Cosmic consciousness are one andthe same thing. Time and space are illusory. To probe to its depths the single“atom” of ego is to understand, simultaneously, the mystery of the universe.(7:5) Such is My lower nature (Aparaprakriti). Understand now, O Mighty-armed(Arjuna)! that My other and higher nature (Paraprakriti) sustains the soul(jiva), which is individual consciousness, and sustains also the life-principleof the universe.The jiva, or soul, is individualized consciousness: the infinite limited to, andidentified with, a body. The beginning of its existence as an individual soulcomes with the causal body. The soul’s further encasement in an astral body iswhat causes it first to manifest ego-consciousness. Identification with thatbody of light is what causes one to think, “I am unique and different from otherbeings of light.” Ego-consciousness becomes further bound to objective realitywhen it assumes a physical body, and all its energy is directed outward throughthe physical senses.In the material world, man’s awareness of outer Nature (Aparaprakriti) virtuallydefines his concept of reality. In the astral world, that outward direction ofawareness is only partial. Though limited by ego-consciousness, he neverthelesssenses the reality of the energy within him, which subtly links him to theobjective realities around him. In the causal world, he knows that everything ismade of idea-forms, or thoughts. Separate ego-consciousness ceases, for him, toexist, and he knows himself as the soul (jiva), a manifestation of Paraprakriti:pure Nature. He is attuned to the Kutastha Chaitanya—the Christ consciousnessunderlying the universe. Blessed with this high state of realization, andvirtually freed from every self-limitation, his consciousness is crowned withalmost infinite power.The universe, seen from without (through the senses), is composed of grossmatter and—in the astral world—of unsheathed energy that can manifest beautifulheavens, but also terrifying hells where hatred, despair, and other violentlynegative emotions are no longer confined within and, to that extent suppressedby, thick walls of flesh.The satanic force is not a separate reality from the divine. It is simply theoutwardly manifesting creative force (Aparaprakriti) which, once set intomotion, is bent on continuing that momentum. Without that initial impetus, theuniverse could not have come into being.This impetus toward continuing that outward thrust becomes—downward fromwhatever point one is standing on the long climb back to God—the force of evil.It is a conscious force, universal and no mere individual moral weakness. It isno more personal than the Cosmic Vibration itself. Man can attract evil tohimself, however, (as he can also, of course, attract divine assistance) by anyaffection he feels for lower influences.Good and evil are, it should be understood, relative terms. If a saint foundhimself attracted to self-gratifying actions that in other people would beperfectly normal, he would open himself to the outwardly flowing energy ofAparaprakriti. Others might not see him to be operating under the satanicinfluence if he began trying to boost his own importance, to gain name and fame,to enjoy (in ways that others might consider perfectly normal) a few of thepleasures to which most of humanity is addicted. Nevertheless, through hisgrowing attraction to these things he would be responding to the satanic force.Satan is impersonal. He is, however, willing to draw man down to any degree ofdegradation acceptable to man himself. There is no limit to how far theindividual can fall, just as there is no limit to how high he can rise.The inward pull of Paraprakriti (the mighty sound of AUM) is ever available inthe soul. If, however, one insists on looking outward for his satisfactions hewill succumb to the outward pull of Aparaprakriti, or Satan, which also is everat the disposal of those who, though they laugh at “temptations of the devil”and at “the devil’s wiles,” think it merely fun to get drunk, perfectly normalon occasion to lose their temper and shout angrily, and—so far from it seemingwrong as to be virtually expected of them—to seek endless sexual enjoyment. Totell such people that they are under satanic influence might well invite fromthem gales of mirth. Nevertheless, the downward slope, once entered upon, exertsat least this much appeal: it appears easy. Those who walk, run, or slidedownhill eagerly would rather not think about the long, hard climb back up thehill again.The astral world contains both angels (devas) and demons (asuras). They areattracted to their own kind among human beings. Angels go where goodnesspredominates, and where they can inspire people with heavenly thoughts. Demonsor devils go where maya (Aparaprakriti) holds sway: to bars where people drinkto get drunk; to the madness that reigns on the floor of a commodities exchange;to the corridors of power and corruption; to places of infamy, violence, andhatred. If demons are able to do so, they go beyond merely influencing peopletoward negativity and harmful emotions: Sometimes—for example, through theweakened power of self-protection in a person who is drunk—they succeed inentering a person’s mind and body, and even in committing crimes through him,using his body—deeds of which the person has no recollection, later on.“Thoughts,” Yogananda wrote in Autobiography of a Yogi, “are universally and notindividually rooted.” Inspirations are not created: they must be invited. Actsof hatred and violence are a sign of man’s openness to demonic forces, and arenot by any means initiated only by human beings themselves.The great masters who come (rarely, alas) on earth do so in response not only toneed, but to humanity’s consciousness of that need. Once here, they try (withinthe strictures of divine law) to be of universal help. Paramhansa Yogananda, forinstance, during his early years in Los Angeles, would sometimes walk up anddown a street containing many bars and other places of iniquity. He saidnothing, but clearly he was trying to influence any patrons of those places whowere receptive to his spiritual vibrations to change their way of life.Normally, alas, what causes man to change his ways is suffering. God doesn’twant man to suffer. When, however, one goes contrary to the direction that leadsto harmony, it is inevitable that he will experience disharmony.Hell—contrary to some popular beliefs—is not a place of permanent confinement.The Biblical term, “everlasting hell,” is simply a myth, and (probably) amisconception either in the reporting or in the translation. “The thing is,”Yogananda said, “hell seems everlasting.” Such, indeed, is the nature of sorrowand suffering: The sufferer thinks nothing will ever again improve for him.Every state of consciousness creates a vritti, or vortex, which seeks to drawinto itself whatever comes within its orbit.Don’t be fooled into thinking that because a state of consciousness, or a way ofbehavior, is so common as to seem universal it is therefore normal and right. Tobe in “normal” health is to be physically well. To be “normal” spiritually is tobe out of delusion and fully aware of oneself as a child of God. Everything elseis abnormal!“Lord,” prayed the Christian Saint Augustine, “Thou hast made us for Thyself,and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in Thee.”(7:6) Know that all beings, (both) the pure and the impure, are born of thistwofold Prakriti. I (alone) beget and dissolve the (whole) universe.(7:7) O Arjuna! There is nothing above Me, nor beyond Me. Through all things, asthrough the gemstones of a necklace, runs the thread of My all-unifyingconsciousness.As the thread is what supports and unites all the beads, so God’s consciousnesssupports, sustains, and unites everything in creation.(7:8) O Son of Kunti (the quality of dispassion), I am the fluidity of waters; Iam the light of the moon and the sun; I am pranaba (AUM) in the (teachings ofthe) Vedas; I am (the “silent” roar of cosmic) sound in the ether (the subtlevibrations of space); I am the manhood in man.Throughout the Bhagavad Gita there are hidden, as well as overt, meanings. The“fluidity of waters” is a subtle reference to the vibratory motion of the“elements,” which we’ve discussed above. The “moon and sun” refer to negativeand positive polarities in the universe and in man’s body. The pranaba (AUM)taught in the Vedas refers to the subtle inner sounds (which emanate from thechakras). The “sound in the ether” is audible, though not to ordinary ears;other traditions (notably the Greek) have described it as “the music of thespheres.” The “manhood of man” refers to that special attribute possessed bymankind (among earth’s creatures) which enables him to advance spiritually byfree will.(7:9) I am the wholesome fragrance of earth; I am the radiance of fire; I am thelife of every creature; in holy ascetics, I am their austerity.As in the previous stanza, the reference here is subtle as well as overt. Earthand fire are the “elements” of two of the lower chakras. It is divine vitalitywhich vibrates in the “air,” or anahata (the dorsal, or heart) chakra.Self-discipline emanates from the Kutastha center between the eyebrows, and(ultimately) from sahasrara, the “crown chakra” at the top of the head. Amagnetic polarity (as we said earlier in this book) exists between the earthcenter (muladhara) and the dorsal (heart) or anahata center. By meditating onthe heart center, with support from fiery self-control (the quality of thelumbar, or manipura center), it is easier to raise the energy in the spine abovethe lower chakras. From anahata it is easier, next, to draw the energy upward tothe Kutastha between the eyebrows, and thence to the highest chakra, thesahasrara, and Cosmic consciousness.(7:10) Know Me, O Son of Pritha (Arjuna) to be the seed of all creatures! I amintelligence in the discerning; in those who are glorious, I am their glory.(7:11) Among the powerful, O Best of the Bharatas (Arjuna)! I am power withoutpersonal ambition and attachment; I am that sexual desire (kama) in men which isin keeping with dharma (righteousness).Because desire is such a strong factor in the lives of human beings, it shouldbe pointed out, incidentally, that good (that is to say, dharmic) desires bringgood results, but only temporarily so. Desirelessness alone leads to liberation.(7:12) Know that all manifestations of sattwa (the elevating), rajas (theactivating), and tamas (the darkening quality) emanate from Me. They exist inMe, though I am not apparent in them.Paramhansa Yogananda often illustrated his lectures by comparing “real life” tothe fantasy world of motion pictures. In a movie, he said when discussing theabove stanza, the same beam of light shining on the screen produces both goodand evil people. They are only images of shadow and light. Although they seemreal, they are in fact true only to sight and sound.The “cosmic dream movie” is true not only to two human senses, but to all fiveof them! And yet, just as the light emanating from the projection booth in amovie house produces mere images of reality, so also does God’s light producemere appearances. The universe itself is only a projection of shadows and light.Everything is produced by God. More than merely showing a movie true to the fivesenses, he produces the script, directs the action, plays all the parts,composes and plays all the music, and even provides the audience!A playwright knows that actors portraying both good and evil are necessary tohis story. He is in all of them, in a sense, but they are not in him: in otherwords, they don’t define him. If he approaches his work with proper skill, hedoes so impersonally, rarely expressing personal feelings of his own: his likes,dislikes, social outrage, or prejudices. He himself need not possess any of thequalities possessed by his characters to express their natures. Were thosecharacters actually alive, they might not understand him at all. Yet he mustlive their lives—from a distance, as it were. He must enter into even thevillain’s consciousness to give him verisimilitude. He must view everything thevillain does from his misguided point of view. He may even enjoy the villain’stwisted self-justifications, and must make them as believable and as seeminglyreasonable as they would be to the villain himself. His enjoyment in writingthat part is not sadistic. He knows that the man’s villainy will only make theconclusion of the story more beautiful. The tension he creates in delaying theaction will bring the story to a more satisfying dénouement.A disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda’s once said to him, “I have such a deeplonging for God! Why does it take so long for Him to come?”“Ah,” the Master replied with a blissful smile, “that’s what makes it all thesweeter, when He does come!”When the English novelist, Charles Dickens, was writing his famous tale, The OldCuriosity Shop, he realized at a certain point that it would be necessary to theintegrity of his story for Little Nell, his main character, to die. It is saidthat when this understanding came to him he walked the streets of London forhours, weeping. Yet he had no artistic choice but to “kill” her. Otherwise, hewould have been untrue to his own story line.God also, Yogananda said, weeps for mankind: for man’s follies and sufferings.He weeps also for human wickedness, for though it produces grief for itsrecipients, it produces even more grief, in time, for the wicked themselves. Yetthe Lord allows His show to go on. He created it without any sense of personalinvolvement. The drama of every individual’s life must work its slow way, byhowever winding a road, to its eventual, indeed inevitable, conclusion:reabsorption in the bliss of Satchidananda.God is conscious of every thought, every flicker of feeling in every single oneof His creatures. Yet He stands apart from it all. Even in the story of theBhagavad Gita, although Krishna served Arjuna as his charioteer, his conditionfor doing so was that he would take no part in the battle. Arjuna knew that theLord’s mere presence was enough. And in fact Krishna did intervene in a sense,when the need became crucial. The same is the case when a devotee lives for Godand in the thought of Him. God never intervenes openly, yet somehow everythingcomes out all right in the end for the devotee—indeed, it comes out in the bestpossible way. As Krishna stated, “Arjuna, know this for a certainty: My devoteeis never lost!”The question is often asked, “Why, if God loves us, does He allow this ‘show togo on’? Why the sufferings, the pains, the disappointments—the outrighttragedies?”Several answers may be given to this all-but-universal question. One is whatSwami Sri Yukteswar is quoted as stating in Autobiography of a Yogi: “Leave afew questions to be answered by the Divine.”Another answer is this: The little child cannot know why the father must leavehome daily to work. He has yet to achieve an adult point of view.Still another answer is one that has been quoted already in this book: “Godcreated the universe in order that He might enjoy Himself through many.” That“enjoyment” can seem, to the ego, very long delayed! No one, however, who hasever found God has said accusingly, “He didn’t have to do it that way!”Everyone, rather, has said, “Ah! It was well, well worth every seeming pain anddifficulty!” The story of every life is thrilling, beautiful, and—in itsending—completely satisfying for every soul.(7:13) Deluded by the three qualities (gunas) of Nature, mortal beings do notperceive Me, ever changeless and beyond all qualities.Moviegoers in a theater sit forward on their seats—sometimes anxiously,sometimes in eager anticipation, their emotions deeply involved in the activityon the screen. Fearfully they may anticipate the worst. Delightedly they mayexpect the best. To them, it all seems very real.Yogananda once was watching a movie of the life of the Christian saintBernadette. He said, later, that he identified personally with many of theepisodes in the saint’s life. “And then,” he said, “I looked up at the lightcoming from the projection booth. Everything on the screen, I was reminded bythat light, was only a play of shadows and light.” Few human beings, absorbed asthey are in this “movie” of life, think to “look up” to the spiritual eye inmeditation, and perceive God’s One Consciousness producing and directing all theaction.(7:14) It is indeed difficult to waken from My cosmic hypnosis, instinct as itis with the three gunas (qualities) of maya. Only they who take shelter in Mecan find freedom from the wonderful power of illusion.There is a symbolic legend about Narada, an ancient Indian sage, and God in theform of Vishnu. Narada, after years of meditation, realized God in that form.When Vishnu appeared to him, He asked Narada if he would like Him to grant him aboon.“Yes, Lord,” replied Narada. “Please help me to understand how mankind getscaught up in Your maya. It all seems so simple to me, now that I’m out of it.How can people be so foolish?”“Very well, My son,” replied the Lord. “Come, let us go for a walk.”As they went, they came to a desert. The day was hot, and the sand made it muchhotter. After some time, both of them felt the need for water to drink. Andthen, on the horizon, they saw a wisp of smoke rising; it gave evidence of avillage.“Narada,” said Vishnu, “I am very thirsty. Would you go to that village andfetch Me some water?”“Certainly, Lord!” replied Narada.He trudged over the hot sand until he reached the small village. At the firsthouse he came too, he knocked on the door. It was answered by a beautifulmaiden. Anciently familiar she seemed to him. In an instant he forgot everythingelse! Her parents, who were at home, welcomed him as their own. He and themaiden were married, and set up a home and business in another part of thevillage. Years passed. They had a son; then another son.After twelve years, his wife gave birth to a third child. While this one wasstill a baby, there suddenly came a flash flood from a swollen river up in thehills high above them. In little more than a moment the inundation wiped outtheir home, their business—the whole village. Narada escaped with nothing buthis little family and the clothes on their backs. They waded through theswirling water around them, as high as their knees. Narada was holding one childby each hand, and had their baby slung over one shoulder. His wife struggledalong by his side.Suddenly Narada stumbled slightly on a stone. As he hastily tried to regain hisbalance, the baby slipped off his shoulder into the water. Desperate to save it,he released his other two children’s hands and reached out for the baby. Alas,before he could catch it, it was swept away. The older boys, lacking his stronggrip, were swept away also. At that moment Narada’s wife, her knees bucklingwith grief, fell too, and was carried off in the flood. In just a few minutesNarada had lost everything he had worked so hard, over twelve years, to create.Despondent, his will failed him, and he collapsed, letting the water take alsohim.Long afterward, it seemed, he came back to consciousness. Looking around him, hesaw everywhere what seemed a muddy expanse of water. He thought, “I must havebeen swept onto a little mound.” Then, recalling his tragedy, he began softly toweep.“Narada!” the voice sounded nearby. Why did it seem so familiar? He looked abouthim again, and realized that what he’d beheld around him was not muddy water,but a broad expanse of desert sand.“Narada!” came the voice again. He looked up. To his amazement, Vishnu wasstanding there.“Narada, what happened?” inquired Vishnu. “Half an hour ago I sent you for adrink of water, and now I find you sleeping in the sand. What has happened?”Such, indeed, is the power of maya! Time passes—incarnations?thousands—millions—billions of years: who knows? Time is an illusion. Once oneawakens from it, it seems as though no time had passed at all!(7:15) Evildoers (in whom tamas predominates), lowest of human beings,dull-witted and bereft of understanding by (the power of) maya, failing to takeshelter in Me, partake of the nature of demons.One meets such people in the world. They are not, like rakshasas, evil monsterswith slavering jaws, avid to devour human beings. They are themselves humanbeings, though cruel, callous to the pain and suffering of others, absorbed inthemselves, sex-hungry, avid for riches obtained by any means possible (to themhonesty means nothing), power-drunk, ruthless. Such people are not demonslurking in wait for the unwary. They can be seen any day of the week walking thestreets of our cities. I remember my Guru seriously describing a well-knownmovie star after she’d come to him for an interview: “She is a devil,” he said.After death, souls are drawn to their respective levels in the astral world.It must be strictly understood, however, that no one is evil by nature. All arechildren of God. What differentiates the demonic from the angelic is only thethickness of the veil over their understanding.(7:16) Those who seek shelter in Me, O Arjuna, are of four types: those who arein distress; those who seek understanding; those who seek power (in this worldor the next); and those who are (already) wise.A saying among soldiers at war is, “There are no atheists in the foxholes.” Mostpeople who turn to God do so during times of affliction. (And people ask why Godpermits suffering! What other incentive do most of them have for seeking helpfrom Him?)Bewildered by life’s countless anomalies, some few (tiring of shaking theirfists at God in anger) turn to Him for understanding. “Why?” they askrepeatedly. When they ask that question sincerely, they begin to receiveanswers: through books; through well-read teachers; through teachers withvarying degrees of understanding born of experience. Only when a person verysincerely wants to know, however, does God send him someone who, himself, doesknow: a true guru.Often, on the pathway to wisdom, people get sidetracked by the desire for powersand phenomena. They go to spiritualistic séances. They go to “miracle workers.”They spread word (especially in India) concerning every “saint” they’ve everseen perform wonders. Vicarious power over matter, or the desire to achievepersonal power, may catch them in the net of delusion for incarnations.Those, finally, who seek perfection in wisdom, spurning all other “attractions,”offer themselves up wholly to God. Such devotees are, among all the virtuous,the most pleasing to God.(7:17) Outstanding among the wise is he whose devotion is constant andone-pointed. I am, above all things, dear to that sage, and he, of all beings,is dearest to Me.Is God, one may ask, really more fond of one person than of another? How couldHe be? He is ever and supremely impersonal, having no individual self to beespecially pleased with anyone! It is through people’s own love for Him that Hislove is expressed. Those, however, who love Him purely and entirely are bestable to receive His love. He would shower it unceasingly on all who areunhindered by doubts, uncertainties, or any karmic blocks. In an I-and-Thourelationship with God, He may respond quickly to even the slightest lovingdemand of a perfected devotee.(7:18) All of the above (four kinds of virtuous) men are noble (for thedirection of their consciousness is upward), but the sage who has establishedhimself firmly in Me as the highest goal, him I look upon as indeed My own Self.Is it wrong, in light of these words, to pray to God for His gifts? Not at all!Man has certain needs: It is always better to seek their fulfillment from Godthan by outward, ego-driven effort alone. People say, “God helps those who helpthemselves.” If one busies himself, however, with fulfilling his desires byself-effort alone, forgetting God, he’ll tell himself, when success comes, thatthe credit for his success is only his. Thus, his gratitude will go to his ownego as the achiever. Is this the way to liberation from ego-consciousness?Best it is, then, to pray to God for everything, always adding, “Fulfill thisprayer, Lord, only if it is in keeping with Your will.”Man can spare himself much pain in life if, even in prayer, he practices nishkamkarma: non-attachment to the fruits. Otherwise he may attract what he wants inlife, by his own mental power (which increases vastly when it is united to God’sconsciousness), but find that what he got was, for him, disastrous.Swami Sri Yukteswar enjoyed recounting the following fable to show theimportance of seeking God’s will alone, not one’s own.A certain yogi, having developed a degree of psychic power, came upon a treeduring his wanderings in the Himalayas which he intuitively recognized as a“kalyana kalpataru,” or magic wishing tree. “How splendid!” he thoughtdelightedly. Sitting beneath the tree, he wished for a palace.Instantly a beautiful palace materialized before him, right there in the forest.He entered it, and found that it was perfectly matched to all his wishes. Theedifice was empty, however. “Let there be beautiful furnishings: sofas, chairs,carpets, wall hangings, paintings, artistic curtains.” Lo! it all became so.“This place is already wonderful beyond my wildest dreams!” he thought. “But itlacks people to enjoy it with me and to rejoice with me in my good fortune. Iwish these rooms to be filled with laughing, happy men and women.” Suddenly—lo!it was so. People thronged the room he was in: the reception hall, the diningroom, the staircases, the foyer.He enjoyed these delights for a time. Then he thought, “Let me go now from roomto room, that I may see and take pleasure in all my new treasures!” He went byhimself, exulting in his good fortune. After some time he came to a room on theground floor that was empty of human beings. The window stood wide open. Becausethis miracle had come into being out in the forest, the surrounding woods wereas Nature had made them. Suddenly he heard a tiger roaring outside the palacegates.“Ah!” he thought in alarm. “I’m here in this room all by myself. The window isopen, and I’m on the ground floor! What if that tiger should leap in through thewindow and eat me?”He forgot that all this had been produced under the magic spell of the wishingtree. Instantly a tiger appeared outside, leapt in through the window, anddevoured him before he could cry for help.The moral of this story is that if, by the practice of concentration, one hasdeveloped a strong mind, he will be sitting under the wishing tree of his ownspinal energy. He should offer all his desires, his understanding, and his willup to God alone for fulfillment.(7:19) After many incarnations, the sage realizes Me in My true nature. A personso illumined that he sees Me as all-pervading is rare (and hard) to find.It is true, certainly, that the soul must pass through many incarnations beforeit attains God. Usually, even a whole lifetime scarcely suffices for one toovercome a single deep-seated bad habit. In this passage Krishna is speaking,however, of the sage who, after many incarnations, has reached perfection inGod. The meaning here is much deeper than what appears superficially. For,consider this: One who is a sage must be very close to God-realization.Otherwise, he would not be truly sage, or wise.We saw earlier that every inhalation can become, in effect, like birth into anew incarnation. Some say that even the heartbeat can be turned, in this sense,to advantage: each beat bringing a new life. To create such an effect, however,one would have to be unusually aware! The sage (certainly not the ordinaryseeker!) can utilize his breath and heartbeat to pass through many births anddeaths even while he inhabits a single body. Most people, of course, must dieliterally and be reborn many times to accomplish significant inner change inthemselves.How to make such a teaching universally helpful? Sages don’t really need tostudy scripture, after all: Their wisdom is already inscribed in their own“book” of consciousness. The point for everyone to bear in mind is that time isnot an essential factor in self-upliftment. Asmy Guru said to me, “Habits can be changed in a day. They are the result ofmental concentration. If one has been concentrating one way, he can simplyconcentrate a new way.” The yagya, or fire ceremony, prescribed in the Vedas,and mentioned often in these pages, is symbolic of the ego’s voluntaryself-offering to God in meditation. This ritual can be performed inwardly, andunceasingly, by the mind.Every time the tendency arises to refer back to the little self such thoughtsas, “I did it!” “Why was that said or done to me?” “I am too important to betreated that way!” we should mentally cast that thought into the fire ofdevotion, which should be kept ever burning in the heart. Consumed in our mentalfire should be everything in our natures that will not lift us toward God.Most people take a long time even to confront their shortcomings; they lack theincentive and, even the will, to change and overcome them. They say, “I’ll dosomething about it some day.” A thought my Guru expressed was, “Eventually?Eventually? Why not now?!”Another thought has been expressed in these pages: Concentrate first on thosebattles which you can win. If you are not yet strong enough to conquer somehabit, or if other duties command so much of your time and energy that yousimply cannot deal with it yet, then simply resist it mentally. Never admit toyourself that you haven’t the power to overcome any defect. The more your mindresists a bad habit instead of embracing it gleefully, the more you will buildup the inner strength eventually to overcome it.Thus, the incarnations that might otherwise be required to extricate yourselffrom the mud of delusion may be reduced to a relatively short time. Be astrategist: Await your opportunities calmly and dispassionately. Then, when theycome: Strike! Affirm your potential as a sage, even though you still wander inback alleys of delusion, and it won’t be long before you discover that you, too,“see” God in everything: that He is your only treasure, your only reality.To pass from that understanding to the realization described in this stanza doesnot require a very long leap. If you don’t make it in this incarnation, you mayfind yourself ere long living on higher planes where such sages are not so “hardto find.” You may, indeed, become one of those sages, yourself, in time.Paramhansa Yogananda added his own assertion to that of Lahiri Mahasaya, SriYukteswar, and the other masters of the Kriya Yoga line that the practice ofKriya Yoga—the science taught by Krishna to Arjuna thousands of yearsago—greatly accelerates the yogi’s spiritual evolution. The Kriya Yogi can, theysaid, attain Cosmic consciousness—according to the depth and intensity of hispractice—in three, six, twelve, twenty-four, or forty-eight years. Yoganandaadded wryly (meaning I suspect, that few people in their lifetime will have achance to practice twice forty-eight years!) that if the Kriya Yogi doesn’t makeit in forty-eight years, he may as well plan to continue the practice in hisnext life!(7:20) Those, however, who prefer (to follow) their own will (rejecting the pathof inward communion with God), whose discrimination has been vitiated by thiscraving or by that, and who (perhaps) feel inclined toward cultish teachings,seek lesser gods.Krishna utters a warning here to beware of ego-motivated self-will. One’sdiscrimination can be carried away by desires, which cause one to endow almostany outward circumstance with the attractive halo of expectation: “It just hasto be!” Thus, he may tell himself—indeed, he may insist to himself and also toothers—that he knows he is right, this time: He must possess this thing, oraffiliate with that person.Anything one desires intensely becomes for him, in a sense, a god. This is thetrue meaning of “idol worship.” An idol is not a statue or a painting thatpeople use to remind them of some high ideal. Such people are, indeed, “idealworshipers,” not “idol worshipers.” Idol worship means to harbor a desire foranything other than God.Every man, unless he loves God alone, is in this sense an idol worshiper! Tolove something, or some person, because it reminds him of God is a virtue, not afault. To get to the top floor of a building one must ascend by the otherfloors: No one can leap all the way to the top. To feel love for God as Hereally is, formless and impersonal, is almost impossible for human beings. Suchlove comes naturally, however, to those who first envision divine perfection insome human form. The important thing in such worship is always to keep in mindthat the form one loves (even of a living person) serves one only as a windowonto infinity.Self-will, particularly when united to intense desire, is difficult to discernin oneself. Discrimination can be snatched away in a moment by some suddeninfatuation. The key to intelligent behavior in such situations is to watch theheart’s feelings.The poet Wordsworth wrote, “My heart leaps up when I behold a rainbow in thesky.” He described exactly what happens when one is suddenly seized by anystrong attraction. That rainbow soon vanishes, but the feeling remains. Theobjects of any sudden affection all vanish, but that “leap” in the heartcontinues to spurt upward for a time. We have seen that an upward flow of energyis desirable—indeed, essential for spiritual awakening. The flow must be calm,however. Upward leaps of feeling indicate outwardness also. Watch the heart: Doits feelings “leap up” at any sudden infatuation? If so, challenge them! Let notyour discrimination be fooled by anything that uplifts the feelings in emotionalexcitement, instead of calmly, in uplifted devotion.People, finally, who allow their feelings to become uplifted emotionally areoften susceptible to sensation-mongering. They may pass from one “cultish” fancyto another—attending séances, going to miracle workers, flocking eagerly tolisten to every new lecturer who arrives in town. All these activities aresymptomatic of the disease of ignorance: the desire for outward stimulation,rather than for inward inspiration.(7:21) Whatsoever the form a person worships (a saint, a master, a deity—whetherreal or imaginary), it is I who (uplift his heart) and make his devotionsteadfast and true.(7:22) Absorbed in his devotion, intent on worshiping that form, he derivestrue, spiritual benefits, and has his desires (his prayers) fulfilled. Theblessings he receives come from Me alone.Even with the worship of lower gods, so long as that worship is offeredsincerely and not merely for selfish fulfillment—and even when the prayer is forselfish motives, but is offered up to a higher power rather than as ego toego—it is God Himself who answers through those limited channels. The importantthing is not to concern oneself with theological niceties (think how manyreligious pedants waste time and effort in that preoccupation!), but to offerone’s energy upward, past the ego to a higher source.Interestingly, even “man-made” deities like the symbolic images of Kali, Durga,Saraswati, Vishnu, Shiva, and Ganesha become what Yogananda called “blueprintsin the ether.” They acquire a reality of their own, and can be communed withperhaps even more easily in those forms than in some form one has only imaginedhimself.As Yogananda wrote concerning his own Whispers from Eternity and his CosmicChants, he “spiritualized them,” drawing a divine response by repeating themdeeply. Any response from God that is superconsciously generated remains “in theether,” and can continue forever to convey special blessings. Such also is thepower of pilgrimage, when devotees seek blessings in places where some divinemanifestation has taken place.(7:23) Men of meager understanding, however, (in limiting their worship to thelesser gods) receive limited results. Devotees of the lower gods go to thosegods. Devotees who worship Me (the Infinite One) come to Me.Those who worship any form of God as a reminder of the Infinite One are not theones described here as limited in their worship. Those, however, who worshiplower forms with the attitude described above—ego to ego—with a view to gainingthe fulfillment of some personal desire, go to those regions where subtler egosstill exist, in more exalted forms.People sometimes ask, “Are not the angels higher than earthly masters?” A truemaster, it must be said, is far higher than any angel! He has merged his ego inGod, whereas angels, though lofty compared to most human beings, still possessegos—pure, exalted, sattwic egos, but for all that limited by the consciousnessof separation from God.There is the story of a saint in India who lived long ago. A deva, or angel,offered him the boon of transportation to heaven in his physical body. (Thus didancient Indian tradition express the concept of leaving the body consciously atdeath.)Legend tells us that this deva came to him one day in a heavenly chariot, longbefore his own destined time to die, to carry him off to heaven. “So great areyour virtues,” said the deva, “that you have been deemed worthy of this greatblessing.”“Wait a moment!” said the saint. “I’d like first to know what advantages I willreap by going to this heaven of yours.”“Well,” replied the angel, “this is a most unusual request! Most people arehappy enough to get to heaven at all! Still, since you’ve asked me I mustrespond. In heaven you will enjoy a wonderful environment—beautiful, serene,harmonious. You will get to mix with the gods. What more could you possiblydesire?”“Well,” replied the saint, “in everything I’ve experienced in this world of mayaI have always found some disadvantage. Even in beautiful surroundings, dualityintrudes. Tell me, therefore, what disadvantages will I find in going toheaven?”“I must say,” exclaimed the deva, “your questions are most unusual! Still, sinceyou’ve asked me I must answer you once more: You will get to stay in heaven onlyas long as the good karma lasts which took you there. You will not be able toprogress further, spiritually. Living with angelic beings and with other goodpeople will bring you great happiness, but once your karmic time comes to returnto earth, your happiness will fade like forest leaves in autumn, then drop tothe ground. You will experience a deep sadness as you realize that you must soonleave that world. Until then, however, everything will be wonderful!”“I very much appreciate your coming all this way,” said the saint, “to offer methis gift. I can see that what you’ve offered me would be, for many people, agreat blessing. I must say, however, that the disadvantages you’ve outlined seemto me so colossal that I cannot imagine any sane person accepting this‘blessing’! Were the situation you describe to last a thousand years, it wouldstill end, in time. Please tell me, isn’t there anywhere that offers somethingpermanent?”“Yet once again,” said the angel, “you’ve asked me a question I must answer.Yes, such a place exists. It is beyond our place of astral beauty—beyond theastral light itself. We ourselves have only heard about it. If you want to reachthere, however, you will have to remain here on Earth and continue yourspiritual disciplines, for only thus will you be able to soar to that highestplane of manifested existence. For this reason it is said that even the godswould like to be reborn on Earth.”The saint declined the angel’s invitation and remained on Earth, where hecontinued his yoga practices, in the end attaining the God of gods and mergingin oneness with the Infinite.(7:24) Men who lack wisdom think of Me, the Unmanifest, as limited (when Iappear) in a bodily form. They comprehend not My higher nature (which is)changeless, unutterable, supreme.Devotees without wisdom think of the Supreme Being as limited in essence to Hisspecial manifestations. They may even worship one of those forms as the onlyGod: as Krishna with his flute, for example, as Shiva with His trident, as Kaliwith Her four arms, or as Jehova or Allah (who have names, but no form). God isall of these, but is so much more besides that He cannot, in His true essence,be either named or imagined.To worship the Unutterable by any name, however, and to visualize Him in anyform, cannot be avoided if man is to worship God at all. What Krishna means inthis sloka is not that it is erroneous to worship God with name and form, butonly that it is wrong to try to confine God in doing so. God is everything—andHe is nothing: that is to say, no specific thing. He is both in and beyondeverything, and, in truth, is not even the “things” He has manifested, sincethey are but dreams, “real” only as dreams are real.(7:25) Hidden by My veil of yoga-maya, I am invisible to mankind. Humanity,therefore, bewildered (by appearances), sees not that I am (in essence) everunborn, and ever deathless.(7:26) O Arjuna, the past, present, and future of all beings is known to Me. Me,however, no man knows (so long as he knows himself as only human).(7:27) O Descendent of Bharata, Scorcher of Foes (Arjuna)! Birth in a bodysubjects all beings to the power of delusion with its dualities, which produceattraction and repulsion. (Such is the storm of maya on the surface of My oceanof consciousness.)A baby’s energy at birth is necessarily outward. A child continues thatoutwardness as it learns gradually to relate to the world. People’s bias isimposed upon them from birth, and continues to be outward. They must, as theygrow up, learn to distinguish right behavior from wrong that they may find whichpaths lead to true and long-lasting fulfillment, and which ones lead todisappointment, pain, and suffering. It is not easy to find God, particularlyand unfortunately because the very direction of a person’s energy inclines himfrom the time of his birth toward outwardness.Even liberated masters may allow themselves to live for a time under the partialsway of maya. Thus, Lahiri Mahasaya—who had been anciently liberated—came backwearing the semblance of mortality. Though he sat long in meditation as a child,after growing to manhood he took a job, married, and produced a family. He hadreached mature years before he met his guru, Babaji, and received from him oncemore his enlightenment.Swami Sri Yukteswar also married, had a daughter, and lived (to outwardappearances) as a normal human being before he received enlightenment from hisguru, Lahiri Mahasaya.Paramhansa Yogananda, in his turn, accepted human limitation. During his boyhoodhe played the ardent seeker instead of revealing himself—and perhaps even beforeperceiving himself—as he was: a great master from long before who receivedenlightenment anew from Swami Sri Yukteswar. Yogananda often said publicly, “Ikilled Yogananda long ago. No one dwells in this temple now but God.”I once asked him, “Does one who is born liberated come with the fullconsciousness of oneness with God?” I posed that question because it seemed tome that he, and other masters, had played many human roles that would surely nothave been compatible with living consciously in that high state of oneness.“They never lose their consciousness of inner freedom,” he replied.God’s lila (play) is endlessly diverting. My Guru told us that the gopis intheir lila with Lord Krishna as a boy in Brindaban were in fact reincarnatedrishis. “Their role on Earth,” he said, “was to enact the divine play of loverand beloved.”Krishna at that time was only a boy. He had come as a mahavatar—a purna or fullmanifestation of God, and was universally recognized as such. From the beginningof that life he manifested not only divine attributes, but divine perfection.The fabled love between him and the gopis was no ordinary human love. Indeed,the gopis were all married women. Their faithfulness to their husbands was neverin doubt. The rasalila, their divine dance with Krishna in the forest when eachgopi saw him as her very own, was enacted to inspire human beings with longingfor the perfection of human love. The love which the gopis shared with Krishnawas perfect. Unfortunately, human consciousness being what it is, their lovebecame greatly misunderstood in time. “The legends that have grown up around thelife of Krishna,” my Guru told me, “are mostly allegorical. Don’t take them allas literally true.” As often happens, a few facts were built up into a largebody of legend.(7:28) Righteous men, however, their sins expiated, and no longer subject to theoppositions of duality, worship Me steadfastly.It is noteworthy that already-free souls, even if they come to earth with amission necessitating a slight assumption of delusion, are always pious andhigh-minded.The expression, “righteous men,” need not, of course, indicate souls that areliberated, even though Krishna describes their “sins as having been expiated.”Those with good spiritual karma, also, are usually drawn back soon to thespiritual path, and are born with virtuous tendencies. Nevertheless, theuncertainties accompanying birth in a new body should give everyone a powerfulincentive to work hard at finding God now, assuming his circumstances aresupportive enough to his underlying desire to know God. What man, indeed, canknow what his own future holds?(7:29) Those who, clinging to Me, seek release from (the debilities of) old ageand from (the finality of) death become true knowers of Brahman (the Absolute),of Adhyatma (the Overself), and of all the secrets of karma.The debilities of old age are notorious. They include increasing illness,physical and mental debility, and perhaps senility. It is always sad to seesomeone who was once robust and full of energy decline to decrepitude, outwardlyand inwardly. People often spend their life savings on medical care in theirlast years. Those who cling to God are the most likely to die with dignity. TheOverself watches over them in old age better than any human doctor could do.Inwardly—it is evident to those who know them intimately—they are unchanged and,indeed, spiritually robust—“ever the same,” as the great woman saint AnandamayeeMa declared.Those with any lingering doubts as to the “whys” of life—the disparities offortune; their seeming injustices; the endless intricacies of karma—find alltheir questions answered in Brahman: the great Overself of all beings.(7:30) Those who perceive My presence within their physical (Adhibhuta), astral(Adhidaiva), and spiritual (causal, or Adhiyagya) bodies, their hearts united toMe, retain their perception even at the time of death.Death is the “final exam” for which all of life is a preparation. To leave thebody consciously is a blessing not accorded to many. Most people slip back intothe after-death sleep. One’s experiences prior to death may be painful, butdeath itself comes as a relief, and is without pain. Mainly, whatever painpeople experience at the time of death is mental: the fear above all of losingthe body, to which they’ve grown not only accustomed, but attached—very often tothe point of identifying with it as their real self.Death is an ordeal everyone must face—even masters, sometimes, although for themthe ordeal is brief. The sudden realization that everything one has known, allthe people to whom one has related, all the work one has set into motion, themany people who are—for good or for ill—dependent on one, all the things one mayhave left undone, and above all the sum total of one’s bad and/or virtuousdeeds: The loss of all these must be faced and accepted as a fact, thenrelinquished into eternity and turned to some fresh resolution for the future.The consciousness one brings to death determines his future existence—whether inthis world, in a higher world, or in eternity. The weight of error may cause oneto recoil in rejection. That recoil itself may suffice to make one fall backinto subconsciousness in hope of a healing. The struggles of life may havebrought one to a point where he feels a need for rest. This is why many people,in old age, already begin to withdraw from active interest in outwardness.Senility itself, for them, may be a kind of escape. Those who have lived wastedlives may, after a period of rest, suffer “nightmares.” Those who have livedevil lives may wake up in ghastly-seeming circumstances which cause thempurgative anguish and even suffering. Those, on the other hand, who have livedvirtuous lives may wake up in an astral heaven, and enjoy there for a time thefruits of their goodness. Memories of the past may linger, though less vividlythan the people left behind might expect. Sometimes, a person’s departedrelatives may come to him in dreams—to give him help, warning, or encouragement.The thoughts with which one leaves his body have a great influence on his futurestate. Exaggerated remorse for one’s mistakes is a negative affirmation that mayattract to oneself unnecessary suffering. Far better than useless regret is anaffirmation of positive intent to correct one’s errors. “Sin” itself is only,and quite simply, error. As people lie dying, they should resolve to do betterin future. To seek absolution from sin at the time of death may only cause aperson to focus on his sins. It may cause him to leave his body with a negativeaffirmation, as he recalls all the wrongs he committed. Instead of “absolution,”then, a better practice might be simply to offer the heart’s feelings in lovingsurrender to God, leaving to Him (once again we see here the teaching ofKrishna’s) the fruits of all one’s actions.Those who at death can fix their minds at the point between the eyebrows,calling deeply to God in their hearts, will go to Him. Any priest, therefore, oranyone dear to the person who is dying, will do well (instead of devoting timeand effort to offering him forgiveness) to place his forefinger on the person’sforehead, at the point midway between the eyebrows, and, sending energy there,encourage him (or her) to focus the body’s energy completely at that point.The ego often struggles against death’s final, firm decree. It may clingadamantly for a time to the spine and brain, like someone hanging onto a cliffby his fingers. Such persons sometimes actually return to their bodies andstrive to reactivate them. For this reason, cremation is safer for the dead thanburial. It is better not to have a body to return to than to reawaken in it onceit has been buried, and once one’s actual departure has been accepted by othersas a fact.Realized saints, on the other hand, about whose bodily non-attachment there needbe no concern, are not traditionally, and ought not to be, cremated. Theirinterred bodies emanate vibrations that may bring healing and blessings to manydevout persons.In the astral world, after a time of either rest or enjoyment, egos that havenot finished their material karmas begin to feel a muffled longing once more forearthly gratification, one that cannot be fulfilled in the astral world. As theygather there, waiting to be reborn, couples on earth, uniting sexually, generatea light in the astral world by the union of their sperm and ovum cells.According to the quality of that light, disembodied souls are attracted. Thisattraction accounts for the affinity that often (though not always) existsbetween parents and children. There will certainly, in any case, be strongpoints of resemblance.Those discerning human beings who, during their earthly sojourn, practicenon-attachment, adherence to duty without egoic identification or desire, andabove all love for God, go either straight to Him, or to some high astral heavenwhere they may be conscious enough to continue the great work ofego-transcendence and reabsorption in God.Thus ends the seventh chapter, called “The Yoga of Knowledge andDiscrimination,” of the Upanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialoguebetween Sri Krishna and Arjuna discussing yoga and the science ofGod-realization."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter TwentyTHE OUTER AND INNER UNIVERSE(8:1) Arjuna said: O Best of the Purushas (Krishna)! Please tell me, what isBrahman (Spirit)? What is Adhyatma (the Kutastha Chaitanya underlying allmanifestations, which is individualized as the souls of all creatures)? What isKarma (action—cosmic and individual—born of AUM)? What is Adhibhuta (theconsciousness immanent in physical creatures and the physical cosmos)? And whatis Adhidaiva (the consciousness manifest in astral bodies and in the astralcosmos)?(8:2) O Slayer of (the demon) Madhu (Krishna)! What is Adhiyagya (the SupremeCreative and Cognizing Spirit), and in what manner is Adhiyagya (the soul’sself-offering) possible in this body? How, finally, at the time of death, arethe self-disciplined to know You?Arjuna is perplexed by these terms, which Krishna used toward the end of Chapter7. In these stanzas he asks for clarification.(8:3) The Blessed Lord replied: Brahman is the Indestructible and SupremeSpirit. Adhyatma is Brahman’s manifestation as the essential soul of all beings.Cosmic karma is AUM (the Cosmic Vibration), which causes the birth, sustenance,and dissolution of all creatures, and also the diversity of their natures.Brahman (the Supreme Spirit), in order to manifest His cosmic dream, set aportion of His consciousness in vibration. Thus came into being the CosmicSound, AUM. This Cosmic Vibration is the primordial karma (action), out of whichall individual karmas are manifested. Self-conscious (human) beings, in whateverforms they manifest on different planets, are all governed by the “rhythmic law”of individual and mass karma.A playwright is conscious of the characters he creates from both inside andoutside their minds—that is to say, both subjectively and objectively. At thesame time, he remains untouched, personally, by their personalities. Even so,Brahman has divided His functions—not Himself—into the watchful butnever-affected Viewer (the Spirit Itself); the action in the play as a whole(Cosmic Vibration), which determines (but also, on a micro-cosmic scale, isdetermined by) the characters, each with his own individual destiny (karma) towork out. The third division of functions is the Kutastha Chaitanya, thereflected consciousness of vibrationless Spirit in every tremor of vibration inthe universe. In a way similar to a chip of wood rising and sinking with everypassing wave, though its horizontal positionremains unchanged, the divine consciousness at the heart of each ripple ofCosmic Vibration remains a motionless reflection of the vibrationless Spirit.Individual karmas, relative to the over-all activity at the ocean’s surface,might be compared to the wake behind a ship: never affecting the over-all oceanlevel—any more than storm waves affect it—nor even effecting much changeanywhere except locally.Adhyatma is the pristine reflection, the Kutastha Chaitanya, within creationitself of the vibrationless Spirit beyond creation. Its manifestation is bothmacro-cosmic and micro-cosmic: throughout space, and in each individual being.Karma, similarly, is both macro-cosmic and micro-cosmic: universal vibration,and individual acts, the results of which rebound to the egos themselves or tocausative social groups, or (more generally) to a species as a whole which hasnot yet (by higher evolution) developed individual self-, or ego-consciousness.Adhibhuta is the “macro” physical universe, and also its “micro,” or individualexpressions. Adhidaiva is the expression of the same “macro-” and“micro-”relationships on the astral plane.Adhiyagya is the same inter-related truth applied to the causal plane. On thecausal plane, self-consciousness has been offered up and purified in the fire ofwisdom, and no longer exists; hence that word, yagya, or self-sacrifice.Individual consciousness, on a causal level, is thinly separated from Cosmicconsciousness. Thus, souls living in the causal body have the power—as Swami SriYukteswar explained in the chapter, “The Resurrection of Sri Yukteswar,” fromAutobiography of a Yogi—to “bring universes into manifestation even as theCreator. Because all creation is made of the cosmic dream-texture, the soulthinly clothed in the causal has vast realizations of power.”Whether “universes” (as Sri Yukteswar used the word) means “galaxies,” orentirely new and different universes, I never heard my Guru explain. I did hearhim use the term “island universes” in reference to what are now termedgalaxies.Images are symbolic of reality, and cannot entirely replace any aspect of it.Thus, to use waves raised in the wake of a ship as an analogy for individualactivity, or vibration, in its relation to the wave-vibrations of a whole oceanhas this disadvantage: The ship is a foreign body agitating the surface. Themicro-vibrations of individual waves, on the other hand, are activated in thewater itself by the ego. Imagine, then, the waves of the ocean all beingconscious. Individual waves, to the extent that they are not only conscious butare also identified with their individuality, may of their own accord pushthemselves farther away from the ocean bosom, thereby creating high crests, orthey may prefer to remain humbly close to the ocean bosom as little ripples.The simile may be extended: In a storm, many waves tower high in response to thewind’s force. A few waves, however, even in the midst of the storm, resist thattendency (owing to opposite forces) and remain small. So, when the influencessurrounding people on earth plunge most of them into a veritable storm ofdelusion and cause them to feel anger, violence, and warlike fervor, a fewindividuals resist that influence even if it is all around them, and remaincalm, usually loving, and all-forgiving.Thus, the AUM Vibration manifests on both a cosmic and a micro-cosmic, orindividual level. The cosmic Adhibhuta manifests similarly: macro-cosmically(from outside) and micro-cosmically (from inside) every atom, and every ego. Andthe same holds true in the astral and causal universes.When the waves of duality become stilled in the yogi’s consciousness, and hemerges his one soul in the Cosmic Vibration of AUM, the dual opposites mergetogether into the oneness of Spirit.Adhi means “above, or original.” Adhi-atma is written with a “y”—Adhyatma—simplybecause that is how it is pronounced. Adhyatma is the same, on the subtlestplane, as the other “adhis.”An animal’s life is determined more by macro- than by micro-karma: by the groupkarma, for example, of a species, a region, or even a planet. Mankind, thoughaffected also by these group karmas, has also self-awareness, which enables himto act with some degree of free will. A tiger is ferocious by nature, not bychoice. A Chihuahua is different from a Great Dane—again, not by its own choice,but by nature’s. Free will, in man, depends not on egoic whims but on guidancefrom the level of superconsciousness. Egoic will, which we have calledwhimsical, is in fact imposed upon man by his own past karma. It is whimsicalonly in the sense that, though an act may seem deliberate, in fact man isnormally guided by his own past actions, and by the tendencies he built up inconsequence of them. Thus, his liking for (let us say) the color blue is not amatter of free will, but of past conditioning. His choice to become an engineeris, again, whimsical in the sense that, even if it seems deliberate, it is not achoice of his free will but of his past conditioning. The will is free only whenit is guided by superconscious inspiration. Even then, that inspiration must befiltered down through the mind’s prior conditioning: a poet, for example, willreceive influence from the superconscious in the form of words, whereas acomposer, under perhaps the same inspiration, will express it in melody, rhythm,and harmony.(8:4) O Supreme among the Embodied (Arjuna)! Adhibhuta is the basis of physicalexistence; Adhidaiva is the basis of astral existence; and I (the Spiritmanifested ideationally, both macro- and micro-cosmically) am Adhiyagya.Paramhansa Yogananda stated that, as Adhibhuta, God’s presence in the physicaluniverse and in the physical body can only be inferred. As Adhidaiva, God’spresence is felt. As Adhiyagya, His presence in the causal world is knownintuitively.(8:5) He who, at the hour of death, thinks only of Me enters unquestionably intoMy Being.Krishna now answers Arjuna’s final question (posed above): “How, finally, at thetime of death, are the self-disciplined to know You?”A person’s final thoughts at death determine his after-death state. This doesnot mean that one can live any sort of life he pleases, then hastily summon upthoughts of God at the last moment of life and thereby, leaping over the hurdleof karma, fly to the arms of Infinity! Many people hope by such clever ploys toavoid the consequences of their mistakes.There is a supposedly true story about a dacoit (brigand) in India who, havingbeen told that anyone dying in Varanasi (Benares) is automatically saved,decided that here was his “way out.” Not wanting to pay the price for his manysins, when he reached old age he had both his legs cut off above the knees, andthen settled down to die in that holy city, determined never to move again.One day someone riding by on a horse showed such poor horsemanship that the“feat” raised gales of mockery in the ex-dacoit. “Why,” he cried, “even withoutmy legs I could ride better than that!”He insisted that he be lifted onto the horse’s back. As soon as he was firmlyseated, the horse bolted. Varanasi is bounded on one side by the Varuna river,and on the other side by the Asi. When the horse got just beyond the Varuna, itthrew its rider, breaking his neck and causing his death.One’s thoughts at death cannot but be influenced by the way he has lived. Evenwere he to chant, “Ram! Ram!” this does not necessarily mean that his thoughtswould be immersed in God, to whom it may be only his lips that are chanting.Even if his mind is on God, in his heart he may think, “What favors shall I askof Him?”Krishna’s meaning here is that if, at death, one’s whole consciousness isimmersed in unconditional love for God, without any thought of ego-fulfillmentor reward, then and then only will he merge in the Infinite. The meaning of“unquestionably” is twofold: Krishna’s words are unquestionably true, but alsothere must be no flicker in the mind of doubt, or questioning.(8:6) O Son of Kunti (Arjuna)! the uppermost thought in a person’s mind as hedies determines his next state of existence.The whole of human life is, as we’ve already said, a preparation for the “finalexam” of death. At death there flashes before the mind an overview of one’sentire life. Things that may have seemed important to him when they occurredmay, during these last moments, be cognized as quite insignificant. And thingsthat may have seemed to him trivial may now be recognized as having had greatsignificance for him. All these things are beheld now as they reallywere—whether good, bad, or insignificant—rather than as they may have seemed tohim at the time by mere opinion.(8:7) Therefore, remember Me (throughout life), and fight the battle (of rightaction)! Surrender to Me your mind and understanding. In so doing, you willwithout a doubt come to Me.The Bhagavad Gita, amazingly, never wastes a word. What does Krishna mean bytelling Arjuna to surrender both mind and understanding to God? The averagereader would lump these two words together and not give a thought to whethertheir meanings may be subtly different.Mind is that aspect of consciousness which receives impressions. Understandingis that which defines those impressions and gives them meaning. One should, inother words, on seeing (for example) a sunset, enjoy it with God. He shouldoffer up to God the joy he feels in that beauty, and discriminate inwardly thatthe joy he feels inside is, for him, the reality of that experience. Were it notfor that inner ability, the sunset would hold no special meaning for him. Thus,both the experience and the discernment of its reality for him as being inward,not outward, is what Krishna means in saying, “Surrender to Me your mind andunderstanding.”In such surrender, finally, all doubts disappear. The mind no longer stands backhesitantly, like a boy pausing on a riverbank before daring to plunge into thewater, and fearful of finding it too cold. He simply dives.(8:8) That person attains the Supreme Effulgence, O Partha (Arjuna), who, hismind (by long practice) firmly fixed on Me, thinks of Me only.With practice, this “firm fixity” is not a consequence of stern determination,but of total relaxation into the truth of one’s being, as he has perceived itand knows it to be.(8:9,10) The yogi, at the time of his death, attains that supremely effulgentstate: provided that, with deep love and with focused power through the practiceof yoga, he succeeds in penetrating his conscious energy through the Kutasthabetween the eyebrows (the seat of the spiritual eye); and if he maintains hisattention unwaveringly on that Being who, beyond all delusions of (gloom and)darkness, shines like the sun—whose form is subtler than the finest atom, who isthe Ultimate Support of all (existence), and the great Ruler (of all), eternaland omniscient.Here we find listed the three major qualifications by which a true yogi at deathpasses into, and merges with, the Divine Essence: divine devotion; yoga mastery(which comes through the practice of Kriya Yoga); and perfect concentration.Yogananda stated that the true yogi “always knows in advance the hour of hisdeath.”These two stanzas refer twice to God as Light. The mention of a yoga techniqueis also specific in these stanzas, as will be seen with increased clarity inStanzas 12 and 13. The inner light is “supremely effulgent”—brighter, it stateslater in the Gita, than a thousand suns. Yet the inner light is not hurtful tothe eyes; it is only thrilling to the soul. The soul knows it is, itself, thatlight, as, when one hears AUM, one knows he is, himself, that Cosmic Vibration.As the AUM vibration plays upon the harp strings (so to speak) of one’s verybeing, so also the light thrills one’s consciousness with the awareness that itis Light. The “light of knowledge,” and, “the light of understanding” are nomere figures of speech.This radiance “as from a thousand suns” merges into multi-colored rays in an“ever-new display,” issuing as if from a spherical fountain, its rays sprayingoutward from an endless number of points in space. The single, spiritual eye inthe forehead bestows on the yogi a spherical vision, its luminosity everchanging, blissful, omnipresent.This vibratory light, an aspect of AUM, carries the yogi beyond all of maya’sdualities. He realizes oneness with the transcendent Lord, “whose form issubtler than the finest atom, the Ultimate Support of all (existence), the greatRuler (of all), eternal and omniscient”—out of whom issue the causal, astral,and material universes.The yogi who has attained complete control over his own consciousness beholdsthe divine consciousness everywhere, manifested in all the three universes. Heperceives God in all His eight aspects: Light, Sound, Peace, Calmness, Power,Wisdom, Love, and (above all) Bliss. (Peace and Calmness differ from one anotheronly in that Peace is the soothing cessation of all agitation of feeling,whereas Calmness is dynamic, and is the silent, essential core of creativity, ofimpersonal love, and of divine wisdom.)Krishna, in speaking in these two stanzas of the inner light, and ofconcentration at the point between the eyebrows, is referring to the light thatall can—and that many do—behold at that point. The spiritual eye is not a poeticimage. Many even who know nothing of yoga have beheld it. It is, as we statedearlier, a reflection of the medulla oblongata (the agya chakra) at the base ofthe brain. It consists of a circle of golden light encasing a blue field, with abrilliant five-pointed star, silvery-white in color, in the center. The bodilyeye is also, in a sense, a reflection of the medulla, with the white of the eye,the iris, and the pupil in the center.This phenomenon is, as we have stated, universal. It is described in the Book ofRevelation of the Bible: “And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto theend, to him will I give power over the nations. . . . And I will give him themorning star.” (Rev. 2:26–28) The “star of the East” is also the star seen bythe wise men who came to see the baby Jesus after his birth. They saw it “in theEast,” not because they came from the East (it was said to “go before” them asthey traveled westward), but because they saw it in what is known, in mysticaltradition, as the “east” of the body: the forehead. To “open” this spiritual eyeis to see through it and, after long practice, to be able to pass one’sconsciousness through it.We have already discussed how the unenlightened person sinks into a peacefulstate of deep slumber after death—a healing state after the turmoil, tests, andchallenges, the sufferings and uncertainties of earthly life. After a healingperiod spent in this condition, he may (if his intuition is somewhat developed)awake to the beauties of a higher astral world (or to the temporary terrors ofhell), in a body similar to the one he has left—made, however, of astral light.The attractions of his new life cause him to forget his physical existence for atime, though love will always bind him to those who are close to him.The great yogi, however, through his spherical spiritual eye, merely observesthe phenomenon of death. Even one who is only somewhat spiritually advanced maysee a beautiful light at death, and find himself temporarily uplifted into ahigher state of consciousness. The yogi who, during his lifetime, has practicedwithdrawing his energy and consciousness from the body is able to greet death asan old friend. Permanently released by conscious transition, he emerges from thebody with great joy. If his yoga practices have taken him beyond the astral andcausal bodies to the Lord Himself, through the “energy-knots” (chakras) in theastral spine, and through their corresponding “idea-knots” in the causal body,he soars out into union with the vibrationless, transcendent Spirit.(8:11) I will now relate to you briefly that truth, and the method for attainingit, which Vedic seers declare to be Immutable, and which sannyasis (renunciates)gain by dissolving their attachments through a life of self-discipline andtranscendence of all passion.Krishna assures Arjuna in this stanza that the divine goal can be attained bythe practice of a specific method, which in the next two stanzas he proceeds tooutline.(8:12,13) That person reaches the highest goal who closes the gates (openings)of the body, sequesters the (receptive) mind in the heart center, channels allhis life force to the brain, and engages steadfastly thereafter in the practiceof yoga: Such a one, established in AUM—the Holy Word of Brahman—is able toremember Me at the final moment of his emergence from the body.For this purpose the Kriya Yogi learns, and practices daily, a technique knownas Jyoti Mudra, the purpose of which is not only to see but to pass his lifeforce and consciousness through the spiritual eye into infinity. The mind(manas, perceptive sense-consciousness) is withdrawn upward from the lowestthree chakras in the spine (which are associated with outer consciousness), andis focused in the heart chakra (the second “stopping place” in the spine aftermanipura—located opposite the navel—for the rising energy). In Jyoti Mudra thefingers are used lightly in such a way as to close the eyes, ears, nostrils, andmouth openings, and to direct their energy inward and upward, focusing it in thespiritual eye at the point between the eyebrows. The spiritual eye is the “innergateway,” which opens onto infinity.Krishna has spoken several times already in the Gita of communing with AUM. Mosttranslators imagine this to mean chanting AUM with the voice. Indeed, that soundis, of all mantras, the highest, and helps to attune the mind to the CosmicSound. To chant that sound, however, is not the same thing as communing with itsuperconsciously. AUM is itself the true “name of God,” whose name cannot beuttered literally by human lips.The true meaning of this passage, then, is not merely (as most people take it tobe) that one should “utter the syllable AUM,” but that he should commune withand finally merge into the mighty sound of the universe.Experiencing the omnipresence of AUM, he becomes conscious of the KutasthaChaitanya—the Christ consciousness underlying all creation—and unites hisconsciousness with that. From there the yogi’s consciousness is absorbed intothe Transcendental Absolute, beyond vibratory manifestation. This is whatYogananda de-scribed as “the watchful state”: Infinite Consciousness.This state must be practiced during physical life itself. If, having practicedit, one can hold his consciousness with firm focus at the time of death in themanner prescribed, he will attain final freedom from all vestiges of ego, andwill unite his soul with God.(8:14) O Partha (Arjuna)! I am reached easily by that yogi of single heart (theheart’s feeling focused and uplifted) who daily, continuously keeps Me in hisconsciousness, wholly focused on Me.It often happens that people’s religious and spiritual practices come to berepeated “by rote” after a time. The positive inner peace and joy which resultsfrom Kriya Yoga practice make it less likely for it to be done mechanically, butstill, one must be careful to keep the heart’s feelings devotionally uplifted,and should always bear in mind the goal (God) even while traveling the path.Here is a good rule for the sincere seeker: Never go to bed at night beforeexperiencing at least some aspect of the divine presence within—peace, love,upliftment of consciousness, or joy.(8:15) Those great souls who love Me and (out of love for Me) merge in Myspirit, achieve the highest success (the only kind worth courting). They neednever return again to this ephemeral, grief-stricken world.Many spiritual aspirants equate success with some achievement that falls shortof oneness with God. They are like mountain climbers who feel satisfied afterclimbing a moderately high peak, when Everest (the highest of them all) isnearby. Or else they are satisfied to rest on a plateau, without making thefinal push to the mountaintop.Spiritual powers, worldly respect, people’s devotion, ardent crowds offollowers, success in one’s outward accomplishments—these and countless otherfleeting fulfillments seduce many even (relatively) good yogis to settle forless than total absorption in God. The underlying temptation comes fromego-attachment—not to pride, but rather to the simple thought, “I’m me! How canI give up everything I know and am for a truth I haven’t experienced?”One such “lower peak,” widely approved by people on this Earth, is the thought,“If only I could make this world into a perfect paradise!” The ego-attachmenthere is refined and sattwic (spiritually elevating). One has indeed a duty tobless and help others to whatever degree one is able, so that they, too, may beinspired to climb toward the highest fulfillment. Nevertheless, this duty mustbe seen in relation to the highest blessing of all, God- (or Self-) realization.Less than that, the fruits of anything one does with ego-consciousness can neverbe higher than ego-consciousness itself, which is, alas! the source of all oursuffering!This world is a school. The reason children attend school is to be educated—thatis to say, spiritually speaking, to become perfect. The goal of every system ofeducation is the training of children, not the improvement of the schoolitself—unless with the higher aim of providing a better education. One createsgood karma by whatever good work he does, but even good karma, as long as itremains “hitched to the post” of ego, brings one back to earth again and again.No one can make this earth a paradise, for people themselves are imperfect. Noone can ordain what people’s desires shall be. Nor can anyone decree that theyshall be desireless. The best way to improve matters objectively is to work witha few people, who themselves desire a better way of living, and then to hopethat they, by their example, will inspire a few others who too are open to beingconvinced, in the face of strong sensory evidence to the contrary, of the truth.Even so, how much can one person, one small group, or even one large body ofpeople accomplish in this world? Relative to the vast size of this world, whatman can do is very, very little!Do whatever will purify and sublimate your ego-consciousness in awareness of theSelf. Any work that remains after you leave this earth may be taken up by otherswho have been inspired by your example. Beyond that, one should remember that,as we said before, one moon gives more light than all the stars. OneSelf-realized soul accomplishes more by his simple presence in this world thanall the “stars” of busy (but mostly either inept or frustrated) world changers.(8:16) Those living in every world, from the highest to the lowest, are subjectto rebirth. (Only) on entering into My consciousness do they gain release (fromkarmic bondage)."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter Twenty-OneFINAL LIBERATION(8:17) They truly know “day” and “night” who comprehend the Day of Brahma, whichendures for a thousand mahayugas, and the Night of Brahma, which endures foranother thousand mahayugas.(8:18) At the dawn of Brahma’s Day, all creation, remanifested, emerges from its(night) state of unmanifestation: At the dusk of (approaching) Brahma’s Night,all creation sinks back into its (previous) un-manifested state.I asked my Guru once what these actual time periods were, for they do not seemto correspond to the present age of the universe according to the claims ofmodern science. He replied, “Well, Krishna may have been only making the pointthat vast periods of time are involved. The Bible expresses itself symbolicallyalso in saying that God created the world in six days.”In our discussion of Chapter 4 of the Gita, Stanzas 1 and 2, we went somewhatinto a discussion of one mahayuga: that of 24,000 years. The reader is referredback to those pages. It may well be that there are greater cycles of time eventhan that within the greatest “mahayuga,” a Day of Brahma. Certainly there isalso our solar system’s complete cycle around the galactic center—a period oftime that embraces hundreds of millions of years.Here, Paramhansa Yogananda adds to that former discussion the interesting factthat the four yugas (Kali, Dwapara, Treta, and Satya or Krita) correspond alsoto the four castes: Shudra, Vaishya, Kshatriya, and Brahmin. The number four hasa natural resonance with the progressions of relativity in the Indian teachings.There are also the four ashrams or stages of life. Even the gunas were givenfour divisions by Yogananda, with rajas having a sub-category of sattwa-rajas.In the Dark Age, called Kali, the Shudra mentality is uppermost. In Dwapara Yuga(the age we now live in, of energy), Vaishya consciousness is predominant.During Treta Yuga, when mind power comes into its own, Kshatriya consciousnessis predominant and leaders have a natural sense of honor and nobility. DuringSatya Yuga, the spiritual age, Brahmin consciousness is uppermost.No progression, however, is wholly linear. As day follows night, and nightfollows day; as winter progresses to summer, then back to winter again; as theocean waves and tides rise and fall; as the moon waxes, wanes, then waxes again:so also the yugas—long ages of time, some longer than others—advance and recedealternately. Even in the life of each man there is rising power, then a slowdecline into old age and death, preparing him for yet another try (in a newbody) at extricating himself from the hypnosis of maya.(8:19) Again and again, O Son of Pritha (Arjuna)! the same people throng back toearth to be reborn. (The cycle of) reincarnation ends for them only temporarilywith the descent of Brahma’s Night. It resumes again with the dawn of Brahma’sDay.How long does the “show” go on? This stanza provides a spine-stiffening, if notutterly dismaying, answer to those who tell themselves, “Everything will workitself out, in time.” A Day of Brahma lasts—judging from the evidence of modernscience—some billions of years. Many self-aware egos, appearing at the dawn ofBrahma’s Day, are still wandering in delusion at the fall of Brahma’s Night. Onecannot but pursue the question further: How many Days of Brahma do most souls,in fact, wander in delusion?The answer is not circumscribed by time. It might be countless Days of Brahma!Yet the cosmic destiny of every soul is final liberation in God. “Eventually?”we quoted Yogananda above as saying, “—eventually? Why not NOW?” When the soulfinally escapes the great wheel of “destiny” (which is only a cycle of unceasingkarmic return until karma itself ceases to enchain), one realizes that the timeelapsed was non-existent! Time is an illusion: In eternity, it is not even asecond.A worrying question arises: Is personal spiritual progress also not linear, butcyclic like everything else? What this stanza of the Bhagavad Gita suggests isthat any rising wave of good karma should be seized with a firm grasp. Don’twaste the opportunity! For even though time doesn’t exist, it certainly seemsvery real to us as we labor under its yoke! “Seize the day!” is an expression:this Day of Brahma; this yuga of Earth time; this season; this day; this verymoment! Spiritual progress comes not with the passing of years, but with everymoment of sincere effort. “The minutes,” Yogananda said, “are more importantthan the years.”Live now in God! Now is the only time you will ever have, since tomorrow toowill be only another “now” when it arrives. “Who cares what happens in fiveyears?” was a question flung scornfully by a young woman at her questioner in afamous movie. Many people think, similarly, “Oh, some ‘future time’! Who careswhat happens then? Now is the only time I’m concerned with.” Unfortunately forthis blithe way of thinking, that “future time,” when it arrives at last, willbe very much “now”—even if it happens in a future body. It is very unwise—not tosay foolish—ever to offend against karmic law.Right action will give you good karma, which will bring you correspondinghappiness. It will not, however, release you from the constant turning of themill that grinds every delusion, in time, to powder. The goal of the Gita is notto show you the way merely to a better life—perhaps on Earth; perhaps in heaven.Rather, it is, as Yogananda quoted Krishna, to help you to “get away from Myocean of suffering and misery!”One by one, and by no means in consequence of any mass societal or evolutionarystep forward, every soul escapes from the wheel at last, into the arms of CosmicWisdom. Be such a one, yourself!The astonishing thing is that this step is really quite easy to take! It seemsdifficult when we look around us, and see how many there are who fail to makeit. If we will look into our own hearts, however, instead of judging ourselvesby the criterion of others’ struggles, we must see that the job is not sodifficult as it seems. It all hinges on two or three very simple thoughts:First, do you prefer happiness to suffering? Second, are you willing to do thework to find a happiness that won’t change, in time, to suffering? Third (andmost important), are you willing to offer into the fire of wisdom—which is thetrue perception of things as they are—that pathetically little, insignificant“I”? Are you, in continuation of this final question, willing to say, “Thou,Lord, art the Doer. Thine is the importance. Thine is the prominence beforeothers. Thine also is the blame for every sin this little ‘I’ has committed,which I hereby cast into Thy flames to be purified that its reality be destroyedforever”?Now—as a physician might say to a little child after giving it an injection—wasthat so very difficult?The path to God is easy! For one thing, life’s tests would come anyway,apparently without any cosmic reason. For another, there is no alternative toit! And for a third, every step of the way is more rewarding, more joyful, andmore utterly satisfying!(8:20) Beyond the unmanifested state (known as the Night of Brahma) there is theAbsolute Unmanifested, forever immutable, which remains eternally untouched bythe recurring cycles of creation.People sometimes take hope when they learn about the Night of Brahma, thinkingthey may be able simply to wait long enough, and then, at the time of Pralaya orcosmic dissolution, they’ll be able to merge back into God. Nothing can happen,however, without the conscious consent of the will. When everything merges backinto Spirit again and becomes unmanifested, it retires only to a “way station.”Final liberation is not attained so irresponsibly. The Cosmic Night, thoughdescribed as having an equal length to that of Brahma’s Day, is not theunmanifested state of Absolute Spirit. Instead, it is simply a state ofquiescence: a temporary resting period during which all beings and all thingsremain in a condition not unlike that of seeds in wintertime, which lie dormantunderground. The seeds, in the (partially) unmanifested state, are not material,but the ever-living, conscious nuclei of idea-forms.(8:21) The (aforesaid) “Absolute Unmanifested, forever Immutable” is (what sagesspeak of as) the Supreme Spirit. Those (only) who attain it by self-effort gaineternal freedom from obligatory rebirth.(8:22) Singlehearted devotion, O Arjuna! is what lifts one to that supremelyunmanifested state. Only the ever-conscious, Omnipresent Spirit is the(ultimate) repository of all (things, and all) beings.“On a little piece of thought,” my Guru used to say, “rests the cosmic lot. Rubthat thought away: The universe is wiped away.” How strange it is to think that,surrounded by an ocean of consciousness, and being conscious ourselves, we canseem (though only in consciousness!) to be so separate. It is thought itselfthat separates us: the little notion that ours is an individual reality!Otherwise, whether passing through the Day or the Night of Brahma, we are ever(to ourselves unconsciously, however) in Him. Our abode—both actual anddeluded—lies in Him alone.(8:23) I will now declare to you, O Best of the Bharatas (Arjuna)! the two pathsopen to departing souls: the one, the way of the yogi, which leads to (eternal)freedom; the other, the way to rebirth.(8:24) Fire, light, daytime, the bright half of the lunar month, the six monthsof the northern course of the sun: pursuing this path at the time of death, theknowers of Brahman go to Brahman.(8:25) Smoke, night-time, the dark half of the lunar month, the six months ofthe southern course of the sun: following this path at the time of death, oneattains only the lunar light and so returns to earth.(8:26) These two paths of exit (from the body) are eternal alternatives: the wayof light leads to freedom; the way of darkness, to rebirth.Stanzas 24 and 25 are among the most abstruse and esoteric in the whole BhagavadGita. Intellectual scholarship alone could never fathom them; indeed,translators and commentators deserve forgiveness if they simply skip over them,as some do—evidently in the hope that readers won’t notice the omission. Only agreat yogi could make any sense of them—or, indeed, could show them to have deepmeaning.Paramhansa Yogananda explained that the path of spiritual ascent is by awakeningthe Kundalini. “Fire” refers to life energy: the fire of yagya, which symbolizesthe divine energy into which one offers his ego for purification in ultimateconsumption.“Light” stands for what Jesus Christ, in an equally esoteric passage in the NewTestament of the Bible, described as “the light of the body”: the spiritual eye,beheld in the forehead.“Daytime” signifies that period of time when the yogi is divinely awake insuperconsciousness. It is also the period of time the yogi spends insuperconsciousness, as opposed to the hours (whether few or many) devoted tofulfilling his worldly duties. The “sun” of the spiritual eye shines upon him,bringing what is described in all mystical traditions as enlightenment.The “bright half of the lunar month” marks the time of spiritual awakening. Themoon is symbolic of the ego. In traditional works of Indian art, the moon isoften depicted as a crescent-shape in the forehead of the enlightened yogi,signifying that his ego-consciousness has become enlightened, and is one withthe divine Self.The “six months of the northern course of the sun” denote, literally, that halfof the year when the sun rises higher in the sky. Figuratively, they denoteenergy rising in the six spinal chakras, culminating in the Kutastha, orspiritual eye (this being the positive pole of the medulla oblongata at the topof the spine). “North,” in mystical terminology, indicates the top of the body:the sahasrara, or “crown chakra.” North, therefore, indicates the upward flow ofenergy in the spine toward that highest point.Kundalini, to recapitulate, is the south pole of the body, located at the baseof the spine, where the outward-flowing energy, from the spine to the nervoussystem, becomes “locked,” so to speak, in its “southward” direction. Kundaliniis said to be dormant: Kundalini awakening signifies that moment when thedownward flow of energy relaxes its grip on outwardness and begins its returnjourney upward, in the direction of its source in divine consciousness.As there is no limit to how far the energy can flow upward in expansion ofconsciousness—since spiritual development “ends,” as Paramhansa Yogananda putit, “in endlessness” (infinity)—so also there is no limit, theoretically, to howfar it can flow downward. Though the negative pole of energy in the body is saidto lie dormant at the base of the spine, it represents the lower extremes ofsubconsciousness. Nothing in the universe is wholly unconscious: It cannot be.The “collective unconscious” of Carl Jung is a literal impossibility. Everythingin the universe is to a degree conscious, since it is a product of divineconsciousness. Thus, although Kundalini represents the dormant energy of man atthe base of the spine, and therefore stands for his lower-than-consciousawareness, it is by no means stationary. Kundalini can move further downwardtoward greater nescience, like a mole burrowing ever deeper into the ground.Thus, human beings can sink ever deeper, toward relative (but never absolute)unconsciousness.Kundalini can be awakened by yoga practices. If, however, those practices arenot accompanied by a corresponding purification of the ego, they can raise moreenergy to the medulla oblongata than the ego is prepared to send forward to thespiritual eye (in the self-offering known as inner yagya). This excessive energythen forms a vortex around the thought of ego, creating an imbalance ofawareness, and the yogi cannot maintain his heightened state, but falls backagain toward the base of the spine. Yogananda made it clear that the raising ofthe Kundalini force must be accompanied by conscious purification of the heart’sfeelings. The most important part of its awakening depends, indeed, on kindness,generosity, truthfulness, and all the basic virtues—recognized as such in everytrue religion.On the other hand, every time one is unkind, ungenerous, untruthful, or behavesin any way contrary to the virtues, his Kundalini continues its downward courseinto ever dimmer awareness. Taking the upward course of energy andconsciousness, its direction is outward to infinity, and has therefore nolimits. Its potential downward course toward the infinitesimal, is also withoutlimits. More of this dismaying potential later on, however. Let it, for now, beonly something to ponder as to the seriousness of its implications.Yogis who follow the upward course raise the fiery energy in the spine, andawaken, in passing, the chakras in the spine. The greater the upward flow ofenergy, the greater the light at the point between the eyebrows. Indeed, theclear vision of that light reveals a differently colored light in each chakra,which is seen in the spiritual eye: yellow for muladhara; white for swadisthana;red for manipura; blue for anahata; smoke colored with little specks of lightfor bishuddha; and, in the spiritual eye (as has already been described), a ringof gold surrounding a field of deep blue-violet, with a silvery-whitefive-pointed star at the center.It is tempting to compare the colors of these six chakras, along with theseventh in the so-called crown chakra at the top of the head, with the colors ofthe rainbow. The rainbow is certainly comparable with the seven chakras,especially with their gradual change in hue from materialistic red to spiritualviolet (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet). This comparisonmust be written off, however, as more poetical than literal. The colors statedabove by Paramhansa Yogananda are the actual chakra colors seen in the spiritualeye.The upward “way of light” takes the yogi, as was described earlier, through thespiritual eye and through the progressively deep channels in the astral spine—sushumna, vajra, chitra—then through the channel in the causal spine—thebrahmanadi—into infinity.The downward way is implied by the above.“Smoke” implies ignorance, as smoke can hide a burning fire. Ignorance, like adark cloud, obscures the light of wisdom and makes impossible the correctperception of anything.Darkness implies complete obscuration of the light. Which of these two—asks theworldly mind—is the reality? Darkness seems to reign supreme until alight—whether of the sun or of a candle—is introduced into it. Even so, the manliving in ignorance accepts that state not only as normal for him, but as,objectively, the universal state of things everywhere. Light is considered byworldly minds a foreign reality. In a similar display of ignorance, science hasintroduced what it calls The Second Law of Thermodynamics, according to whichall warmth in the universe is being gradually lost—dissipated at first, and thendwindling to the temperature of absolute zero.Such is mankind’s perception of reality. As man doesn’t see that everythingbegins with absolute consciousness, and not (as materialists believe) with“absolute” unconsciousness, so he doesn’t see that energy, and not a totalabsence of energy, is the underlying reality even of matter. Thus, he seesdarkness, not light, as the eternal reality; coldness, not a process of finalequalization, as describing the final outcome of all “progressive” evolution.“Smoke”—that cloud of ignorance which obscures human consciousness—is not thenorm. “Night-time,” too—the second condition of existence described in Stanza25—is the time of spiritual sleep, in which the unenlightened human beingdrowses.“The dark half of the lunar month” refers to the waning of the moon ofego-consciousness. Human beings—in contradistinction to the lower animals—areendowed with egoic awareness. This fact might be considered unfortunate(inasmuch as the challenge of living spiritually is to transcend the ego), butin fact one has to become aware of a limitation before he can transcend it.During the “bright half of the lunar month” the ego becomes, in time,sufficiently self-aware to offer itself up completely into infinite freedom.During the “dark half of the lunar month,” by contrast, the ego, though clingingto its individuality, loses that fine edge of awareness which distinguishesoneself from, but also identifies oneself with, all life. During this “waningmoon” of ego, self-consciousness becomes obscured also: instinctive rather thandistinct. The ego, if it chooses to move downward into ever-darkerconsciousness, can plunge so far as to find itself again in the body of a loweranimal. (Of this, again, more later.)The “six months of the southern course of the sun” are, at this point, obvious.They signify the downward course of energy and consciousness through the sixchakras of the spine, back again to its base.The reference in these stanzas is, specifically, to the course of man’sconsciousness at the time of death. Those commentators, however, who try to givethe stanzas a literal interpretation are at a loss. The death of a great yogihas no relationship to the phases of the moon, nor to the time of year. Thereferences in these stanzas are all metaphorical.(8:27) No true yogi, understanding these two alternate paths, is ever deluded(into following the downward way). Therefore, O Arjuna! Keep yourself firmly atall times in a (state of) yoga.(8:28) He who knows the (hidden secret of) these two paths goes beyond anymerits (with its fruits of good karma) gained from study of the scriptures, orfrom the formal practice of yagyas, austerities, or gifts in charity. That yogiattains his (self’s) Supreme Origin.Religion is the path. True experience is spirituality: the attainment of thegoal. Krishna is not deprecating religious acts. He is, however, remindingArjuna that such acts have their end. Even in the practice of spirituality(Krishna is saying), and of all the religious virtues, keep your heart and mindfixed on God alone.Thus ends the eighth chapter, called “Union with the Absolute Spirit,” of theUpanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna andArjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter Twenty-TwoTHE SOVEREIGN LORD OF ALL(9:1) The Blessed Lord said: To you, who have overcome the carping spirit, I nowreveal the sublime mystery (the immanent and transcendent nature of God). Armedwith this (intuitive) wisdom, you shall escape all evil.The impulse to carp at everything is a kind of illness of the mind. It preventspeople from opening themselves to new ideas, and causes them to see themselvesas, in a sense, presiding judges in the courtroom of life. In other words, it isa negative symptom of ego-consciousness.The carping spirit inclines one to respond to every suggestion with thecautionary objection, “Yes, but. . . . ” Seldom does it bring any firmconclusion, for even its understanding is tentative. This is not theself-torturing condition of spiritual doubt, but it keeps one neverthelessconstantly in a state of indecision: a condition endemic to the intellect,which, lacking the certainty of intuition, never really knows anything. The veryproofs of Euclidean geometry leave one at least wishing he could find a “catch”to them.One who is tired of this habit in himself should live more in his heart, and tryto develop there a calm, intuitive feeling about the rightness of things. Untilhe can do so, life will remain for him a rocky ride of perpetual uncertaintywhich causes him to challenge every statement, almost compulsively, withqualifications.(9:2) (The way to this) realization is the highest of sciences, the (secret of)secrets, the essence of all dharma (right action). Through (yoga) methods, easyto perform, this way bestows the direct perception of truth.(9:3) Men who lack faith (and even interest) in this dharma, (seeking theirfulfillment elsewhere) do not attain Me, O Scorcher of Foes (Arjuna)! Again andagain they take the path of samsara (delusion) and mortality.Indifference is the greatest spiritual disease. One doesn’t expect a turtle toask, “Why do I need a shell into which I can withdraw?” At the first sign ofdanger, it simply retracts to comparative safety. Man, however, is above themental level of merely instinctive response. If, when suffering, he asks only,“Why me?” without probing more deeply into the reasons for his suffering andinquiring what he might do about it—if, in short, he behaves like a sparrowindifferent to (because it doesn’t see) the swooping hawk—life will gobble himup before he knows what is happening.Many people, when they are introduced to spiritual teachings, respond by saying,“Frankly, I’m not interested.” Are they more interested, then, in dancing theirlives away while the house they live in collapses? Urged to take their owndestiny more seriously by seeking truth, they respond, “But, it’s difficult!”So—the question must be asked—is suffering easier?How sad, that so very few people are willing to face the one reality that, ifthey but knew it, would give them everything! Their physical, emotional, mental,and spiritual security is at stake, yet they push away the thought that anythingmenaces them by seeking diversions, and think, “Oh, it will all take care ofitself—someday.” It never will “take care of itself”! They themselves must facea reality that will never leave them alone until they’ve solved its mystery.The thing is, as Krishna says here, yoga practice is really much easier than anyother path one might follow through life’s wilderness. For one thing, it is theonly path that actually leads somewhere—indeed, that provides answers that arepermanent, secure, and supremely fulfilling. For another thing, yoga andmeditation really aren’t difficult, but demand simply, as Krishna states in thisgreat scripture, that one “slay” the foes that threaten his own happiness. Allthat one does is redirect the energy he has devoted, under the influence ofhabit, to things that do not and that never will give him what he wants. He mustsimply channel that energy away from conclusions that have brought him misery,and direct them into channels that will provide him with perfect happiness, joy,and—in the end—bliss.So many things militate, however, against this simple, obvious, and in factinevitable decision (inevitable, that is, in the end): habit, for one (perhapshabit is even paramount); and the thought, caused by delusion: “I am this body,separate from all others. I need to make a place for myself, protected from thehostile forces surrounding me.” The greatest thing which militates against theobvious, however, is, simply, hope. People hope to find happiness in specifics;material things, usually. When at last they fulfill a dream—and almost, thoughnot quite, at the very moment of fulfillment—those dream-fulfillments turn todust and are blown away on the winds of altered circumstance.Through the swirling mists of maya a face appears; the mists then close again,and the face vanishes. If ever, through them, it returns, it is somehowcoarsened, changed, and painful to contemplate.You never, in all eternity, have anyone but your own self. Must you not, then,love no one else? Certainly you must love others! Love them as they are,however: as extensions of the Self—not of the egoic self, but of the true Selfof all. No other reality exists! That one Self exists in all things.Images—swirling, haunting, dream-like—come and go, changeless forever yetforever changing. Until you know yourself in infinity, you will have to livealone with your dreams. The chasm between you and them, between you andeverything in existence, yawns ever wide and defies you to cross it.What people really want (though they see it not!) are not things, nor others tolove, but ideas, fantasies, mere will-o’-the-wisps. Consciousness alone is real!Mankind dances with idea-waves on the sea of chitta (feeling), and sees not thatall hopes are but wisps of imagination!(9:4) I, the (eternally) Unmanifested, pervade the entire universe. Allcreatures abide in Me, though I abide not in them.Krishna made a similar statement in 7:12: “They [the gunas] exist in me, thoughI am not apparent in them.” Here, it is of creatures themselves that he speakswhen he says: “I abide not in them.” He (the Spirit), in other words, is beyondthose abstractions—the qualities—which permeate mankind in constantly varyingmixtures. He is also beyond mankind itself, with its ego-driven ideas,ambitions, and deeds. We all ride on waves that rise up out of the ocean ofdivine consciousness—never relaxing to mingle with the water around us, neverletting ourselves become absorbed in it, and never allowing Him to enter ourhearts.We imagine that we, like little icebergs, are substantially different from Him,and that He, similarly, is essentially different from us. Poor mankind, that itshould suffer so needlessly! Water is water, whether frozen, liquid, orevaporated in the form of steam.(9:5) Behold My divine mystery! All beings seem not to exist in Me, nor I inthem: Yet I am their sole Creator and Preserver!(9:6) Think of it thus: As air moves through space, but is not space, so do allcreatures have their being in Me, but are not I.(9:7) At the end of a cycle (kalpa), O Son of Kunti (Arjuna)! all beings returnto the unmanifested state of My Cosmic Nature. At the beginning of the nextgreat cycle, I cast them forth again.(9:8) By reawakening again and again My own emanation, Prakriti, I repeatedlyproduce the vast host of creatures, all subject to Nature and to her finitelaws.(9:9) These activities do not bind Me, O Winner of Wealth (Arjuna)! for I,remaining aloof from them, am forever non-attached.(9:10) O Son of Kunti (Arjuna), it is My impregnating essence alone that makesMother Nature give birth to (both) the animate and inanimate. By My power alone(through Prakriti) do the (very) worlds revolve.God as Nature is the Divine Mother. His “Son” is the reflected, vibrationlessconsciousness at the core of every vortex of atoms. He is Spirit’s “uninvolved”presence in every life.To attune ourselves with God, we too must try to view objectively not only whathappens to us, but our very reactions, for all these are simply parts of theraging storm of maya. We must feel ourselves centered as much as possible at thecore of that vortex, untouched by anything—even as Spirit, our essential self,is untouched.(9:11) The ignorant, oblivious of My transcendent nature though (I am) theCreator of all, are blind also to My presence within (themselves).(9:12) Blind to all (valid) insights, vain in their aspirations, deeds, andthoughts, human beings (who were made for a nobler purpose) may partake of thenature of monsters and demons.By “monsters,” here, are intended human beings self-afflicted with “monstrous”natures: those of extreme cruelty, for example, or of distorted and unnaturalappetites. Such people after death (which releases their emotions from theenclosing physical walls of the body) become demons, their very forms displayingin grossest caricature the foulness of their own consciousness. Such humanbeings are at the darkest end of the spectrum of the three gunas, or qualities.They are veritable personifications of the darkening quality of tamas.(9:13) Great souls, however, expressing in their human nature the higherqualities of divinity, pay undeviating homage to Me, the Imperishable Source ofall life.(9:14) Constantly absorbed in Me, prostrating to Me with love, steadfastlyresolute in their high aspiration, they worship Me with (unceasing) adoration.(9:15) Lesser beings also, offering Me themselves with clear discrimination,discern Me first in the manifested many, and then as the One (behind the many).The two paths of devotion (bhakti) and discrimination (gyana), love and wisdom,become one when united in the Ultimate Vision. Bhaktas (those who proceed by thepath of devotional bhakti) do not ask, and are not interested in, all thereasons for loving God. He is their own: What is there to ask? Gyanis (those whoproceed by the path of gyana) must love also, otherwise (as Swami Sri Yukteswarstated) they will not be inspired to set even one foot before the other on thepath to God. Their intellects, however, want satisfaction also. Nor is this acontradiction in human nature. Bhaktas need the discrimination to turn theirfeelings Godward. Gyanis need the devotion to long deeply for God, without whichthey would feel no inspiration to seek Him.How can discrimination help one’s devotion? It can help in this way: Look at aleaf; then, instead of analyzing it minutely (as both science and the intellectare inclined to do), expand your consciousness of that leaf into a broaderreality. Instead of thinking how to squeeze your understanding of the leaf intoa definition—as if to place it in a catalogue—think of the many things that aremarvelous about a leaf: the fact, for instance, that something so simple couldbe replicated by human beings in a thousand ways, yet never be more living thana stone sculpture.What impulse of life could produce a leaf? Could the form of that leaf becontained already in the seed? If so, how? Is there not some idea, hidden withinthe leaf, that springs forth at last to form that one leaf, among countlessothers?What great impulse is there in life itself to produce such a little, fragileobject, and yet to continue, in the face of endlessly falling leaves, to bringlife back again and again to other leaves, each one unique? What consciousnessis there in the universe that could, perhaps from its beginnings, havevisualized that leaf? Did it know, in those nebulous clouds of primordial time,what it would accomplish at each stage of evolution? Was love at the heart ofthe leaf’s first conception? Does God love, and does He enjoy, the simplecreation of that leaf?And what about man himself? Whence come his thoughts? Is his thinking merely aresponse to subconscious, perhaps repressed, impulses of the body? Or does thefact that all men, in one way or another, have identical, or similar, thoughtsmean that there is some cosmic “reservoir” generating the power to motivatethem?In these ways, by ever-expanding inquiry into the underlying cause and nature ofthings, discrimination can become, instead of a path of dry inquiry, a pathwayalso of love.(9:16) I am the sacrificial ritual; I am the sacrifice itself; I am theoblations offered to the ancestors; I am the (medicinal) herb; I am the sacredmantras; I am the ghee (clarified butter, which is offered in ritual worship);(I am also) the fire (and) the very act of offering.(9:17) Of this world I am the Father, Mother, Forefather, Preserver; I am He whosanctifies; I am the Object of all Knowledge; I am the Cosmic AUM; I am the loreof the three Vedas (Rig, Yajur, and Sama).[5](9:18) I am the Ultimate Goal, the Upholder, the Lord, the Witness, the Abode,the Refuge, the One Friend. I am the Origin, the Dissolution, the Foundation,the Cosmic Storehouse, and the Imperishable Seed.(9:19) I bestow heat; I send or withhold rain. Immortality am I, and mortalityas well. I am both Being and Non-being (Sat and Asat).If one thinks of God as existent, He is existence. For an atheist who thinks ofHim as non-existent, He is non-existence! No thought can exist without Hissustaining presence. It is He who fosters faith, and He also who nurtures doubts(in those who hold them). Without Him, nothing can exist. People’s veryrejection of Him is sustained by His consciousness and energy.“I’m too busy to seek God!” is an oft-heard objection to meditating and toperforming other spiritual practices. “What if God,” replied Yogananda whenpeople made this remark to him, “were too busy to think of you? You’d cease inthat very instant to exist!” Yet I asked him once, “Can the soul ever bedestroyed?” Very forcefully he replied, “Impossible! The soul is a part of God.How could God be destroyed?”“Who made God?” is another question commonly asked. Yogananda’s reply was, “Youask this question because you are living in the realm of causation. God,however, is the Supreme Cause. He is self-existent.” To assume that a thing hasbeen caused is, necessarily, to accept that it will, in time, be “uncaused”—thatis to say, destroyed. God is neither living nor non-living: He simply is—withouta cause, without a reason, beyond all inference or disproof, beyond eitheracceptance or rejection.Wise are they who, contemplating Him, simply marvel in silence.(9:20) Those who follow Vedic (or other) rituals, cleansing themselves by theSoma rites, or worshiping Me by prescribed yagyas, doing (all these) to winheaven, succeed in going there, and (may) attain the realm of Indra (lord of thegods), where they enjoy the delights of heaven.(9:21) After enjoying those lofty regions for a time, and when the merits theyhave acquired (that have brought them) there have been exhausted, they return toearth. By following the scriptural regulations in their desire for celestialrewards, they (endlessly) repeat the cycle of ascent and return.Endlessly repeated last-minute reprieves, followed by a return in chains to thesame old prison: What a choice destiny! Reading scripture, obeying its“commandments” to please God (but not to attain His bliss for oneself) is surelysattwic, or self-elevating, and is therefore not something to be criticized orcondemned. And yet—how far short it leaves one of the fulfillment every soul sodeeply craves!(9:22) To those who meditate on Me as their very own, (their hearts) ever unitedto Me by incessant (inward) worship, I supply their deficiencies and makepermanent their gains.The merits acquired through worship of the lesser (astral) gods are temporaryand limiting. The merits—that is to say, the good karma—one acquires by doingkind deeds, by being honest, by telling the truth, and so on are also temporary,and self-limiting. Krishna taught in a country, and at a time, when religion andreligious practices were wholly identified with the Vedas. Hinduism itself was aname given only centuries later to the religion of India. The indigenous name,as we stated earlier, was Sanaatan Dharma: the “Eternal Religion.” Krishnaspeaks throughout the Bhagavad Gita of beliefs and practices that people inother religions came to define as Hindu. The truths he taught, however, aretimeless and universal. Sanaatan Dharma ought rightly to be understood as thespiritual way of the entire universe: that is to say, inward, not outwardthrough the senses. Thus, people in every religion can benefit enormously fromthe teachings of the Gita, simply by substituting for expressions like “Vedicrituals” the scriptures and rituals of their own religions. Worship of the“gods” can be understood as special reverence for the angels.To admit the existence of nothing higher than one’s self is to be self-condemnedto an almost pathetic pettiness. We must seek ever to grow in understanding andsympathy. Not to do so is to decline, which means to shrink in consciousness,inward upon the ego. For there can be no stasis in life. Movement is aninevitable fact of manifested existence. Even stagnation is a kind of movement,implying as it does a kind of inward deterioration.Without at least the concept of God, however, there can be no clear direction ofmovement. No wonder ancient societies, lacking that clear upward direction, madethe “gods” themselves over into very human figures, with jealousies, rivalries,lusts, and prejudices. Without the concept of a Supreme Lord, to what “bull’seye in the target” could they point their arrow of discrimination?Thus, the Indian scriptures speak of the lesser gods, and say that man shouldhonor and even pray to them. Mankind in its relation to the gods might becompared to the lower animals in their relation to man. Animals that live inclose association with human beings evolve more quickly, and are likely to bepromoted sooner to the human level of evolution. People, similarly, who seekpiously to associate with the gods evolve spiritually more rapidly than thosewho consider themselves sufficient unto themselves.Such evolution is slow, however, and never certain, for it is rooted inego-consciousness. Incremental progress of this sort is like the illustration ofthe magnet and the effort to magnetize a bar of steel by turning each molecule,one at a time, in a north-south direction. By the time one had advanced only ashort direction up the bar, the already-oriented molecules, possessing as yet nostrong magnetism to hold them to that orientation, might easily become randomagain in their direction.Again, incremental progress, working painstakingly to advance only by improvingone’s karma, may be compared to washing a shirt. An air bubble may raise onesection of the shirt above water. If we submerge that part, the air bubble willsimply move elsewhere, and raise another section. Concentration, similarly, onthe transformation of one bad karma into a good one, or of one weakness into itsopposite virtue, might work if only a few traits required attention. Consideringthe fact, however—which the Bhagavad Gita makes clear—that our “mental citizens”are comparable in number and variety to the population of a large country, thetask of transforming each one of them individually seems all but hopeless. Oneincarnation may not suffice to change even one deep-seated flaw.Scriptural rules—prescriptive and proscriptive—are what Paramhansa Yoganandadescribed as the “bullock cart” approach to perfection. Worshiping the gods (orgiving reverence to the angels) is, similarly, a “bullock cart” approach. In therealm of relativity, what goes up must eventually come down. Good karma, soughtonly as an astral “merit badge,” can fall again as easily as the crest of awave.Thus, the highest teaching, which Krishna expounds here, is to love God, theInfinite Spirit, above all: “to meditate on Him as one’s very own.” God alonecan lift us out of the relativities of karmic merits and demerits into theabsolute peace and freedom of Infinite Being.(9:23) O Son of Kunti (Arjuna), even the devotees of other gods, if theysacrifice to them with faith, are worshiping Me alone, however improperly.(9:24) For I alone am in truth the Enjoyer and Lord of all sacrifices. Those,however, (who worship Me in lesser aspects) perceive Me not in My true nature,and so eventually they fall.What constitutes “improper” worship, mentioned above in Stanza 23? Worship ofany kind is an offering up of the ego. Most people indulge in self-worship:offering the self, so to speak, into the same little self, and thereby inflatingit with arrogance. Those who offer themselves to others by showing them respect,are—again, only in a sense—suppressing their egos, but theirs is no serious movetoward overcoming the ego. Suppression, as Krishna has indicated already, is notpossible. An ego held temporarily in abeyance is still ego, and can break outanew, like a disease, whenever outward circumstances permit.Self-offering to the gods implies at least a raising of consciousness, for it isan offering of the qualities one possesses into a greater goodness and a pureraspiration. Why, then, is such worship “improper”? It is so only in the sensethat the increase of goodness and aspiration in oneself is only a step into ahigher ego-consciousness, not into absorption of the ego in infinity.Even so, because it is a step upward in spiritual evolution—and although thatrise must be continued to the top of the stairs, where the “bird of paradise,”the soul, can take wing and soar in endlessness—attunement with higher beings,whether conceived of as gods or as angels, is acceptable by the Supreme Spiritinsofar as the blessings they receive (from Him) will purify their understandingand help them to prepare for the “final assault.”The danger, however, expressed in Stanza 24, is that because the devotee thinkswhatever blessings he receives through the gods come from them, rather than fromGod Himself, worshiping them ends in an exalted, but still limited, form, andthus becomes merely an extension of the ego, not an absorption of it. The reasonthey who worship the gods fall back again into delusion may be explained by anelastic band, which, though stretched to its limits, cannot but snap back intime to its original position, once the force that extended it is released.In offering the ego up to God, there is no question of self-extension; there isno band to stretch out and snap back. The ego is dissolved in the Infinite Self,and thereby ceases completely to exist (except as a memory in omniscience).Worship that needs repeated formal re-offering cannot be forever effective. Inthe end, it becomes habitual, and what is habitual no longer has the full forceof will behind it. Worship of the Supreme Lord, by contrast, is not onlyreinforced by divine joy itself, but ceases in time to have an ego to do theworshiping: The ego merges into, and becomes, that which it contemplates.(9:25) Those who worship the gods go to them; those who worship their ancestorsgo to the abode of ancestors; those who worship the nature spirits go to them;but those who are My devotees come to Me.This famous sloka is a reminder to all to make God throughout their lives theirprimary object of worship, and especially, when they reach the doorway of death,to keep their consciousness focused on Him.It is the heart’s feelings that direct energy. One is drawn wherever hisfeelings pull him.Small-minded or materialistic persons find it difficult to understandabstractions. To them, consciousness itself seems possible only if there is aphysical brain to produce it. To such persons, statements like these may easilybe interpreted to mean—as some people actually believe—that the Supreme God,being Krishna, is (in keeping with the Krishna legends) blue-colored and playinga flute. To them, he has to be saying in the above passage that He, Krishna, isabove the other gods in some relative sense—higher, larger, more powerful,wiser, more effulgent. Effort has been devoted in these pages to clarify thetruth that the Infinite is above relativity. There is nothing sectarian inKrishna’s teachings. Nevertheless, it may be helpful to state once and for all,in connection with a passage that bigots sometimes use to justify theirsectarianism, that in Krishna’s exalted view of Truth there is no competition.(9:26) Whenever anyone, with a pure intention, offers Me (even) a leaf, aflower, a (piece of) fruit, or water (whether poured out or held up in avessel), I accept his offering (as symbolic of his love).Some people are foolish enough to think God is satisfied only with theseofferings. They may even discuss what kind of leaf, flower, or fruit is mostpleasing to Him. Many people in Bengal, worshipers of God in the form of DivineMother Kali, believe that the red hibiscus (jawba) is in itself particularlypleasing to Her. Tradition insists that certain offerings are correct, andothers, incorrect. In reality, however, what God wants from us is our love. Thespecific things we offer to Him are only symbols of that love. If we offer themwithout love, however, He will never accept them, no matter how “correct” andsanctioned they are by tradition.In this passage, Krishna is simply saying (as if to little children) “You mustpractice offering yourself in little ways, first. If you cannot yet make thesupreme offering of your ego-consciousness to Me, then practice the thought ofmaking little gifts. Any slight offering, made with love, is a step in the rightdirection, and is for that reason acceptable to Me.”The first snow that falls on the ground in wintertime does not immediatelywhiten the earth. Gradually the snowflakes cool the ground until it is coldenough to accept them. Whiteness then becomes visible, as if suddenly,everywhere.Some people say, “I will wait until I’m old. Then I will give my life to God.”Or they declare in all earnestness, “I will wait until I’ve fulfilled my worldlydesires. Then I will dedicate myself to seeking Him.” Foolish ones! How can theybe certain that, in old age, they’ll have the strength, the good health, and themental clarity to do anything but sit, gazing into the middle distance anddreaming vaguely of what might have been? How do they imagine that their desireswill ever end? What is it that keeps the ego going, life after life, era afterera; yuga after yuga; Day of Brahma after Day of Brahma!? It is, simply andentirely, the power of desire—of wishful thinking!Krishna is saying here, “Start wherever you are now on the way to the Infinite.The smallest step you take will bring you closer, and will give you theunderstanding, and also the ability, to offer yourself ever more completelyuntil that final day comes when giving yourself will be like stepping joyfullyinto the arms of the Beloved.”(9:27) Whatever action you perform (with dispassion), O Arjuna! whether eating,or performing spiritual rites, or making gifts in charity, or in austerities(self-discipline), dedicate that action in offering to Me.(9:28) In this way, nothing you do will bind you to either good or evil karma.Firmly anchored in Me by self-renunciation, you will achieve freedom, and willcome to Me.(9:29) I am impartial to all. No one is (specially) hateful or dear to Me.Those, however, who give Me their hearts’ love are in Me, as I am in them.(9:30) Even an evildoer, if (in his heart) he rejects all else and worships Mealone, should, because of that resolution, be counted among the good.(9:31) (Such a one) will soon become virtuous, and will achieve lasting peace. OSon of Kunti (Arjuna), know this for a certainty: My devotee is never lost!(9:32) Taking shelter in Me, all can achieve Supreme Fulfillment—whether they beof sinful birth, or women (the preservers, traditionally, of family values andtherefore of samsara), or Vaishyas, or lowly Shudras.Stanza 32 intends no slur on anyone, but states only that social distinctions(sex, caste, race) have no meaning before God. Man, out of egotism, createsbarriers. God simply ignores them.(9:33) How easy it is, then, for (true) Brahmins, who know God, and forRajarishis (true Kshatriyas, whose sole desire is to serve God in all) to attainMe. Ah! You who have come into this transient world, full of misery: Worship Mealone!(9:34) Keep your mind fixed on Me! Be My devotee! In ceaseless worship andadoration, bow to Me! Thus, becoming one with Me and knowing Me as your highestgoal, you shall (ever) be My very own!Thus ends the ninth chapter, called “The Sovereign Lord of All,” of theUpanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna andArjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization.[5] The fourth Veda, Atharva, was added at a later time."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter Twenty-ThreeFROM THE UNMANIFESTED TO THE MANIFEST(10:1) The Blessed Lord said: O Mighty-armed (Arjuna), hear now My supremeutterance: Speaking for your highest good, I will say more to you, who havelistened with joy.(10:2) Neither the multitude of gods (angels) nor the great sages (in theirhuman state) know Me in My Unmanifested state. I am their Source and Origin.(10:3) Whoever realizes Me, however, unborn and without any beginning, as wellas (even now) the Lord of Creation, has conquered delusion, and is sinlessthough he inhabit a human body.It may be helpful for people to realize that even jivan muktas—indeed, evenfully liberated masters—accept, in their human state, some human limitations.They may seem, for example, to suffer for others—and even, on occasion, forthemselves. They express hopes, enthusiasms, and disappointments that they don’treally feel at their own center. Though completely non-attached, they “play thegame” of life.I used often to observe, when my Guru expressed perfectly natural humanfeelings, that he always did so in a sattwic manner. His eyes, too, werefathomlessly calm. It was obvious to me that he was inwardly untouched. Yet tobe acceptable to human beings, he accepted humanity for himself as part of theteachings he was sharing.Once, for example, when a disciple tried to call his attention to the higherteachings during a discussion of world events, the Guru responded, “Well, butnow we are speaking in human terms.”When, during his early years in America, an Indian disciple betrayed him, ourGuru expressed great sorrow. Yet another disciple, who years later visitedIndia, learned that the Master, even while still a boy, had predicted this verybetrayal. We might compare his later grief to someone seeing a movie for thesecond time. Wanting to enjoy the plot as it unfolds, he deliberately ignoreshis prior familiarity with it.(10:4,5) Discrimination, wisdom, calm clarity, forgiveness, truthfulness,sense-control, inner peace, joy, sorrow, birth, death, fear, courage,harmlessness, equanimity, serenity, self-discipline, charity, fame, notoriety:these states, vastly diverse as they are, derive from My one Self: They aremodifications of My one (essential) nature.As, in dreams, the thoughts and emotions expressed are experienced asprojections of the dreamer’s consciousness, so in the cosmic dream all aspectsof it are projections of the Divine Consciousness. The most significantdifference between the divine dream and human dreams is that human dreams may(though they don’t necessarily) reveal something about the person projectingthem, whereas God’s dream reveals nothing of His cosmic nature. God is beyondall qualifications. The potential manifestations of consciousness itself areinfinite in number, and express no attachment or desire on the Creator’s part.(10:6) The seven great rishis, the Primeval Four, and the (fourteen) Manus areall modifications of My nature, born of My (projected) thought, and endowed with(creative) powers like Mine. From these (progenitors) come all the life forms onearth.These “modifications” of God’s nature, though meaningful to people who aresteeped in the ancient lore, possess less significance for the modern mind. Theimportant thing is that God, the Eternal Spirit, does not act directly inproducing His cosmic dream, but creates “executives”: channels of Hisconsciousness, through whom He, in His overarching power and wisdom, manifestsand unfolds all later developments.(10:7) He who realizes the truth of My prolific manifestations, and the creativeand dissolving power of My divine yoga, is unshakably united to Me.(10:8) I am the Source of everything. From Me all creation emerges. Realizingthis great truth, the wise, awe-stricken, adore Me.As opposed to the details that produce the sum total of all knowledge, there isa flow to wisdom which of its own nature rejects a superfluity of detail, thoughcomplete wisdom knows them all. Its primary focus is on the direction ofmovement. What is awe-inspiring about Supreme Truth is not the sheer number ofits manifestations—which are, indeed, beyond numbering—but its cascade ofoverwhelming bliss.(10:9) Their thoughts engrossed in Me, their beings surrendered to Me,enlightening one another and conversing of Me, they are ever contented andfilled with joy.Ordinary human beings, accustomed to the pleasure of conversing together, ofgossiping and retailing the latest news, along with their opinions andreactions, imagine that in God all this fascinating variety will be lost.Krishna in this stanza suggests that such is far from the case. Not only is thebliss of Satchidananda “ever-new,” as Yogananda declared, but those who know itfind, even in conversing together of divine matters, a level of delight whichworldly people never know. People’s sheer need for variety indicates theirbarrenness of heart, which drives them anxiously to seek a few raindrops ofdiversity in hope of somehow slaking their thirst. When two people meet who knowGod, they may not converse much, but the flow of divine love and bliss betweenthem is completely satisfying to them both.(10:10) To those who are attached only to Me, and who worship Me with love, Iimpart that discernment of wisdom by which they attain Me completely.(10:11) Out of pure compassion (that is, out of the selfless gift of love, withno admixture of compulsion), I, the Divine One who dwells in all, set alight intheir (hearts) the blazing lamp of wisdom, which banishes their darkness ofignorance.It is important for the spiritual aspirant to realize that, in seeking God, hedoesn’t earn anything. Divine grace is still a gift of compassion, and may bewithheld from those who follow the law exactly, but who, perhaps out of drynessof heart, fail to win His love. God may, on the other hand, reward with thehighest wisdom those who, in their surrender of perfect devotion, love Himalone.Through the intervention of the Satguru alone do such blessings come.(10:12) Arjuna said (in adoration): O Lord, Thou art the Supreme Spirit, theSupreme Shelter, the Supreme Purity, the One, Self-manifested Being, theCauseless, the Eternal, the Omnipresent!(10:13) Thus do all the sages—the divine seer Narada, Asila, Devala, Byasa, andYou Yourself, Krishna—declare.Those who know God speak the same essential truths regarding Him.Were an architect, a landscape designer, and a civil engineer to go to Londonfrom New Delhi, they might all return with the same basic descriptions of itssize, variety, busyness, climate, etc. They might well in addition, however, addtheir own perceptions of the city in terms of their special interests. Thearchitect might not only speak of the buildings, but might place so muchemphasis on them that his listeners would imagine that London consists ofnothing but noteworthy edifices. The landscape designer, on the other hand,might devote so much time to describing the parks that his listeners wouldenvision London as consisting mostly of parks. And the civil engineer mightelaborate on the roads of London to such an extent that automobile drivers,braving the monsoon-produced potholes of New Delhi, would think of London onlyas a city “blessed not to be cursed” by these public menaces. Yet all would haveseen, and would be describing essentially, the same city.The same may be said of those who know God. Their descriptions of Him are, inessence, one and the same. Yet each may also emphasize a particular aspect ofHis awe-inspiring vastness. Those who hear these reports and think, “I haveheard all this at first hand,” may declare loudly to others, but with partialauthority: “This is what God is.” God, however, is so much more! Arjunatherefore seeks the support of countless authorities to support his declarationof the divine wonders.(10:14) (Arjuna continues:) O Keshava (Krishna)! I consider all that You haverevealed to me to be the eternal truth. Neither gods nor demons (can) know Your(multifarious) manifestations.None of those who are ordinary, though permanent, residents of the astral worldcan know supernal truths that are above all the manifested spheres of existence.How much less so, then, can earth dwellers know those truths in their merelyhuman state! Masters, on whatever plane they live, are omniscient, but thoseearthfolk who hope for full enlightenment from mere angels, or who pay heed toany flattering promises by demonic beings, are destined for disappointment.(10:15) O Supreme Person (Arjuna continues), Origin of beings, Lord of allcreatures, God of gods, Sustainer of the world! verily You alone areSelf-Knowing.(10:16) Please expound fully to me Your perfect powers by which, beingomnipresent, You sustain the universe.(10:17) O Supreme Yogi (Krishna), how shall I meditate on You, to know You asYou are? In what forms and aspects can I most accurately think of You?(10:18) O Janardana (Krishna), tell me at length of Your yoga powers andmanifestations, for I never tire of listening to this nectar-like speech ofYours.(10:19) The Blessed Lord said: O Best of Princes (Arjuna), I shall willinglyrelate to you something of My manifestations—but I’ll relate only those whichare outstanding, for there is no end to My variety.With this stanza there begins a long list of divine manifestations, the neteffect of which is to convince the devotee that, whatever desires he harbors inhis heart, their highest fulfillment lies in God alone, who is the very essenceof all fulfillment. The devotee is encouraged to look behind even his delusionsto see how, in their most exaggerated form, God calls to him, “Wake up!”“Among deceivers,” he says, later, “I am gambling” (10:36). What other purposecould there be for Krishna to announce this “manifestation” to Arjuna? Gambling,a pastime which seizes and all too often ruins many people: What could be a moredeceiving lure to improbable, but ever-possible, riches? God, even in theextremes of delusion, says to mankind, “Can’t you see for yourselves how foolishit all is?”Stanza 20 sets the scene: God is the Hidden Presence at the heart of everything.(10:20) O Gudakesha (Conqueror of Sleep—Arjuna), I am the true Self dwelling inthe heart of all creatures. I am the beginning, the continuation, and end oftheir existence.In addressing Arjuna as the “Conqueror of Sleep,” Krishna implies that thehighest truths can only be known when one has fully wakened from the sleep ofdelusion. Krishna says here that the Lord, in his essential Self, is the soleDreamer: that only in Him does anything exist. This is the answer to thechallenge of those who say, “I have no time for God.” To that all-too-commonobjection Paramhansa Yogananda often answered, “And what if God had no time foryou? You have your very existence in Him alone.”(10:21) Among the Adityas (Vedic gods), I am Vishnu; among luminaries (in thesky), I am the sun; among the wind gods, I am Marichi (the most beneficialwind); among (nocturnal) luminaries, I am the moon.In this passage, and in the subsequent ones in this section, Krishna is sayingthat, whatever man views as most special, that is God.(10:22) Among the Vedas, I am Sama Veda (on account of its musical beauty);among the gods, I am Indra; of sense-perceptions I am Mind (the perceiver); increatures, I am their intelligence.(10:23) Among the Rudras (the intelligent life forces) I am Shankara (theirempowering intelligence); among Yakshas and Rakshasas (astral abstractions ofhuman desire) I am Kubera (the god of wealth); among Vasus (the vitalizingforces) I am Pavaka (Agni, the god of fire); among mountain peaks, I am Meru.Meru, in classical tradition in India, symbolizes the highest spiritualattainment.(10:24) Of priests, O Son of Pritha (Arjuna), know Me to be Brihaspati (guru ofthe gods); among generals, I am Skanda (Kartikeya, the god of war); among bodiesof water, I am the ocean.(10:25) Among great rishis, I am Bhrigu; among words, I am the syllable AUM;among yagyas (sacred rituals) I am japa-yagya (silent, superconscious chanting);among things unmoving, I am the Himalaya.(10:26) Among trees, I am Ashvatta; among the divine seers, I am Narada; amongthe Ghandharvas (gods of music), I am Chitraratha; among perfected beings, I amKapila (the exponent of Shankhya).Later in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna describes the human body as the (true)Ashvatta tree, “with its roots above and its branches below”: the spine, inother words, with the nervous system the “branches,” and the many-rayedsahasrara (the roots) at the top of the head.It need hardly be added that most of the names in this section of the Gitacorrespond to Hindu myths and legends, and have little correspondence to modernknowledge. Many of them are, of course, symbolic, and refer to spiritualteachings that are given more explicitly elsewhere in this scripture. In thisportion of Chapter 10 they are offered more for information than for instructionor inspiration. The essential significance Krishna gives them is that whateveris brightest, best, strongest, most glorious, or most intelligent is theclearest manifestation of God—not so much in the sense that the highest wave ismore His manifestation than the lowest, but in the sense, rather, that whentamas and restless rajas least obscure a divine quality, the result is like athinning cloud-cover which veils the moon, and renders it more visible. Themetaphor of a rising wave may indicate egoic tension, but God is especiallyevident wherever His effulgence shines forth most naturally in this world.(10:27) Among horses, I am the nectar-born Ucchaisravas; among elephants, I am(Indra’s white elephant) Airavata; among men, I am the monarch.“Horse,” it may be mentioned in passing, symbolizes power: specifically, itrefers to that power which carries energy, whether downward or upward. Ucchaismeans, “upward.”(10:28) Among weapons, I am the thunderbolt; among cows, I am Kamadhuk (thefulfiller of desires); in sexual desire, I am procreation; among serpents, I amVasuki.(10:29) Among the Naga serpents, I am Ananta (endless); among water beings, I amVaruna; among departed ancestors, I am Aryama; among those who maintain law andorder, I am Yama.(10:30) Among the Daityas, I am Prahlad; among measurers, I am Time; amonganimals, I am their king (the lion); among birds, I am Garuda (“lord of theskies”; in classical symbology, the vehicle of Vishnu).(10:31) Among purifiers, I am the wind; among wielders of weapons, I am Rama;among aquatic creatures, I am Makara (vehicle of the ocean god); among rivers, Iam Jahnavi (the Ganges, holiest of rivers).(10:32) Among all manifestations, O Arjuna, I am their beginning, middle, andend; among the various branches of knowledge, I am the wisdom of the Self; amongdebates, I am the clearest reasoning.(10:33) Among all letters, I am the first in the alphabet; among compounds, I amthe connecter; in time, I am the immutable; in creation, I am the Omnipresent,and ever turn My face in all directions.(10:34) I am all-dissolving Death; I am Birth; I am the origin of things yet tobe; among feminine manifestations (the qualities of Prakriti, or Mother Nature),I am fame, success, the illuminating power of speech, memory, intuitivediscrimination, firmness in loyalty, and patience.(10:35) Among hymns, I am Brihat-Saman; among poetic meters, I am Gayatri; amongmonths, I am Margashirsha (the auspicious winter month); among seasons, I amKusumakara, the flower-bringer (spring).(10:36) Among deceivers, I am gambling; of the glorious, I am glory; for thosewho strive to win, I am victory; among the good, I am Sattwa (the elevatingquality).(10:37) Among Vrishnis, I am Vasudeva (Krishna); among the Pandavas, I am(yourself) Dhananjaya (Arjuna); among the munis (saints), I am Byasa; amongsages, I am Ushanas.(10:38) I am the rod of discipline; I am the skill of the victorious; I am thesilence of hidden things; among knowers, I am wisdom.(10:39) Whatsoever constitutes the reproductive seed of all beings, that am I.There is nothing, O Arjuna, moving or unmoving, that exists apart from Me.(10:40) O Scorcher of Foes (Arjuna), the manifestations of My divine attributesare without limit; this brief declaration of them merely hints at them.(10:41) Whatever being is endowed with power, prosperity, or glory, know thatendowment itself to be only a spark of My effulgence.(10:42) What need have you, however, O Arjuna, for these manifold details? Knowthis only: I, the Unchanging and Everlasting, permeate and sustain the entirecosmos with but a fragment of My essential being.Thus ends the tenth chapter, called “From the Unmanifested to the Manifested,”of the Upanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishnaand Arjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter Twenty-FourTHE DIVINE VISION(11:1) Arjuna said: In Your compassion You have revealed to me the secret wisdomof the Self, and have thereby banished my delusion.(11:2) O Lotus-eyed (Krishna)! You have spoken extensively of the beginning andend of all beings, and of Your eternal sovereignty.(11:3) O Great One! You have declared Yourself to me; I accept as trueeverything You have said. And yet, O Purushottama! I long to behold You formyself, in Your infinite form.(11:4) O Master, Lord of Yogis! If You deem me fit, reveal to me Your InfiniteSelf!The Indian scriptures contain over a thousand names for God, each with adifferent nuance of meaning to suggest in human terms one aspect of the infinityof truth. Purushottama, in this third verse, is an appellation for God in Hishighest, unmanifested aspect.(11:5) The Blessed Lord said: Behold, O Son of Pritha (Arjuna)! by hundreds andby thousands My divine forms: multicolored, multifarious!(11:6) Behold the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the twin Aswins, the Maruts,and many wonders hitherto unknown!(11:7) Here and now, O Gudakesha (Conqueror of Sleep, Arjuna)! behold unified inMy Cosmic Body all the worlds, all that moves or is unmoving and all, besides,that you desire to behold.(11:8) You cannot grasp my vision with mortal eyes, however. Now, therefore, Igive you divine sight. Behold My supreme yoga power!(11:9) (To Dhritarashtra) Sanjaya said: With these words Hari (Krishna), theexalted Lord of yoga, revealed to Arjuna his Supreme, Divine form.(11:10,11) Arjuna saw the Supreme Deity, infinite in variety, omnidirectional inradiance, all-pervading—as if adorned on all sides with celestial robes,garlands, and ornaments; the divine weapons (celestial powers) upraised (asthough ready for use); fragrant with exquisite essences, and with faces and eyesseemingly everywhere!(11:12) Were a thousands suns to appear together in the sky, their brilliancecould suggest but dimly the splendor of that exalted Being.(11:13) There (in that vision) did Arjuna behold the vast universe with itsendless divisions, all united as one, within the form of the God of gods.(11:14) Then Dhananjaya (Arjuna), wonder-struck, the follicles of hair on hisarms rising in awe, prayerfully joined his palms together and, bowing his headto the Lord, exclaimed, marveling:(11:15–31)Most wonderful Lord, adored of gods!Within Thy cosmic form I beholdthe vast universe of beings,saints and sages divinesequestered in remote caves,their serpent nature (Kundalini),formerly virulent, now tamed,raised by love on the rod of awakening.Lord Brahma, God of gods,seated on the head of each sage,his seat the shining lotus of a thousand rays!O Cosmic-bodied Lord of all worlds,I behold Thee everywhere, and in everything!Innumerable bodies, faces, eyes reveal Thy energy!Inscrutable to me are Your origins,Your reigns, Your endings.O Blazing Effulgence!

What is Thy cosmic will?What is Thy purpose?To what end has all this been done?(11:32–34) The Blessed Lord said:I am Kala: I am Time.Disguised as Endless Doom I come.I seize; I obliterate.Even were you not to fight,these foes you gaze upon at Kurukshetrawould perish, Arjuna, slain by My mighty will.Indeed, I slew them long ago:You are but My instrument.Your destiny is to carry out My will.I need you not: It is you, Arjuna,who have need of Me!I know the past, present, and future of all men.Make war for Me, if you would embraceeternal life, and victory, and bliss!(11:35) Sanjaya said: Thus hearing, Arjuna, with folded hands, trembling in awe,prostrated before Krishna and spoke these words:(11:36) O Krishna, rightly does the world rejoice in Thy glory! The demons,terrified, in vain seek refuge from Thy wrath. And the multitudes of perfectedbeings bow in the surrender of true worship.(11:37) Ah! how could they not pay Thee homage, Thou more-than-exalted Lord?Greater art Thou than Brahma, who created all!

Thou art the Supreme Goal. By Theeis the universe pervaded, O Thou of infinite form!(11:39) Thou art Vayu (the wind). Thou art Yama (the destroyer, and god ofdeath). Thou art Agni (god of fire). Thou art Varuna (the sea god). Thou artSasanka (the moon), and Prajapati (the grandsire of all). Hail, all hail to Theea thousand times! Hail, and hail to Thee again, and yet again!(11:40) Hail to Thee in front, behind, and everywhere. Boundless in power andimmeasurable in might, Thou art in all, and therefore Thou art all!(11:41) For whatever disrespect I may have shown Thee in jest, addressing Theeas “Friend,” “Companion,” “Krishna,” “Yadava” (Krishna’s family relationship toArjuna), speaking carelessly, though with affection—(11:42) and for any irreverence I may have shown Thee lightheartedly, OUnshakable Lord! while eating, resting, walking, when we sat together byourselves, or in the company of others: for all such unintended slights—ah!never intended!—O Illimitable Lord, I beg Your forgiveness.(11:43) Father of all beings, Thou: of animate and inanimate alike. None isworthy of worship but Thee, O Guru Sublime! Unequaled by anyone in the threeworlds, who can surpass Thee, O Lord of Incomparable Power?(11:44) Therefore, O Thou Infinitely Adorable! I cast myself abjectly at Thyfeet, imploring Thy pardon. As a father to his son, as a friend to a dearfriend, as a lover to his beloved, do Thou, beloved Lord, forgive me!(11:45) Overjoyed I am by this cosmic vision, never before beheld. Yet, Iconfess, my mind is not free from terror. Be merciful to me, O Lord of gods andShelter of the worlds! Show me Thyself once again in Thy (limited, human) form.And so came to an end the mighty Vision of visions. I have—craving the reader’sindulgence and forgiveness—offered here a very free paraphrase, considering itmore important to convey the feeling of awe and majesty than to preserve theexact words of the original—even those, indeed, of my Guru’s translation. Manybooks contain literal translations. I have long felt a need existed forsomething more poetic, stated in contemporary language.Paramhansa Yogananda wrote a great mystical poem, “Samadhi,” conveying his ownexperience of this supernal vision. It seems fitting here for that poem to bequoted also:Vanished the veils of light and shade,Lifted every vapor of sorrow,Sailed away all dawns of fleeting joy,Gone the dim sensory mirage.Love, hate, health, disease, life, death,Perished these false shadows on the screen of duality.Waves of laughter, scyllas of sarcasm, melancholic whirlpools,Melting in the vast sea of bliss.The storm of maya stilledBy magic wand of intuition deep.The universe, forgotten dream, subconsciously lurks,Ready to invade my newly-wakened memory divine.I live without the cosmic shadow,But it is not, bereft of me;As the sea exists without the waves,But they breathe not without the sea.Dreams, wakings, states of deep turia, sleep,Present, past, future, no more for me,But ever-present, all-flowing I, I, everywhere.Planets, stars, stardust, earth,Volcanic bursts of doomsday cataclysms,Creation’s molding furnace,Glaciers of silent x-rays, burning electron floods,Thoughts of all men, past, present, to come,Every blade of grass, myself, mankind,Each particle of universal dust,Anger, greed, good, bad, salvation, lust,I swallowed, transmuted allInto a vast ocean of blood of my own one Being!Smoldering joy, oft-puffed by meditationBlinding my tearful eyes,Burst into immortal flames of bliss,Consumed my tears, my frame, my all.Thou art I, I am Thou,Knowing, Knower, Known, as One!Tranquilled, unbroken thrill, eternally living, ever-new peace!Enjoyable beyond imagination of expectancy, samadhi bliss!Not an unconscious stateOr mental chloroform without wilful return,Samadhi but extends my conscious realmBeyond limits of the mortal frameTo farthest boundary of eternityWhere I, the Cosmic Sea,Watch the little ego floating in Me.The sparrow, each grain of sand, fall not without My sight.All space floats like an iceberg in My mental sea.Colossal Container, I, of all things made.By deeper, longer, thirsty, guru-given meditationComes this celestial samadhi.Mobile murmurs of atoms are heard,The dark earth, mountains, vales, lo! molten liquid!Flowing seas change into vapors of nebulae!Aum blows upon vapors, opening wondrously their veils,Oceans stand revealed, shining electrons,Till, at last sound of the cosmic drum,Vanish the grosser lights into eternal raysOf all-pervading bliss.From joy I came, for joy I live, in sacred joy I melt.Ocean of mind, I drink all creation’s waves.Four veils of solid, liquid, vapor, light,Lift aright.Myself, in everything, enters the Great Myself.Gone forever, fitful, flickering shadows of mortal memory.Spotless is my mental sky, below, ahead, and high above.Eternity and I, one united ray.A tiny bubble of laughter, IAm become the Sea of Mirth Itself.Arjuna, overwhelmed with the majesty of what he has just beheld, asked Krishna(above) to reveal himself again in a more human form—as beloved Teacher, Friend,and Guide. Here Arjuna repeats that request, somewhat more surprisingly (tomodern minds)—asking Krishna to appear not as a man, but (probably to satisfytraditional tastes)—as Vishnu.(11:46) I long to see Thee (O Krishna!) in the form that is familiar to most: asfour-armed Vishnu, diademed, his mace and discus held aloft. O Lord of athousand arms, for the reassurance of many, appear to me now in that knownshape.(11:47) The Blessed Lord said: By My grace, exercising My yoga power, I haverevealed to you—as to none other—this Supreme form of Mine: radiant, infinite!(11:48) No mortal man—save thee alone, great hero of the Kuru dynasty!—haslooked upon My universal form: Not by sacrifices, nor by gifts in charity, norby noble works, nor by pious study of the Vedas can that vision be attained.(11:49) Be not fearful, nor bewildered by this vision of the wholly impersonalaspect of My being. Take comfort; be glad at heart, and behold Me in this, My(humanly speaking) reassuring aspect.(11:50) Sanjaya said: Having thus addressed Arjuna, Vasudeva (Krishna) appearedonce again to his disciple, comfortingly, in his own (human) form.(11:51) Arjuna said: O Granter of all Boons (Krishna)! Viewing You once again inthe human form I love, my mind is pacified and I feel I am once more myself.(11:52) The Blessed Lord said: Very difficult is it to behold, as you have done,the vision of the divine universe. Even the gods yearn to see it.(11:53,54) Its revelation, however, is not attained by penances or byfaithfulness to scripture or by charities or by formal worship. O Scorcher ofFoes (Arjuna)! only by single-hearted devotion, achieved through deep yogapractice, is it possible to behold Me, and to become one with Me, as you havedone, in My cosmic form.(11:55) He who serves Me alone, who makes Me his only goal, who lovinglysurrenders every thought of “I” to Me, who releases all attachment to aughtelse, and who (beholding Me in all) bears no ill will toward anyone—he, OArjuna!, enters My vast being.Thus ends the eleventh chapter, called “The Divine Vision,” of the Upanishad ofthe holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjunadiscussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter Twenty-FiveTHE PATH OF BHAKTI YOGA(12:1) Arjuna said: Between those who worship You with steadfast devotion, andthose who concentrate on the Absolute, which is better versed in the yogascience?(12:2) The Blessed Lord answered: Those who, with minds fixed on Me, are everunited to Me in pure devotion, are in My eyes the best versed in yoga.(12:3,4) Those, however, who aspire to the Indestructible, the Indescribable,the Unmanifested, the All-Pervading, the Incomprehensible, the Immutable aboveall vibration, who have subjugated the senses, are even-minded, and devotethemselves to the well-being of all—verily, they, too, attain Me.It should be noted here that Krishna is not saying that devotional love ishigher than yoga (union) with the Absolute. He is, as always, being practical.Most human beings are accustomed to seeing themselves as individuals, living inego-consciousness. They cannot simply banish that self-awareness and worship anabstraction: the Unmanifested Spirit. They must begin realistically where theyare now on the spiritual path. Dwelling in bodies, it is very much easier forthem to worship God in an I-and-Thou relationship, and even to visualize Him aspossessing a form: as Vishnu, Shiva, as forms of the Divine Mother, as Krishna,or as Jesus Christ. People can visualize love in a human form: It is difficultfor them to visualize it as an abstraction. As my Guru once put it, “How can thelittle cup hold the whole ocean?” They need to expand their consciousness bydegrees. Yoga is the “down-to-earth” spiritual science which lifts people fromthe ground with which they are familiar into the vast, unknown skies of Spirit.(12:5) Those who make the Unmanifested their primary goal make the path moredifficult for themselves. Arduous is that path for embodied beings.It should be added, for those of intellectual and philosophical temperament,that heartfelt devotion, even to abstract truths, is an absolute necessity.Without love—which must be childlike, innocent, and pure, and not somebrow-furrowing, carefully formulated theological attempt at exactdefinitions—one cannot set one foot before the other on the path. He lacks thenecessary urgency of desire to reach the goal.It should be added, for those lovers of God who find it offensive to practicetechniques (which to them may seem mere mechanisms that intrude on the flow ofdevotion), that undisciplined inspiration has always been the mark of theamateur and dilettante. No art is needed to feel inspiration, but to expressthat inspiration requires self-discipline and focused energy. These come only asa result of serious training and much effort. The true artist is never one who,feeling uplifted by what he sees, makes wild brush marks on his canvas that canhave meaning for no one but himself.(12:6,7) For those who venerate Me only, offering to Me all their actions, theirminds concentrated on Me by yoga practice, and their hearts’ feelings upliftedto Me in devotion: Such devotees I rescue from the ocean of mortality.(12:8) Immerse your consciousness in Me alone; direct all your discriminationtoward finding Me: Beyond any doubt, then, you shall come to Me.(12:9) O Dhananjaya (Arjuna), if you cannot absorb your thoughts in thecontemplation of Me, then practice the techniques of yoga, intended to helpdevelop concentration.(12:10) If, however, you find yoga practice too difficult, then perform everyaction in the thought of Me. By this means, too, shall you achieve finalsuccess.(12:11) But if even, while active, you cannot think of Me, then give Me yourintentions. Ever striving to discipline your mind, offer to Me the fruits ofyour every labor.Sir Edwin Arnold puts it beautifully in his much-loved paraphrase (deservedlyso), The Song Celestial. His translation of this passage is, “But, if in thisthy faint heart fails, bring Me thy failure!”As Yogananda, earlier, gave the counsel to give God even one’s mistakes, so hewould give the counsel to give one’s failures to God. It is the intention thatcounts. Every thought that is uplifted to the Lord becomes in time purified andstrengthened. No amount of restlessness can define anyone as he is at thepresent.Regarding attunement with the guru, also, Paramhansa Yogananda said, “If youshut me out, how can I come in?” The glass that is turned upside down cannotreceive drink. The first step toward receiving divine blessings is to holdoneself in readiness for the moment when those blessings are poured. Indeed, theblessings are there, ever waiting, for vessels of consciousness that are“upturned” to receive them.(12:12) Perseverance in pursuing Self-knowledge, and (sincere) aspiration to(experience) it through meditation, is better than the possession of theoreticalknowledge. Offering up to Me the fruits of action, moreover, is better thanone-sided but restless meditation. Action, coupled with renunciation of thefruits of action, brings inner peace, which makes it possible to meditatedeeply.This passage is often translated to suggest that the “easier” path of devotionis more suitable for bhaktas than meditation, who tend rather to sing and chantdevotionally, to an accompaniment of drums and cymbals. At no time in the Gitahas Krishna recommended outward practices as preferable to silent, innercommunion. What he offers in this stanza is encouragement to those who cannotyet take their devotion within. Devotion is always paramount. When it is offeredonly outwardly, however, there can be no question of merging in the actualexperience of God’s love. It is like being at a banquet: The one who eats best,and with the most enjoyment, is he who eats in silence, not he who keeps onloudly and repeatedly exclaiming how delicious the food is!Prayer and chanting may be described as either talking or singing to God;meditation means listening for His answer. Could the Lord possibly be pleasedwith someone who doesn’t want to hear His reply? And could He possibly be evenmore pleased with such noisy, self-centered devotees? Absurd!(12:13,14) He who bears no ill will toward anyone; who is kind and friendly toall; who has no consciousness of “I” and “mine”; who is even-minded during painand pleasure, forgiving toward all, inwardly contented, steadfast in his (yoga)meditation practices, and self-controlled; who tries faithfully (through yogapractice) to unite his soul to Me; who is firm in determination, and whose mindand discrimination are surrendered to Me: such a one is dear to Me.(12:15) One who doesn’t disturb others, and is not disturbed in return, whonever exults in anything, is never jealous, fearful, or worried—such a one isdear to Me.(12:16) One who is free from worldly expectations; pure-minded; prompt inaction; unconcerned and unafflicted by circumstances; who is withoutego-motivation: he, My (true) devotee, is dear to Me.It should be specified here once again that to be without ego-motivation is notthe same thing as to view the world with bland indifference. Indifference,unless it is accompanied by inner freedom and joy, can be tamasic. Sometimespeople pride themselves on “being above it all,” when in fact they areapathetic. The true yogi is at all times intensely aware. He is interested,also, not in the sense that he is emotionally involved, but in the sense that hegives energy, rather than waiting to receive it.(12:17) He who neither rejoices in good fortune nor grieves when things gowrong; who judges matters as neither good nor evil; who is devoted only to Me:such a one is dear to Me.(12:18,19) He who treats friend and foe alike; who is even-minded whether(receiving) honor or dishonor; who calmly, without attachment, accepts warm andcold, pleasure and pain; who is the same under praise or censure; who isinwardly tranquil and contented; who is attached to no abode and is ever calmand devout: such a one is dear to Me.(12:20) But those who, filled with devotion, pursue the deathless dharma I havedescribed, ever engrossed in Me, are above all dear to Me.Thus ends the twelfth chapter, called “The Path of Bhakti Yoga,” of theUpanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna andArjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter Twenty-SixTHE FIELD OF BATTLEPreamble:Arjuna said: O Keshava (Krishna), I long to know the (mystery) of Prakriti andPurusha (Intelligent Mother Nature and transcendent God, the Father); of kshetra(the body) and kshetragya (the inner perceiver); of knowledge and its object(that which is known).The above stanza is usually unnumbered, with a view to keeping the number ofstanzas in the Gita to exactly 700.Arjuna, after hearing Krishna’s discourse on divine union through devotion,wants to know more about the eternal struggle (the war of Kurukshetra) betweengood and evil in the self and in the cosmos. One cannot help wondering, giventhe sequence of these two chapters, whether he is not (on behalf of all seekers)asking Krishna these deep questions to help clarify for the reader the fact thatthe relatively easy path (at least, so it appears) of devotion must be pairedwith the deep, extremely practical teachings Krishna has been giving him. TheGita begins with Arjuna showing himself reluctant to fight at all. The reader’sneed, now, is to be shown that bhakti (devotion) does not render that fightunnecessary after all. Only at the end of the Bhagavad Gita does Krishna, in theproper context and at the right time, explain divine love in such a way as tocontrast it properly with all other considerations of the spiritual path. Peoplemight otherwise seek a shortcut, through devotion, and end up becomingsuperficial in their spiritual search.(13:1) The Blessed Lord replied: O Son of Kunti (Arjuna), those who know truthperceive this (human) body as kshetra (the “field” where good and evil karma arereaped), and the knower of the field (the soul) as kshetragya.There are two forces at work in the body: the outward- (and downward-) flowingenergy, and the inward- (and upward-) flowing. Although the scene of theBhagavad Gita is set on an actual, historic battlefield, the setting, as thisstanza makes very clear, is primarily allegorical. The body, and not the outerfield of Kurukshetra (which still exists geographically in northern India), iswhat is really intended by the field of battle. The “knower of the field”(kshetragya) is the indwelling soul, which, like Krishna on the legendarybattlefield, takes no active part in the war. The soul observes, but remainsinactive. It is not the soul that incarnates and dies with the body.Paramhansa Yogananda defined ego as “the soul attached to the body.” Thebody—actually, the bodies: physical, astral, and causal, the first two of whichare subject to birth and death—may be described even on the physical level asonly ideas of the soul. All three bodies are unreal in eternity, and endure onlyas long as the idea of them is kept alive by desires. That idea is fueled in theastral and physical bodies by the concept of individuality. Ego-consciousnessis, indeed, an “element” of the astral body.The human intellect, presented with the problem of the knower and the known(kshetragya and kshetra) says, “To know something is, in fact, to differentiatethree distinct things: the knower, the thing known, and the act of knowing.” Solong as the act of knowing (that is to say, of perceiving) is directed outward,the energy in the body will flow outward also, through the senses, and man willbe sucked into a downward vortex, as it were, from which escape will becomeincreasingly difficult.The true war of Kurukshetra is the struggle between aspiration, which causes theenergy in the body to flow upward, and the pull toward lower awareness whichbrings man’s expectation of fulfillment outward to the senses. The mere thingshe hopes to enjoy are themselves inanimate, and can never satisfy him in any wayexcept in his reactions to them.What defines the downward direction as evil is that, in its outwardness from theinner source, it disappoints what everyone in samsara (maya) really wants:ego-fulfillment, emotional happiness, and the enjoyment of life through thesenses. It takes man also in the direction opposite to what he ultimately wants:divine bliss. Were it possible for human nature truly to be fulfilled outwardly,as mankind mistakenly believes, what person in good conscience could consider itevil to seek such fulfillment? Society might be outraged by actions it considerscontrary to custom, but what others want of one is not really their business!Everyone has his own life to lead. What makes certain behavior wrong—and indeed,sometimes, evil—is the fact that desire deceives people into behaving againsttheir own higher interests.Habit and desire separate us from soul-awareness. Added to that initialseparation is the fierce hold the ego exerts on our awareness. The host ofnegative qualities that develop from ego-consciousness—pride, for example, andguilt, and a fancied need for self-justification—though integral to people’sdance with delusion, bring false satisfactions which, in the end, causesuffering. These qualities wrap themselves around the ego, binding us quite astightly as Gulliver was bound by the many threadlike “ropes” that tied him downwhen he was shipwrecked, and stretched unconscious on the sands of Lilliput.Because the memory of the soul is never lost, man begins slowly to tire ofever-disappointing dreams, and longs to dispel them. The process of wakening iswhat man terms good, since it draws his energy and consciousness up the spineagain, and, as it brings him back to himself, brings him also greater happinessand, eventually, the state of oneness with Spirit.Rising energy and consciousness in the spine eventually bring perfect inner andouter unity. Knowing, knower, and known become one. Devotion rises in responseto the magnetism of divine love. Material desire, by contrast, pulls people downin response to the magnetism of the downward-moving Kundalini, which manifestsin the body as the outward pull of maya—called Satan in some religions.In this chapter Krishna details the cosmic verities, both inner and outer, bywhich Spirit created the universe, and the soul of man which is caught in thatcreative vortex. When the soul ultimately escapes the vortex, it reclaims itsnatural oneness with the Spirit.(13:2) Know Me also, O Bharata (Arjuna), as the silent Knower (Perceiver) in allkshetras (bodies evolved out of the cosmic creative principle and Nature). Iconsider true wisdom to be the understanding of kshetra, the field, and of itsrelation to kshetragya, the perceiver of the field.A young man named Naresh met a saint. The saint asked him who he was, and theyouth answered, “I am Naresh.”“Who are you?” asked the saint again.Naresh, thinking perhaps the saint hadn’t heard him, said, “My name is Naresh.”“Yes, but who are you?”Naresh, puzzled, replied, “My father’s name is Ram Dutta. I live in Delhi. I’man accountant.”“Yes, but who are you?” persisted the saint.The young man puzzled over this question. Was the saint hard of hearing? Or washe, perhaps, growing old and a bit senile?“Well, if you don’t know,” said the saint with a smile, “maybe it’s good youcame to me.”By now the young man was thoroughly bewildered! Still, he felt a certain peacein the saint’s presence, and returned to him many times—he didn’t really knowwhy. Gradually, however, he came to think, “Can I really define myself in such alimited way as to say that I’m an accountant?” He began to think, “I’m not whatI do. I’m a young man with many interests, including that of visiting thissaint—though I do so for reasons I don’t fully understand.”“Who are you?” the saint asked him again one day. By now the older man seemed tothe younger not only perfectly normal, but even wise.“I don’t know who I really am,” said Naresh.“That’s better!” exclaimed the saint. “Now then, think about it again. Who areyou?”Well, thought the young man. I have a name, a family, a domicile. But am Ireally any of those things? Suddenly it dawned on him: “I’m a soul in search ofitself!” His body was still young, but he knew it would age in time. Even now hewas the same person inside that he’d been as a little child. The body hadchanged, but he had not. Therefore, he realized, he was not the body.He introspected further. His understanding had changed since he’d met the saint,but he was still the same person, inside. His personality had changed, butsomething in his consciousness had remained the same. Slowly he came to realizethat he, himself, was a point of inner perception from which he merely observedthese changes, but didn’t define himself in terms of any of them.That which changes, he realized, cannot be what I am. I am that something withinthat remains unchanged—that simply observes change. Thus, he came to identifyhimself more and more with his soul.One day he said to the guru, “I know who I am, but there are no words with whichto speak of it.” The saint, hearing those words, only smiled. Later on, thesaint said, “Now that words fail you, there is much that we can communicate!”Wisdom begins with the knowledge that we are not this body or personality. Weare the immortal soul.(13:3,4) Hear now briefly about the field, its attributes, its cause-and-effectprinciple, and its distorting influences; also what He (the kshetragya) is, andthe nature of His powers—truths which have been sung by sages in many ways: inchants of the Vedas and in well-reasoned, conclusive aphorisms of theBrahmasutra.Krishna states that he is expounding truths already declared in the scriptures.(13:5,6) Succinctly stated (quoting scripture), the kshetras are composed of(both) undifferentiated and differentiated Nature, their differentiated naturebeing the gross “elements” (earth, water, fire, air, ether), the ten senses (thefive organs of knowledge: the ears, skin, eyes, nose, and tongue; and the five“objects” of sense—hearing, feeling, sight, smell, and taste), and the fiveorgans of action (the hands, feet, mouth, anus, and generative organ); the onesense-conscious mind, intellect, ego-consciousness, the distortions of chitta(attraction/aversion, pleasure/pain), the body itself, consciousness, andpersistence.These principles have their cosmic, undifferentiated aspect as well as theirdifferentiated, individual aspects. God’s creation itself is a conscious entity,self-aware (though not egoically so, since ego—the soul identified with thebody—becomes an “element” only with the astral body). As Swami Sri Yukteswarstated in the chapter on his resurrection in Autobiography of a Yogi, causalbeings have vast powers, which enable them even to create universes or“galaxies.”Krishna himself offers these extraordinarily intricate details as a quotationfrom the Shankhya scriptures. His intent is to lead Arjuna, the universaldevotee, from the consciousness of complexity to the simplicity ofnon-identification with any of them, and therefore to non-identity with thethought of the ego as having supreme control over anything.Persistence, or fortitude (dhriti), is manifested physically first of all byholding the body and consciousness together. The body is an aggregate of thetwenty-four “elements” of creation (expounded in the Shankhya system of India),combined with the aspects of consciousness arising from them. On this “field ofbattle” the war constantly rages between passion, desire, attachment, and otherhuman delusions (on the one side) and (on the other) their opposite aspirations:devotion, non-attachment, and all the virtues. The goal of yoga practice is toresolve this complexity in the simple, all-unifying awareness of changelesssoul-consciousness.(13:7) The true insight bestowed by wisdom is revealed in the followingqualities: humility; unpretentiousness; harmlessness; forgiveness; integrity;service to the guru; purity (of mind and body); steadfastness; self-control;—(13:8) indifference to sense-objects; lack of emphasis on one’s own self;perception of the sufferings and evils inherent in birth, illness, old age, anddeath;—(13:9) non-attachment; non-identification of the ego with one’s own children,wife, and home (and with everything that these entail); equal acceptance of bothfortune and misfortune;—(13:10) unswerving devotion to and identity with Me, through yoga practice; loveof solitude; disinclination for worldly society;—(13:11) perseverance in the pursuit of Self-knowledge; aspiration toward truewisdom, which is the goal of all learning. Qualities opposite to these virtuesare the signs of ignorance.The above-listed qualities speak for themselves. They are the marks of one whois intent on absorbing his little self in the Self of all. Whatever duties hehas on earth—the examples listed here are duties to one’s children, wife, andhome—must be fulfilled without ego-identification. The yogi must perceive God asequally present in all. Living in this world, he must constantly remind himselfthat birth, life, and death are passing phenomena, and are fraught withsuffering and pain—paired, inevitably, with earth’s pleasures and fulfillments.He should not, therefore, identify himself with anything outward.Whenever possible, he should seek seclusion—for one or two weeks a year, or forlonger periods—to immerse himself in the thought of God. He should not dislikeworldly company, since to dislike anything is to create a disturbance in hischitta, or feeling. He may not always find it convenient to avoid such society,but he should be conscious of, and accept as the right attitude for a devotee,an inner disinclination for it. Thus, if he must sometimes attend worldlygatherings, he should relate to people from a firm center of calmness withinhimself.Intellectual knowledge for its own sake is not a worthy pursuit for anyone whoseeks wisdom. Knowledge is the possession of a mere catalogue of facts: Wisdomis the understanding of how to use facts in the quest for enlightenment in theSelf.(13:12) I will now tell you what knowledge one should pursue: true knowledge,which bestows immortality. Hear (what I have to say) about the Supreme,Beginningless Brahman: He who cannot be said either to exist or not to exist(since existence im-plies a coming into being).(13:13) He dwells, however, omnipresent in the universe, pervading all: heads,eyes, ears, faces everywhere;—(13:14) shining in all the sense faculties, yet transcending them; the mainstayof everything, yet attached to nothing; above the (three) gunas (qualities), yetexperiencing (everything) through them;—(13:15) within and without all that exists, both animate and inanimate; the“nearest of the near,” yet so subtle as to be imperceptible;—(13:16) He, the indivisible One, appears divided into countlessbeings—maintaining, then destroying their forms, then manifesting them anew;—(13:17) the Light of lights He is, beyond all darkness; all knowledge, (whether)knowable or aspired to: He is (forever) seated in the hearts of all.(13:18) I have briefly described here the field (kshetra); the nature of wisdom,and the object of wisdom. Possessed of this insight, My devotee enters into Me.It is amazing to contemplate the infinity of truth—all of it united by the oneconsciousness of God. The sum of all these facts listed by Krishna is theoverarching realization that God is not only in everything, but is everything.Nothing could have come into existence without having been dreamed into being byHim.Yet the second amazing point to contemplate is that even the universe, in allits vastness, is not directly the product of His will. He is removed afar fromeverything, vibrationless, immutable, untouched. He conveys His power, love, andwisdom to universal, conscious forces (manifested by Him) who produce theuniverse we know.(13:19) Know that both Purusha and Prakriti are without a beginning. Know alsothat all the modifications and qualities (gunas) of Nature are born of Prakriti.Purusha and Prakriti—Spirit and Nature: Paramhansa Yogananda described them asdancing together in an eternal divine play, or lila. The Lord Transcendent (thekshetragya, or observer) and Prakriti (Mother Nature): These two are notseparate, but are one essential Reality. As the ocean is ever the same whetherwith or without its waves, so the ocean of Spirit, whether with or without thewaves of cosmic manifestation, is ever one and the same.Prakriti might be described as the storm which produces the waves. She is theproduct of Spirit’s “desireless desire” to manifest His bliss outwardly: to“enjoy Himself through many,” as the scriptures put it. The storm produces thethree gunas, or qualities, which are degrees of manifestation. Sattwa is like alow wave, closest to its Source in the ocean; it most clearly reveals the truthof its being. Rajas is the agitation which begins to manifest itself in a gale,rather than in a light breeze. The higher the wave, the farther it is removedfrom its Source. Thus, its height distorts the truth more completely. Tamas,finally, is the result of extreme violence in the shape of a storm, whichproduces towering wave crests. The crests seem to obliterate any sense ofoneness as they disintegrate into innumerable bubbles. Being farthest from theOcean Source, they also give no hint of the ocean’s calm depth and majesty, butrather conceal every suggestion of vastness.It should be emphasized that “closest, more removed, and farthest” are figuresof speech, merely, and not literal facts, since God, or Prakriti, is equallypresent everywhere. Thus, this image must be offset by another: Sattwa gunacasts only a thin veil over Eternal Reality. Rajoguna may be described, in thissecond image, as casting a blanket over that Reality, rather than a flimsy veil.And tamoguna, finally, may be described as enclosing that reality in concrete,seeming to separate it from God and from all godly qualities altogether. Asviolence often ends in exhaustion, so the quality of tamas also sinks the mindinto utter dullness, despair, and hopelessness.Satan—a common theme in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam especially—is not, andcould not be, such a separate or different reality from the Divine Lord of theUniverse. Satan is a manifestation of the outward-moving force of maya—away fromSpirit, and toward creation. It should be clearly understood, however—we madethis point earlier also—that Satan is a conscious force and will, anever-further manifestation of consciousness into matter. Thus, Satanis—determinedly so—the source of all disharmony and discord. He is “at thebottom of” every disease or distortion of what might otherwise have been arelatively carefree existence on earth. Plagues, illnesses, poisonous andotherwise noxious insects, the intrusion of ugliness with the deliberate purposeof disturbing whatever is beautiful and uplifting: These things are not theproducts of higher entities, but of that force which wills disharmony on earth.In the higher astral spheres, such nuisances do not exist. In material worldswhere sattwa guna predominates, those nuisances either do not exist or are not aproblem. On the other hand, in worlds and in whole galaxies that are moretamasic than our own, these “nuisances” enormously exacerbate the generalmisery. This subject will be treated at greater length later on, but for now itis important to clarify the fact that Nature, in her aspect of Cosmic Mother, isnot responsible for human suffering. It is Prakriti in her outward-manifestingaspect, as Aparaprakriti, that—from a relativistic, human viewpoint—is sofrightening.Modern science has prepared people for a less deistic, but at the same time morefundamentally spiritual, outlook on reality. It is necessarily—considering whatis known now of the vastness of the universe—a much more impersonal view thanman held in the past. No longer can people view themselves so confidently asbeing watched over by an ever-benevolent, fatherly God who concerns Himselfintimately with human affairs—a loving Personage who wants everyone to succeedin his life ambitions and to be humanly happy; one who really hopes that Joewill make up with Mary, and that Bob will get that diploma for which he and hisparents have been praying so earnestly.Some people in the past have viewed God, alternatively, as a God of wrath andjealousy—again, very personal in His concern for the human scene, but angryenough with sinners to condemn them to eternal hell—even though (this has to besaid) He gives people every incentive they need to sin, and sin exuberantly!These incentives are often overwhelming. Does man alone deserve the whole blame?God is impersonal. He is willing to let people suffer if they ignore Him, orturn against Him, or betray an erstwhile dedication to Him. But to those wholove Him, He is also personal through their love.The view of things people held in the past made life into a sort of footballgame, with satanic and angelic forces vying together—often, alas, evenlymatched—each side fiercely battling for eventual victory. God is said to beall-powerful, all-knowing, all-caring, all—well, all-everything, except there’salways that insidious “serpent,” Satan, who manages somehow to meddle with everygood plan, and to keep everyone wondering whether God really has the stuff inHim that it takes to win. If anyone resolves to play on God’s side, thatperson’s chances for success are improved, but still it helps to have theguarantee of a few miracles to push things along.The cosmic view that is now evolving out of science’s revelation of how thingsreally work is not friendly to the concept of divine favoritism. Yet science,too, is veering toward a view of reality that includes a universalconsciousness, rather than an inert, material sludge. Old-fashioned religiousconcepts are being undermined by the discoveries of the very impersonal natureof everything. At the same time, so also is the traditional scientific outlookbeing transformed from complete materialism into an increasinglyspiritual—indeed, Vedantic—perception of reality.Without conscious evil, there could be no conscious good. Without duality, therecould be no cosmic manifestation of anything. On the ocean’s surface there wouldbe no waves, nor any compensating troughs to keep the over-all ocean levelunchanged. Creation would never have come into being. The gradually evolvingmodel people are forming of ultimate reality, and which the Bhagavad Gita firmlydeclares, suggests no final, objective victory for either good or evil. Finalvictory is reserved only for individuals. Otherwise, in this world of duality,all victories are transient, and are necessarily balanced by defeats (owing tothe universal sway of duality). Individual seekers of truth must, one by one,dive beneath the agitation caused by the storm at the surface, and find peace inthe depths. Liberation is achieved singly, not by group effort. Though groupscan at least provide a supportive environment for the individual aspirant, theexercise of conscience must be done personally—and often solitarily: It is evera matter between the individual and his Maker.In God’s eyes there are no favorites. However—strange to say—His law does seemsomehow to favor those who seek Him earnestly. For the sincere seeker, thecosmos is like the sounding board of a musical instrument. It resonates with hisconsciousness, and greatly enhances his power. For such a soul, miracles doindeed happen, though never in the sweetly sentimental, smilingly supportive waymany orthodox worshipers envision. What does happen is more like what happenedat Kurukshetra, when Krishna agreed to be Arjuna’s charioteer on the conditionthat he himself would take no active part in the battle. Arjuna gladly acceptedthis condition, for he realized correctly that, whether active or not, Krishna’smere presence would guarantee victory in the end. That, indeed, was what finallyhappened. And it is what happens in the private “war of Kurukshetra” withinevery individual human being.Amazingly, the shift from belief in an intensely personal God to One who issternly aloof and impersonal is not giving us a stone-carved, solid statue,rock-firm in its absoluteness. Exceptions occur constantly: The statue keepscracking, and is in constant need of repair. Who, really, can fathom God? He isimpersonal—yes, clearly so. Yet He dwells in every one of us, and He does carefor each of us very personally, if we give to Him our hearts. His impersonalityconsists in wanting nothing from us, except, indeed—since in each of us, throughour human feelings, He is also very personal—He longs for our love!Sweet, foolish sentiments don’t win Him. Earnest, complete self-offering does.True miracles are a constant feature of the spiritual life. By appealing to theMother of the Universe, people do receive Her loving response. The condition forforming this relationship with Her is utter, childlike trust, and a totalabsence of selfish desire.Let me finish this discussion with a very little, but true, story from the lifeof Paramhansa Yogananda.Living as he did in California, he often traveled back and forth between hisheadquarters on Mount Washington, in Los Angeles, and his oceanside hermitage ahundred miles to the south, in Encinitas. In Laguna Beach, a little town on theway, he found a shop that made delicious Scotch shortbread. A true master likehim is not attached to pleasures, and isn’t driven by any slightest desire forthem. Nonetheless, he can enjoy things. When he is strong in his non-attachment,he has no need to remain forever grimly aloof from everything.With that preamble, I may relate that he sometimes broke his journey between LosAngeles and Encinitas by stopping at that little shop. In the car, afterward, hewould share with his companions the pleasure of eating this shortbread. It wassomething that he enjoyed sharing especially with the Divine Mother.One day they stopped at this shop, and a disciple went in to buy a little supplyof the shortbread. She came out to report, regretfully, that all the shortbreadhad been sold. The Master, as he told us later, was not disappointed: he wasonly surprised. He never did anything without first consulting the DivineMother. Had She, this one time, misled him?“Divine Mother,” he prayed for an instant, “what happened?”Just then he beheld a shaft of light descend onto the roof of that shop. Amoment later the proprietor ran out, bearing in her hand a little package.“Wait!” she cried. “Don’t go away! This package is for you. I was saving it foranother customer who had ordered it, but I can make him another batch.”Strange to say then, in this vast, impersonal universe where God seems remote,untouched, immutable, and apparently unconcerned, the old truths are beingreinforced as it were with a vengeance! Young people, nowadays especially, wanta religion that will satisfy the demands of common sense. When all the reasoninghas been done, however, and the final tally is in, we find that in spite ofeverything the universe is more loving, more caring, more interested in us thaneven our forefathers believed!(13:20) Material cause and effect are the product of Prakriti. Joy and sorrow(the mental experience of those effects) are the product of Purusha (the soul)in man.Divine consciousness filters down into human consciousness. As the soul, thatdivine consciousness is the impartial observer. Yet the soul provides us withour very awareness, giving us the capacity to enjoy, or to grieve. In order tobecome more conscious of the soul, we should tell ourselves, “It is not I, in mytrue Self, who rejoice or grieve.” The bouncing ball of emotional reaction iswhat keeps people’s attention focused outward on the game of life. My Guru gavethis advice: “Always remain in the Self. Come down a little to eat or to talk asnecessary, but when the opportunity returns, withdraw into the Self again.”(13:21) Purusha, acting through Prakriti, and the soul acting through the body:Both experience (impersonally) the gunas, born of Nature. It is attachment tothe gunas which causes men to return (to earth) in good or in evil wombs.The three gunas, or qualities, are an omnipresent feature of Nature. Theirconstantly varied mixture produces the vast differences that exist among humanbeings. As a diamond’s luster is not dimmed by any pouch that contains it,whether the pouch be diaphanous, translucent, or opaque, so the soul isunaffected by the gunas in man. Whether a person is saintly, worldly, or evil inno way affects or defines his soul, which is the ever-changeless Spirit’spresence within him.(13:22) The Supreme Spirit, manifested in each body as the soul, is the detachedwitness; it is (through man’s conscience) the counselor who, though acceptingall, offers guidance, if asked. The soul is the Sustainer, the one whoexperiences (but doesn’t react with feelings of either pleasure or pain), theGreat Lord and Supreme Self.God, in other words, is the soul of man—individualized but ever perfect. Thesoul is the witness. Through the ego, the soul experiences the joys and sorrowsof life. Through intuition, it offers wise guidance when it can—that is, whenpeople ask it, or when the ego shows itself in other ways or on other occasionsopen and receptive to it.Sometimes the devotee, through spiritual absent-mindedness, or through notsufficiently guarding himself against temptation, slips momentarily from hisdevotion. If his normal openness to divine grace has not been closed off bypresent delusive directions, the soul may be able to enter the scene and preventhim from slipping any further. This hope, however, should not—obviously shouldnot!—give him the impudence to presume on its intervention. Still, the thoughtmay help to keep one hopeful, when the way before him seems dark. Grace is anall-important feature of the spiritual path. It is never imposed, but it can bewon.Sometimes, indeed, it happens that a person in great danger of a spiritual fall,whose karma from the past is essentially good, may for a time be granted highspiritual experiences—his deserved blessing from right effort in past lives—toencourage him to return with a good will to his spiritual practices. Otherdevotees on the path, aware of his deep experiences, may imagine him to behighly advanced, but in truth his soul, invited to do so by his good karma ofthe past, is offering him a special grace. Sad it is, when people reject thatoffer.(13:23) Whatever his mode of life, one who (by realization) understands therelationship between the Spirit (also, his individual soul) and Nature (and, onan individual level, the body) with its threefold gunas, even though he engagesoutwardly in the activity of this life, need never again undergo rebirth.It may be helpful, here, to reiterate that what is intended in this passage isintuitive, not intellectual, understanding.One day my Guru scolded a disciple for some shortcoming. The disciple, althoughresisting mentally, replied as if patiently, “I understand, Master.”“You do not understand,” the Master retorted. “If you really understood, youwould do what I say!”(13:24) To behold the Self in the self (the purified ego) by the self (theclarified mind), some seekers follow the path of meditation, some that ofknowledge, and some the path of selfless activity (service).Described here briefly are the three main approaches to God (which is to say, toSelf-realization). The first is meditation—the path of inner action, which we’vedescribed as the science of Kriya Yoga. The second is Shankhya Yoga, the path ofdiscrimination, or Gyana. The third is Karma Yoga, the path of right action.One may ask, “Why has Krishna not mentioned also the path of BhaktiYoga—devotion?” The truth is that without devotion no other path will work.Krishna frequently, in the Gita, stresses the importance of devotion. In thischapter he is emphasizing the need to wage inner war in the cause of truth.(Hence the repeated references to kshetra, and to Kurukshetra, symbol of thestruggle involved in advancing spiritually.) Whether meditating, discriminating,or acting, a devotional attitude must underlie everything one does. Devotion isthe bowstring that shoots the arrow to its mark. Without it, all spiritualeffort is merely a gathering of good karma. It cannot bestow liberation.(13:25) Some men, ignorant of these three paths, heed the instructions of theirguru; accepting what he teaches as their supreme refuge, they approach the truthworshipfully, and thus cross over (the river of) death.Few people understand the importance of the human guru. No scripture can fulfillhis function. As my Guru put it, “You can argue with scripture, and it won’tanswer you. But a living guru can set you straight on any misunderstanding.”What he mentioned above all, however, was the guru’s subtle assistance inwardly,whether in the form of guidance or of needed strength and blessings. Many peoplemisunderstand the role of the guru, imagining that he needs only to be a wiseteacher, competent in spiritual matters and familiar with the common pitfalls onthe way. As we said earlier, it is not uncommon for true gurus in India topreserve maun, or complete silence. A true guru’s teaching is, above all, by atransferral of consciousness. His main “job” is to uplift the disciple by hisspiritual magnetism.The disciple’s role is to listen, not to argue. If he has doubts or questions,of course, it is important for him to express them. The way to do so, in thatcase, is not challengingly, but with an earnest desire to learn. In this case,indeed, it may be that the more questions he asks, the better. What oftenhappens instead, however, is that the disciple, full of questions, enters theroom where the guru is seated, but finds in the guru’s presence that all hisquestions have evaporated. The reason is that questioning is of the intellect,whereas the guru emanates vibrations of superconsciousness. Those vibrationsoften satisfy the disciple’s questions by silently giving him the answers hewants, or by nullifying the very desire to question, since he finds the joy andpeace he feels in his guru’s presence completely fulfilling.Gradually, as the disciple tunes in to his guru’s consciousness, he finds hisown consciousness changing, old habit patterns disappearing, and new onesmanifesting that open him to superconscious inspiration and guidance. Tendenciesthat the disciple himself desires intensely to eradicate, but has not been ableto by his own efforts, may disappear suddenly, in attunement with the guru, asif they had never existed.Paramhansa Yogananda said, “The spiritual path is twenty-five percent thedisciple’s effort; twenty-five percent the guru’s effort on his behalf; andfifty percent the grace of God.” Because the guru is a channel for God Himself,it may even be said without error that God, both in and through the guru,accounts for seventy-five percent of the disciple’s spiritual journey.In every true guru’s ashram there are disciples in many stages of spiritualmaturity, from struggling beginners to those who are highly advanced. One maylearn from their various examples how best to tune in to the guru’s help,inwardly. Those “green” disciples whose focus is outward follow the guru aroundas if hoping that his slightest word or gesture will somehow prove beneficial tothem. Those who are spiritually more developed attune themselves inwardly,bathing their consciousness in the uplifting vibrations the guru emanates.Service to a guru is not the busy fussiness of a restless person, whetherplaying the role of nurse or that of a petitioner eager to catch his attention.It is primarily inward. Service to the guru means primarily to offer one’senergy and devotion up for cleansing in his fountain-flow of grace. One serveshim more with the right consciousness than with outward actions—though both,depending on circumstances, can be appropriate. The important thing is thatone’s attitude be respectful and receptive.Is it important to be physically near the guru? Not necessarily. Mentalattunement is everything. My Guru told me that even one physical contact withthe guru may suffice to seal that bond. There must, however—so he told me—be atleast that one contact. It can occur through the mediation of an advanceddisciple. Those, however, who think to form it only by mental acceptance ontheir part do not achieve the same results. The truths stated here are visibleand tangible. They can be tested. They do not depend on blind faith.Physical proximity to the guru is a great blessing, certainly. It carries thedisadvantage, however, (unless one is highly advanced) of making the disciplethink that he knows the guru well through mere familiarity with his personality.A master needs a body, and therefore also a personality, in order to function inthis world at all. He is not, however, either that body or that personality.What will his personality be like? It should go almost without saying that itwill be radiant, magnetic, loving, joyful, and overflowing with divine power.Apart from that, however, it will be very individual. Nevertheless, to know andlove that personality does not necessarily mean that one is in tune with hisinner spirit. Inner attunement is the supreme necessity for receiving to thefullest degree his divine grace.Long-time disciples often cling to particular attitudes of their own, notreflective of the guru’s attitudes, and may not even be conscious that adiscrepancy exists, since they feel fulfilled, personally, in their attunementwith him. They deserve no blame for what might otherwise seem in them adeficiency. Their reason for coming to him in the first place was to find God.Nevertheless, it is unwise to keep any door of consciousness closed to him bythinking, “This much will I accept. Beyond that, I have my own ideas, and Ibelieve I must develop my own strength.”(13:26) O Best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), whatever is in existence, know it tohave been born of the union of kshetra (Nature and the body) and kshetragya(Spirit and the soul).(13:27) He sees truly who perceives the Supreme Lord present equally in allbeings, the imperishable within the perishing.Mahatma Gandhi put it beautifully: “In the midst of death, life persists.” Lifeitself, born of Spirit through Nature, is the imperishable principle.(13:28) Beholding the Divine Presence everywhere, he no longer harms himself bySelf-ignorance. (Thus,) he attains the Supreme Goal.(13:29) That man sees truly who perceives that all actions are performed byNature (Prakriti) alone, not by the Self (which is above all action).This last stanza can be given a secondary meaning: The yogi needs to offer upall his actions to God (or Nature), and feel that God (Nature) alone is actingthrough him. Although this concept is not literally true (since it eliminatesthe reality of the ego altogether), it helps in the exercise of expanding one’sego-consciousness from the little self to the infinite Self.(13:30) When (the yogi) sees all beings as contained in the One, having expandedhis consciousness (and sympathy) to include all living beings, he merges intoBrahman.A practical aspect of the teaching in this stanza is something Yogananda said:“Don’t think you can love God purely and entirely if you are able to treat evenone human being unkindly. The one Lord is equally present in all. To mistreat oreven to feel ill will toward any of His creatures is, at least to that extent,to separate yourself from God.”(13:31) O Arjuna! The Supreme Self, having no beginning, (no ending,) and noattributes, even though it dwells in a body (as a realized master), neither actsnor is touched by any action.(13:32) As the subtle, all-pervading ether is unaffected (by what moves throughit), similarly the Self, though pervading the whole body, is never affected byit.(13:33) O Bharata (Arjuna), as the sun illuminates the whole world, so does theLord of the Field (God and His reflection as the soul) illuminate the whole body(of Nature, and of man).(13:34) They go to the Supreme who perceive with the eye of wisdom thedistinction between the kshetra and kshetragya, and understand how beings canbecome liberated from (involvement in) Prakriti.Thus ends the thirteenth chapter, called “The Field of Battle,” of the Upanishadof the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjunadiscussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter Twenty-SevenTRANSCENDING THE THREE GUNAS(14:1) The Blessed Lord said: I will declare to you once more that supremewisdom, higher than any knowledge, in the realization of which all sages have,after death, attained the Final Perfection.(14:2) Those who attain this wisdom and become established in Me are never againreborn, even when creation itself is re-manifested. Nor are they troubled at thetime of Pralaya (cosmic dissolution).This stanza is a comfort to those in whom the doubt lingers that, at some futuretime when the universe is remanifested, they may have to go through the longstruggle for liberation all over again!(14:3) The great Prakriti is My womb in which I plant the animating seed whichgives birth to all life.(14:4) O Son of Kunti (Arjuna), whatever form issues from any womb, its (true)womb (and cosmic source) is Great Prakriti, and I am its seed-implanting Father.(14:5) O Mighty-armed (Arjuna)! What binds the imperishable soul to the body arethe three gunas, brought into manifestation by Prakriti.(14:6) O Sinless One (Arjuna)! Of these gunas, the pure quality of sattwabestows health and understanding, but (still) causes bondage to the body bymaking man attached to happiness and (intellectual) knowledge.Even sattwa guna, though elevating, does not free one from the thought of “I.”He thinks, “I am happy. I am insightful. I am healthy.” Ego-consciousness is thefinal limitation; it lingers on after every other bond has been severed.“Chains, though of gold, still bind.” To be happy is not in itself binding, ofcourse. What binds one is the thought, “I.” Ego binds to the degree that itseparates one from others. It becomes ever more limiting to the degree that itdoesn’t include their happiness, and makes a person clutch his own happiness tohimself rather than offering it up into the joy of God.Happiness, in its highest form (bliss), is the goal. Attachment, however, to thethought, “I, John, am happy” keeps that thought from expanding to infinity. Itis like those disciples we mentioned a few pages back who feel personalfulfillment in whatever progress they have made so far, and feel no urgency toclimb higher toward spiritual perfection. Thus, although they continue to makethe right efforts, they always act with the thought, “I already have thehappiness I struggled so long to attain.”Intellectual knowledge is a trap also. Or let us call it, rather, a cul-de-sacon the spiritual voyage. Many spiritually inclined people feel fulfillment inthe vicarious knowledge they get from reading and discussing spiritual truths.Intellectual knowledge, however, does not touch a person inwardly. It is notbased on direct experience, but only on the thoughts, opinions, and experiencesof others.(14:7) Know (the quality of) rajas as imbued with passion, which activatesstrong desires and attachments and binds one to the body by the intenseexpectations it develops in him, through his restlessness.A good example of rajas is the excitement shown by the crowd at a football game:wild exuberance when the “right” team scores a point; rage when the refereemakes a “wrong” decision; muttered oaths when scoring is done by the “wrong”team; joyful exhilaration when the “right” team wins; despondency and gloom whenvictory goes to the “wrong” team. What makes this an especially good example isthat it doesn’t really matter one way or another who wins or loses. It is only agame.So also is life itself: only a game! Yet people take it with great seriousness,and invest all their hopes, or all their fears, in certain outcomes that, as faras the soul is concerned, don’t even exist!(14:8) O Bharata (Arjuna)! Know the (darkening) quality of tamas to produce(spiritual) ignorance, which deludes the mind and makes people lazy, heedless,and excessively attracted to subconscious sleep.Drunkenness is tamasic. Drug addiction is tamasic. Dull-mindedness is tamasic.Stupidity is tamasic. Anything—whether wrong food; habitual inactivity; lack ofproper exercise; unwillingness to puzzle anything out or to face any challengingreality; passive acceptance of things as they are, however degrading they may beto one’s consciousness, and not caring to see them improved: anything that keepsone from mental clarity may rightly be called tamasic.Tamas is that quality in human nature (born, however, of cosmic nature) whichattracts misery of all kinds. It creates such a thick wall around the ego thatit causes one to view himself and his own interests as completely unrelated toanybody else’s.In the analogy of the ocean and the waves, tamas represents that part of thewave which protrudes farthest from the ocean bosom. The action of tamas isgenerated by the “rajasic” middle part of the wave. Tamoguna, in itself, has nopower, and only disintegrates into foam after it reaches its peak ofself-expression. In the flow of energy in the spine, tamoguna is the downwardpull of matter-attachment, after one reaches the point where one no longer seeksanything actively, but rather clings blindly to whatever material thing orcondition the ego insists on as being “mine, and no one else’s.”(14:9) Sattwa attaches one to happiness; rajas, to activity; and tamas, bystifling discrimination (which gives “solution-consciousness”), submerges one indifficulties.Sattwa guna uplifts the consciousness. Rajas keeps it involved outwardly. Tamasdulls it to the point where questions of right and wrong don’t even arise.Sattwa guna, however, if it hasn’t at least a touch of rajas, may make a personpassively happy and therefore susceptible to falling again from that elevatedstate into relative inertia. And so the wheel keeps turning. There are threeaspects to rajas: upwardly directional, non-directional except on the sameplane, and downwardly directional. Though rajas spurs one to activity, thatactivity can be self-raising or self-debasing. To fulfill one’s dutyconscientiously is to act under the influence of sattwa-rajas.Action, on the other hand, that is directed only toward self-fulfillment, underthe influence of desire and attachment, may lead in any direction. If onelearns, by such action, to see and appreciate that others, too, have theirneeds, then even selfish activity can lead upward, toward a freer consciousness.But if one determinedly excludes the needs of others from one’s own struggle forself-fulfillment, his consciousness will shrink inward upon itself, and hisenergy will move downward in the spine into the lower chakras.(14:10) In some persons, sattwa is predominant, holding rajas and tamas inabeyance; in others, rajas prevails rather than sattwa or tamas; and in stillothers, tamas obscures both sattwa and rajas.All men, it must be understood, are a mixture of the three gunas, even as a wavehas three parts: the part closest to the ocean bosom; the middle part, whichpushes the wave higher; and the crest, from which point the calm ocean depth mayseem not to exist.Saints, who of course manifest sattwa guna primarily, nevertheless demonstratethe tamoguna aspect of their natures when they draw the curtain of sleep overtheir minds, or when they rest briefly from other activities. Saints show therajas in their nature, also, when they strive for the well-being of others, orwhen they are simply relaxing, telling jokes, or laughing.Worldly people, intent on their own ego-fulfillment, nevertheless show signs ofsattwa when they help others—even their own children, perhaps, to grow up andseek success in their lives. They show tamas not only when they sleep to excess,but also when they shun any duty as “too much trouble.”Dull-minded, tamasic people show the rajas in their nature when they bestirthemselves to accomplish anything. They show sattwa when they expressappreciation for anything—or even when they ask themselves idly, concerninglife, “Is it all really worth it?” (For in the very asking they tend to holdtheir minds upward, however briefly, and even if only in exasperation!)When trying to help people, or to teach youngsters, it would be well to rememberthat one can only advance by stages. To urge sattwic attitudes, for example, onsomeone who is basically tamasic would be a waste of energy, and would beabsurd. If one tried to get him to meditate, he would only sleep or drift offinto a subconscious torpor. Meditation is not for everyone. Nor is even selflessvirtue. Ask a tamasic person to do something selfless, and he won’t do anythingat all! Ask a rajasic person to “live more in the Self,” and he’ll look aroundto see what he can grab and hold.A seed cannot suddenly become a tree. Every human being needs to grow from thatstage which he has reached so far. Instead of expecting overnight perfection onthe spiritual path, one must work realistically with the tools he has to hand.The seed will grow if it is watered regularly. That watering process, for adevotee, is daily meditation and constant practice of the presence of God.(14:11) When the light of discrimination shines through all of a person’s sensegates, it is clear that sattwa predominates in him.The sattwic person hears goodness and purity in all things, sees it reflected inall things, finds reminders of God in everything that he feels, tastes, andsmells. What he is in himself, that he projects outward onto the world aroundhim.(14:12) When a person displays greed, restless activity, and selfish motivation,rajas predominates in his nature.The rajasic person views everything in terms of what he might get out of it forhis own fulfillment. The “gates of his senses” are clogged with the mentaltoxins of desire. He sees a beautiful mountain brook and thinks only, “How muchelectrical power could I harness from this flowing water to make me wealthy?” Hesees a beautiful painting and asks only, “Monetarily, what is it worth?” Hehears beautiful music and thinks only, “It needs a heavier beat.” He tastesdelicious fruit, and thinks, “It needs more spicing.” And so it goes for himwith every sensory experience.(14:13) When a person’s consciousness is dark, lazy, neglectful of duty, andinclined to understand nothing rightly, tamas is his dominant guna.The “gates of the senses” in such people are blocked with impurities.Everything, to them, has sexual, or gustatory, or other grossly materialinnuendoes. They see, hear, and speak only evil. To tell them to be better thanthey are would be an exercise in futility. The best that can be done for them isto try to get them into good company. Otherwise, the best one can do about themis simply to avoid their company.(14:14) A person who, at death, has sattwa predominant in him rises to thosehigh regions where dwell the knowers of truth.The moment of death is all-important in everybody’s life. Therefore Krishnadevotes many stanzas of the Bhagavad Gita to that sacred moment. One’s thoughtsat that time reflect the kind of life he has lived. He must, however, make anextra effort then to keep his consciousness uplifted. Even masters, who alwaysknow the hour of their own death, quite commonly experience a certaintrepidation in the stark awareness that everything they have known in this lifewill soon be snatched away from them irrevocably. This doesn’t mean they areattached. It would be truer to say that they have simply become accustomed.My Guru told me that when he last saw his own guru in the flesh, shortly beforethat great master’s death, someone said something to him like, “I’ll see youshortly in Kidderpore.” For a moment the Master’s hand shook, and he cried withunaccustomed force, “I go to Kidderpore no more!” A moment later he was oncemore inwardly calm and non-attached.The veil cast by maya, however, is heavy. Even masters must make a consciouseffort to cast off its last lingering traces in their consciousness.When death comes to you, therefore, make a serious effort to sever the cords ofattachment that bind you to this life. With the thicker cords, mentally apply anaxe to them. With the thinner ones, mentally use a sharp knife to slice throughand discard the knots they’ve formed in your heart. Cast them away from youvigorously, and try not to think of them again.Begin with the most tamasic-seeming of your desires and attachments. Give themfirmly to God, telling yourself, “All I’ve gained from this attachment ismisery. I gladly give it away!” Affirm then, mentally, “I am free in myself!”Proceed upward to those bonds which, being rajasic, are thinner and less able tohold you down, keeping you from rising.Even spiritual people may find a sudden surge of regret at the thought ofleaving behind them places and people they’ve loved, or at least have grown usedto. Keep in mind that love is a link between people; it draws them togetherrepeatedly, until their affection merges at last in the great ocean of divinelove. However sincere a devotee you’ve been, however, make an extra effort, whendeath comes, to focus on God alone.(14:15) A person who at death has rajas predominant in him is reborn among thosewith strong egoic attachment to activity. One, however, who at death ispermeated with tamas is reborn in the womb of someone who is steeped in delusion(and in the family, environment, and objective circumstances that promotedelusion).There are many grades of people, of course, in all of the three categories. Asattwic person may be a saint, but even saints are of different grades rangingfrom those who have dedicated their lives to the spiritual search to those whohave achieved its goal. Only those saints who have transcended ego-consciousnessbecome jivan muktas—freed, that is to say, while still living in the body—evenif their freedom comes only at the moment of death. Others must return to earth,bound by the cords (silken, in their case) of past karma.Rajasic people also may be categorized as being of many types. Essentially,there are upward-moving and downward-moving people, as well as, of course, thosewho are horizontally motile: neither good nor bad, but merely restless.Tamasic people, finally, come in categories ranging from the merely stupid tothe actively evil. Souls who descend from higher levels of expression toactively expressing evil may even indulge in dark practices such as black magicand Satanism.We mentioned earlier that there are worlds, and even whole galaxies, where oneor another of the three gunas predominates. People may ask with seemingreasonableness, “How can even a master know anything about distant galaxies?”The answer is that in samadhi, he is already there! Once the ego has beentranscended, the only real barrier to omnipresence is demolished.The residents of sattwic galaxies live an ideal, though still material,existence. They live long lives amid beautiful surroundings. The veil betweenthe material and the astral universes is easily pierced.The rajasic galaxies are like our own, filled with beings who strive incessantlyto fulfill their desires. Such galaxies abound with restlessness,dissatisfaction, and anxiety. Their inhabitants “have it good,” however,compared to those in the tamasic galaxies, where ferocious beasts prowl inceaseless search of prey, and cannibalism among human beings is common. There,all is warfare, conflict, violent emotions, primitive conditions, and mentaldullness.A question naturally arises: Are beings on other planets similar in appearanceto ourselves? Biologists would say, “Impossible! Evolution is completelyaccidental.” Paramhansa Yogananda explained, however, that this world is animitation on a grosser level of the astral world. The shape of the human body isdetermined at an even subtler level: the causal. It is reminiscent, in grossform, of the star in the spiritual eye with its five points. In man’s case, whenhe extends his arms sideways, and stands with outspread legs, his four limbs,plus the head, form a replica of that star. Self-aware beings, far from beingthe outcome of pure accident, follow a prototype established already in theastral and causal universes.Another question arises: Does each different material world necessarily reflectonly one of the three qualities? The answer is, Of course not! The gunas appeareverywhere mixed—always, however, in the same relationship to one another. Werenot great masters, for example, born on Earth, who, here, would be inspired toseek spiritual development? The longing might exist, but spiritual hope would becrushed by the all-too-evident, grosser realities of life.Souls are drawn back to earth—that is to say, of course, to the materialplane—to places where the conditions reflect whatever consciousness they’vedeveloped so far.People in this world express the doubt—as many have indeed done—“But ifreincarnation is a fact, and the soul is not created for the first time withevery new baby, why is it that the Earth’s population is increasing? Where doall those souls come from?” The answer is, of course, “From everywhere!”(14:16) It is said (by sages) that the fruits of sattwic action are harmony andpurity (of heart and mind); that those of rajasic action are pain and suffering;and that the fruits of tamasic action are the various manifestations ofspiritual ignorance (dullness of mind, slothfulness, stupidity, and generalhelplessness in confrontation with life’s difficulties).These results of the various kinds of activity, born of the diverse qualities,act as spurs toward eventual enlightenment. Alas, man’s inventiveness inprotecting himself against self-improvement amounts almost to genius! Rajasicpeople often—instead of working out rajasic complexes in themselves—hate sattwicpeople for their very harmony and purity. Tamasic people resent those with highenergy, seeing their energy as a personal insult to their own lack of it.Tamasic (as well as rajasic) people, again, cannot bring themselves to believethat there really are sattwic people. They attribute to those who are good everyimaginable shifty motive. If they fail in the attempt to bring good people down,they persecute and even slay them, as the Jews treated Jesus Christ in his time.(14:17) Wisdom arises from sattwa; lust and avarice, from rajas; and (thedarkness of spiritual) ignorance, from tamas.It is important to realize that although each person as an individual is unique,the qualities he manifests are universal. The words of a sentimental song thatwas in vogue some years ago in the West managed somehow to express a truth thatis eternal: “There will never, ever be another you.” It is equally important torealize, however, that the “you” (the personality) about whom the song waswritten had nothing to do with the truly eternal “you.” The qualities, or gunas,belong to no one. They are simply manifestations of Prakriti, and can attachthemselves to anyone, seeming verily for a time to define him.The wisdom of sattwa can become in time, in the same person, the lust andavarice of rajas or the dark ignorance of tamas. No quality is or can beanyone’s possession; it never defines him as he is in himself. The qualities, orgunas, only reside in people temporarily. One might describe the gunas aseternal wanderers. Any quality a human being manifests can be increased,diminished, or eliminated altogether, but it can never, in any way, beidentified with who he really is, inside.And—the question begs to be asked—who is he really, inside? He is Satchidananda!The war of Kurukshetra, and Krishna’s counsel to Arjuna to fight, is founded onthis eternal truth. On the Pandavas’ side, it is a war against qualities thatcannot ever in any case—since they are universal and eternal—be slain, for theycannot be identified with anybody. On the Kauravas’ side, it is a war to protectterritory seized by trickery and held onto with arrogant contempt for thewell-being of the populace. When lust and avarice are transformed into wisdom,they are “slain,” in a sense, but nothing has been lost. The transformation hasmade use of all the same “materials”—energy and consciousness—and has simplydressed them up in new clothing.Thus, the best persons, if they live wrongly, can acquire worse, then the worstattributes. And the worst persons can acquire in time, if they live rightly, thebest attributes. The qualities, or gunas, themselves are abstractions. Theindividual they attack, harass, or bless is the host reality, and is thereforemore permanent. He too, of course, is only a dream-actor in the cosmic drama.His existence as an egoic self is, in eternity, impermanent—except as a memory,which remains even after he has achieved final union with God. There is nothingpermanent or self-defining about any quality, however.What the Gita is pointing out here is that the gunas can be manipulated. If youact in a certain way, you will attract that guna which belongs to that kind ofactivity. If you act in another way, you’ll attract the guna that belongs,again, to that other kind of activity.The less you allow your ego to identify itself with any quality, the more you’llbe able to pick and choose the qualities you’d like to manifest, and will thuslearn to act appropriately under all circumstances. If you want to be happy,work at developing sattwic qualities. Remember, no quality is “you.” That deeper“you” never changes, and can never be identified with anything—least of all withyour little self, the ego.Happiness, if you manifest it by living a sattwic life, is real, though itdoesn’t define you. It should inspire you, however, to rise above even thatsatisfaction into the supernal bliss of the Spirit. Otherwise, if you becomesatisfied with yourself, you’ll only fall—once more!—because you’ll havereaffirmed your ego. True joy is not tied to the petty thought, “I.” It ispossible to have it only in perfect freedom. There is no possibility of a fallfrom the state of complete ego-liberation. This state comes with fullSelf-realization.The way to transcend the gunas is different for each of them, and is differentfor each individual, also, depending on the particular mixture of gunas thatmanifests in him. It is useless to try to shrug off the dark and heavymanifestations of tamoguna. They cannot be transmuted: They must be simplyendured, and gradually worn down through contact with other people—like therounding of pebbles in a riverbed by constant friction against one another. Itis at the other end of the spectrum that transcendence becomes fully possible,though rajoguna can at least make people want to be calmer, more peaceful, andmore happy in themselves. One can ascend the ladder of spiritual evolution onlyby patience, and by accepting what is as a present reality. Thealmost-transparent veil that covers delusion with sattwa guna can, like anillustration used in the Gita earlier, be blown away like smoke by a mere puffof wind: A little meditation soon uncovers the bright fire of wisdom hiddenbehind its diaphanous screen.We see here the importance of having a true guru. He alone, from his level ofhighest wisdom, with his clear insight, in addition, into your nature, and withhis commitment to helping you, as his disciple, to find God, can be relied uponto show you the way through the minefield of bewilderingly mixed qualities thatyou manifest. With his help you will emerge onto the plateau of mostly sattwicqualities, and will then understand how to pass beyond even those elevatedqualities to perfect freedom in infinite consciousness from the last vestiges ofego-consciousness.Even to be mentally in tune with the guru can help you to understand, every timeyou come to the point where you might make a mistake. What you will feel is acertain nervousness in the heart’s feelings. When you are doing right, on theother hand, you will feel in your heart the guru’s calm inner endorsement andapproval.We see here again the utter importance, on the spiritual path, of having a trueguru. Few people even appreciate that need. And few, even after getting a trueguru (which means also being accepted by him), have the faith required to followhim implicitly. True faith in the guru is not passive, nor is it an indicationof ignorance. Disciples blessed with that faith soon emerge from the confines ofego into the spotless skies of divine consciousness.In the annals of spirituality, there are a few outstanding examples ofobedience. It must be said, on this point, that a true guru makes every effortto ensure that his disciple’s obedience will be both deliberate (free-willed)and intelligent, and will not be a matter of blind or merely submissiveacquiescence.Swami Shankara was standing on the other side of a river from a close discipleof his. My Guru once described to me what happened. I still remember hisunderstated facial expression, the subtle hand gesture, and the quiet tone ofvoice with which he related this part of the story.Shankara called gently to his disciple, “Come over here.” Most people would havelooked around for a boat. This disciple, however, placed one foot unhesitatinglyon the water. The moment he did so, a lotus leaf appeared beneath his foot,supporting it. With each successive step another leaf appeared. The disciplequickly reached the other side. From then on, he became known as Padmapada(“Lotusfeet”).Sadashiva (who was mentioned earlier in this book) was another case. Both thesestories indicate perfect obedience, and the grace of the guru. As a young man inhis guru’s ashram, Sadashiva was a brilliant conversationalist. He often bestedin discussion men much older than he. One day, he discomfited an older man bypointing out the inadequacies in his arguments.His guru demanded somewhat impatiently (or so his words seemed), “When will youlearn to hold your tongue?” His disciple’s penchant for showing off hisintellectual brilliance was a manifestation not only of intelligence, but, lesslaudably, of ego.“Instantly, Master, if I have your grace!” came the response. From that dayforward, Sadashiva never spoke another word. He became widely known as a mauniof unbroken silence.(14:18) Those established in sattwa rise upward; those immersed in rajas remainin the middle regions; those steeped in tamas sink to the lower spinal centers.We have already discussed the gunas relative to the direction of energy andconsciousness in the spine. In yoga practice, the energy flows inward. In peoplewho live in ego-consciousness and are filled with desires and attachments, theirenergy is outward. The consciousness of sattwic people, being centered more atthe point between the eyebrows (the frontal lobe of the brain), brings clarityof intellect and understanding. Rajasic people, being centered primarily intheir emotions, are ruled by their likes and dislikes, hopes anddisappointments, ambitions and devastating failures. Tamasic people, beingcentered in their lowest three chakras, are focused exaggeratedly on physicalenjoyments and “rewards”: cruelty, crude sex-addiction, drunkenness, and thepleasure of telling lies for the sole purpose of creating confusion.(14:19) The seer who perceives no other active agent in the universe but thethree gunas (that is, who sees human action as motivated by the gunas ratherthan by individual choice), and perceives that (unmoving consciousness) which ishigher than the gunas, enters My being.(14:20) Having transcended the three qualities of Nature, which are the cause ofphysical embodiment, one is released from the suffering (attendant upon) birth,old age, and death, and attains immortality.(14:21) Arjuna said: What signs distinguish one who has transcended the threegunas? What is his behavior? In what ways does he reveal his transcendence?(14:22) The Blessed Lord said: O Pandava (Arjuna), he neither dislikes nor longsfor any manifestation of the gunas, whether illumination (upliftment), unceasingactivity, or dull ignorance;—(14:23) unconcerned either way, unshaken (by any expression he sees of thequalities), viewing them as active throughout the universe, he remains evercentered calmly in the Self.(14:24) Unaffected (personally) by joy or sorrow, praise or blame, appraisingequally a clod of earth, a stone, and gold, he doesn’t distinguish among others(according to) whether they treat him well or badly.(14:25) Uninfluenced by honor or dishonor, equally (gracious) toward friend andfoe, free from any motivation of personal ambition: these signs accompany onewho has transcended the (three) qualities of Nature.(14:26) He who serves Me with undeviating love and devotion transcends thegunas, and is qualified to become (one with) Brahman.(14:27) For I am the basis of everything there is: the Imperishable Brahman, inwhom reside the eternal Law and unending Bliss.Krishna has been speaking of himself as personal. How can the personal be thebasis (or, as some have it, the abode) of the Infinite Brahman? Only in thesense, surely, that the devotee perceives the Divine first through the guru asif through a window: personal first, then impersonal.Thus ends the fourteenth chapter, called “Transcending the Three Gunas,” of theUpanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna andArjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter Twenty-EightTHE YOGA OF THE SUPREME PERSON(15:1) The Blessed Lord said: They (the wise) speak of the imperishable Ashvattatree, with its roots above and its branches below. Its leaves are the Vedichymns. Whosoever understands this tree of life knows (the meaning of) the Vedas.The mythical-seeming tree described here is the human body. Its trunk is thespine. Its “roots above” are the rays of energy which both emanate from andnourish the brain and body through the sahasrara, the “thousand-petaled lotus”at the top of the head. The tree’s branches, “below,” are the much-ramifiednervous system.The “Vedic hymns” are the vibrations of sensory knowledge transmitted to thebrain from the senses by way of the nervous system. As the sap of a treenourishes all its parts including the leaves, so the life force flowing outwardfrom the spine through the nerves to the senses thereby enlivens theirfluttering “leaves” of response to the vibrations of sight, hearing, smell,taste, and touch.The soul, as has been explained before, is encased in three such bodies, thesubtlest, or causal, being the innermost, the one enclosing that (the astralbody) coming next, and the outermost sheath being the physical.Why is the body called imperishable? Because its origins lie in Brahman, theSupreme Spirit, and its prototype lies in Prakriti (Nature). The physical bodydies, but the conscious desires directing its creation re-form the body againand again. The astral body, too—once that world becomes one’s “home”—is absorbedperiodically into the causal body, and again remanifested—owing, in this casealso, to conscious desires for astral enjoyments. Even when the causal body isabsorbed into the Infinite, the creative principle behind the manifestation ofthe three bodies is eternal.What makes man’s tree of life “imperishable,” beyond the fact that it manifeststhat eternal creative principle, is that his body, uniquely among animal forms,has a nervous system, spine, and brain refined enough to render him capable ofrealizing Brahman.Krishna’s use of the Ashvatta tree as an image owes to the fact that this tree,the peepul or fig, has an abundance of leaves. The “leaves” on the human “treeof life” are similarly abundant: the multifarious vibrations of sensoryinvolvement (sounds, colors, tastes, smells, and touch sensations) that areavailable to man with his greater ability (more developed than in the loweranimals) to enjoy and appreciate. The lower animals are contented with very fewsensory pleasures. Man’s taste for these is never-ending. Thus, even the leavesof that “imperishable” tree are large and numerous, as the delights peoplederive from them are never-ending.Human hair is a condensation of the rays of astral energy surrounding the brain.Yogis sometimes allow their hair to grow long so as to draw more energy from thecosmos to the brain.(15:2) Its branches extend below and above, nurtured by the gunas. Its buds arethe sense objects. Small roots extend also downward into the world of men,impelling man to action.The metaphor of the tree is beautiful. It becomes problematic here, however, inasking us to visualize the branches extending not only downward but upward, andthe roots extending not only upward but downward. The mind wants visualizationsthat will simplify and clarify. Here, the visualization is complex and somewhatconfusing. No metaphor is exact, in any case. The image of the ocean and itswaves has the disadvantage, similarly, that the waves, as they swell the ego andthe quality of tamas, rise from their source in the ocean, whereas in fact ourconsciousness, to return to its source in Spirit, and even to develop sattwaguna, must rise too, and not descend. Downward movement in the spine causes anincrease of negativity. Another problem—almost too trivial to mention—is that,if one would water the seed of spirituality with faith, water flows downward,not upward, whereas watering with faith demands an upward flow of energy. Theproblem, again, with making spiritual progress is that one doesn’t reallyprogress at all: One simply becomes whole in himself.One might pursue this point further, but—to what avail? A metaphor must simplybe accepted lightly for what it is: a mental crutch. No image can “stand” toocareful a scrutiny!Let us, then, focus our attention less on the upside-downness of the tree thanon the functions of its roots and branches. The branches indicate the extensionsof consciousness as expressions of the gunas—some of them reaching back(upward?) toward their roots; others stretching sideways; still others reachingdownward toward the earth, but away from the roots, which are nourished fromabove.The leaves begin as buds, then spread out to assume their large, leafy form. Asbuds, they symbolize the sense objects of sight, hearing, smell, taste, andtouch. As leaves, they bestow the full-blown, variegated enjoyment of thosesense objects.The “roots,” which draw their principal energy from the cosmos, also drawlife-force from the response of consciousness to likes and dislikes in theworld. These secondary roots keep the life flowing ever back toward there-creation and perpetuation of this tree of life, which constitutes ourhumanity.(15:3,4) The true nature of this tree—its beginning, its continuity, itsend—cannot be understood by ordinary men. The sage, having felled his Ashvattatree at its roots with the axe of non-attachment, thinks, “Iseek refuge only in the Primeval Purusha, from whom issues all creation (ratherthan under the protection of any tree).” He seeks the Supreme Goal, from whichthere is no need to return.The wise man perceives Cosmic consciousness as the beginning, continuity, andend of the tree of eternal life.(15:5) Those reach the eternal goal who crave no human honor; who, havingsevered the bonds of attachment, are free from infatuation; who are untouched bythe pairs of opposites such as pleasure and pain; and who are established in theSelf within.(15:6) Where shines neither sun nor moon nor the light of fire, there lies Myabode; those who reach it pass beyond birth and death.The sun in the body represents the light of the spiritual eye—or, alternatively,the sahasrara (the “thousand-rayed lotus”) at the top of the head. The moonrepresents the reflection of that light in the ego, or agya chakra (the medullaoblongata), and therefore represents the human ego itself. Ego-consciousness is,in fact, centered in the medulla. Fire is the life energy in the body, burningas self-control in the manipura chakra or lumbar center. In finding God one goesbeyond these differentiations of consciousness into absolute oneness.(15:7) An eternal part of Myself, manifesting as a living soul in the world ofhumanity, attracts to itself the six senses, inclusive of mind, all of whichrest in Prakriti.(15:8) When the Lord as the jiva (the individualized soul) takes on a body, hetakes with him (into it) the mind and the senses. When he leaves the body, hetakes them with him and departs even as the breeze wafts scents away from theirdwellings (as in flowers).Thus the jiva, still possessing an astral body, carries with it its capacity forsense-perception and its individuality.(15:9) Thus, he still (possesses and) enjoys the senses of sight, hearing,smell, taste, and touch.(15:10) His departure from the body, like his abiding in it, is not perceived bythe ignorant (who see only the effect of his presence: the body itself). Ittakes the eye of wisdom to perceive him (as he is).(15:11) Yogis who strive for liberation see His reality in themselves, but thosewho, even though striving, have not purified (their hearts) and lack discipline,see Him not.(15:12) The light of the sun which illuminates the world, of the moon, and offire—know that their radiance comes (ultimately) from Me.(15:13) Permeating the earth with My effulgence, I support all beings; throughthe watery moon, I nourish all plants.The sun gives energy to the world. The moon, which is its reflection, representsthe sap, blood, and life fluids in all creatures, permitting that energy to flowthrough matter.(15:14) I am the flame of life in all living creatures. It is I (alone) whomanifest as prana and apana, and digest their food.(15:15) From Me, seated in the hearts of all beings, come all memory andknowledge, and also the loss of these. I am the Goal of knowledge in the Vedas.I am also their Author, and He who knows them.(15:16) Two beings (purushas) there are in the cosmos: the destructible and theindestructible. Creatures are the destructible. The Kutastha Chaitanya is theindestructible.This stanza refers to Prakriti manifested as all creatures, and to KutasthaChaitanya, the vibrationless consciousness at the heart of all manifestation,which informs the universe and cannot be destroyed, since it remains unchangedwhen all creatures are reabsorbed into Spirit.(15:17) There exists, however, Another—the supreme Self who, permeating thethree worlds (the causal, astral, and physical planes), is their Sustainer.(15:18) I (the Supreme Lord) am beyond the perishable (Prakriti) and am higherthan the Imperishable (Kutastha Chaitanya). Therefore, in the (three) worlds andin the Veda (which reflect perfect, intuitive perception) I am proclaimed asPurushottama, the Uttermost Being.(15:19) Whosoever, freed from delusion, thus knows Me as the Supreme Spirit,knows all (there is to be known), O Descendant of Bharata (Arjuna). He worshipsMe with his entire being.(15:20) Herewith, O Sinless One (Arjuna), I have taught you this deepest of allwisdom. Comprehending it, one becomes a sage, having successfully fulfilled allhis duties, (even if) he yet continues to perform dutiful actions (in theworld).Thus ends the fifteenth chapter, called “The Yoga of the Supreme Person,” of theUpanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna andArjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter Twenty-NineTHE NATURE OF THE GODLY AND THE DEMONICKrishna now relates twenty-six qualities that ennoble the mind spiritually.The goal of spiritual progress is, as has been repeatedly emphasized, thetranscendence of ego-consciousness in the realization that separateness fromother selves, and from the Absolute Self, is the one great delusion, from whichall other delusions derive. The sense of individuality is rooted in infinity.There is no other reality but the Self: God, the Self of all. In Himself He isever-conscious, ever-existing, ever-new Bliss. No one created Him: He isself-existent.A spiritually ennobling quality, therefore, is one that can lift us toward thatawareness.(16:1) The Blessed Lord said: Fearlessness; purity of heart; perseverance (inthe acquisition of wisdom and in the practice of meditation); (sattwic) charity;self-restraint; the performance of holy rites (symbolic self-offering to God andto the devas), service to holy persons, and agnihotra (pouring oblations intothe sacred fire); study of the scriptures; self-discipline;straightforwardness;—(16:2) harmlessness; truthfulness; freedom from anger; renunciation;tranquility; disinclination toward faultfinding; kindness to all;non-covetousness; gentleness; modesty (not calling attention to oneself);steadfastness of purpose;—(16:3) radiance of character; forgiveness; fortitude; cleanliness; absence ofmalice; absence of self-conceit: these qualities, O Descendant of Bharata(Arjuna), are the endowments of those who are divinely inclined.Fearlessness comes with perfect non-attachment. It is a natural attitude forthose who feel they have nothing to protect. The instinct of self-preservationis, of course, the basic motivation for fear. Ego—the sense of having a separateindividuality, and of being distinct from all others—gives rise to the instinctof fear. Ego-consciousness is born of attachment to the body. Fear arises fromanxiety to protect the body. It cannot be conquered so long as attachment to thebody lingers.The more a person’s body-consciousness expands to include such things as a senseof possessions, a concern for one’s own reputation, and a sense of personalpower or importance, the greater the likelihood of fear. Fearlessness, on theother hand, comes from releasing those attachments—quite possibly in theirreverse order—into the infinite: the desire for personal importance; the desirefor power or control over anything or anyone; the desire to be well thought of,admired, and respected by others; attachment to possessions; attachment tobodily health and well-being; and, finally, self-identification with the body.The fast and sure way to develop fearlessness is to love God. By loving Him, onefeels oneself ever protected by a force far greater than one’s own.Purity of heart comes when one has removed from the heart’s feelings any thatare foreign to his true nature. Thus, purity begins by removing whatevernourishes his consciousness of self. This includes, of course, all themotivations for fear that were listed above. Included also must be an absence ofselfish or “ulterior” motive. A person who is pure of heart is without guile,and never harbors the slightest wish to make use of anyone without that person’swilling consent. He bears no malice toward others. Indeed, with the heart’spurity alone he automatically manifests virtually all the spiritual qualitieslisted above: absence of malice, harmlessness, forgiveness, truthfulness(selecting these four as examples, primarily).Perseverance (in the acquisition of wisdom and in the practice of meditation) isa distinct quality, demanding the continuous re-application of will power towhatever cause one believes is right and worthy. Perseverance, in its ever-newlycreative outlook, is different from stubbornness, which is a refusal tore-examine the facts, or to reappraise one’s position with regard to them.Perseverance means not to allow oneself to be dissuaded or diverted from one’sworthwhile goals, but to meet every difficulty creatively, with new solutions,until one’s ends have been achieved.Thus, perseverance means to be willing to re-examine one’s position and, ifnecessary, to correct one’s first assumptions, thereafter seeking ever-newavenues by which a worthwhile goal may be achieved. It means to be firm in thefaith that what is right and true must, eventually, come to pass, provided oneholds firmly to high principle.Sattwic charity means many things besides alms giving. It means being generousin the opinions one holds of others, owing to the simple realization that allmen are basically motivated by the same desire: for Satchidananda, divine bliss.Although most people seek this apotheosis in wrong ways, they do so out ofsimple ignorance. Thus, a charitable attitude must be based on what someonecalled out from the audience at a children’s recital: “Don’t be nervous, Susie.We’re all your friends!”When giving alms or helping others materially, make it an important point neverto convey the impression that you are placing the other person under anobligation. Bear in mind that he, too, must be allowed, in his receiving, topreserve his sense of dignity and self-worth. Give him something to do for youin exchange for what you give or do for him. Never try to make him subservientto you. Indeed, his dignity should be placed on a par with your own. Otherwise,to receive gifts can be demeaning, and can create at least a sense of havingbeen placed under an obligation, and can create (sometimes) a certain resentmentagainst the giver.Self-restraint means retaining always, even during times of sense enjoyment, thefeeling that one is centered inwardly in the Self. This doesn’t mean oneshouldn’t enjoy good things, but one should realize that the source of thatenjoyment is not in anything outer, but in one’s own heart. Sadhus and otherreligiously dedicated people sometimes recommend that one not permit himself toenjoy anything. This is a very dry attitude. To neutralize the vrittis, orvortices of chitta, as Patanjali recommends, does not mean to deaden one’sfeeling capacity, but only to calm one’s feelings and make them perfectlyreceptive. There cannot be consciousness without feeling. Indeed, feeling isconsciousness. Spiritual progress depends on refining the receptivity offeeling. This is possible only when the intuition is calm and, therefore, pure.Thus, in any sensory experience—the enjoyment of food, or sex, or of anything atall—never give in completely to the sensation. Remain somewhat restrained inevery expression of feeling. In this way, self-control will gradually come toyou easily, and you’ll develop effortless control over the senses.The performance of sacred rites is enjoined on all spiritual seekers. Listed asa quality, it must be understood primarily as an attitude rather than an outwardpractice. The practice of offering oblations into a sacrificial fire accompaniedby Sanskrit mantras that help to attune one with subtle aspects of vibration,and especially with the Cosmic Vibration, AUM, can help one to attain certaindefinite outward effects, but these effects, one should realize, will be limitedto the realm of maya; they cannot take one out of maya except to the extent thatone’s practice of them is accompanied by the thought of self-offering.On the other hand, mental self-offering (of heart as well as of mind) is thehighest sacrifice, and need not be accompanied by any external ritual, thehighest benefit of which is only symbolic.Service to holy persons, notably to the guru, should also be done with theheartfelt intention of receiving his uplifted consciousness into oneself.Study of the scriptures, again, is not an attitude, but can become so if onetakes it to mean reverence for the scriptures. Reverence for them will surelylead one to study them.It is important, however, to be discriminating in one’s choice of scripture, fornot all writings that are purported to be scripture are founded in higher truth.People often accept as revelation the writings of some well-meaning butspiritually unenlightened person, or of persons less well-meaning but ambitiousfor personal glory.Paramhansa Yogananda told the story of someone who wrote a treatise which hewanted people to accept as scripture. He then buried his document under a tree,and began giving religious discourses. Fifteen years later, affecting to beguided by angels, he, accompanied by a few followers, was “led” to that tree. Hedug there, and lo and behold! this “angel-materialized” scripture was“discovered.” Thus, a new religion was founded, and although the document itselfwas later “lost,” its subsequent versions continued to attract a largefollowing.Other false religions, similarly, have won many people by methods other thanscrupulous. What was appealed to was people’s credulity, not their intuitivediscrimination. Accept nothing that doesn’t appeal to your highest sense of whatis right and true. Even then, be guided by the supportive opinions of the wise.When wise persons in general agree on the spiritual authenticity of a document,then only—so wisdom dictates—may the document be safely accepted as truescripture.Self-discipline is included in the advice Krishna gave earlier to be moderate inall ways. Do not “flagellate” yourself, whether literally or figuratively—forexample, by depriving yourself of the sleep you need to remain mentally alert,or by denying your body the life-sustaining elements of a balanced diet.Straightforwardness means to be completely honest and truthful in all yourdealings. Any corners you “cut” in this respect will only weaken your powers ofaccomplishment, and will also weaken your ability to persevere to final successin any worthwhile undertaking. Both honesty and truthfulness harness one’s powerto the infinitely greater power of the universe. It is—to use a simile that hashelped us before—to turn that greater reality into something like the soundingboard of a musical instrument, augmenting one’s own efforts by making them“resonate” with the vibrations of infinity.Harmlessness is far from being ineffectual: It results in inviting the sympathy,cooperation, and support of all who tune in to your ideals.Harmlessness is not, as it may at first appear, passive. Once one has removedhis ego’s natural impulse to wrest what it wants from life, he achieves hisgoals effortlessly, often with willing help from others.Truthfulness might be included under “straightforwardness.” It has, however, thefurther connotation of not wishing reality to be other than it is. Be truthfulwith yourself. Don’t try to pretend even to yourself that your motives have beenbetter, perhaps, than they may actually have been. Only when we face reality asit is can we begin to change it to what it should be. If we have spoken rudely,for instance, we can only become gentler in our speech after we’ve faced franklythe fact that we have, indeed, spoken harshly on occasion.Freedom from anger comes from not desiring anything, whether things or “right”behavior in others. Anger creates a disturbance and an unsettling influence inthe brain. Righteous anger, of course, can be a virtue, but it is so especiallyif directed with calm will power through the spiritual eye. Because the pointbetween the eyebrows is the seat of will power in the body, energy directedthrough there can help to set the wheels of necessary change turning.Renunciation has been defined by Krishna as the transcendence, especially, ofselfish or otherwise ego-inspired motive. Thus, it means also nishkam karma:action without personal desire for the fruits of action. Renunciation meansgiving up all one’s attachments. The man who said, “My children died, my wifeleft me, I’ve been fired from my job, and my house just burned to the ground.I’ve decided to renounce the world,” hadn’t yet quite the right idea ofrenunciation. As my param-guru Swami Sri Yukteswar remarked wryly, “That manhasn’t renounced the world: The world has renounced him!” Renunciation must beprimarily of the heart.Tranquility means in all circumstances to be centered calmly in the Self within.When others are agitated (and you might be, too), tell yourself, “Things will benormal again in a few hours, or days, or another week—or another month—oranother year.” However long the period, it will end. The reason some religionsdescribe hell itself as eternal is that when suffering comes, it seemseverlasting. Nothing, however, is permanent. All is flux. All is change. No waveremains at its peak; no wave trough remains forever depressed. The wise man, inthe face of both fulfillment and disappointment, remains unaffected and evertranquil in himself.Disinclination toward faultfinding is, again, a willingness to accept situationsand people as they are. This does not mean one should never try to improvethings, or to help others to improve themselves. Whatever good one does in theworld, however, will be more effective if all of one’s efforts are directedpositively, and not in mere reaction to anything.Kindness to all is not compassion, as some people translate the Sanskrit word“daya.” It would be a distortion of genuine feeling to feel compassionate towardsomeone who had treated you unkindly, for it would imply condescension—as thoughyou looked down on him from above. In kindness there is no pride, but incompassion there might be, especially if you saw to it that others realized howvery compassionate you were. Kindness means the simple acceptance of others, andthe recognition that they are all, like you, striving for self-improvement.Non-covetousness means not wanting anything that is not yours by right.Gentleness means not trying to force anyone to act in any way contrary to hisfree will.Modesty is well expressed as not trying to draw attention to oneself. It is notthe same thing as backing bashfully into the limelight, so to speak. That isfalse modesty. True modesty in dress means not to appear either over- orunder-dressed, but (out of regard for the feelings of others) to dress simplyand in good taste. Modesty in demeanor means not to push oneself ahead ofothers, nor yet to exasperate others by excessive disclaimers of one’s ownworthiness. Modesty of speech means to speak only loudly enough to enable othersto hear; not to speak too much about oneself; and to show respect for (and, ifpossible, interest in!) the opinions of others.Steadfastness of purpose was allied, above, to perseverance. The two qualitiesare similar, but are also different. Perseverance (as indicated in the Gita)means not to allow anything to dissuade one from his high, spiritual ideals.Both perseverance in the quest for truth, and steadfastness in a lower purpose,are often mistaken by scatter-minded persons, or by those with differentinterests, for mere stubbornness. One should always be ready to consider thepossibility that one may have been mistaken, and in that case to change hisdirection instantly. However, granted that one’s purpose and ideals are right,it shows virtue to stand by them steadfastly.Radiance of character is more an attribute than a quality, but it shows in theeyes and demeanor of those who are inspired by superconscious insight.Forgiveness, often, is merely verbal. One may want to forgive, but the thoughtof the offense demanding forgiveness may continue to rankle in his heart.Forgiveness should therefore be coupled with the word, forget. Evenforgetfulness, however, can be a mistake if what is forgiven is an act thatmight recur. If, for example, a person’s behavior has revealed a flaw in hischaracter—betrayal, for example, or disloyalty—it would be wise to keep thatflaw in mind during future dealings with him, until the flaw has beenconvincingly corrected. One may accept that person even as a friend, and as suchforgive him, but one should also bear in mind his potential until adequate proofhas been given of full eradication. Most people (indeed, all of them, except thewise) have flaws. It would be a bleak world if one carried always the feelingthat no one could be trusted! One should also ask himself, introspectively, “Andwhat about me? Haven’t I, too, faults to overcome? Let me therefore be lenienttoward others.” Nevertheless, when someone shows his true nature, accept him ashe is (forgive him, in other words), but behave toward him in future withappropriate awareness and common sense. Forgiveness means, in the last analysis,giving a person a chance to reform, but also recognizing that an apology is notin itself the same thing as reform.Fortitude, or patience (the two words are often paired), means to keep thecompass of your intention ever pointed toward the polestar of high purpose, nomatter how many influences intrude to deflect it.Cleanliness is an outward reflection of an ordered mind. When someone keeps hisperson clean—either his body or his clothes—it is an indication of self-respectas well as of regard for the feelings of others. One time in America ParamhansaYogananda met a man who was unkempt, filthy, and seemingly indifferent to whatanyone thought of him (though quite possibly this was a pose intended to shockothers, which of course would have shown definite interest in their opinions!).Yogananda asked him, “Why do you appear like that?”“I’m a renunciate!” announced the other, proudly.“But you’ve become attached in a new way,” the Master replied, “—to disorder!”Malice is an all-too-common flaw of those who think the world owes themsomething—or anything. Absence of malice, like kindness and forgiveness, enablesone to accept—indeed, to smile upon—the world without judgment, acceptingwhatever is as, simply, what it is.Absence of self-conceit may be translated as humility, or the absence of pride.Humility, however, is often taken as self-abasement and as a consciousness ofpersonal inadequacy—not before God, which is right, normal, and in factobvious—but before other people. Humility is not an inferiority complex!Self-conceit is often present, moreover, where pride is absent. It is thefertile soil in which the seeds of pride, given enough fresh circumstances, cansprout, grow, and flourish.Self-conceit, however, means to entertain, and not merely possess, certainfeelings about oneself. A famous singer, for example, would be deficient insomething if he didn’t know he was good at singing, and was famous for it. If heentertains that thought, however, and lets it feed his self-definition and makehim think it matters in the great scheme of things: that is self-conceit.Krishna now gives the nature and destiny of those with the opposite qualities.(16:4) Vainglory, arrogance, self-conceit, wrathfulness, harshness, andignorance—these, O Pandava (Arjuna), mark the person whose nature is demonic.Vainglory is ostentation, boastfulness, extreme vanity, and an exaggerated senseof the importance of anything one does. It is setting oneself on top of ananthill and crying out, “I have conquered Mount Everest!”Arrogance is an exaggerated opinion of one’s own importance relative to themerits of anyone else.Self-conceit has already been defined and explained. Essentially what it meansis holding an almost-invisible hair so close to one’s eye that it seems as thickas a tree trunk.Wrathfulness is a tendency to lose one’s temper, with or without good reason,because one lacks control over the presumption that people and circumstancesought to be other than they are.Harshness comes as a result of insensitivity to the needs and feelings ofothers, and of a wish to impose one’s own feelings on the world around him.Ignorance, finally, means having no notion as to what is true or false, real orunreal. It doesn’t necessarily mean lack of education, though certainly itindicates a lack of refined feelings. Ultimately what it means is to mistakewhat is not for what is. It means spiritual, not merely intellectual, ignorance.What Krishna has outlined are the qualities of an asura, or demon. Such beingsinhabit not only the regions of hell, but may be found in abundance, as humanbeings, here on Earth.(16:5) Divine qualities lead to liberation. Demonic ones lead to (continued andincreasing) bondage. Fear not, however, Arjuna, you are endowed with divinequalities.It may seem strange that Arjuna should need this reassurance. No doubt hedidn’t. Yet every devotee who wants to be completely sincere with himself, whoknows the ego’s seemingly infinite capacity for self-deception, and who hasdiscovered how difficult it is to see oneself as he really is, must ask himselfsometimes, “Am I as I should be?” It may often happen that others criticizehim—especially if he is trying earnestly, as they are not, to become spiritual.Thus, it is a consolation which every devotee should take to heart. “Krishna,”he should reflect, “offered this reassurance even to so great a devotee asArjuna! And he said that even an evil man who tries steadfastly to become goodshould be counted among the virtuous. Need I worry, really, as long as I trywith all sincerity to improve myself?”(16:6) There are two types of men in this world: the divine and the demonic. Ihave described at length the divine. Now hear Me, O Son of Pritha (Arjuna), on(the subject of) the demonic.There are in the universe, as we’ve seen, not two but three qualities (sattwa,rajas, and tamas) in a varied mixture of expressions. There are at the sametime, however, only two directions of movement: upward, and downward—or, moreexactly, upward and downward in the spine. The quality of rajas is in between,and might be described as asking, in a vacillating way: “Where to, next?” As thesattwic qualities are the upward answer to that question, the demonic ones arethe downward answer.(16:7) The demonic do not know the meaning of right action, and do not know whento refrain from acting.When moved by strong urges, whether sexual or covetous or prejudicial to others,they act without consideration for the possible consequences.(16:8) They say: “The world is without fundamental morality. There are noabiding truths. There is no God. There is no system in the universe; it is allaccidental. There is no aim in life, apart from lustful pleasure.”Their “philosophy” might be expressed with these words: “When passion reigns,conscience goes into exile.”(16:9) Feeble of intellect, such self-ruined men cling to their (darkened systemof) beliefs and commit countless atrocities. They are the enemies of mankind,devoted to its destruction.Virtuous people find it difficult to believe that such evil exists on earth. Itsproponents, moreover, often proclaim teachings (if they have a degree ofintelligence) that are designed purposefully to win others to their side:teachings like “the greatest good for the greatest number,” and “to eachaccording to his needs, from each according to his ability to give.” On theactual field of activity, however, they show themselves nothing butpower-hungry, ruthless, and utterly cynical in the application of theirso-called “idealism.”Such people appear in every age. Usually, they are more or less successfulaccording to how many dissatisfied Shudras, and well-meaning butundiscriminating intellectuals, they can persuade to fill their ranks.(16:10) Abandoning themselves to insatiable desires; hypocrites; pretending anoble purpose; filled with self-conceit; insolent (to anyone who disagrees withthem); their concepts (assuming they have any) twisted by delusion; theiractions prompted solely by impure motives;—(16:11) convinced that the fulfillment of physical passion is man’s highestgoal; confident that there is no world (and no life) but this one: such personsare engrossed until the moment of death in earthly cares and concerns.(16:12) Bound by the fetters of hundreds of selfish hopes and expectations, andenslaved by passion and anger, they strive by unlawful means to amass fortuneswith which to purchase sensual physical pleasures.(16:13) “This much,” they say, “I have acquired today, (putting me in a positionto) attain this desire. I have this much money at present; my goal, now, is toacquire more.”(16:14) (Or they say:) “(Today) I have slain this enemy. Next, I shall slaymore. What I’ve wanted, I possess. I am successful, powerful, and happy!”(16:15) (Again they say:) “I am wealthy and well-born! Who can rival me? I willshow my greatness by giving alms and making public sacrifices. I will rejoice(in my glory)!” Thus they boast, befuddled by their own lack of wisdom.(16:16) Addled in thought, caught in (a spider’s web of) delusion, craving onlysensual “delights,” they sink (in life, and even more so after death) to a foulhell.(16:17) Vain, (heedlessly) obstinate, intoxicated by pride in wealth,hypocritical in whatever sacrifices they perform, careless of scripturalinjunctions,—(16:18) egotistical, ruthless, arrogant, lascivious, prone to (fits of) rage,these evil-intending persons despise Me (though for all that) I dwell in them,as in all beings.It is the practice in some religions to decry “idol worship,” by which is meantthe erection of images to remind people of Abstract God or of high, impersonalideals. The true idol worshipers, it should be pointed out here, are those whoworship the false gods described in these stanzas: idols of ego, lust, pride,and the host of other materialistic goals so many set for themselves.(16:19) These cruel perpetrators of evil, filled with hatred, worst of the humanrace, I hurl again and again into demonic wombs on their return to earth.(16:20) Cursed and fallen, filled with delusion life after life, (far from)attaining Me, they sink to the lowest depths.It is frightening to contemplate the people one meets, or has met, in life whomanifest some, or even many, of the above traits. They are human beings, and notdifferent outwardly, at least, from everyone else. Many of them are rich,successful, publicly respected. Some of them are famous thinkers, philosophers,writers, scientists. And yet, self-declaredly, they subscribe to at least someof the views Krishna describes as demonic.It would be convenient, and no doubt reassuring, to believe that worldly successis always the fruit of good karma, and that wealth, prominence and even fame,power, and all the accoutrements, at least, of the kind of fulfillment manypeople seek are necessarily proof that one has done at least something right byany definition of the karmic law. Unfortunately, the escape route from maya isnot so clearly defined as that! As Krishna points out—and even though happinessought to be (and indeed is, when rightly understood) the criterion ofvirtue—evil people often do consider themselves happy in a dark way that doesnot understand calm, pure happiness. This “happiness” is not unlike the“pleasure” one feels when scratching a mosquito bite, an act which hurts, yetsomehow feels good at the same time! Nevertheless, those with nothing better tocompare their state to may delude themselves into believing they have everythingthey want in life, and that all they need now is more and more of the same. (Forof course they can never get enough.) The “fulfillment” they seek is like thecarrot dangled from a stick and tied to the head of a donkey which draws himforward, pulling a heavy load. Out of arrogance, moreover, such people shoutdown or loudly dismiss any attempt to persuade them they are wrong.Many people of base consciousness are wealthy, powerful, and, by their owndefinition, “well born” (as Krishna puts it)—though that definition, by sattwicand even rajasic standards, is warped and confused. How is this even possible?It may be because karma itself is usually a mixed bag: The worldly success ofevil people may be due to good karma along with the bad. There is more to besaid on the subject, however. For much that passes for success in worldly eyesis not really even good karma, and may actually result in a person’s eventualspiritual downfall and long-range misery.There are two factors to consider. One is the fact that success comes as aresult of focused concentration. Energy can be concentrated by causing it toflow mostly in any direction. Complete focus occurs only when all one’s energyflows up toward union with God. There may be degrees of focused energy, however,in which the focus is on one specific image—success perhaps, or wealth, orpower. Thus, very worldly and even demonic people may for a time be so sure oftheir goals that they actually acquire the power they need to achieve lowerlevels of success.The other factor to consider is an image that was mentioned earlier in thisbook: that of the sounding board of a musical instrument. If God and angelicforces in the universe can reinforce one’s power through his attunement withthem, it follows that one’s power can also be increased by attunement withlower—indeed, with satanic—forces.It may even be easier to achieve this kind of increase through attunement withthe dark forces, which are closer to the human scene—especially to scenes withlow vibrations. If one invites them, they may respond eagerly. It isn’t evennecessary to invite them consciously—that is to say, by believing in evil and bydeliberately willing to contact it. A person need only live in some of the waysdescribed in the last stanzas. People’s very disbelief in the conscious power ofmaya constitutes one of her greatest victories.The downward spiral presumes also on the power derived from past good karma toreinforce present evil tendencies. “People,” my Guru once exclaimed inexasperation, “are so skillful in their ignorance!”Misery is, certainly, the final result of evil, and it is important tounderstand that such misery is self-inflicted. Indeed, the deluded mob of fallensouls may consider themselves well off, as we saw. They have what they thinkthey wanted. Many, many lifetimes must pass before such souls awaken to theirown higher truth—as all must do, in time, for divine freedom is the destiny ofevery soul.The question naturally arises at this point: how far can a soul fall? We sawearlier that our potential for expansion of consciousness is infinite. Thispotential must perforce, therefore, include also the potential to shrink—tobecome, in time, infinitesimal. The upward road cannot preclude the possibilityof a downward one also: indeed, it necessitates such a premise.Krishna has spoken of the descent of evildoers into demonic wombs. It must beunderstood that what descends is the soul in its identification with thebody—the ego, in other words. An individual may fall so far downward as to findcompatible self-expression only in the body of some lower animal, not that of ahuman being. A story came out of Tibet several years ago about a lama who,because of his misdeeds, found himself in the womb of an ass. As a man, he had,in his sexual overindulgence, behaved already like an ass!A fall to the level of the lower animals does occur, my Guru stated quiteclearly. He also said, however, that this fate, which is a great punishment,lasts for only one incarnation at a time. After a single lifetime as an ass, amonkey, a tiger, or as some other form, the soul, that has once reached thehuman level quickly returns to being human again.My Guru added, however, that if a person stubbornly, life after life, persistsin sinning, refusing to reform even after repeated forays into lower forms, hemay actually be cast very far down the evolutional ladder—as an insect, perhaps,or to some even lower form.Almost unbelievably, if one continues to sin without repentance, he may, afterrepeated, heavy punishment, be cast down as far as the level of a germ. Fromthis level he must work his way slowly up the ladder of evolution again. Howcould there be a quick reprieve? He has brought suffering on himself by willingto embrace darkness and ignorance.There are tamasic galaxies, infested with hordes of such degraded souls. Plaguesand similar scourges of Earth are often caused by an invasion of clouds ofdisease germs—fallen souls, brought here by their karma and by the karma of thisEarth. Their destiny is to be destroyed, here, by modern medicine.An evil-doer may not be fully aware of his misery. He may even persuade himselfsuccessfully, in his arrogance, that he is well off. Anyone, however, who hasknown a higher, more refined existence cannot but feel the intense (thoughsuppressed) pain of suffering—at least on a subconscious level, when he findshimself submitted to the indignity of confinement in a lower, animal, existence.Some suffering surely remains, and may even be exacerbated, when he findshimself living in the body of a rat, or a beetle. Probably, any awareness he hasof the degree of his indignity is somewhat muffled, but it cannot be quenchedaltogether.What, then, of the germ? Surely some higher awareness lingers during the long,slow climb back up the ladder of evolution—enough awareness, perhaps, to keep itsensing at least subconsciously, “There’s something wrong. I ought to be muchmore than this!” Whatever the case, some level of suffering could hardly fail tobe the lot of every fallen soul. The suffering would be born of an awarenessthat it has potentials that it is not expressing.The above realities are sobering! One would like to think of life as offeringless stark alternatives. Every devotee should take heart, however, from thesimple fact that, as Yogananda said, “As long as you make the effort, God willnever let you down.” And again the comforting words of Lord Krishna: “Arjuna,know this for a certainty: My devotee is never lost.” One further thoughtremains, both to stiffen one’s resolution and to brighten one’s hope: Once thedesire for God awakens in the heart, that desire must be fulfilled. It isalready his guarantee of salvation.(16:21) Lust, anger, and greed for gain: these are the three pathways to hell,leading to the destruction of soul-happiness. In man’s own interests he shouldavoid them all.(16:22) O Son of Kunti (Arjuna), by avoiding these three ways down into therealms of darkness, man acts for his own highest good, and sets himself on the(upward) way to the highest state.A monastic disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda fell in love with a beautiful womanand wanted to marry her. When the Guru tried to dissuade him, the young mansaid, “But she’s a wonderful person.”“Naturally,” replied our Guru. “Satan knows how to tempt you!”The disciple did leave his monastic calling, and in consequence suffered greatlyfor many years.The lure of “sex, wine, and money,” as maya has often been epitomized, emits anaura of almost visible attraction. Anger ensues when the desire for them isthwarted; hence the inclusion of anger in Stanza 21 (above). The very fact thatdesires can lead to anger should be a sufficient indication that the desiresthemselves are manifestations of bondage, not of freedom.(16:23) One who ignores the commands of scripture and follows his own ego-drivendesires finds neither happiness, nor fulfillment, nor the supreme goal of life.(16:24) Take (true) scripture, therefore, as your guide in determining whatshould be done and what should be avoided. With intuitive understanding of theinjunctions in holy writ, perform your earthly duties.The words, “intuitive understanding of . . . holy writ” are important, lest eventrue scripture be distorted by fanatics who use the scriptures to justifyheinous deeds. The ways of God are ever rooted in godliness. God may on occasionbe a “refining fire,” destroying evil and restoring virtue to its proper placein order to bring back a balance again to the affairs of man, but His vengeanceis never motivated by wrath, hatred, or vindictiveness. What seems so to men whoare afflicted with these faults is only a projection of their own nature.Krishna counseled Arjuna to fight in the righteous war of Kurukshetra, but healso urged him to fight dispassionately, without attachment to the results. Thisis the secret of true ahimsa, non-violence (harmlessness). Sometimes one mustdestroy in order to honor his higher duty. He need not, however, wishdestruction on anything or anyone.To the person of strong ego-consciousness, of course, destruction effected isdestruction willed. Such a person sees only God’s wrath when he himself ispunished—a fate he has, however unwittingly, willed upon himself. God does notwill our suffering. His will, which manifests personally in all of us, is forour eternal freedom in Him.Thus ends the sixteenth chapter, called “The Nature of the Godly and theDemonic,” of the Upanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue betweenSri Krishna and Arjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter ThirtyTHE THREE LEVELS OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICEKrishna, at the end of Chapter 16 of the Bhagavad Gita, recommended followingthe guidance of true scripture. Arjuna’s next ques-tion, proceeding from thatstatement, marks the beginning of the next chapter.(17:1) Arjuna said: Those who set aside scriptural rules, yet sacrifice (to God)with devotion—what, O Krishna, is the status (of their sacrifice)? Is itsattwic, rajasic, or tamasic?The point was made earlier that there are true scriptures, less true ones, andeven false or man-made ones. Arjuna’s question here is based on true, revealedscripture. His concern is twofold: Can the sincere exercise of devotion ever bewrong? And, Are there different qualities of devotion? For it is not enough tosay, “He prays with devotion.” There are different kinds of devotion, fromselfless to self-serving. Ultimately, the effect of prayer depends not on anyprayer-formula, however valid in itself, but on the attitude of the personpraying.Essentially, Arjuna is setting the scene for a discussion of the different kindsof devotion, rather than of the different kinds of people who practice devotion.Most tamasic people, especially, practice no devotion at all. Many rajasicpeople too, may practice devotion of a type more tamasic than rajasic.(17:2) The Blessed Lord said: (The issue involves) the quality of faithexercised—whether it is in fact sattwic, rajasic, or tamasic. Hear My words onthis point.(17:3) Each one’s faith depends upon his nature. As a man is, so is his faith.As his faith is, so is the man.We are, in other words, what we believe. All followers of a religion may declarean article of faith, and use exactly the same words day after day, week afterweek, year after year, but for all that there will be as many beliefs as thereare adherents. Each person’s understanding will be molded by what he himselfis—by his experience in life, his understanding, his personal preferences andprejudices, his likes and dislikes. It cannot be otherwise, for our entireunderstanding is based less on objective realities than on who and what we arein our own natures. Thus, a simple word like “home” will have very differentconnotations for one who was raised in a happy family than it will for one whowas raised by unfeeling authorities in an orphanage “home.” Words like “father”and “mother,” similarly, have different connotations for different peopledepending on the happiness, or lack of it, of their own home life. So hassuccess. So have many other words: work, kindness, travel, sport—indeed, so havevirtually all words in any language.We may declare, “I believe in God,” but that simple statement raises all sortsof images in different people’s minds. Most who call themselves atheists areonly rejecting some formal concept that others they know hold of God. No one,surely, however, would reject such concepts as love, or joy.To good people, God will seem good. To ordinarily selfish and ambitious people,God may seem a kind of “horn of plenty,” or—if not that—a stern judge or perhapsa kind of “boss,” more or less indifferent to human needs. To evil people, ifthey believe in God at all, He may seem filled with jealousy, anger, andvindictiveness—as are they themselves. To lustful people He will seem, like thegods of Greek and Roman mythology, consumed with lust. To kind people He willseem kind. To narrow-minded people, and to those filled with narrow prejudices,He will seem as they are: narrowly sectarian and grimly disposed to judge menfor their sins.(17:4) Sattwic reverence is given to the devas; rajasic reverence is offered tothe yakshas and rakshasas; tamasic “devotion” is the fascination some peoplefeel for ghosts and (astral) spirits.Good people revere God, of course, but they also love goodness in others, andrevere it in the angels.Worldly people bow with respect (mixed with anxiety) to anything or anyone theythink may help them to fulfill their worldly desires. Thus, rajasic “devotion”is described by Krishna as being directed toward the yakshas (the legendaryastral guardians of wealth). Rakshasas are reputed to be astral beings whosewrath or favor can unmake or make a person’s fortune.Tamasic devotion is not limited to the “devotion” felt by tamasic people—asentiment which few among them actually feel—but includes the lowest levels ofdevotional feeling itself, even if practiced by people of higher, perhaps ofrajasic nature.Of particular interest here is Krishna’s description of this last kind of“devotional” fascination. Many people (not only, we repeat, tamasic people) arefaddishly consumed with interest in communication with departed spirits, and(exaggeratedly so) in soliciting help from nature spirits—fairies, elves, and ahost of beings described in “fairy tales” everywhere on Earth.It is an all-too-common mistake to think that anyone “up there” who has passedbeyond the veil between the material and the astral world must have insightsthat are denied to the people of earth. The Gita is not necessarily saying thatthose who make this mistake are themselves tamasic. It is the form theirfascination takes that is tamasic, for it leads to spiritual confusion.Spiritualistic séances produce “guidance from the masters,” and from a widevariety of other supposedly knowledgeable entities. What makes these phenomena,and devotion to them, tamasic is twofold. First, they are imaginary. Second, toaccess this “information” one must enter a passive state of consciousness inwhich the thought process is not transcended in superconsciousness, but blankedout to “receive” whatever impressions come. This practice shows spiritualignorance, and is a doorway through which much mischief can enter.To contact a spiritual master, one must raise one’s consciousness to asuperconscious level. No master would deign to come through mediums—not becausehe couldn’t, but simply because to do so would convey the false message thatspiritualism is not only an easy way of communing with higher beings, but alsothat it is a spiritually acceptable practice. It doesn’t work. It is, as Krishnastates, tamasic.(17:5,6) Tamasic devotion also takes the form of trying to show off by theperformance of terrible austerities, unauthorized by the scriptures; byhypocritical displays, ego demonstrations, (the expression of) lustful passionsand attachments, and power madness. Senselessly (those with this kind ofdevotion) torture their body-elements, thereby offending Me, who dwell in theirbodies.The unnatural austerities mentioned here are practices like self-flagellation(which we’ve mentioned before), wearing hair shirts, piercing the body withsharp spikes, trying to achieve kumbhaka (breathlessness) by unnaturally holdingthe breath, and risking death by, again, depriving the body of the oxygen itneeds with a view to attaining a sort of giddiness that ignorant people equatewith superconsciousness. There are many methods, similarly misguided, that areindulged in by those foolishly seeking shortcuts to ecstasy: drugs, “sacred”mushrooms, and the like. These methods are not sanctioned by any true scripture,and are condemned by Krishna as tamasic.The body is the temple of God. It should be respected as such, and not abused asthough it, rather than its animating ego, were the thing to be “conquered.”Another display of tamasic devotion is indulgence in lustful passion, whether inthe name of falsely understood tantra or of trying to imitate the “lila” of thechild Krishna and the gopis. Gloating attachment to worldly pleasures with theexcuse, “Oh, it’s all God,” and the hunger for adulation with the ulteriormotive of controlling other people—all these practices, though one may claimthat they are conducted in the name of God, have no higher motive thanego-glorification.(17:7) Even the taste for food is, variously, sattwic, rajasic, or tamasic. Soalso the preferred types of yagya, or sacrifice, the penances, and the ways ofalmsgiving. Hear these distinctions.Every taste in food proclaims to some degree a person’s level of evolution. Soalso do his natural predilections regarding spiritual practices.(17:8) Foods that promote longevity, vitality, endurance, health, a cheerfulattitude, and a good appetite; that are pleasant-tasting, mildly flavored,nourishing, and agreeable to the body: such foods (give sattwic enjoyment and)are preferred by sattwic people.(17:9) Foods that are bitter, sour, heavily salted, excessively hot, pungent,sharp tasting, and burning (give rajasic enjoyment and) are those preferred bypeople of rajasic temperament. Such foods produce pain, discomfort, and disease.(17:10) Foods that are nutritionally worthless, tasteless, putrid, stale, thrownaway as garbage, or (otherwise) impure (give tamasic enjoyment and) arepreferred by tamasic people.The spiritual qualities of food should not be confused with their chemicalproperties. Discussed above are the vibrations of what one eats. For this reasonalso, it is important that food be prepared in an uplifted frame of mind, andnot under the influence of such harmful emotions as anger, grief, deep worry, ordepression.It may be said, basically, that sattwic food helps to calm the nerves and makethem clear channels for the energy flowing into the body, and for higherinspiration. Rajasic foods are stimulating to the nerves, to the point ofirritating them. Even poison, if it is taken in minute quantities, canstimulate, though too much of it kills. Rajasic foods have an exciting effect onthe body, whether slightly or pronouncedly, causing the flow of energy in thebody to become restless. Tamasic foods, finally—lacking as they are in nutritivevalue—merely clog the nervous system and make a person dull and unenergetic.Sattwic foods consist of fresh fruits and vegetables. The vegetables should belightly cooked, or even raw. This diet includes also whole grains and legumes,fresh dairy products, nuts, and such natural sweets as honey, dates, and figs.Cooked foods should be combined and prepared in such a way as to preserve theirnatural ingredients. Food should be pleasing to the eye as well as to thepalate—only lightly seasoned, and agreeable to the body’s constitution.Rajasic foods are, as indicated above, excessively stimulating to the lifeforces in the body, somewhat irritating to the nerves, and exciting in theireffect on the mind. Not all such stimulation is bad, however. For someone whoselife includes intense activity as well as meditation, a certain amount of rajasmay be helpful in stirring him to action. Onions, garlic, and eggs are examplesof rajasic foods that may prove beneficial for sattwic people also who need tobe busily active. Eggs are mistakenly considered a meat product: In fact theyare not significantly more so than milk products. Other rajasic foods includethose which are excessively hot, spicy, salted, or otherwise strongly flavored.Certain meats may be included in a rajasic diet: fish, fowl, and lamb.Tamasic foods are well described in this stanza. They include horseradish andalso such meat as beef, veal, and pork, which have been validly proscribed invarious religions. The slaughtering of these more highly evolved animalsproduces in them strong emotions such as fear and anger, which remain asvibrations in the meat itself and increase people’s naturally aggressive and/orfearful tendencies. Beef causes cancer. Pork is an unclean food, the verysweetness of ham being due, my Guru said, to the pus in it.Because the food one eats has an effect on mental clarity and upliftment, itplays an important role not only in one’s bodily health but also in one’sspiritual life.(17:11) That yagya (sacrificial rite, or performance of duty) is sattwic whichis offered without any desire for (personal) gain from the deed, which isperformed in accordance with (the teaching of) scripture, and with firm beliefin its rightness.(17:12) Yagya performed with the hope of reward, O Best of the Bharatas(Arjuna), and in a spirit of ostentation, is rajasic.(17:13) That yagya, finally, is declared tamasic which is not motivated byregard for scriptural injunctions, makes no (suitable) gifts of food or money,is performed without the offering of sacred chants or prayers, and is withoutdevotion (to God).Sattwic self-offering has only the highest “motive” of union with God. Rajasicofferings are made in the hope of selfish gain. The advice to have regard forscriptural injunctions raises two questions: “Which scriptures?” and, “Whichinjunctions?” As we’ve seen, not every so-called “scripture” is true. Certaininjunctions, moreover, even among those stated in true scripture, may have aspecial application to some particular time in history, to a particular culture,and to the general consciousness at the time. Jesus Christ, for example, saidthat a teaching of Moses (who was a true master in Judaism of earlier times) hadbeen given because of the “hardness,” at that time, of people’s hearts.The universal point in Krishna’s emphasis on scriptural injunctions may beexplained as respect for high tradition. After all, many people in the worlddon’t know the teachings of any religion—even that in which they may have beenraised. One who egotistically flouts the worthwhile traditions of his ownculture, however, ignoring them, or even substituting “rituals” of his own thatreflect a disregard for general opinion; rituals performed forself-glorification, without devotion to or faith in God, without dueconsideration for others (which would be shown by the distribution of food ormoney), and without any prayer or mantra to indicate that one is invoking theaid of a higher power: Practices like these are tamasic.There are three, or perhaps four, categories of religious tradition. The first,the sattwic, contains those which show an awareness that God can be realized.People in these traditions revere the saints. Under rajas, two categories may bediscerned: the sattwa-rajas as well as the “pure” rajas. The former traditions,sattwa-rajasic, have a strong dedication to ethical behavior. The people inthese traditions aspire to moral goodness, though not to holiness.Traditions that are more clearly rajasic are full of emotional displays. Theyencourage loud singing and exuberant physical displays such as rolling on theground or jumping up and down in a kind of ecstasy of agitated feeling.The tamasic traditions, finally, have a darkening influence on the mind. Theycontain dark rites such as voodoo, black magic and various other kinds ofsorcery, and dark practices, hypnotic in their effect, that are performed toinvoke evil forces for the wreaking of harm.(17:14) Veneration of the devas, the priestly, the gurus, and the wise; purity(of heart and deed); straightforwardness; sexual restraint; harmlessness(non-violence): these are considered the austerities of the body.(17:15) Speech that is pleasant, beneficial, and truthful without beingoffensive, the repetition of japa and recitation of the scriptures: these arecalled the austerities of speech.(17:16) Even-mindedness, cheerfulness, kindliness, serenity, self-control,purity of heart, meditative communion with the true Self—these are said to bethe austerities of the mind.(17:17) This threefold austerity (of body, speech, and mind) is sattwic innature; it is practiced by persevering seekers (blessed with) deep devotion, whodesire not the fruits of their actions.These sattwic “austerities” are the natural products of an upliftedconsciousness. “Austerity” in this context, therefore, suggests no grim effortsat self-restraint, but is a natural offering up of the mind intosuperconsciousness.(17:18) Those austerities which are performed for the sake of gaining respect,honor, and a good name—done, therefore, for the sake of show—are mereostentation, fitful and transitory. These are what are called rajasic.(17:19) Tamasic austerities are performed without reasonable purpose—(perhaps)for self-injury, or (perhaps) to inflict harm on others.Rajasic “austerities” are not laudable, but at least they are better than thetamasic ones. As Yogananda said, “It is better to do good for the sake of praisethan not to do good at all.” Tamasic rituals of witchcraft, sorcery, utteringincantations with a view to inflicting harm: Some of these practices have beenshown to be effective, but they inflict much more harm on the person practicingthem than on his victims. People with sufficient awareness to know that sheerthoughts and incantations can have power should have the common sense to realizethat the same force, once hurled, must perforce return, boomerang-like, to theperson who first hurled it as an anathema.(17:20) (In the matter of gift-giving) to give sattwically is to give without athought of receiving in return; to give because it is right to do so; and togive appropriately, at the proper place and time, and to one who is deserving.Sattwic gift-giving is of three kinds: material, mental, and spiritual. A giftof money to someone in need is good, but it is well also to consider Krishna’scounsel to give appropriately. If one had a million dollars to give away, anddonated one dollar each to a million people, the best they could do with itwould be to make some trivial purchase like a dish of ice cream. That sameamount of money, however, concentrated in a single worthwhile project could helpmany people significantly, over a long period of time.In the early days of the movie industry, many actors and actresses who becamewealthy handed out money indiscriminately to any friend who simply asked themfor it. They ended up poor. Had their giving been sensible and appropriate, theywould have been far less likely to suffer such a fate.My Guru used to say that to give food or money to someone in need is good; togive him a job is better; and to help him to become qualified to get a good jobis best of all. To give continuously to the same person would be to make him notonly financially but psychologically dependent on the giver.On a mental plane, to give good advice inappropriately, to someone who is notlikely to benefit from it, would be a mistake also. Give counsel charily, whenit is clearly wanted and requested, and never impose it on anybody: This issattwic counseling.To help people spiritually is best of all, for when they rise out of spiritualignorance they attain the true wealth of the universe. Spiritual sharing shouldfocus on the satisfaction one feels in giving, and not on the pleasure of beinglistened to (which would be a-sattwic, or unspiritual). Greater than words,however wise, is the sharing of uplifted vibrations. Those who wish to sharespiritually should be conscious above all of sharing with others theirvibrations of divine joy and inspiration.A spiritually aware person sees everyone as an expression of God, and asdesirous, in his heart, of the gifts which God alone can give him. He tries tohelp everyone according to that person’s capacity to receive. Above all,however, he tries to bring people to God.(17:21) A gift is deemed rajasic if it is given, perhaps reluctantly (in thethought of what one is losing), in the hope of getting something in return.It is, as we’ve already said, better to do good—including giving gifts—than togive nothing at all. Such giving, even with an ulterior motive, may be a steptoward learning to give in a truly sattwic way.Such rajasic gifts, however, being tainted with selfish purpose, always convey acertain lack of cleanness—like giving someone a glassful of muddy water todrink.(17:22) A gift is tamasic if it is given inappropriately: at the wrong time orplace, or to an unworthy person, or contemptuously, or with ill will.To give money or help of any kind at the wrong time is to give it where it canserve no good purpose and may even do harm. To give it at the wrong place is togive it insensitively or foolishly, without due consideration for the effectyour giving may have on others. To give it to an unworthy person may be, in thecase of money, to enable him to spend it for an unworthy cause; or, in the caseof advice, to give good advice to someone who may even turn it to some wrongpurpose. To give contemptuously is to give with the motive of slighting othersby showing your superiority to them. And to give with ill will is, in a sense,to curse the other one with potentially damaging energy even while pretending togive good energy.(17:23) AUM, Tat, Sat: This has been declared as the threefold designation ofBrahman (God). From this power issued, in the beginning, the wise knowers ofBrahman, the (holy) Vedas, and the (Vedic) sacrificial rites.This Holy Trinity, it should be noted, is the same thing as the true ChristianTrinity. Most scholars have wrongly equated the Christian Trinity with the threeaspects of AUM: Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva—the Creator, the Preserver, andDestroyer of creation.AUM is the Cosmic Vibration. We have explained this aspect of Spiritual Truthbefore, but it may be helpful to explain it briefly again in the presentcontext.Sat stands for eternal and absolute truth: the Supreme Spirit, above and beyondall vibration. Out of that oceanic consciousness are projected, at the time ofcreation, the waves of Cosmic Vibration, AUM. The three letters of AUM stand forthat vibration’s three basic aspects, personalized in Hindu tradition as Brahma,Vishnu, and Shiva.In the Christian Trinity, Sat stands for the Father, and AUM, for the HolyGhost. “Ghost,” in this case, stands for the divine breath, or cosmic “wind” ofdelusion, which raises waves on the surface of the ocean.Tat (meaning “That”—as in the scriptural declaration: “Thou art That”) is thestill reflection at every point of vibratory creation of the calm, unmovingconsciousness of the Spirit beyond all vibration. Thus, Spirit is presenteverywhere, though not visible anywhere because all that God’s creatures areable to observe, as creatures, is vibratory creation.Everything in existence is a manifestation of Brahman, the Supreme Spirit.Spirit’s first manifestation, however, is that which most perfectly expressesthe highest consciousness. Thus, those (the knowers of Brahman) who mostperfectly manifest wisdom, have expressed it most perfectly (in the Vedas, andin all true scriptures), and that which shows the way most perfectly—above all,the sacrificial rite of self-offering into the fire of wisdom, and theconsumption and reabsorption in Spirit of ego-consciousness—is best accomplishedby the true fire rite of Kriya Yoga, magnetizing the spine and raising theenergy through it to the brain.(17:24) Therefore, scripturally sanctioned deeds—sacrifice, the giving of gifts,and the practice of (the sattwic) austerities—are always (traditionally) begunwith the chanting of AUM.There is power even in the sound of AUM, rightly pronounced. Therefore let usrepeat here (as well as can be done in writing) how AUM should be uttered. Thesound is like the English syllable, “OM” (but more the American than the Britishvowel, which introduces a third sound, “e-o,” into the “equation”), because, asin American English, the “O” should be a double, not a triple diphthong. “A” inSanskrit has two sounds, a short and a long. The short is pronounced as it is inthe English, “a tree,” or “uh.” The long is pronounced like the “a” in “sharp.”Because “OM” is pronounced in other languages (which commonly have pure vowels)with a single vowel sound (“o” as in the vowel sound of the English word,“gone”) it should be written, as it is in Sanskrit, as three distinct sounds:“O” as in “gone,” or (short “a”) as, “uh”—“U” (like the “o” in the English word,“who”)—and a long-drawn-out, not briefly uttered, “M” (like a short “humming”sound). Alternatively, in English, it may be written, “Uh—oo—mmm.”This sound, as we’ve said, has great power. It serves somewhat the same purposeas the word, “Amen,” which is uttered at the end of Christian prayers.Originally, the meaning was the same.(17:25) Those who seek (spiritual) liberation should perform all the rites of(ego)-sacrifice (true yagya), gift giving (sharing with others whateverblessings are received), and (the sattwic) austerities while concentrated on thehigher Self (the Christ consciousness, or Kutastha Chaitanya in oneself),without any wish for (specific) results.Kriya Yoga (and all other meditation practices), sharing (especially truth, andhigher inspiration), and sattwic austerities (listed in Stanzas 14–16 of thischapter): all these should be practiced with a consciousness of deep calmness,centered in the inner Self.One of the traditional gifts performed after yagya (sacrifice) is an offering tothe guru. Gifts of food and money can easily be seen as symbolizing the highergift of truth and inspiration to the “needy”—that is, to those who can benefitfrom this higher gift—but some people may object, “How can such higher gifts begiven, even symbolically, to the guru?” The answer is that every true disciplemust mentally offer up to the teacher everything that he has and is, partly thathe might receive still further enlightenment; partly that any error in hisunderstanding might be corrected; and partly with that kind of gratitude whicheven the enlightened disciple always feels toward the source of hisenlightenment. Indeed, the enlightened disciple, even more than others, offershis eternal gratitude, in the form of obeisance, to him from whom hisenlightenment came.Not to desire results does not mean not to desire enlightenment. A truly sattwicperson need hardly be advised not to seek selfish fruits from his spiritualactions. He may need to be counseled, however, not to seek specific results,even spiritual ones, from his spiritual practices. Many meditators, for example,hope for visions and phenomena. Many who share even truth and inspiration wantothers to be helped, instead of leaving the results in God’s hands, or (a verydifficult thing to surrender) they want some outward manifestation of the Guru’spleasure or love for them. And many who practice austerities want (quite rightlyand understandably) to see some inner consequences of those practices. All thesedesired results do come, in time, to the sincere seeker, but giving upattachment to those results will keep one focused on doing, rather than onreaping benefits from, one’s practices, and therefore on continued effort untilthere is no sense of doing, doer, and done because one is merged in theInfinite.(17:26) The word “Sat” is the designation of the Supreme Truth (beyond vibratorycreation) and of the supreme goodness emanating from it. Thus also this wordrefers to every higher form of spiritual action.(17:27) Steadfastness in self-offering (sacrifice) to the Infinite, theausterities, and selfless sharing, and any activity connected with thesepurposes (for the sake of realizing the Supreme Self), is also spoken of as“Sat.”Yoga practice leads gradually from oneness with AUM, the Cosmic Vibration, tooneness with Tat, the Kutastha Chaitanya (or Christ consciousness), and finallyto merging into a state of oneness with Sat, the Supreme, Vibrationless Spirit(God the Father).(17:28) O Partha (Arjuna)! Whatever sacrifice is offered, gift bestowed, orausterity performed, if (it is done) without devotional faith it is calledasat—“untruth.” Both here and in the hereafter, it has no (spiritual) value.Deep, devotional faith is an utter necessity on the spiritual path. Yet thereremains a simple truth: One cannot have faith before coming onto the spiritualpath! Faith, as we saw some time back, means more than belief. It is what comesafter receiving some spiritual insight. Indeed, perfect faith comes with deeprealization.What Krishna is referring to here, then, is that provisional faith (belief, infact) which is born of the conviction that only in God will one find everythinghe has been seeking in life.Krishna means also that one should abandon as early as possible the absurdtendency of the doubting mind which, sitting on the river bank and fearful ofplunging into the water, says, “Yes, but how can I be sure I won’t drown?”Compare what everything else has given you— nothing!—with even the first peaceand inner consolation you feel in spiritual practices, and even from theseexalted teachings in the Gita, and decide for yourself. The only thing thatmakes any possible sense in life is to go ahead and take the plunge!As long as you hold back, you will be inwardly divided against yourself, andevery step forward will be canceled by another step backward.Thus ends the seventeenth chapter, called “The Three Levels of SpiritualPractice,” of the Upanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue betweenSri Krishna and Arjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"feather_small.tif [../Images/feather_small_opt.jpeg]Chapter Thirty-OneYOU SHALL ATTAIN METhis final chapter of the Bhagavad Gita is a summation of the whole scripture.The teaching began with the blind king Dhritarashtra, a metaphor for the “blindmind,” asking Sanjaya (introspection) what had happened on the battlefield ofKurukshetra. Already in the first stanza the stage was set for spiritualreflection, not for the actual history of the epic war. For it is only after aninternal struggle, whether spiritual or psychological, that one asks, “Who won?”During the heat of battle one is too preoccupied with the struggle to askseriously how the battle is going. That question is reserved for later: the timeof introspection and calm reflection.The Gita immediately lists the psychological warriors facing each other. Andhere, suddenly, the question is addressed in the present tense: who the warriorsare, not who they were. For after the war, of course, many will have been slain.In the final analysis, the entire battle is between the ego (represented byBhishma, who is fighting for Duryodhana, or Material Desire) and the soul’saspiration for divine union. Bhishma has received the grace not to die until heoffers himself up to death. Thus, though riddled with arrows, he cannot dieuntil he himself wills it. Thus also with the ego: One can never be stripped ofit. It must, of its own free will, surrender itself to the Infinite.Renunciation (of ego), therefore, is the final message of the Gita. It isfitting that this, Arjuna’s earlier and very important question, should be posedat the outset of this final chapter:(18:1) Arjuna said: I desire, O Mighty-armed (Krishna), Slayer of (the demon ofignorance) Keshi! to know the true meaning of sannyasa (renunciation), and alsoof tyaga (self-surrender), and the distinction between the two.How, Arjuna is asking, can I tell the difference between renunciation and KarmaYoga, the essence of which is the renunciation of the fruits of action?(18:2) The Blessed Lord said: The wise understand renunciation to be therelinquishing of any action performed with (personal) desire. They also declarethat it is not action itself which should be abandoned, but only that actionwhich desires the fruits of action.Essentially, Krishna is saying, “Act, but don’t consider yourself the ‘doer’ ofthe act.”No one, he has explained, can abandon action. To breathe, sleep, eat, andperform all the necessary functions of the body must be classified under thegeneral term, action. No one, therefore, can renounce action altogether unlesshe is so spiritually advanced that he can sit the whole day in breathlessecstasy—a possibility for very few.The important thing, then, is to give up the sense of personal “doership.”Everything the renunciate does should be done with the thought, “God is doingall this through me.”The tyagi, on the other hand, may have to involve himself somewhat in personalactivities—wife, job, family, and social responsibilities—but for himself hemust desire nothing from any activity. This is the true meaning of Karma Yoga,and certainly is not substantially different from the path of outer renunciationexcept insofar as, if one need not attend to such outward duties, he iscertainly freer to pursue the path of giving his life to God alone, and finds iteasier to free his ego from all limiting attachments.Lest anyone think this easier way indicates a path requiring less courage, itwould be well to point out that the path to God takes all the courage andstrength one possesses. Only someone very foolish would choose the moredifficult path simply to show others (and perhaps also himself) that hepossesses these two qualities in full measure. Tantra is an approach to God thatteaches one to be strong in himself in the very teeth of temptation. It is a“back staircase” to God, and spiritually very dangerous. Far wiser is one whosaves his strength, instead, for the strenuous task—in every sense, in any case,a supreme task—of climbing up by the “front staircase” of right action,meditation, and renunciation of both the thought of “doership” and of desire forany personal gain from the doing.Krishna goes on to explain these thoughts more fully.(18:3) Some (theoretical) philosophers claim that all work should be forsaken as(being) tainted. Others insist that worthwhile activities (at least), such asyagya (sacrifice), philanthropic works, and (various) austerities should not berelinquished.(18:4) Hear now therefore from Me, O Best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), for tyaga(non-attachment to the fruits of action) has been declared, O Lion among Men, tobe of three kinds.(18:5) The activity involved in yagya (sacrifice), philanthropic works, and theausterities (listed in 17:14–16) ought certainly to be engaged in, and shouldnot be abandoned, for, when performed with wisdom, (they) purify the heart.(18:6) Even these (self-uplifting) activities, however, ought to be performedwithout attachment (either) to them or to their fruits. This, O Partha (Arjuna),is My decided and final view.We see here Krishna’s sublime practicality. He was no abstract or theoreticalphilosopher. He firmly believed in doing what works. Theoretically, to be sure,the highest truth is to be merged in Brahman. One who can spend his whole timein samadhi doesn’t need any teachings! Nevertheless, as Krishna points out, notto act also in ways that uplift the mind is to set a wrong example for those whowant to reach that state. Thus, the highest truth, for mankind, is that whichwill help everyone to reach the absolute state.In answer to those vairagis (persons of supreme dispassion), moreover, who saythat one should not enjoy anything in God’s creation, their counsel might evenbe considered an insult to God! They overlook the fact that it was God who madeeverything, through his instrument, Prakriti. How can He be pleased with anyonefor despising His handiwork? Surely the best attitude, and one which Krishnahimself recommends, is to enjoy inwardly, with the joy of God.(18:7) It is not (laudable, or) right to abandon dutiful action. To relinquishit when one is still in delusion is (in fact) considered tamasic.Indeed, not to perform right, dutiful actions is to open oneself to evil—as inthe saying, “The devil finds work for idle hands to do.”(18:8) One who gives up a duty because he finds it difficult, or because hefears it will cause him pain, relinquishes that action with rajasicconsciousness (motivated by desire and attachment). He will never attain anyreward from such renunciation.Desire and attachment, it must be understood, relate not only to what one hopesto gain, but also to what one wants to avoid. To rise above duality means togive up both desire and repulsion, attraction and aversion.(18:9) O Arjuna, one who renounces in a sattwic way performs dutiful actionsolely because it ought to be done, forsaking both attachment to it and thedesire for its fruit.It is common for people who want to do good in the world to want certain thingsin the personal conviction that those things are what the world needs. Suchaction may or may not be laudable, but a sattwic person allows God to decide insuch matters. He acts to please God, and not for any other motive. Moreover, heacts in accordance with divine guidance—either what he receives from his guru orfrom God directly. (A true disciple of a true guru will never pit one of thoseagainst the other.)(18:10) One who is wise in his renunciation is ever calm in himself, and isnever doubtful. He has no aversion to unpleasant actions, nor is he attached topleasant ones.It is interesting that Krishna associates calm renunciation with freedom fromdoubt. In fact, doubts arise—obviously so—from uncertainty, and uncertaintyarises from at least some degree of attachment. Where there is truly noattachment, one no longer questions whether he likes or doesn’t like what he hasto do: He simply does it.(18:11) It is not possible for an embodied being to abstain from actionaltogether. Tyaga (self-surrender) is possible, however, by relinquishing thefruits of action.This point has been carefully clarified before. Krishna is only re-emphasizingit here.(18:12) The fruits of action (for those who are attached to them) are threefold:pleasant, unpleasant, and mixed. They accrue after death (in the astral world,or in the next incarnation) to those who have not renounced them. For theself-surrendered, however, they do not accrue (to oneself).A question sometimes arises with regard to the jivan mukta, who is free fromego-consciousness: “Does he create no karma?” Every action, it should beemphasized, is karma. Action is the very meaning of karma. Yes, of course, anego-freed being creates karma. Because he has no ego-identification with hisactions, however, their good results accrue not to himself, but to his disciplesand to the world generally. All action has to have a reaction, which in his casewill naturally be a good one, but there is no “post” of ego to which the actionis tied; therefore its karmic result either comes back to those for whose goodhe did it, or expands outward in blessing on the world. Indeed, all the actionsof a saint are both particularly and universally beneficial.(18:13) O Mighty-armed (Arjuna), hear from Me now the five causes of all actionand its accomplishment, as chronicled in the supreme, Shankhya wisdom, and themeans of eradicating (the last vestiges of) karma.The teaching of Shankhya is based on man’s need to free himself from his bondageto karma by eradicating its roots, which may be seen as the basic cause of allhis physical, mental, and spiritual suffering. The teachings of Yoga givemethods for accomplishing this eradication. Vedanta, the meaning of which is“end (or summation) of the Vedas,” describes the nature of Brahman, the SupremeSpirit, union with which is the ultimate goal of all spiritual striving.Without the eradication of karma, as taught in Shankhya, and without thetechniques for controlling the mind and energy as taught in the yoga science,man would not find it possible to emerge from the suffering he undergoes insubjection to cosmic delusion.These three systems are not distinct and separate from one another—and arecertainly not mutually exclusive, as certain scholars have claimed. Each of themsimply emphasizes different aspects of the same truth. Man must know why it isimportant to extricate himself from the meshes of karma. He must know how to doso. And he needs to know, at least intellectually, what the consequences will befrom his doing so.Without the right method of extrication—through renunciation, first, of thefruits of action—man will continue to flounder in his first efforts. Again,without yoga practice to help him gain control over his mind, energy, andbreath, which keep him tied to body-consciousness, he can try futilely forlifetimes to reach that center of perfect calmness without which truerenunciation is not even possible. Thus, although the goal of all spiritualpractice is renunciation of ego-identification with that little reflection ofSpirit, the body, and the realization of one’s fundamental oneness with theSupreme, to proceed on this path by mental aspiration alone is inadequate.(18:14,15) The five causes of all action—of right action as well aswrong—performed by man in body, speech, and thought are as follows: (1) thehuman body itself (as the seat of action); (2) the causative agent of action(the ego, or jivatma); (3) the various instruments of action (senses, mind, andintellect); (4) the various kinds of action (the power of speech and the motoractivities of hands, feet, and rectal and genital organs); and (5) destiny,which is the influence exerted by past karmas or actions, and is the “presidingdeity” of all action.(18:16) Considering how many factors are influential in human action, anyone,lacking this awareness, who thinks of his ego as the sole doer of everythingaccomplished by him shows no understanding at all.Man little realizes how much of a pawn of many influences he is when he performseven so simple a task as sitting down to eat. First, the body he feeds is notthe fixed, solid reality it appears to be, but is constantly changing: its cellsforever being removed and replaced. It is also not even physically solid, butonly a temporary wave of energy.Second, he imagines that he, John, is eating according to his own wishes,tastes, and convenience. Apart from the obvious fact that those “wishes” aredictated by the body’s needs; that those “tastes” are dictated by his upbringingand habits; and that his “convenience” is dictated by social convention, by thewishes and convenience of others, and by the influences of his ownupbringing—apart from all these obvious factors, it is not even John who doesthe eating! John’s ego, which thinks he has seated his body at the table, isonly the soul dreaming a separate, narrowly confined bodily existence.Third, the instruments of action: the senses, mind, and intellect—members of the“committee” of which he is “chairman”—are not always obedient to his wishes, butmay in various ways rebel. They may, for example, see things differently, andnot accept his intentions.At a certain dinner party many years ago, the hostess, hoping to create apicturesque setting, hung green Japanese lanterns over the table. Unfortunatelyfor her wishes, the green color shining on the meat made the meat lookunhealthy. Though it tasted as good as it was meant to, all of the guests becameill from eating it; for some, a stomach pump had actually to be brought!The ears, and their power of hearing, also may rebel—if, for example, while Johnis eating, a woman in the house next door is sobbing loudly and long. Variousother examples might be given to show the senses of smell, taste, and touchsimilarly affected, influencing his intention of eating.His intellect, also, may be affected by a variety of unsettling factors, and hismind, though the passive perceiver, may perceive several things unclearly.Fourth, one can imagine various adverse influences from the kinds ofaction—one’s own or someone else’s careless speech, for example—and disturbancesfrom the other parts of the body affecting the ego’s decisions. In fact, even as“chairmen of the committees” of what we think of as our own bodies, we are notnearly so free to act as we like to imagine.Moreover, even the chairman of the board of directors of a large company mustobey the wishes of the stockholders, over which he himself has little or nocontrol. And this brings us to the final cause of action, the fifth: Past karmacan enter unexpectedly onto the scene in an infinite number of ways, renderingnull and void any present decision made by the ego.(18:17) He who is above the hypnosis of ego-motivation, and whose understandingis clear (because undistorted by false perception), is not the slayer on thebattlefield (of Kurukshetra), and commits no sin in the slaying.The truth, as pointed out heretofore, is, first, that no one is slain—and thisfor two reasons: There is no such thing as death, but only transition. Moreover(still under the first reason), what are actually being “slain” in this allegoryof war are not people, but evil tendencies in oneself. Their activating energyis simply being redirected toward their opposite, virtuous tendencies.The second aspect of this stanza’s teaching (giving, as it does, a briefoverview of material that came before it) is that the sin of slaying accrues tothe agent of the act: the ego. When all consciousness of ego has been transmutedinto a realization of God as the sole Doer of everything, no karma accrues tothat ego. This does not mean that, armed with an ego-free attitude, one can doas one pleases! One doesn’t “please,” in that state, to do anything except God’swill.(18:18) Knowing, knower, known: these three together constitute the impulse toaction: doer, awareness of the deed, and the deed itself.Thus, we see here even more limitations on the ego, these being an explanationfor the action itself: not its “five causes,” but what happens in order to makean act possible. Subtle refinements like these serve the practical purpose ofhelping to convince the ego of how little freedom it has in its egoic state. Indivine consciousness, knowing, knower, and known are one and the same. Theperson is, in fact, the thing known: he is not only the knower. Thus, forexample, learning, for him, is no longer difficult, since he already is thatknowledge! He is also the act of knowing, which means that, in learning, hedoesn’t really absorb anything new. In accomplishing a task, even a big one, onewho has merged his ego in the larger Self considers no task too big. Must heclimb a mountain? He already is that mountain, and therefore doesn’t view it aslooming high above him. Not thinking of himself as having to do that strenuousclimb, the act of climbing is already a part of his own reality: climber,climbing, and the thing climbed are one. With such awareness, an arduous tasklike this may take, relatively speaking, hardly any time at all—although forpeople who lack this awareness it might take an unconscionably long time, and beaccomplished only by Herculean effort.(18:19) Awareness of an act, the accomplishment of that act, and the personaccomplishing it are described in the Shankhya system as being of three types,according to the gunas involved. Hear Me now about the manifestations of thesethree types.Clearly, what one does, how he does it, and the spirit in which he does it areall influenced by the mixture of sattwa, rajas, and tamas in his character. Fewpeople are—in fact, it must be said, no one is or can be—completely one type oranother, but it would be helpful to understand the factors involved in what hehimself, or others around him, are seeking to accomplish.(18:20) O Arjuna, understand that influence to be sattwic in which the oneindestructible Spirit is perceived (as residing) in all beings, (“undivided inthe divided”) and not as separate in each of them.The image of a motion picture theater is apt here. The countless images on thescreen are only changing manifestations of the one light shining steadily behindthe film in the projector. Such is the sattwic view of reality. It influenceseverything one does by bringing a unity to what others see as disunity, andharmony, therefore, to what others see as disharmony or even chaos.(18:21) That influence, on the other hand, which is based on seeing themultiplicity of beings as real (in themselves) is, by nature, rajasic.The influence of rajas on a person’s nature inclines him to see himself andeveryone else as being motivated by ego, selfishness, and personal motive.(18:22) That influence is tamasic, finally, which views every effect as thoughit had no connection with any other, and which disregards as irrelevant themotive, whether valid or trivial, behind the act.People acting under the influence of tamas never think of action in terms ofkarmic cause and effect. They consider the act itself the reality, as somethingquite independent of whatever motivated it. If they are fired from a job,whether or not they deserved to be fired is irrelevant to them. They are onlyupset by what they conceive to have been their mistreatment. If they arecriticized for something they’ve done, they turn the cannon of outrage on thecriticism itself, not on the question, “Did I deserve to be criticized?” If theydo a job badly, they protest, “Well, but at least I got it done, didn’t I?” Andif someone feeds them food that they don’t like, they don’t say, “Well, I knowyou meant well.” Instead, they are simply distressed not to have been given whatthey liked.(18:23) That action is sattwic which is divinely inspired, performed withcomplete non-attachment, without any sense of likes or dislikes, and without anydesire for its fruits.At this point we come to an explanation of the actual relationship of the threegunas to activity, rather than discussing the influences of the gunas onactivity.Sattwic action is motivated by superconscious inspiration. It is performedwithout attachment, without likes or dislikes, and without desire for any fruitsaccruing from it. Once again it should be pointed out that this is not beingoffered as new information, but is simply a review of what has been said atlength previously.(18:24) Action is rajasic if it is motivated by desires, if it is performed withego-consciousness, and if it produces a sense of great (stress) and effort.The more sattwic an action, the greater the sense of ease that accompanies it.On the other hand, the more rajasic it is, the greater the sense of effortbecause ego-consciousness cuts off higher power and inspiration, giving one theillusion that he must solve every problem and complete every labor by himself,alone.(18:25) Tamasic action is performed heedlessly, without measuring one’s ability,and in disregard of the possible consequences, (for example) failure, injury, orsome other disaster to oneself or others.It is interesting to see how often it occurs that opposites resemble oneanother. In this case, the attitudes described as tamasic might correspond, on ahigher level, to sattwic ones: faith, non-attachment to the fruits, andfearlessness. Yet it is not like a circle closing itself. Rather, it is anupward spiral, as if one returned to some of the same attitudes he held in hisimmaturity, but at a higher level of more mature understanding. The soldier whohurls himself heedlessly against an enemy line learns, with experience (assuminghe lives through the event!), to be more careful, and may even become intenselyfearful. One who has offered his ego up to God, however, and who feels that Godalone is acting through him, may be perfectly conscious of the dangers he facesin battle, yet if he feels this is what God wants of him, he may throw himselfwith the same, though more conscious, courage as the tamasic warrior, completelyaware of everything his courage entails.(18:26) That action is called sattwic which is without ego-motivation, whichcares not for either fulfillment or lack of fulfillment, success or failure, andwhich is filled with courage and zeal.We have seen the difference in quality between tamasic and sattwic courage. Intamas, however, there is no true zeal. Zeal comes from selfless, but veryconscious, dedication to an idealistic cause. Thus, the “courage” of the one isblinded and dark, and is based on ignorance of (or indifference to, which inthis case is the same thing) the possible consequences. Sattwic courage, on theother hand, is based on perfect knowledge, and on acceptance of the possibleconsequences. It weighs sensibly in the balance, therefore, the likelihood ofits possible usefulness.(18:27) The instrument of action (the individual performing it) is calledrajasic if he is full of attachment to and longing for its fruits, if he is fullof greed, impure motive, and ruthless determination, and if he is jubilant ordepressed in the face of success or failure.Even in the light of what people want for themselves, those who leap up and downin victory, or sob themselves hoarse in defeat, deprive themselves of the clearenergy needed to carry to success whatever they do! Greed for gain, attachment,desire, selfish motive, indifference to the feelings of others—all these,combined with a jack-in-the-box reaction to everything, are great deterrents toaccomplishing well or to completing anything in life, whether worthwhile ortrivial.(18:28) Tamasic action is vacillating, vulgarly ostentatious, obstinate,unscrupulous, deceitful, (frequently motivated by) malice, lazy, andprocrastinating.There is no point in telling tamasic people how to cure their tamas. They seenothing wrong with being as they are. If they seem to accept your advice, itwill be only to “get you off their backs.” You may count on their betraying youor otherwise letting you down at the first opportunity. The only reason fortreating them with leniency and forgiveness will be for your own sake, to affirmyour non-attachment to the fruits of what they, too, are doing. Otherwise, bewarned by the above signs that tamas is at work in their nature. Such people arenever to be trusted, and if, out of charity, one agrees to work with them, oneshould always be aware of their dangerous proclivities. Never, for example,trust them to take the week’s income to the bank!(18:29) O Winner of Wealth (Dhananjaya: Arjuna), I will now explain, at lengthand singly, the threefold divisions of the gunas in their relation to people’scapacity for understanding and to fortitude.(18:30) That intellect, O Partha (Arjuna), is sattwic which understands thenature of right action and knows when to refrain from (even right) action; whichknows what should be done and what should not be done; which understands thedistinction between what ought to be feared (as wrong) and what ought to beembraced fearlessly (as right and dutiful), and between what constitutes bondageand what constitutes the path to liberation.This stanza speaks its teaching clearly and beautifully. It hardly requires anycommentary except, perhaps, to point out that Krishna has said there may,occasionally, be a right motivation for fear: when the action one contemplatesmight put one in karmic error.(18:31) O Partha (Arjuna), that intellect is influenced by rajas which causesone to perceive dharma and adharma (righteous and unrighteous action)distortedly, as also (any) dutiful and undutiful action.Consider the prospect of a war between one’s own country and another. The drumsof propaganda will beat loudly to proclaim the righteousness of one’s owncountry’s cause, whichever country it may be. Is that cause, however—in light ofa higher law—justified, or unjustified? The rajasic influence is already fullyin evidence, and will do its best to incite people to fight, through using loud,self-justifying slogans which claim the justness of the cause. Sattwic people,however, should withdraw their feelings to an inner center of calm intuition,and ask God, there, “Is this cause just? Would I be more justified in supportingit, or in refraining from involvement in it?”Sometimes, as with the war of Kurukshetra, and as it would be were one’s owncountry invaded by hostile forces, the cause may be adjudged right andjustified. Sometimes, however, it is not karmically justified. Would one, inthis case, be right to object, pleading conscience? Or, if the ethics of thesituation seemed mixed, would one be right to show loyalty to one’s own countryby accepting a draft into the armed forces? These are matters of conscience, andshould be settled by the discriminating individual at that level.For rajasic people, however—the great majority of them—the decision is quite asimple matter: launch into it, no matter how lurchingly. Activity, to therajasic, is its own reward.(18:32) O Partha (Arjuna), that intellect is tamasic which, enveloped inignorance, thinks that wrong is right, and judges everything (not only dharmaand adharma) distortedly.Tamasic people, if they have some intelligence, use whatever dim reasoning theycan muster to justify obviously false conclusions. They’ll say (and in factnotoriously have said), “Well, if I steal from this unlocked car it will be agood lesson for the owner. He’ll learn to lock his car the next time, so as tokeep thieves like me from entering it.”They will march with self-righteous zeal in support of a dictatorial cause, andsee those who resist the cause as “enemies of the people.”(18:33) (In the matter of steadfastness,) sattwic fortitude depends on steadyingthe mind by yoga meditation, and keeping the energy of (both) body and sensescontrolled by pranayama.Sattwic fortitude depends not on grim determination, but on being centered inthe Self, and on keeping the breath and the body’s energy calm by regulating theflow of prana and apana in the spine.(18:34) Rajasic fortitude manifests itself in clinging fast—whether to duty, tothe objects of desire, or to possessions—and demanding (for oneself) the fruitof every effort one expends.This “clinging fast” produces tension, anxiety, and uncertainty in everythingthat person does who acts under the influence of rajas. People under thisinfluence loudly demand their “rights.” They are often obsessed with the fear ofbeing robbed or burgled. And even if they have a good desire, they allowthemselves to be so seized in its jaws that, for them, there can be no other“cause” in the world!(18:35) Tamasic fortitude, O Partha (Arjuna), manifests as addiction to sleep,obsession with whatever one fears, utter absorption in grief, abandonment todespair, and overweening arrogance.The tamasic temperament tends toward extremes, in other words—to the point wherereason is completely abandoned. Unable to see beyond the horizons of presentreality, whatever that may be, if a tamasic person sorrows, he can’t imagineever feeling calm on the subject again; if he does something well (or is praisedfor it, however undeservingly), he preens himself absurdly on his excellence. Ifhe fears something, his fear is, for days, all he can talk about.(18:36) Now hear from Me, O Best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), the three kinds ofhappiness, transcendent above which is Supreme bliss—the consequence ofcontinuous inwardness of mind (through meditation). In bliss (alone) does oneachieve the end of all sorrow.It is fitting that Krishna begins his discussion of the kinds of happiness thatare under the influence of the three gunas by referring to the bliss thattranscends them all. All human happiness is relative. Only in absolute bliss isthe end of all sorrow attained.(18:37) That (human happiness) which is called sattwic (is attained throughwhat) seems in the beginning like poison, but in the end is like nectar, andleads to the clear perception of the Self.It is more difficult to climb a mountain than to slide down it. Virtue isdifficult to practice in the beginning, and may, like poison, have a bittertaste. After a time, however, it becomes easy to practice and tastes as sweet asnectar. There is a certain magnetism in higher consciousness that draws the souleffortlessly, as it were, upward—once a certain point in one’s sadhana has beenreached. There is a saying that applies, here: “When we lift up one hand to God,He reaches two down to help us.”(18:38) That happiness is rajasic which arises from contact of the senses withtheir objects. It seems like nectar in the beginning, but in the end is likepoison.Sensory enjoyments may often seem, in the beginning, as sweet as nectar. If weconsider them the source of our enjoyment, however, they soon turn bitter and,indeed, poison our happiness. Good food is pleasant, but if we consider it thesource of our happiness we may overeat and become too heavy, flaccid, and proneto disease. Wine may be pleasant to the taste, but if we consider it, too, asource of happiness we may drink to excess and become alcoholics. The same mustbe said of anything and everything that is enjoyed through the senses: sex,drugs—everything. Surfeit never fails to end in boredom, disgust, and,sometimes, in tragedy.(18:39) That elusive happiness is termed tamasic which begins and ends in thedeluded stupor of over-sleep, drunkenness, and slovenliness.The choice to live in mental darkness comes from bad karma, reinforced by badcompany. There is also the draw of the almost-familiar: We have come up fromless conscious levels of awareness in lower animals. Subconsciously, that memorylingers, and exerts the attraction of effortless ease. A comfortablealternative, it seems, to the long, steep climb up the mountain to Perfection.Having the choice eternally before us between effort and ease, it is hardlysurprising that many cry out, in effect, “Stop bothering me; let me sleep on!”This tamasic tendency, though pronounced in some people, is present at leastlatently in everyone. It has a certain magnetism of its own, rooted in nostalgiafor old, subconscious habits. Everything in Nature manifests a blend of thethree gunas. Watch your own mind for any reluctance you may feel to do what youknow you must do. That is the influence in you of tamoguna. Of its loweringtendency on the mind it may be said, “Give it an inch, and it will take a mile.”(18:40) There is no one in the material world (or in the material universe), noramong the gods in the astral heavens, who is free from the three qualities, orgunas, born of Prakriti (Cosmic Nature, the manifestation of God).As my Guru put it, the fabric of creation is held together by the threads of thethree gunas. Even saints manifest tamoguna (tamas), although, relativelyspeaking, to a very mild degree. They manifest it in the fact that they sleep,or take rest. Even tamasic or very evil people, moreover, show the sattwicquality to a mild degree when they do anything good for anyone. My Guru told astory about a very wicked woman who bit into a carrot she’d stolen, found thatit contained a worm, and gave it carelessly to a passing urchin. On reachinghell after death, that one “good deed” was recalled as her only (relative!)merit.(18:41) O Scorcher of Foes (Arjuna)! the duties of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, andVaishyas, as also of Shudras, are (inborn and diverse) according to the gunasuppermost in their natures.Krishna separates Shudras in that way (saying, “as also of”) because thementality of a Shudra is not given to taking the term, “duty,” seriously.Paramhansa Yogananda often said that the real “races” of man have nothing to dowith the color of people’s skin. It has everything to do, however, with theirstate of consciousness. The true divisions of the human race may be discernedvertically, not horizontally. They are the four natural castes.At any congress of accountants, let us say, from many countries and from everycontinent of the world, the attendees will display a unanimity of basic outlookthat they may not feel with their own next-door neighbors. Monks from differentparts of the world will feel a greater kinship with one another than, possibly,with their own relatives. Businessmen will understand one another naturally andeasily, even if they have to converse through translators. What people do, andeven more so the kind of people they are, separates them into categories thatcut across all barriers of language, nationality, and skin coloring.Svabhava (one’s own inherent nature) is the word Krishna uses here, indicatingclearly that caste-distinctions depend not on heredity, but on what each personis in himself. This subject has been gone into extensively already, and need notbe restated here at length. Krishna himself is merely recapitulating, for thesake of emphasis.(18:42) The inherent duties of a Brahmin (the highest caste) are mind control(concentration), sense control (by the practice of pranayama), self-restraint,purity, forgiveness, integrity, wisdom, meditation to attain Self-realization,and faith in a higher truth.The question may be asked, “Aren’t all these things, being good, the duty ofevery man?” Krishna, and indeed the caste system itself (as rightly understood),simply accepts reality as it is. What people should do and what they are capableof doing are not by any means always one and the same thing. Even theself-restraint, purity, and integrity expected of a person of spiritualrefinement differ from the best one can expect from people with less refinednatures. Self-restraint in someone who is devoted to amassing riches might meanshowing the “kindness” not to ruin a competitor completely. Purity might meanelecting to refrain from gouging a customer even when the opportunity presentsitself. And integrity might mean admitting that merchants (Vaishyas) elsewhere(in another city perhaps, and thus at a safe distance away) may offer betterprices on certain items.A sattwic person, and one therefore who is by nature a Brahmin, has a duty tobehave in a manner that is more refined, because his nature makes such behaviorpossible. He should nevertheless reach up toward the perfection of hispotentiality for virtue. Where a lesser person might deserve praise forrelatively generous deeds, a sattwic person, and therefore a true Brahmin,deserves none, and in any case should not desire it, should it so happen thatothers appreciate his godly qualities. Any praise owing to his behavior shouldbe both offered and accepted for the quality of goodness alone, which he merelymanifests. Sattwic virtues are, as Krishna put it earlier, like smoke, whichslightly obscures a fire but can be easily dispelled with a little puff of the“wind” of meditation. Since the fire can be seen through the smoke, appreciationfor the light and warmth of the fire is given rightly to the fire alone, shiningthrough the smoke, and not to the smoke itself which, to some extent only,obscures the fire.(18:43) The natural duties of a Kshatriya are valor, vigor, fortitude,resourcefulness, skill in action, standing up firmly to the enemy (whatever kindof “battle” is involved), munificence, and leadership (of a kind that inspiresothers).Kshatriya types are not always in a position to fight in battle, to show couragewhen faced by an enemy, or to lead others to victory. The qualities of aKshatriya, however, show up under all circumstances. In one incarnation a personmay be a ruler, and in the next, a monk. The ruler may not—indeed, surely willnot—be always at war, and the monk may have no one over whom to rule buthimself. In character, however, the two will be basically the same. It is thecharacter of a Kshatriya that determines what he really is. A true Kshatriyastands up for what he believes, but his rectitude will be appropriate. In thehome, for instance, he doesn’t stand up to his wife if she wants to go out todinner but he himself doesn’t want to. In that case, he is munificent—within thegeneral meaning of the term: not, that is to say, as a heroic concession to herwishes! As a monk in his next incarnation, he will probably have no enemies tofight, but he will have spiritual tests, perhaps temptations, and times ofdifficulty with others. In such cases, instead of fleeing he will stand up tothose tests courageously. If in any difficulty with others he can practicemunificence by holding an understanding attitude, he will show himself willingto see their point of view.Thus, in many ways it may be seen that a Kshatriya is one who has Kshatriyaqualities by nature, and who doesn’t only display them under necessity.(18:44) The duties of a Vaishya by nature are tilling the soil, cattle breeding,and business. Those of a Shudra are service to members of the higher castes.The duties of the Vaishya must be reckoned by his own individual “reality,”which begins with a rajasic, ego-centered attachment to things. Thus, eventhough not all societies on Earth, nor every place even within one country,concern themselves with farming and cattle breeding—cities, for example, offerfew if any opportunities for rural activity—and though even merchandising is afairly circumscribed activity, nevertheless there are many Vaishya types in alarge variety of gainful activities, and there must have been such even inKrishna’s (perhaps) simpler times, which cannot be listed in exact categories.We must begin, therefore, with the underlying purpose of those Vaishyaactivities which the Gita lists. First, what makes any action a duty? Speakingof man’s duty to society, it is that which will best serve society as a whole.Krishna’s concern, however, is with the individual’s spiritual progress.Therefore, the duties of a Vaishya must be those activities which can help himto rise spiritually. Activities that will help him to fulfill his own desire forgain and for ego-, or for self-, expression, and which may at the same time helphim to raise his consciousness, include such things as all kinds of artisticexpression. Yogananda listed artists, in fact—including composers, novelists,sculptors, musicians—as Vaishyas. Yet one can well imagine that this designationdoes not include those as Vaishyas who create works of art, music, andliterature for the upliftment of others! Those, rather, who create such worksfor money, and for people’s mere pleasure or diversion, are what he meant by theterm, Vaishyas.The “mere” in that last sentence is not meant derogatorily. To give estheticpleasure to others can be a means of raising their, and one’s own, awareness,and of clarifying one’s own and other people’s understanding.The duty of a Vaishya is to include the benefit of others in his own activities.Thus, he will become more sensitive to the needs of others, and will develop, intime, the nature of a Kshatriya.Shudra types can only grow spiritually by mixing with those of a higher level ofconsciousness than themselves. The most practical way for them to do so is tohold positions of service under persons of greater refinement.(18:45) Each one attentive to his own duty, men rise toward the highest success.Hear now how, by devotedly pursuing his own duty, one may rise toward that finalend.Caste should be determined, not by one’s parentage or by social expectations,but by the nature of the individual himself. Indeed, without even defining aperson’s natural caste, one usually finds it naturally, himself. Parents mayhelp a child to get the sort of education that is best suited to his actualneeds, but when the child himself attains an age and a level of maturity todecide such matters for himself—even to move out on his own—he alone mustdetermine, finally, what his place is. As for his duty, that can be at leastsuggested by others who are perhaps wiser and more mature than himself.Always, one’s duty (as distinct from one’s predilection) should be determined interms of what will help him to rise—both toward a higher caste and toward ahigher influence of the gunas.(18:46) One attains perfection by offering his own special gifts up to Him outof whom all beings were manifested, and by Whom the whole (universe) ispermeated.Whatever one’s particular gift, one can advance best, spiritually, by offeringthat gift up to God. God, on the one hand, will perfect that offering and helpthe person to excel at whatever he does. He will also help that person who longsfor truth to walk in the direction of inner freedom.Here again we see, recapitulated, Krishna’s advice to Arjuna to act, and not totry to reach God by abandoning all activity. The only qualification to thisteaching is its balancing one: “If a duty conflicts with a higher duty, itceases to be a duty.” In other words, if there are several things one can dowell, he should concentrate on that activity which will most expand hissympathies and uplift his consciousness.Many commentators have claimed that Krishna in this stanza is saying that oneshould follow whatever vocation is traditional in his family. They are mistaken.In a settled society, and not one that is under transition as the whole world istoday, this advice might at least be generally acceptable (though one wondershow anyone, following it, would ever become a sannyasi!). In an age, however,when society itself is in flux, this counsel could be ruinous! The truth is,everyone in this world is, simply, himself. He comes into his family as a guest.Being transient, he should take nothing outward as defining who and what he is.Every human being must follow his own star. The higher one rises toward innerfreedom, the more imperative becomes this advice.(18:47) It is better to fail attempting to follow one’s own dharma than tosucceed in following the dharma of another. One incurs no sin in trying tofulfill his own duty.(18:48) O Son of Kunti (Arjuna), one should not abandon the work dictated by hisown nature, even though (the work) contain some imperfection, for allundertakings (even the best) are marred by blemishes, even as a flame is(obscured) by smoke.It should be pointed out here, incidentally, that anything done withego-consciousness creates karma, and that any creation of karma cannot but bevaried in quality and consequence. Hence, it ought not to be necessary to add:of course one can create bad karma, as well as good, through anything he does,even if he “only tries” to do his duty. The point Krishna is making is that indoing one’s own duty one is not setting up a new pattern of activity (karma) tobe worked through to its conclusion. If, for example, one knows it to be hisdharma to help children as a schoolteacher, but, responding to the advice ofothers, he settles for a better-paying job as a truck driver, he may be a goodtruck driver, but he will advance no closer to fulfilling his first karmicpattern, and may in fact add a new pattern created by an entirely new set ofexperiences and type of companions.Everyone’s highest duty is to seek God. To pursue this duty may effectivelycancel out every other karmic pattern—so that if the schoolteacher decides to gooff and live with a group of people who are seeking God, and is not able in thatnew environment to teach children, he will in any case have chosen a higherdharma, and one which will take him more surely up to that divine “summit” whereall duties end. To fail in that task will also be more liberating for him thanto succeed as a schoolteacher, for it will take him eventually out of karmaaltogether, whereas teaching school will only aid him on the path toward goodkarma, but not necessarily toward liberation.(18:49) That person comes closest to attaining perfection who keeps hisintellect non-attached to everything outside the Self, who reigns in victoryover the Self, and from whom (all) desires have fled.The true rulers in this world are not those who sit proudly on their thrones,but those who rule themselves to perfection. The king or emperor can commandpeople’s outer activities, but none can tell them what to think, feel, believe,or how simply to be, in their hearts. That man, however, who has command overhimself can inspire, and can therefore truly lead, thousands.(18:50) O Son of Kunti (Arjuna), hear from Me how he who attains such perfectionfinds the culmination of all seeking in) Brahman.To become perfect in one’s Self is to attain Infinite Consciousness. There is noneed to seek wisdom outside the Self. To know even one atom to the depths of itsmystery is to possess the secret to all truth. The objective atom cannot beknown this way, but the ego can be so known. Once one traces the ego to its“lair” by removing from it the last veil between it and God, there will benothing else to attain. Space and time are illusions. To know one’s Self is toknow God! To know one’s Self is to know everything!(18:51) Absorbed in complete purity of the intellect, subjugating body andsenses by resolute self-restraint, protecting oneself (as much as possible) fromnoise and from other sense-entanglements, relinquishing both attachment andrepugnance;—(18:52) abiding in a solitary place, eating lightly, controlling the body,speech, and mind; absorbing oneself in divine yoga meditation; dispassionate;—(18:53) serene; self-surrendered; relinquishing (any lingering) attraction topower, vanity, lust, anger, possessions, and the consciousness of “me” and“mine”: such a person qualifies to become one with Brahman.Purity of the intellect requires, first, that one give up the tendency of thehuman intellect to “figure things out,” as though life were only a puzzleneeding intellectual solution. The yogi learns to approach any problem orquestion by holding his mind up to the downflow of superconscious inspiration.Wisdom comes not by careful reasoning, but by simply knowing in one’s Self whatthe answer is. “Solution-consciousness,” not “problem-consciousness,” is the keyto wisdom: holding the mind up to that higher aspect of knowing which alreadyhas, and can provide, every answer.Protecting oneself from “noise” is more properly translated, “sound.” Somesounds, however, are not intrusive. “Noise,” therefore, is more readilyunderstandable. The sounds of nature—wind in the trees, bird calls, and othercommon sounds—are not intrusive. If one must sit for meditation where automobiletraffic and other sounds intrude on one’s concentration, one continuous sound(like flowing water, or a waterfall) may suffice to block out those individualsounds sufficiently to prevent one from noticing them.Abiding in a solitary place is, for most people, not possible. Krishna himselfin the Gita repeatedly advises the performance of normal, dutiful action—a wayof life that, for most people, precludes solitude. How, then, to follow theadvice he gives here? The answer, for many people, is: by creating a “place ofseclusion” in one’s own home. Set aside one room, or even a screened-off portionof your bedroom, where the only activity allowed is meditation. Superconsciousvibrations will develop there, and will effectively “screen out” thesurrounding, worldly atmosphere.The other points in these stanzas are self-explanatory.(18:54) One attains supreme devotion to Me, and can be absorbed in Brahman, whois always inwardly calm, who never laments and is without desire, and whobeholds all beings with equal mind.A human image made of salt, if it is immersed in the ocean, will dissolve andbecome lost. The human body, by an interesting coincidence, is very similar toocean water in that the percentage of salt in the blood and that of salt in theocean are the same. Were one to immerse himself in the ocean, however, his wholebody would not dissolve, for it is composed of other elements besides salt andwater.What keeps man’s consciousness separate from Satchidananda (divine bliss) is, ofcourse, the fact that his consciousness is composed of other elements also.Prominent among these “elements” are restlessness; the wish that things wereother than they are (lamenting the state of anything, in other words); desires(which keep him from feeling complete in himself); and likes and dislikesregarding people and things (which keep him forever putting forth energy toattract and repel). Only when these “elements” are transformed into the “salt”of devotion (that one-pointed feeling which alone is capable of merging one’sconsciousness in the ocean of bliss) is one capable of becoming absorbed inBrahman.It often happens that great yogis emerge, for a time, from that great ocean inwhich their consciousness has been dissolved, and reassume the individualitythey once had as human beings, in order to enjoy again an I-and-Thourelationship with the Lord. Because they are now pure “salt images,” however,made only of the same “elements” of consciousness as those contained in theocean, they can merge back into Him any time they wish.Ramproshad, a great devotional saint who lived in the eighteenth century inBengal, India, once sang, “Oh, even though a thousand scriptures declare Thee tobe nirakara (formless), come to me in the form I love: as the Divine Mother ofthe universe!”(18:55) By supreme devotion to Me he can quickly realize Me in My true nature:what and who I am. Knowing these truths, he can unhesitatingly enter into Me.(18:56) Over and above the faithful performance of all one’s duties, and takingshelter (completely) in Me, he must still be received by My grace.It is important to understand that God, because He is above His law, cannot bewon only by following His law. No mathematically exact formula can induce Him toreveal Himself. Man thinks too easily that he, himself, can cause things to gothe way he wants if only he will make the correct effort. This is, notably, theattitude of modern scientists. It is the attitude of many doctors, who thinktheir patients’ health depends on them—on their correct diagnoses and on themedicines they prescribe. Yet doctors know that there are cases in which they,in their efforts, go completely “by the book,” yet still have had patients whodied. They know also that cases which seemed to them hopeless have recovered allof a sudden, quite unexpectedly.The ego can intrude in so subtle a fashion that even at the last step of thejourney, some people think they themselves have made it by their own effort.This simple thought is enough to keep them from merging completely in God: It isthat little bit of consciousness which reveals that one has not completely takenon all the “elements of the ocean.” Freely we should give of ourselves,expecting nothing in return, and only loving Him who is our very own. Will He,then, give Himself to us? Yes, certainly! The very presumption, however,implicit in that word, “certainly,” is enough to prevent us from completelybecoming (it is more than acquiring) that perfect state of consciousness!(18:57) Mentally devote your every action to Me. See Me as your Supreme Goal.Uplift toward Me every discernment of your intellect. Thus, with love, absorball your heart’s feelings in Me.(18:58) With heart absorbed in Me, you shall (also) by My grace overcome everyimpediment. If, however, with any (lingering) thought of ego, you do not fullyheed Me (by absorbing My consciousness into yours), you may (even then) bethrown down again to your destruction.The destruction intended here, my Guru explained, is temporary. Still it ispossible even after achieving sabikalpa samadhi to fall again into delusion fora time, until that last samskara (tendency) of being a separate individual, andto that extent separate from God, is dissolved.(18:59) If, indulging your ego, you should determine, “I will not fight,” youwould have to fight anyway, obliged to do so by Nature (your own, as well ascosmic).That devotee who, after incarnations of struggle and effort, has acquired thenature of a spiritual warrior determined to vanquish every inner weakness, willbe driven to fight anyway by that nature (and also by the help of Cosmic Nature,which his efforts have summoned), until every delusion is vanquished.These words of Krishna’s are supremely reassuring. For it does happen that thedevotee, even after long struggle to perfect himself, recoils suddenly,thinking, “Oh no, not this one, too!” Some delusion may seem particularly dearto him, and may even persuade him to think in protest, “Why must I give up eventhis (fond) idea, or this (dear) attachment?” Fortunately for his devotion, oncehe has reached the firm resolve to offer himself wholly to God, even God(through Prakriti, or the Divine Mother) will protect him, and will keep hisfeet firmly on the path. His fleeting nostalgia for that “sweet” aspect of mayaevaporates, and he finds himself once again determined to engage in yet anotherbattle.This next stanza is a reminder that, ultimately, our very strengths andweaknesses are not our own: they are the operation of cosmic forces, through ourhuman nature. Here, however, Krishna is saying that Arjuna had already won thoseinfluences to side with his higher, spiritual aspiration and efforts.(18:60) O Son of Kunti, that (momentary) delusion—the ripened fruit of a pastkarma—which has now made you reluctant to fight will be snatched from you byanother (good) karma, and you will find that you have (no choice but) to fightanyway.In the beginning, one’s “second nature” (namely, habit) impedes his spiritualefforts. He may want, for instance, to meditate all night, but habit may forcehim to sleep whether he wants to or not: He cannot keep his mind wakeful enoughto soar in superconsciousness—in fact, not to put too fine a point on it—hesimply cannot fight off the impulse to plunge heavily into the relative stuporof subconsciousness. (I remember our Guru telling us monks one day, “Lying inbed last night, I experimented going into subconsciousness. I didn’t like thatfeeling at all. I found myself hemmed in on all sides by the thick wall offlesh!”)Gradually, as the devotee keeps on trying, his higher nature takes over, and apower he thought beyond him manifests itself, making it impossible for him notto make the effort necessary to continue on to victory.(18:61) O Arjuna, the Lord is lodged in the hearts of all beings. His cosmicdelusion compels them to revolve as though they’d been mounted on a machine.These words are uttered to show man how insignificant is his ego in its constantthought, “I do,” and, “I am.” The words are not uttered to discourage anyonefrom trying to plunge into that stream which will carry him to Cosmicconsciousness, but to understand from where that power comes.The question arises in some minds, “How free, really, is human will?” Man isfree, my Guru said, to turn to God or to reject Him. Balancing the metaphor of amachine—something fixed, in other words—and recognizing the final inadequacy ofall metaphors, let us consider also another: a stream down which pebbles arerolled helplessly. There is another stream, however, which flows in the oppositedirection. Man has this much choice: He can decide, with each lifetime, whichstream he will enter: the stream toward greater involvement in maya, or thatwhich will take him away from maya to merge, eventually, in the cosmic ocean.(18:62) O Arjuna, make Him (alone), with all eagerness of heart, your refuge. ByHis grace you will attain the uttermost peace, and find shelter for alleternity.(18:63) Thus has wisdom, the most secret (and sacred) of all secrets, been givento you by Me. Reflect on it. Then do as you feel to do.We come now to that part of the eighteenth chapter which has made the BhagavadGita not only the most instructive, informative, and inspiring—perhaps of allscriptures in the world—but also the best loved.Krishna has expounded truths more clearly, exhaustively, and convincingly thandivine truth—ever one and the same everywhere—has ever been explained before,and has done it so succinctly and so wonderfully that no thinking person,surely, could fail to determine to give his whole life to the quest for God.It is marvelous that, after this exposition (so far) of nearly 700 verses,during which Krishna has set forth persuasively every human being’s need forGod, he still could end by saying, “Now then, do as you feel.”(18:64) Again, hear now My supreme word, the most secret (and sacred) of all.Because you are dearly beloved by Me, I offer it now for your highest benefit.Krishna’s words to Arjuna, here, are nectar-sweet. Is everyone, however, lovedso dearly by God as to be deemed worthy of receiving the Lord’s concern for hishighest well-being? Yes! All are loved equally by God. It must be added,however, that, if one would have incontrovertible proof of that love, he musthave a heart pure enough to receive it. A cup turned upside down cannot receivenectar which, otherwise, might be poured into it, filling it to the brim.Imagine a story in which a young man is born to poverty—perhaps in a city slumamong degraded people, with little opportunity for schooling because he mustwork to support his widowed mother and younger siblings. At night he studieshard, and becomes fit at last to obtain good employment in a large company. Herises in the ranks of that company, and is finally made a vice president. Atthose heights he meets the boss’s daughter. They fall in love, and, with theboss’s blessings, get married. Later, the boss dies. The young man inherits hisposition and also his palatial home.At the end of such a story, wouldn’t the reader exclaim with deep satisfaction,“What a beautiful story!”Now imagine another story: a young man, raised in a wealthy home, joining alarge company and, without any obstacles before him, becoming a vice presidentand marrying the boss’s daughter. Would it end by the young man’s inheriting theboss’s position, and moving with his wife into the boss’s palatial home? Quitepossibly so, but even more possibly the reader would have closed the book with ayawn, too soon ever to find out what happened in the end!The cosmic drama needs suspense, excitement, at times terror, and at other timesthrilling beauty. Man needs to feel that the ending to it all is highlyuncertain, and may, for him, prove disastrous. Only thus will his interestthroughout keep him “on the edge of his seat.” Every soul’s journey is unique.It is filled with uncertainties, with sorrow mingled with joy, with hope mingledwith despair, with triumph mingled with crushing defeat, with dark doubt as towhether life has any meaning at all followed by the discovery of human love, ofsuccess, of history-making knowledge, of undreamed-of power, of joyful laughterfollowed by heart-wrenching tears. If man could know, through this long journey,that God’s love was always with him—deeply, eternally, unconditionally—he mightwell preen himself on that “good fortune,” grow cocky, and never learn theattitudes absolutely necessary for entering into, and becoming one with, thatlove.He must learn to empty the vessel of his heart of all pride, all selfishness,all indifference. He must learn how to hold that vessel high, in pure andunconditional devotion, to be filled with the nectar of divine love. Only then,at the conclusion of his aeons-long adventure, will he learn that God has alwaysloved him. He may, then, hear those words, “You are dearly beloved by Me.”Not—please note—“I love you,” with the personal, ego-framed suggestion of an egoloved, but the more impersonal expression of love in which there is no separateindividual reaching out with love toward another individual.(18:65) Absorb yourself in Me; be wholly devoted to Me; worship and bow to Mealone: So shall you undoubtedly reach Me. This I promise you faithfully, for youare dear to Me.(18:66) Forsaking all other dharmas (duties), remember Me alone. I will free youfrom all sin (even from that of not fulfilling other, lesser duties). Do notgrieve!Man’s highest duty is to love God. All dharma serves the highest end ofdeveloping one-pointed, single-hearted devotion to, and love for, God, theSupreme and, finally, the Only Beloved.We told the story earlier of how Krishna once asked Draupadi, “Why don’t youpractice the techniques of yoga meditation?” Draupadi answered, “I would loveto, Lord, but how can I do so, when I can’t take my mind away from You longenough to practice them?” Hearing her reply, we said, Krishna only smiled.This is what Krishna means, here, about “lesser duties.” Of course, the correctpractice of yoga includes doing it with deep devotion. One should not take hismind away from God in order to practice it. Nevertheless, if the river of energyin the spine is flowing strongly upward through the heart to the brain, whatfurther techniques are needed? Yoga techniques have the purpose of directingthat energy upward, for those who can be helped by that extra nudge.(18:67) Never share these truths with one who is without self-control ordevotion, nor with one who won’t share with others in a spirit of service, norgive them to one who is indifferent to them, or who finds fault with Me.One whose life has been changed by finding the truth, or even by finding the wayto truth, naturally longs to help others to find the truth also. He shouldreflect, however, that each one needs to come to it in his own way, and at hisown time. Out of respect for others in their spiritual evolution, one should not(as Jesus Christ put it) “throw his pearls before swine.”One who has no self-control may view as offensive any teaching that emphasizesself-control. That person isn’t ready to face his weaknesses and may only reply,perhaps with resentment, “Now is not the time.” Nevertheless, most people knowin their hearts that lack of self-control has not given them fulfillment, buthas brought only suffering. Because of this very subconscious recognition, theymay resent being given premature advice on the subject.One who has no devotion, whose heart’s feelings are desiccated, who feels(foolishly) completely satisfied with himself, and who is accustomed to applaudsuch dry statements of “the lawyer types” as, “Just the facts, please,” maysneer at any manifestation of devotional feeling that expresses a heartfeltaspiration toward higher truth. To him, such feelings are “mere sentiment.” Whyoffer a beautiful chalice filled with ambrosia to someone who will merely spitin it or throw it away?Those who serve no one, who share with no one, who—miser-like—try to hoard alltheir gains, their sympathies, their concern (which they lavish only onthemselves), could never understand the selfless happiness of self-giving toothers. Instead, their hearts shrink inward upon themselves, become dry shellsof dead feeling, and turn angrily against anyone who suggests to them that theyeven consider the needs of others. Such people should be left alone, unless oneis blessed with great spiritual power to affect everyone’s life for the better.Suffering, alone, ordinarily, will provide the rain to soften such hearts andmake them ready to receive higher truths.Many people are self-satisfied and simply don’t want to hear about a better wayof living and believing. Such people, also, must be left to their own devices,until they themselves ask to receive more.There are people, finally, who presume to think the universe might be betterarranged than it is; or who blame God for their suffering, and do so in such away as not to “want to hear anything more about it”; or who accuse God of being“unfair.” In counseling others, never try to impose even good ideas on anyone,even if you are sure of those truths in yourself. People need to ask, first.They must seek understanding. To try to force even wisdom on them would be anoffense against their eternal birthright of free will.(18:68,69) Whosoever will, with supreme devotion, impart this supreme, secretknowledge to My devotees, shall without a doubt come to Me. No one among menperforms a more priceless service to Me. Nor is there in all the world anyonemore dear to Me.My Guru once told a group of us, “Pray in this way: ‘Give me Thyself, that I maygive Thee to all.’ That,” he concluded, “is the highest prayer.” To broadcasthigh truths without practicing them oneself gains one little merit, but to seekGod earnestly oneself, and, while doing so, to share one’s inspirations,discoveries, and growing wisdom with others is the highest divine service anyman can render to others—which is a service to God in them.(18:70) Whoever studies and (intuitively) understands this sacred dialoguebetween us will worship Me by the sacrifice (self-offering) of wisdom. Such isMy holy declaration.(18:71) Even that person who, full of devotion and without skepticism, merelylistens to this holy discourse, and heeds its teachings, shall become free fromearthly karma and shall be blessed to dwell in the high realm of the virtuous.Salvation is of two kinds: final liberation from all karma, resulting in unionwith God; and freedom from earthly karma, giving the possibility of living fromthen on in some high astral region from which one can work out his astral andcausal karma until he attains final liberation. Salvation from the need forfurther imprisonment on this material plane is in itself a great blessing, andcan be won even without (yet) achieving divine perfection.(18:72) O Partha (Arjuna)! Have you received this wisdom with wholly upliftedconsciousness? Has your delusion-born ignorance, O Dhananjaya, now beendispelled?(18:73) Arjuna answered: My delusion has been demolished! I have, by Your grace,O Krishna, regained the memory of my soul. I stand firm now, all my doubts andquestions answered and dissipated. I will act according to Your word.(18:74) Sanjaya said: Thus have I listened to this wondrous discourse betweenVasudeva (Krishna) and high-souled Arjuna. It has caused the hair on my body tostand up (so greatly have I been awe-stricken and thrilled with joy).(18:75) Through the grace of Byasa (the author of the Bhagavad Gita), thissupreme secret of yoga has been given to me, imparted directly to myconsciousness by Krishna himself, the great Lord of yoga.(18:76) O King Dhritarashtra, as I recall over and over again this wonderful,holy dialogue between Keshava (Krishna) and Arjuna, I overflow repeatedly withjoy.(18:77) And, O King Dhritarashtra, as often as I remember the cosmicmanifestation of Hari (Krishna, “Thief of Hearts”), I am overwhelmed withamazement, and am ever and again renewed with joy.(18:78) (Sanjaya concludes:) Such is my faith now that, wherever Krishna ismanifest, and wherever is Partha (the true devotee, Arjuna), expert wielder ofthe bow of self-mastery, there (I know) will be success, victory, the attainmentof (all) power (needed for any accomplishment), and the manifestation of allglory and righteousness. Such is my firmest conviction.Thus ends the eighteenth chapter, called “The Yoga of Release by Renunciation,”of the Upanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishnaand Arjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"GLOSSARYAdhibhuta.

Americans were hungry for India’sspiritual teachings, and for the liberating techniques of yoga.In 1946 he published what has become a spiritual classic and one of thebest-loved books of the 20th century, Autobiography of a Yogi. In addition,Yogananda established headquarters for a worldwide work, wrote a number of booksand study courses, gave lectures to thousands in most major cities across theUnited States, wrote music and poetry, and trained disciples.

Philosophically and artistically inclined fromyouth, he soon came to question life’s meaning and society’s values. During aperiod of intense inward reflection, he discovered Yogananda’s Autobiography ofa Yogi, and immediately traveled 3,000 miles from New York to California to meetthe Master, who accepted him as a monastic disciple. Yogananda appointed him asthe head of the monastery, authorized him to teach in his name and to giveinitiation into Kriya Yoga, and entrusted him with the missions of writing anddeveloping what he called “world brotherhood colonies.”Recognized as the “father of the spiritual communities movement” in the UnitedStates, Swami Kriyananda founded Ananda World Brotherhood Community in 1968.
