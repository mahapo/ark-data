The incomprehensibility of the miracles recorded in the Bible thus reduces other- wise intelligent minds to blind dogmatism or scornful skepticism. But why should there be cause for doubt when Nature constantly excites man with new revelations? Jesus prophesied: \"Greater works than these shall ye do.\"* He knew that the law of cause and effect was creating in this world an evolution of consciousness through which future generations would possess in incremental measure the means to bring about accomplishments theretofore considered miraculous. Amazing advancement will be witnessed as this present ascending evolutionary cycle continues toward its apex.f Scientific and spiri- tual knowledge will work more and more in harmony and ultimately in unity when humanity will gain the knowledge of the subtle laws that operate in the inner cosmos of consciousness. The spiritually evolved human being, gaining access to the microcosm of the spiri- tual eye, dissolves delusion's vibratory boundaries encapsulating the physical universe and brings on earth the superphysical capabilities of heaven. Already many of Jesus' phenomenal feats can be deemed credible because of modern physics, at least in defining principles long known to masters who manipulate these cosmic formulas as easily as a scien- tist mixes elemental substances to create new compounds in his labo- ratory.

All that is around us (in- cluding our own bodies) which appears so substantial is ultimately nothing but ephemeral networks of particle-waves whirling around at lightning speed, colliding, rebounding, disintegrating into almost total emptiness—so-called matter is mostly emptiness, proportionately as void as intergalactic space, void of anything except occasional dots and spots and scattered electric charges.\"! In The Mysterious Universe,$ Cambridge University physicist Sir James Jeans declares: \"Today there is a wide measure of agreement, which on the physical side of science approaches almost to unanimity, that the stream of knowledge is heading toward a non-mechanical re- ality; the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears as an accidental intruder into the realm of matter; we are beginning to suspect that we ought rather to hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter—not of course our individual minds, but the mind in which the atoms out of which our individual minds have grown to exist as thoughts.... \"The old dualism of mind and matter...seems likely to disappear, not through matter becoming in any way more shadowy or insub- stantial than heretofore, or through mind becoming resolved into a function of the working of matter, but through substantial matter re- solving itself into a creation and manifestation of mind.\" \"To put the conclusion crudely, the stuff of the world is mind- stuff,\" Eddington summarizes. *§ Boldly forthright about the limita- tions of merely material investigations, he has written: \"In regard to the nature of things, [scientific] knowledge is only an empty shell—a * Albert Einstein and Leopold Infeld, The Evolution of Physics: The Growth of Ideas from Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta (Cambridge University Press, 1938). f The Nature of the Physical World (Cambridge University Press, 1928). t Cambridge University Press, 1930. 5 The Nature of the Physical World (Cambridge University Press, 1928). 813"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"form of symbols. It is knowledge of structural form, and not knowl- edge of content. All through the physical world runs that unknown content, which must surely be the stuff of our consciousness. Here is a hint of aspects deep within the world of physics, and yet unattain- able by the methods of physics.\"* When man understands scientifically the spiritual nature of cre- ation and the mastery over its underlying laws possessed by illumined souls, he can accept not only the possibility of miracles, but that there are numerous ways by which they can be performed, as noted in the various modes of healing employed by Jesus. As to feeding the five thousand, one of the methods Jesus would have found effective is mental suggestion or mass hypnosis. A very pow- erful mind can impose on the mental processes of a crowd a belief in any suggested phenomena. Those who fall under such influence do not become un- conscious in all their other faculties and areas of rea- son, but are susceptible only to the particular sug- gestion of the hypnotist. If someone with very powerful magnetism impresses on a hungry person the positive thought that his stomach is full and his appetite satisfied, the feeling of hunger will vanish. Professor James of Harvard demonstrated that it is possible to produce actual blisters on the skin by the power of hypnotic sugges- tion. Mind is the main mechanism in the body. Once the mind becomes convinced about a thing, the body reacts accordingly. So Jesus, with his tremendous will power, could have used mass hypnosis to satisfy the hunger of the five thousand; but I doubt that he even considered it! Jesus instructed his disciples to see that the people were comfort- ably seated on the grass-carpeted ground, from which they would re- ceive some magnetism of the earth. Jesus then took the loaves and fishes and gave thanks to God, \"and looking up to heaven, he blessed them\"—he charged the offering of food with condensed cosmic en- * Space, Time and Gravitation: An Outline of the General Relativity Theory (Cam- bridge University Press, 1920). Speaking about methods of attaining a deeper insight into nature than that af- forded by material science, Professor Brian D. Josephson of Cambridge University, win- ner of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1973, commended the ancient Hindu systems of philosophy: \"Vedanta and Sankhya hold the key to the laws of mind and thought process, which are correlated to the quantum field, i.e., the operation and distribution of particles at atomic and molecular levels.\" (Publisher's Note) Jesus' use of the pow- ers of mind and life energy in feeding the five thousand 814"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ergy drawn from the astral region through his spiritual eye, so that even small portions were a satisfying meal. By his magnetic energy, Jesus also charged the partakers of the repast with magnetism, so that the cosmic energy he cast into the hun- gry stomachs of the multitudes opened the sluice gates of the reservoirs of energy in their brains and flesh, assuring no dearth of satisfaction. After the miracle, the disciples gathered up and filled twelve bas- kets with leftover morsels, evidence that Jesus actually materialized ad- ditional bread and fishes even as the blessed food was being distributed. Though bread is made by man and fish is caught by him from the ocean or lake, the wheat and the fish, and all things, were originally special creations by God, brought into being by His divine will and Cosmic Creative Energy. While science has proved the quiddity of the universe as electromagnetic radiations, coalesced into various forms, it has yet to devise instruments subtle enough to register the underly- ing source of electromagnetic phenomena: finer-than-atomic astral life energy and even finer thoughtrons, vibrations of an infinite con- sciousness. Masters such as Jesus know creation as God knows it and can manipulate intelligent cosmic energy to create at will any desired effect from its primal cause. In dreams, the mind of every person uses thought and life energy to become a prolific creator. Dreams are condensed thoughts, made visible by the life energy withdrawn from the sensory organs into the brain dur- ing sleep. In the world created in his dream state, a sleeper can plant wheat, raise it, harvest it, grind it, and bake it into bread. He can eat of the dream bread, taste it, feel its fresh texture in his mouth. But all things in that dream—the seed, the soil, the oven, the bread, the body that eats and enjoys it—are only modifications of the dreamer's consciousness. Suppose a person dreams of five thousand people and has only five dream loaves of bread to feed them. If he has the power of con- scious dreaming, he can command his mind, \"Since these five loaves are only materializations of my thoughts, I shall multiply them by vi- sualization until I have adequate to serve all the people.\" To produce dreams consciously and at will is one of the first powers attained by the advancing yogi. An accomplished master perceives how God has condensed His creative thoughts to produce all phenomena of this dream world, and by the cosmic hypnosis of maya has suggested those dreams so powerfully to our human consciousness that we accept the cosmic chimera as material reality. 815"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Jesus had the power to condense his thoughts not only as visible mental images as does an ordinary dreamer, but as material dream- realities, even as God does. By the command of his divinely attuned will, he could cause the cosmic energy to condense into electrons, pro- tons, atoms, and molecules of any kind, of any density and specific gravity, informed into whatsoever he willed. After his crucifixion, he re-created his body; thus it was a simple matter for him to create a few more loaves of bread—the process is the same. He had only to com- mand electromagnetic radiations to multiply the food as the five thou- sand people were consuming it. Such feats can be done by anyone who has complete mastery of the mind. Mind is everything. If a small eyedropper were connected to a large reservoir of wa- ter, the eyedropper would continuously drip one drop of water at a time. Thousands of persons could drink of that water even though the water came in tiny drops, but continuously. The five loaves and two fishes, broken up into tiny fragments, were charged continuously with the replicating power of the creative lifetronic energy drawn by Jesus from the infinite reservoir of the astral realm—morsel by morsel, un- til all were fed. From the story of the loaves and the fishes, we see also the prac- ticality and precision of Jesus, who always looked to the comfort of the people. Lest anyone be bypassed in the disarray of the throng dur- ing the distribution of the food, he had his disciples divide the multi- tude by fifties, throughout the grassy area. In instructing his disciples to gather up all remnants after everyone had eaten, he was not only stressing economy in not wasting bounty given by God, but also cit- ing the reverence with which one should treat blessed food (referred to in India as prasad), which on this occasion was a special creation of God.* -  It is evident that according to the custom and Is a vegetarian diet food supply of the time, Jesus did not sponsor strict necessary for spiritual vegetarianism. The cultivation of fruits, grains, and progress?  vegetables was relatively sparse in the desert places where he preached. His mission on earth did not require him to be a nutritionist, but to saturate people with God- consciousness. * The Gospels relate a recurrence of this miracle when Jesus later fed four thousand peo- ple with seven loaves and a few fishes (Matthew 15:32-39 and Mark 8:1-9, 14-21). 816"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"It is true that those who are yet in the developmental stage of spir- itual discipline ought to favor a vegetarian diet. But to great masters who have attained God-consciousness, dietary restrictions have little meaning; they see the whole world as nothing but the manifestation of God's ideas. To them, all forms of physical experiences are but the dif- ferent acts of consciousness under the influence of the cosmic dream. To the man of realization, the very consciousness of giving reality to any form of diet is delusion. He who has awakened from the dream delusion of the cosmos realizes he is Spirit; his mortal body and its physical experiences existing only as amorphous ideas of consciousness. Nevertheless, the various forms of diet and their dissimilar effects on the body should not be brashly denied. Theorizing about the delu- sive nature of the body, while simultaneously supporting the delusion by gratifying hunger and engaging in other activities that reinforce body consciousness, is quite incongruous. When an individual achieves spiritual ecstasy and God-contact, there will be no vitiation of his re- alization that the universe with all its experiences is God's dream, dreaming through him. Until the spiritual aspirant reaches that state of release from all delusive compulsions, he needs to lead a life of spiri- tual discipline, observing the more healthful vegetarian diet—and other health-maintaining behaviors—to keep the body fit for meditation and spiritual service to God. Persons who claim to possess the realization of sainthood and on those false credentials flaunt the ordinary rules of a salutary physical and spiritual life are courting an inescapable rebuff from the karmic law. Jesus had said before, that he, the bridegroom, the divine master, and his disciples did not need to fast for spiritual purification from the con- sciousness of the body, as they were already saturated with transcendent consciousness. But he also added that when his physical presence would be taken away, the disciples would have to adhere to a life of stricter dis- cipline in order to retain attunement with his spiritual vibrations.* Great teachers adopt the lifestyle and some of the customs of the place and time in which they incarnate; it does not mean that every detail of their way of life is forever sanctified for all generations to fol- low! Some persons reason, \"Jesus partook of meat and wine, there- fore I should do the same.\" But I say to them, first become like Jesus; then whatever you ingest in that consciousness is pure Spirit and as * See Discourse 32. 817"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"such will have no ill effects. For non-illumined body-bound persons, a diet reliant on animal products contributes heavily to many sick- nesses, including heart disease and cancer; it is detrimental to physi- cal, psychological, and spiritual health. If people were to follow a proper vegetarian diet, many of the fatal diseases most prevalent in modern civilization would be gone. Whatever diet people follow, their prayer and affirmation should be: \"Heavenly Father, teach us to realize that we live by Thy con- sciousness; that birthless and deathless we are waves of Thine infinite ocean of life, of Thine immortal energy and immutable consciousness.\" Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, \"This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.\" When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone (John 6:14-15). Parallel reference: And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the mul- titudes away. And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone (Matthew 14:22-23). Ur T The prophet that should come into the world\" was a reference to Moses' foretelling in Deuteronomy 18:15: \"The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.\" Many of the Jewish people expected that the coming prophet, or Messiah, would also be an earthly ruler of the royal house of David.* Jesus had no wish to be declared a king of a temporal material king- dom; being one with God, he was already a Prince of the Universe, a true king above all kingdoms of the earth. *See, for example, II Samuel 7:11-17; I Chronicles 17:11-15; Daniel 9:25-26. See also Discourse 36. 818"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The periodic withdrawal of Jesus into solitude [as explained in Discourses 7 and 2.5] was a necessary retreat from the demands of the multitudes. God does not need to pray or meditate, because He is om- nipresent and is seeking nothing beyond Himself. He is engrossed in His joy and need not attain any higher state than His own conscious- ness. The transcendent liberated master enjoys that same blissful free- dom; still he may seclude himself for solitary prayer and meditation to recharge his mortal body, which is needed for his work on earth. In this instance, Jesus also sought to escape a cordon of enthusiasts to disabuse them of their notion to make him their king. And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea, and entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Ca- pernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid. But he saith unto them, \"It is I; be not afraid.\" Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immedi- ately the ship was at the land whither they went (John 6:16-21).

Why should my appearance in this way cause you to be afraid?\" As with the materialization of the loaves and fishes, walking over water, as Jesus did in view of his disciples, is a miracle that can be performed when one understands the electronic composition of matter and its relation to mind. A master who by actual realization perceives the entire cosmos as a dream of God, and all matter as condensed life- tronic light and consciousness, rises above the laws governing mate- rial creation and can modify any material object by his divinely at- tuned creative will. The human mind is deluded into thinking that liquid will drown man's solid body, gas will choke him, solids will hurt him; but as soon as that delusion is gone, he can do anything he wants to with matter. He realizes that the whole world is energy, as scientists tell us. Man thinks of his mortal form as solid flesh and bone. That is a concrete delusion. The body is an amalgam of countless infinitesimal subatomic particles; these particles are made up of finer-than-atomic lifetronic energy and ultimately of thoughtrons, sparks of conscious- ness whose source is Cosmic Consciousness. Everything existing in nature is energy in a more or less compact stage of vibration, exhibiting weight according to its mass or distin- guishing gravitation. In the material world, liquid vibration, such as water, will sink a solid vibration, such as the human body, whose den- sity gives it a specific gravity* greater than the liquid. Jesus realized that the energy composing the solid body has specific gravity only be- cause of its compact formation, as also the specific gravity of the less dense mass of the liquid vibration of the sea. Specific gravity is delu- sion because the density of matter is reducible to its quintessence of energy (weightless, permeable light). Human consciousness that tran- scends this delusion perceives the physical body as essentially ethereal, * The term used in physics to denote the ratio of the density of a substance to that of a standard substance (which is usually water for solids and liquids, and dry air for gases). \"Buoyancy is intimately related to specific gravity,\" explains Encyclopaedia Britannica. \"If a substance has specific gravity less than that of a fluid, it will float on that fluid: helium-filled balloons will rise in air, oil will form a slick on water, and lead will float on mercury.\" (Publisher's Note) Jesus' mastery over the electronic compo- sition of matter and its relation to consciousness 820"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"infinitely united to and consisting of the same substance as the Cos- mic Body of God: energy, mind, Spirit. In Autobiography of a Yogi I have devoted an entire chapter to a comprehensive explanation of \"The Law of Miracles.\" Modern sci- ence has gratifyingly supplied terms and processes of cosmic laws that, intentionally or reluctantly, formulate a science of the age-old art of miracles known alike to generations of Vedic, Biblical, and contem- porary masters. Let me quote an extract from the book apropos to this present Discourse: From science, then, if it must be so, let man learn the philosophic truth that there is no material universe; its warp and woof is maya, illusion. Under analysis all its mirages of reality dissolve.... In his famous equation outlining the equivalence of mass and energy, Einstein proved that the energy in any particle of matter is equal to its mass or weight multiplied by the square of the velocity of light. The release of the atomic energies is brought about through annihilation of the material particles. The \"death\" of matter has given birth to an Atomic Age. Light velocity is a mathematical standard or constant not be- cause there is an absolute value in 186,300 miles a second, but be- cause no material body, whose mass increases with its velocity, can ever attain the velocity of light. Stated another way: only a material body whose mass is infinite could equal the velocity of light. This conception brings us to the law of miracles. Masters who are able to materialize and dematerialize their bodies and other objects, and to move with the velocity of light, and to utilize the creative light rays in bringing into instant visibility any physical manifestation, have fulfilled the lawful condition: their mass is infinite. The consciousness of a perfected yogi is effortlessly identified not with a narrow body but with the universal structure. Gravita- tion, whether the \"force\" of Newton or the Einsteinian \"manifes- tation of inertia,\" is powerless to compel a master to exhibit the property of weight: the distinguishing gravitational condition of all material objects. He who knows himself as the omnipresent Spirit is subject no longer to the rigidities of a body in time and space. The imprisoning \"rings-pass-not\" have yielded to the solvent: I am He. The cohesive property of maya's creative vibration holds together every iota of matter sporting its presence in the universe. Sand mixed 821"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"with water and fashioned into a sand man looks enduringly solid; but when the water is evaporated out of it, that illusion falls apart. Like- wise, the illusion of a seemingly solid human form is held together by the adhesive power of delusion working through the mind. The relationship between consciousness and the body is such that at death the body disintegrates because the mind and consciousness depart; but as long as consciousness remains in the body it works hard to hold together the atoms, cells, and organs—in spite of the effects of disease and aging. The body's mass of dancing electrons—light, en- ergy—when compacted and integrated by mind as a creative sensory instrument of maya, suggests itself as a solid entity. Applying the phys- ical processes described by Einstein, however, scientists could convert the body into its constituent energy; but they lack the ability to do it by mind power, as Jesus did. A master who realizes that the mind con- trols the body, and who possesses complete control over the mind, can partially or fully disintegrate the atoms of the body—changing its spe- cific gravity or completely dematerializing it—and then restore the bodily composition to its customary solidity at will. Superconscious realization that the body is made of informed en- ergy, a dream image of mind-stuff, instantly frees one from the delu- sion of specific gravity; without the density of mass, there is no weight. But as long as the conviction of corporeal solidity persists in one's mind, the body will surely sink if one tries to walk on the unsupport- ive lesser density of a body of water. If a sleeping man dreams he is drowning, his consciousness would suffer a painful sense of suffocation. But if he knew the art of con- trolling his dreams at will, he could save his dream self simply by changing his dream thoughts to behold his dream body floating safely on the dream waters. Jesus, perceiving his body, the sea, and the con- glomerate world as differentiated dream waves of consciousness man- ifesting as various electromagnetic waves of material forms, could by mere willing change the specific gravity or the electronic composition of his body so that weightlessly it could walk on water as naturally as the solid body of an ordinary man strides the solid earth. A small cork tied to a heavy piece of iron will be submerged if dropped in a pot of water; but if the cork were separated from the iron, it would float. The body is similarly weighted down with mate- rial consciousness. When maya's illusions of the perdurability of mat- ter are disengaged from the body by meditation, the body can dance 822"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"on water, walk through solid substances, levitate or fly in the air at will. As easily as any person can change his thoughts, a superman can change his experience of the world just by changing his material con- victions into intuitive divine realizations. Among the yogis of India that I have personally known to demonstrate these truths was the saintly Nagendra Nath Bhaduri, about whom I have written in my Autobiography of a Yogi.* The Kriya Yoga meditation techniques of pranayama, life-force con- trol that transmutes breath into subtle lifetronic energy, bring positive realization that the composition of the body is pure cosmic energy. In the adept practice of Kriya, the body is oxygenated and its atoms ethere- alized until it becomes light as a feather. Man has no idea how much power comes into the body when he has mastered the mystery of the breath. Kriya practice brings a regulated, continuous inflow of oxygen * Chapter 7, \"The Levitating Saint.\" Many Christian saints, including Teresa of Avila and Joseph of Cupertino, have similarly exhibited miraculous powers of levitation and weightlessness. The Catholic scholar Monsignor Albert Farges writes in Mystical Phe- nomena (London: Burns, Oates, and Washbourne, 1916): \"In spite of the strangeness of these facts, they cannot be doubted. Not only are they perfectly authentic, but, moreover, frequent in the lives of ecstatic saints....They have often been discussed and verified in the processes of canonization.... \"St. Francis seems to have been the first stigmatic and also the first ecstatic whose spontaneous elevation above the ground was officially confirmed, but since that time verifications have been multiplied. Here are some instances: \"St. Peter of Alcantara was unable to hear the lofty words of St. John, Verbum cara factum est ['The Word was made flesh'], pronounced without falling into ecstasy and being raised above the earth. The Franciscan, Biagio of Caltanisetta, went into ec- stasy simply at the names of Jesus and Mary, and, enraptured with their beauty, sprang into the air. Blessed Giles, of the Order of St. Dominic, remained suspended in the air in ecstasy for whole nights without it being possible to bring him back to earth...St. Thomas of Villanova, whilst preaching one day in his cathedral, suddenly went into ecstasy and remained suspended in the air for twelve hours.\" The levitations of seventeenth-century St. Joseph of Cupertino are among the most famous. The London Times reported on March 24, 2003: \"In a message marking the 400 th anniversary of the birth of St. Joseph, the Pope said that the Franciscan friar, who was said to amaze congregations by levitating and flying through the air, was spir- itually close to our times. He is the patron saint of aviators and students....Witnesses recor d that after falling into an ecstatic trance, St. Joseph would utter a loud cry and soar into the air, sometimes flying down the nave and sometimes flying out of the church and across the hills for several miles. He was put on trial by the Inquisition, but when he flew over the heads of his inquisitors, the judges referred the case directly t o the Pope, Urban VIII. The Pope dropped the case after apparently witnessing an 'ec- static flight.' Numerous important people, including Frederick, Duke of Brunswick, and Prince Casimir of Poland testified to having seen the flights.\" (Publisher's Note) 823"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"into the body, the atoms of which, by the process of pranayama, are transmuted into life force, reinforcing the subtle currents in the spine, —— which in turn awaken the astral cerebrospinal cen- Frotn material to di- ters and spiritualize the entire body. After years of vine consciousness: successful practice, the body of the advanced Kriya yoga and the mystery Yogi becomes so spiritualized that in exalted states of the breath he can hardly feel it touch the ground. The suffusion of life force becomes so powerful that the whole body loses its delusive solidity and actually levitates. I can testify to that from my own experience. But the beginner should not expect to jump weightless tomorrow! Modern man is accustomed to getting results quickly; his industry and technology manufactures products so rapidly that he thinks there should be a convenience package of concise spiri- tual progress as well. A presumption of instant spiritual achievement is perhaps more than a bit audacious considering the innumerable lifetimes already spent in making oneself an unspiritual being. Even a lifelong practice is little to be required. Nevertheless, the Kriya Yoga science and art of meditation are not drudgery, because gradual transforming results are felt from the very beginning. All this has been explained by the great yogis of India.* Jesus Christ certainly had mastered that yoga science, by which he converted the vibratory density of his body into weightless light. Most persons do not live the truth in the Bible; they are satisfied with mere theo- logical belief or their own philosophical vagaries, which get them nowhere. If one follows the scientific spiritual way, the results are def- *In his Yoga Sutras, Patanjali devotes an entire section to the obtaining of miraculous powers (known as siddhis or vibhutis) by mastery of the yoga science—in particular, by samyama, a coalescence of the last three steps of the Eightfold Path: dharana (con- centration), dhyatia (meditation), and samadhi (divine union). Among the powers men- tioned are levitation and the ability to walk on water or mire without sinking ( Yoga Sutras 111:40), as well as the ability to exercise the eight aishvaryas (ascetical majesties; se e Discourse 70) and to perfect the body so that its functions are unaffected by the properties of earth, water, fire, air, ether—the solid, liquid, fiery, gaseous, and ethereal phases of matter ( Yoga Sutras 111:45-46). In Sutra 111:38, Patanjali warns the sincere seeker of God-union that the use of phe- nomenal powers is an obstacle, tempting the yogi to egotistical pride and distracting hi m from the true Goal. The advancing devotee is careful to shun the use of any su- pernatural powers he might attain, or to employ them only when he is certain of di- vin e permission. After becoming irrevocably established in samadhi, of course, the per- fecte d yogi is guided by God's wisdom; he then exercises the siddhis or refrains from doin g so entirely according to the inner promptings of the Divine Will. 824"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"inite and can be proved by one's own transition from mortal con- sciousness to divine consciousness. And Peter answered him and said, \"Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.\" And he said, \"Come.\" And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boister- ous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, \"Lord, save me.\" And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, \"O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?\" And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, \"Of a truth thou art the Son of God.\"* And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret. And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased; and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole (Matthew 14:28-36). P eter, by the power of faith and mental concentration, became mo- mentarily attuned to the consciousness of Christ, free from the material dream-delusion of matter. Thus he was buoyed by divine con- sciousness when he stepped out of the ship to ap- proach Jesus. But when the violent winds shook Pe- ter's concentrated faith with fear, his habit of beholding matter as real came back into his mind and immediately he felt his body sinking. Jesus' touch restored the disciple's faith and brought him to safety. But he scolded Peter for his precarious spiri- tual instability: \"O Peter, why did you diminish with doubt your Self- realization, your intuition-born, Christ Consciousness-stimulated faith, and revive your consciousness of matter? Unless your faith re- *Cf. parallel reference in Mark 6:47-52.

Faith is absolute con- viction; its proof lies in the intuitive knowing of the soul. God- consciousness and its unlimited powers are available to those ardent devotees who steadily develop themselves by meditation until they form an unwavering faith in the omnipotent nature of God and His manifestation in themselves. One who is always conscious of the body is not conscious of Spirit. In sleep bodily consciousness is forcibly, though temporarily, cast off from the soul. But in meditation the delusion of the body is consciously removed; and during ecstasy attained in deeper states of meditation, the devotee acquires real faith—a deep intuitive realiza- tion—about the electromagnetic, lifetronic, and mental nature of the body. The more advanced one is on the spiritual path, the greater is his faith or meditation-born conviction about the immaterial nature of matter and his own body.f * \"He whose consciousness is not shaken by anxiety under afflictions nor by attach- ment to happiness under favorable circumstances; he who is free from worldly loves, fears, and angers—he is called a muni [God-knowing sage] of steady discrimination\" (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita 11:56). fThe great novelist Leo Tolstoy wrote a delightful folk tale, The Three Hermits. His friend Nicholas Roerich summarized it, as follows: \"On an island there lived three old hermits. They were so simple that the only prayer they used was: 'We are three; Thou art Three—have mercy on us!' Great mir- acles were manifested during this naive prayer. \"The local bishop came to hear about the three hermits and their inadmissible prayer, and decided to visit them in order to teach them the canonical invocations. He arrived on the island, told the hermits that their heavenly petition was undignified, and taught them many of the customary prayers. The bishop then left on a boat. He saw, following the ship, a radiant light. As it approached he discerned the three hermits, who were holding hands and running upon the waves in an effort to overtake the vessel. \"'We have forgotten the prayers you taught us,' they cried as they reached the bishop, 'and have hastened to ask you to repeat them.' The awed bishop shook his head. \"'Dear ones,' he replied humbly, 'continue to live with your old prayer!'\" (The story apparently has a historical basis; an editorial note informs us that the bishop met the three hermits while he was sailing from Archangel to the Slovetsky Monastery, at the mouth of the Dvina River.)— Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 30. 826"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"DISCOURSE 43 Tike True Bread of Life How One Can \"Work the Works of God\" • The Christ Intelligence: \"Bread From Heaven,\" the Divine Sustenance of All Creation • Earthly and Spiritual Hunger Satisfied Forever Ly Partaking of Christ Consciousness • Did Jesus Promise Salvation to All Who \"Bel ieveth on H im ! • Doubt-Filled Materialistic Persons Cannot Know God or Christ • \"Eat My Flesh\": Flourish Ones Life With the ' 'Bread\" of Christ Consciousness \"Drink My Blood\": sorb the Immortalizing Cosmic Energy or Holy Gh ost Vibration • Jesus Spoke Cryptically; But Rightly Interpreted, His Words Are Spirit, and They Are Life\" \"Any one of you who by deep meditation absorbs in his consciousness the Christ Consciousness (bread) will find his life united to eternal life.\""},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"* t T he day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone; (howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:) When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.

To recapitulate, Jesus refers to his flesh as bread, meaning the Christ Consciousness present in all vibratory cre- ation, and to his blood as Cosmic Energy. Christ Consciousness and Cosmic Energy are inseparable, as Christ Consciousness is the reflec- tion in creation of Cosmic Consciousness (which is beyond creation) manifested as Cosmic Energy or vibratory creation. God the Father and Cosmic Consciousness are synonymous; Christ the Son and Christ Consciousness are one and the same. God the Father emanated from Him His son, Christ Intelligence, and Cosmic Energy, the Holy Ghost. As a son is conceived with the dual instrumentality of the father and the mother, so Christ Intelligence would not exist with- out the dual instrumentality of God the Father and Cosmic Energy (Holy Ghost or Cosmic Mother Nature).

Jesus Christ speaks of the bread and the flesh as one and the same thing. The flesh of the Son of man refers to the Christ Consciousness present in the body of Jesus as well as in the body of any individual. \"Eateth my flesh\" refers to the act of absorbing the Christ Con- sciousness into one's human consciousness. \"Drinketh my blood\" refers to the Cosmic Energy (blood) to be consciously united with the bodily life force—both of which are present in the human body and can be united by wisdom, divine realization—thus recharging the life in the body with the Holy Ghost Vibration of Cosmic Energy. The sacramental rites in Christian churches, in which people par- take of blessed wine as the blood of Jesus Christ and blessed bread as his flesh, are symbolical. Saintly souls have transcended the symbol- ogy and experienced in ecstasy the true receiving of Christ commun- ion. Sincere devotees should learn the technique of interiorizing the consciousness in meditation for actual realization of the Christ Con- sciousness in their consciousness.* * \"His flesh is the Word [/ogos], and his blood is the Holy Spirit,\" says the third-century gnostic Gospel of Philip (The Nag Hammadi Library in English, James M. Robinson, ed.; HarperSanFransisco, 1990). Such views were later replaced by the official church dogma of transubstantiation —the doctrine that the bread and wine used in the Eucharistic rites are mystically transformed into the physical body and blood of Jesus when blessed by an ordained priest during the liturgy of Holy Mass. The esoteric truth behind the church's dogmas and outer rituals, however, was not lost sight of by those of deeper insight, such a s Saint Basil the Great, revered Doctor of the Church and bishop of Caesarea (329-379). Karen Armstrong, in A History of God, describes the distinction between dogma and kerygma made by Basil, who taught that \"both kinds of Christian teaching were essential to religion. Kerygma was the public teaching of the Church, based on the scriptures. Dogma, however, represented the deeper meaning of biblical truth, which could only be apprehended through religious experience and expressed in symbolic form. Besides the clear message of the Gospels, a secret or esoteric tradition had been handed down 'in a mystery' from the apostles; this had been a 'private and secret teaching, which our holy fathers have preserved in a silence that prevents anxiety and curiosity...so as to safeguard by this silence the sacred character of the mystery. The uninitiated are not permitted to be- hol d these things: their meaning is not to be divulged by writing it down.' (Basil, On the Holy Spirit, 28.66.) Behind the liturgical symbols and lucid teachings of Jesus, there was a secret dogma which represented more developed understanding of the faith....Some reli- gious insights had an inner resonance that could only be apprehended by each individual in his own time during what Plato had called theoria, contemplation....As Basil said, these elusive religious realities could only be suggested in the symbolic gestures of the liturgy.\" See also Discourse 69, commentary on Jesus' words at the Last Supper.

Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, \"This is an hard saying; who can hear it?\" When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, \"Doth this offend you? What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before? It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. But there are some of you that believe not.\" For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him (John 6:59-64).

You doubt my words and wonder at my sayings, but how much more astonished you would be if you were to see my body, the Son of man, go back to the Christ Consciousness whence it came?\" The consciousness of Jesus was tuned already with Christ Con- sciousness; and here Jesus alludes obliquely to his foreknowledge that his body, though visibly apart from Christ Consciousness, but being an emanation of that Consciousness, would consciously merge in it when the proper moment arrived. Jesus tells his doubting disciples that if they wonder at his amazing sayings, they would have cause to be wholly astonished when they would behold his body after crucifixion return to life and be received by Heav- enly Christ Consciousness. Jesus thereby promised his doubting disciples a demonstration of spirit and life contained in the truth of his words. \"When you concentrate on the Spirit, you understand that the In- finite Immortality can enliven your temporary life with eternal life. It is the flesh consciousness, the doubting material consciousness within 843"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"you, that will yield you no profit, no lasting happiness. It is spiritual understanding that can quickly lead you to eternal emancipation. \"The words of wisdom I speak unto you 'are spirit, and they are life,' they are charged with the Cosmic Consciousness of the Spirit and can give life to the spiritually dead, as are some of you. I know those among you who believe not that the universal panacea for human suf- fering lies hidden behind the words of my wisdom, if they are truly ap- plied and fully realized.\" When Jesus speaks of his words being \"spirit and life,\" he implies the truth that every word has two aspects—the consciousness con- tained in it and the energy it produces. When a psychologically sick man is repentant and hears the word \"peace\" from a saintly individ- ual, he becomes saturated with the consciousness of peace and with mental encouragement from an infusion of life-giving energy. Toward this end, Jesus made it clear to his disciples that if they were in tune with him they would feel the Christ-wisdom of Spirit behind his words and the life-giving energy contained in them. The words of Jesus were not bookish dissertations, but emanated directly from the wisdom fountain of Cosmic Consciousness and the life-sustaining Christ Consciousness-guided Cosmic Energy. The wise and the spiritually inclined retire every day from the cacophonous busy-ness of thoughts and secrete themselves in the caves of silence deep in the clefts of contemplation. There the true devotee drinks from the fountain of Spirit and Life. Great masters who are tuned with Christ Consciousness give forth their teachings, like Christ, charged with the Cosmic Consciousness of Spirit and Cosmic Life. Owing to his all-seeing wisdom, which could trace the law of cause and effect governing the actions of any individual, Jesus knew from the beginning who among his followers believed in him and who would be likely to forsake him: And he said, \"Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father\" (John 6:65). & ^ TTT'rom my omniscient consciousness I know those of you who have iL stored up good karma from your past good actions and have earned the divine grace of my Father by which you have been drawn to me and will be actuated to follow me faithfully. I know also those with the inclinations of bad karma who will leave me. No materially minded 844"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"man can reach and be in tune with the Christ Consciousness within me unless by his devotion he has appealed to the Supreme God, the Father.\" Thus Jesus pointed out to his disciples that it was no small achieve- ment for one to recognize and be able to follow the Christ Conscious- ness in him; it was a blessing earned by that individual who had gained previous good karma and the cooperation of the Cosmic Law, and the grace of God. From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. Then said Jesus unto the twelve, \" Will ye also go awayf \" Then Simon Peter answered him, \"Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.\" * Jesus answered them, \"Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devilf \" He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Si- mon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve (John 6:66- JI). J esus was not in doubt about his chosen twelve disciples, but he re- spected their free will and reminded them that from the freedom of their hearts they must choose to remain with him. Devotees ordain the happenings of their lives according to prena- tal and postnatal seeds of action (karma); therefore, when Jesus said, \"Have not I chosen you twelve (according to your karma) and one of you is a devil?\" he did not speak of this as an inevitable arbitrary or- dinance of God. He told this from his intimate knowledge of the in- ner life of each of his twelve disciples. If Jesus were sure that all his twelve disciples were prisoners of destiny and that eleven were ordained to remain faithful to him, he would not have asked: \"Will ye also go away?\" Jesus knew that the disciples, though influenced by karma and cosmic law, still had free will to be with him or to forsake him. In fact, Jesus predicted his be- trayal at the hands of Judas in order to warn him, that he might cor- rect his karmic predisposition and refrain from doing the evil act. *Cf.

Jesus by his criticism pointed out how the adoption of this degenerate ceremonial law had led to the violation of divine law: \"Tell me, why are you so conscientious in upholding your local- ized customs and yet flaunt God's commandments? Which is a greater sin—to ignore tradition and yet be faithful to God's commandments, or to denigrate God's commandments for your own useful purposes under the auspices of religious custom?

Such conduct was practically to curse them, and to incur the death penalty for so doing.

They seem to know that the love they create while living will be reflected and radiated back to them when they die.\" (Publisher's Note) * From Robertson's Word Pictures of the New Testament: \"Handwashing before meals is not a requirement of the Old Testament. It is, we know, a good thing for sanitary reasons, but the rabbis made it a mark of righteousness for others at any rate. This item was magnified at great length in the oral teaching. The washing of the hands called for minute regulations. It was commanded to wash the hands before meals, it was one's duty to do it after eating. The more rigorous did it between the courses. The hands must be immersed. Then the water itself must be 'clean' and the cups or pots used must be ceremonially 'clean.' Vessels were kept full of clean water ready for use (John 2:6-8). So it went on ad infinitum. Thus a real issue is raised between Jesus and the rabbis. It was far more than a point of etiquette or of hygienics.

Ex- ternal observances are intended to engage the mind so that it is cleansed of worldly thoughts. But meditation itself is the true purifier of man's being that makes his consciousness receptive to divine contact. \"Outward ritual cannot destroy ignorance, because they are not mutually contradictory,\" wrote Swami Shankara. \"Realized knowl- edge alone destroys ignorance.\"* And he called the multitude, and said unto them, \"Hear, and un- derstand: Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man\" (Matthew 15:10-11).

A strongly virtuous person in a bad environment usually re- mains good, and an entrenched wicked person in a good environment is likely to remain evil. This does not mean that environment has no influence on man; its effect requires repeated remedial acts of will. Nevertheless, Jesus emphasizes that it is the inner environment of man that is of primary importance. My master Swami Sri Yukteswarji used to remind me: \"Always be watchful of your company—the company of your friends and the company of your thoughts.\" A person who hosts evil thoughts is in evil company. But even if one is surrounded by ungodly associ- ates yet holds the mind to good and positive thoughts, that evil influ- ence is powerless to affect him. Thus one's primary aim should be to establish virtue firmly within his heart and mind: To think and feel goodness is a powerful force that will attract a good environment and produce a natural, unpracticed spiritual behavior. By contrast, one whose emphasis is on adherence to prescribed outer customs, with no care taken to root out evil from his inner self, remains encircled by his company of evil thoughts and propensities, inevitably unable to thwart their insistence to express outwardly their deleterious nature—\"the things which come out of him...that defile the man.\" A person should be judged not by his actions alone, but accord- ing to the springs or motives of his actions. It is the evil motive of a man that actuates the iniquity coming out of him, nothing else. Of course, there are some evils committed by children through imitation, or by the mentally ill devoid of any power of reason, in which case they cannot be held responsible. But when a child or an adult does evil through his own innate motivation or desire, he is defiled thereby and that action portends an increasingly evil disposition. 857"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Then came his disciples, and said unto him, \"Knoweth thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? \" But he answered and said, \"Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.

Then the beholder (the soul) is established in its own state\"—i.e., the unconditione d freedom and immortal bliss inherent in the soul as a spark of God-essence. As cited briefly in Discourse 26 (\"blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God\"), Jesus' teachings on the emotions parallel those of the more ancient science of yoga. A comprehensive yogic explication of how these energetic forces operate in man's consciousness to promote or impede awareness of the Divine is given in Paramahansa Yogananda's commentary on the first chapter of the Bhagavad Gita (especially verses 4-11). That such teachings were also known and practiced as part of original Chris- tianity is evident in the writings of a number of the early Church Fathers—leading some scholars to refer to them as a kind of \"Christian yoga.\" Among the examples cited is Evagrius Ponticus, a fourth-century Desert Father whose writings were influential in the early mystical traditions of both Roman and eastern Orthodox Christianity, and later among the Sufi mystics of Islam. In Lost Christianity (New York: Tarcher/Penguin, 2003), Professor Jacob Needleman says of Evagrius's teaching: \"The key term is the word apatheia, which translates into our word 'apathy' but which is as far from the meaning of our English word as diamonds are from broken glass.... Apatheia means, lit- erally, 'without emotions'—or, more precisely, freedom from emotions....Evagrius him- self writes, 'Now this apatheia has a child called agape [love of God] who keeps the 859"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"man of little understanding blames God for the ills and evils into which he is born.

But when man subverts his transcen- and dislikes dent soul-nature with egoistic involvement of the feelings of his heart in likes and dislikes—indiscrim- inate attractions and repulsions—about material things and experi ences, those distortions of consciousness become insidious entangle- ments that make him a part of, rather than a being apart from, delusion. Accruing in his consciousness lifetime after lifetime, the desires, attach- ments, and tendencies of the likes and dislikes in his feelings compel him to reincarnate in a physical body that has been customized by his own design. If these proclivities are evil, they will surely proceed from the feelings of the heart into actions that defile man's innate nobility. That is why Jesus emphasized the difference between external and internal methods of purifying the heart: \"Out of the evil karmic ten- door to deep knowledge of the created universe. Finally, to this knowledge succeed the- ology [experiential knowledge of God] and the supreme beatitude.'\" Likewise, in Yoga Sutras 1:21 Patanjali says that the goal of yoga is nearest—that is, is reached most quickly by—those who possess tivra-samvega (extreme dispassion; not a negative state but a transmutation of longing for the world into intense ardor for God). Professor Needleman continues: \"The most influential of Evagrius' practical writ- ings may be taken as general guidelines for the arduous inner struggle to break free from the sufferings and illusions brought to man by the emotions. Emotions and the thoughts that support them are often given the name 'demons.' This term, which sounds so naive to the modern mind, has a meaning that is anything but naive. Man is a microcosmic being; he lives and moves within a field of forces and influences spanning the entire on- tological range of forces in the universe. These forces have a direction—a vertical di- rection toward or away from unity with God. And the transactions of these forces take place within the mind and heart, within the 'soul,' as well as in the external universe.... \"The Praktikos of Evagrius begins with the listing of eight kinds of 'evil' or 'pas- sionate' thoughts: gluttony, impurity, avarice, sadness, anger, acedia ['the desire to give up'] , vainglory, and pride. By calling them 'thoughts,' Evagrius is referring to an ex- ceedingly important element in the early-Christian teaching about the emotions....'It is not in our power,\" Evagrius writes, 'to determine whether we are disturbed by these thoughts, but it is up to us to decide if they are to linger within us or not and whether or not they are able to stir up our passions.' \"In short, thoughts, impulses, associations appear within the psyche, but as such they are not yet emotions. It is only when these 'thoughts' are given something by ourselves, some energy, some specific psychic force, that they take on the nature of emotion—passion —an d assume their overwhelming power in our inner and outer lives.\" (Publisher's Note) 860"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"dencies stored up in the heart of men ( chitta or feeling), all evil thoughts and actions spring.

All these evil tendencies, if not curtailed and spir- itually sublimated, defile man with multiform miseries.\" Evil thoughts are a smoke screen of ignorance that hides from the conscious mind the purity and everlasting joy of the soul. One who looks at life through this pollution of feeling is unable to perceive the subtle beauty of the image of God hidden within him. Living in this darkness, man makes himself wholly vulnerable to all manner of delu- sive afflictions—physical, mental, and spiritual. One who ennobles and beautifies his inner feeling with bright and cheerful thoughts and spiritual aspirations, and most important, who performs daily the highest purificatory rite of cleansing the conscious- ness in divine wisdom through meditation, finds that through the trans- parency of his inner luminous living all the exultant excellence of his God-reflecting soul pours forth and shines into his conscious mind. Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, \"Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.\" But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, \"Send her away; for she crieth after us.\" But he answered and said, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel\" (Matthew 15:21-24). * * Cf. parallel reference in Mark 7:24-26. 861"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"^ jLTVom time to time, the Heavenly Father sends an emissary to A. minister to a particular community, race, or nation of people in whom he can rekindle the flame of truth and open forgotten portals of salvation.

Some scholars, including Karen Armstrong, believe that the evidence of history shows that the pure monothe- ism passed down to later Judaism truly crystalized during the Jewish exile in Babylon from 597 to 538 B.C., and that the older books of the Hebrew Bible were revised ac- cordingly. Other historians point out that it was through Babylon that India's meta- physics and mysticism influenced Jewish, Greek, and Gnostic philosophy. It was dur- ing and after the Babylonian exile that some of Judaism's greatest prophets lived and taught—Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and others. In his Autobiography of a Yogi, Paramahansa Yogananda writes: \"To surmount maya was the task assigned to the human race by the millennial prophets. To rise above the duality of creation and perceive the unity of the Creator was conceived of as man's highest goal....To remove the veil of maya is to uncover the secret of creation. He who thus denudes the universe is the only true monotheist. All others are worshiping hea- the n images. So long as man remains subject to the dualistic illusions of Nature, the Janus-faced Maya is his goddess; he cannot know the one true God.... \"Maya or avidya can never be destroyed through intellectual conviction or analy- sis, but solely through attaining the interior state of nirbikalpa samadhi.

He was a purnavatara, full incarnation of Divinity, able to manifest all the qualities of God in his life.* Through the sage Vyasa he gave to India and to the world one of the greatest scriptures, the Bhagavad Gita, the yoga science of the soul and its path to liberation in Spirit. Later, Gautama Buddha incarnated in India when the message of mercy was sorely needed. It has been said of him that he restored the heart to the religion of India, which had degraded into priestly prac- tices of rituals and mechanical ceremonies. He emphasized the law of righteous action as the way to escape the ever-rotating karmic wheel of birth and death, as also the necessity of developing compassion for all creatures by feeling the presence of Divinity in all life. Through Buddha's influence many animal sacrificial rites were stopped. Five centuries after Buddha, Jesus Christ appeared to bring the message of faith and devotion for attaining the kingdom of heaven. By his performance of miraculous healings of the bodies, minds, and souls of so many, he demonstrated the ever-present divine love and forgive- ness of God to be had by all who make themselves receptive.

Swami Shankara reasserted the eternal truth that a soul who overcomes material desire becomes united to the positive state of ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss. He pointed out that God, Spirit, is that ever-new Bliss, and as such is a universal necessity and the highest goal of life, to be sought through discrimination and medita- tion on the inner Self, the secret shrine of the blissful Infinite Spirit in man. In the twelfth century, Sri Chaitanya came in India to ignite in men's hearts an ardent love for God. His path of bhakti or all-surrendering devotion restored the primacy of actually experiencing a personal rela- tionship with God, a concept demeaned by the abstrusely philosophiz- ing pundits and scholars who influenced the practice of religion at that time. In the modern era, Mahavatar Babaji gave to the world through Lahiri Mahasaya the Kriya Yoga science with its techniques of concen- tration and meditation by which God-contact can be realized. Lahiri Mahasaya emphasized that religionists should rise above their superfi- cial differences, concentrate on the universal principles of morality, and learn the science and art of interiorizing the mind and tuning it with the Infinite. His doctrine of Kriya Yoga is unique in the fact that, apart fro m advice on moral culture and self-discipline, it gives definite tech- niques of meditation for step-by-step ascension to Self-realization. Through attainment of universally experienced successive states of su- perconsciousness, Christ Consciousness, and Cosmic Consciousness, the soul ultimately merges in the Supreme Being. The consciousness of the followers of all religions, by whatever means, must pass through these states to attain God-union. Lahiri Mahasaya's teaching is espe- cially suited to the modern age because it does not ask anyone to be- lieve dogmatically, but rather by practice of the proven techniques of Kriya Yoga to discover by personal realization the answer to the eter- nal question, \"What is truth?\"—about oneself and God.

It is when masters are 865"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"fully or almost fully spiritually developed that they come on earth through the will of God to carry out His special dispensations. God Himself, as God, never comes down to dwell on earth in a human body. By definition the Illimitable Infinite cannot be confined to any one form with its inherent limitations. An essential equality exists among all masters who have fully re- gained God-consciousness within themselves; but they are sometimes differentiated according to their qualitative and quantitative works on earth. Masters are distinguished qualitatively according to the number of souls they have helped to elevate to Christhood, and quantitatively according to the number of people they have inspired during their stay on earth. Jesus created eleven masters from his twelve disciples. Lahiri Mahasaya similarly created many masters; one of them was my God- realized guru Sri Yukteswarji. Thus we see that Jesus said, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel\" in order to declare the incipient unfoldment of God's grand design for Jesus' special dispensation on earth, and not because of any narrow partiality to the Israelites. John the Baptist's declaration, \"But that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore I am come baptizing with water\" (John 1:31) confirmed that Jesus' di- vine consciousness was to be revealed first to the Israelites. His spiri- tual influence as a world savior was both qualitative and quantitative: to work first for the awakening of those who lived in the land of his birth at that time—especially in a qualitative way for liberating the advanced souls who were his close disciples; and second, by his teach- ings, example, and omnipresent blessings to inspire on the path to God-realization all people for all time. Then came she and worshipped him, saying, \"Lord, help me.\" But he answered and said, \"It is not meet to take the chil- dren's bread, and to cast it to dogs.\" And she said, \"Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.\" Then Jesus answered and said unto her, \"O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.\" And her daughter was made whole from that very hour (Matthew 15:25-28). 866"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Parallel reference: But Jesus said unto her, \"Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.\" And she answered and said unto him, \"Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.\" And he said unto her, \"For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.\" And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed (Mark 7:27-30).

He must first serve those whose spiritual background made them more receptive, and whose good karma had attracted the grace of God. Nevertheless, when the woman—who was \"a Greek, a Syrophoenician by nation\"* —displayed the sincerity of her eagerness, he did not refuse to heal her daughter. To her he said: \"O woman, the pulling power of your will and conviction draws the all-healing cosmic energy from me; so let your will be fulfilled.

And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they pub- lished it; and were beyond measure astonished, saying, \"He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak\" (Mark 7:31-37). * * * And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them: Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel (Matthew 15:29-31). ^ & C> y the divinely charged power flowing as nectarous energy into ILJ/my mouth from the astral reservoir of cosmic life force within me, infusing my whole body and empowering the vibration of my words, and by my sigh of the almighty breath of life, I absorb within me your evil karma and its resultant effects of your sorrow and sick- ness.

Other examples of this are recorded in Mark 8:22-26 [page 871] and John 9:6-7 [Dis- course 52]. It is likely that Jesus used this concentrated nectar of astral energy in these unusual healings; as he himself had noted, otherwise, it was an abominable offense worthy of damnation for one even to say to another: \"Raca —'I spit on you.'\" [See Discourse 27.] This same princi- ple employed by Jesus of transmission of divine power concentrated in the mouth (as well as in the hands, feet, and eyes) of a master, is the ba- sis of the tradition in India that any remnant of food left uneaten by a di- vin e personage or food given to someone by him from the plate from which he has eaten is considered as prasad, imbued with blessings. .-sis' Then Jesus called his disciples unto hint, and said, \"I have com- passion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.\" And his disciples say unto him, \"Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?\" And Jesus saith unto them, \"How many loaves have ye?\" And they said, \"Seven, and a few little fishes.\" And he com- manded the multitude to sit down on the ground.

Not only he but his followers would be maligned. He thus emphasized the necessity of courage in one's convictions—to dare to be different, not from motivations of ego or overworked imagination, but from actual experience of truth in ecstatic divine communion. There is a further implication in this Gospel passage. In the divine scheme, God has decreed that there is a duty man owes to man—the strong to aid the weak, the affluent to assist the needy, the healthy to serve the stricken; above all, the enlightened to illumine the path of the benighted. Devotees who are not courageous and unselfish in trying to share the uplifting effects of their ecstatic joys with spiritually nescient souls will find their own consciousness returning to the limited confinement of the ego. By contrast, he who inspires other souls with his ecstasy will find himself expanding. A soul who feels his joy in other souls gradually feels himself as the Self of all, ultimately identified with the omnipresent consciousness of God the Father. Self-appointed \"saviors\" are not implied, just humble souls who unassumingly reach out to inspire in others love for God and the de- sire to seek Him by transmitting their consciousness through the vi- bratory power of their example, words, thoughts, and prayers.

At the Lord's direction, Moses put his hand on his chest, over the fourth subtle cerebrospinal center of life force (the heart, or dorsal, center; anahata chakra), and his hand became charged with the astral life energy, the lifetronic prarta, flowing from that center. \"Leprous\" refers to the scintillating and disintegrating solidity of atoms of the hand, which metamorphosed into a snowy white light.

The relationship between Elijah and Jesus had spanned many in- carnations, not known to man. In confirmation of that bond, Elijah appeared to Jesus Christ to give him his spiritual strength that he might, without wavering, overcome his uttermost ordeal of the sacri- fice of his body on the cross. Moses appeared also as he was the spiritual leader of the Jews, the people among whom Jesus was born and to whom primarily he preached his message of salvation. The appearance of Moses and Jesus together shows their inseparable connection in the spiritual path and that they had been connected in divine work in many incarnations. Moses the Master of the Jews, and Jesus the Master of the Christians, having appeared together on the Mount of Transfiguration in divine glory, ought to be an inspiration to the Jewish and Christian people alike to find and establish harmoniously their brotherhood in God. Moses and Jesus, in heaven now, consciously watch with grief the clannish differences that have arisen between the Jewish and Christian children of God. Moses showed his recognition and support of Jesus when he appeared with Jesus and Elijah.

He offered up man's dearest possession, his body, for working out the karma of others by the terrible ordeal of his crucifixion; and then by superior soul force he resurrected his body and proved his victory over all constraints of Nature.

When you are intu- itively guided by communion with God in ecstatic meditation, your will and faith will then be one with the Father's limitless power.\" Jesus sought to awaken in languid man the cosmic conviction pos- sessed by God, the power of His absolute knowing, by which He cre- ated stars, planets, human beings—the universe and everything therein. Through His self-evolved power of divine will and self-evolved confi- dence in the all-creative force of His thought and ideations, He has \"frozen\" into being the infinite manifestations of matter and intelli- gence. God knows by the incontrovertible immediacy of omniscience that He is all-powerful. With this almighty conviction, nothing is im- possible to Him; whatever He thinks, He can do by divine fiat or by so ordering the workings of His cosmic laws. Being made in God's image, man too has that omnipotent will and self-confidence hidden within his soul, empowering him to create or accomplish anything he can imagine. When one dis- lodges from his soul the octopus grip of human Faith gives man super- habits and hereditary beliefs, replacing impossibil- natural sovereignty ity consciousness with the realized power of faith, over the natural order one gains over the natural order a supernatural sovereignty. It is by deeper and deeper meditation that one can unite his intuitive imaging power with the almighty conviction of God and realize the relation of intuition and matter. All manifestations of cos- mic vibration are controlled and guided by God's ideated intuitions. When by God-communion the convictions of advanced souls are at- tuned with God's conviction of His own omnipresent omnipotence, that faith creates vibrations so potent that if so willed it can literally uproot a mountain and cast it into the sea.

The consciousness of an ordinary man is omnipresent in the microcosm of his body; he can will that con- sciousness to move any part of the body. Similarly, one who has faith realization of his identity with the omnipresent Cosmic Consciousness can, by divine will, govern any aspect of the macrocosmic body of the universe—but he is unlikely to find an engaging interest in rearrang- ing the Lord's cosmic scenery. \"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen....Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed • • by the word of God, so that things which are seen Definition of faith: were not made of things which do appear.\"\"' The that which perceives phenomena of material creation can be apprehended God's invisible cosmic by man's intellect and senses, but not the supersen- creative powers sory astral and causal vibratory forces that underlie and structure the physical world. The light of intu- ition is required to reveal the subtle workings of the heavenly powers. That light is the soul's realization of truth, which expresses itself through intuitive knowing, and the resultant conviction is faith. Thus, faith is the term used by Jesus to denote that which perceives the invisible cosmic creative powers, and God as the final Substance. Faith in, i.e., intuitive knowledge of, Cosmic Consciousness as the prime mover of all atomic creation bestows power to act on any portion of the universal structure. The sense-dependent, matter-worshiping man is a consummate in- fidel—disavowing, because he has no \"evidence of things not seen,\" the invisible forces of an invisible God that would bestow on him all \"things hoped for.\" Nevertheless, even ignorance-blinded individuals possess some degree of faith: a latent intuition of God's presence and power within that gives birth to all human hopes and incentive to achieve. This unconscious faith is the secret fountainhead of man's ex- pectations of fulfillment of his copious dreams. Human hope, if used rightly as motivation to cultivate higher potentials of mind, imagina- tion, and will, ultimately produces true faith, the intuitive realization of the divine powers in the soul. \"•Hebrews 11:1, 3. 898"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"\"Lord, increase our faith,\" the disciples petitioned Jesus. Even a little intuitive faith can accomplish wonders, far more than mere belief or the enhancing power of imagination. One who - does not meditate or contact God might stand in How to develop a fee- front of a tree and with all his human belief, abet- lief into the absolute ted by a strong imagination, say: \"I command you, conviction of faith be thou plucked by the root, and be thou planted in the sea.\" Naturally, it will not do so. Miracles cannot be demonstrated by conditional belief or imagination, but by uniting the Self with God. There is a way to cultivate belief until it becomes faith or absolute conviction. Belief is the initial recipient attitude of the mind necessary for planting the seed of a hoped-for outcome. As a successful farmer learns the laws of planting for a good harvest, so a truth-seeking in- dividual must learn how to cultivate the soil of belief so that it may yield the desired result. When the seed of his aspiration is continuously watered with belief in the Self and in the intercession of a master—as when the disciples appealed to Jesus—it sprouts into faith that the de- sired result will inevitably be accomplished. Jesus knew the laws of truth; he was equipped with almighty God-consciousness and knew that anyone who trusted in him and his words would create a channel through which he could easily transfer to the supplicator the powers within his Christ Consciousness. Ordi- nary spiritual teachers cannot surcharge people as Jesus did, because they themselves are not always convinced of the power of divine will and intuition-born faith and are thus lesser conduits for its transmis- sion to others. Jesus taught from his own experience and example that soul in- tuition and its supremely accomplishing power of faith develop in those who meditate deeply and do not stimulate body consciousness by constant dependence only on material sustenance.* When the soul continuously remains identified with the delusive dream-body, it puts on the weaknesses of that mass of matter and forgets to exercise the all-powerful faith hidden within itself. Faith is lost by sorrowing over or being elated by the changing conditions of sickness and health that \"Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: (For we walk by faith, not by sight:) We are con- fident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord\" (II Corinthians 5:6-8). 899"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"invade the body. The soul can neither be sick nor healthy, for it is made in the bodiless image of perfect God. Anyone who is jubilant be- cause of the dream health of the body or grieved by its dream sickness, or who is afraid of disease and distressed when it comes, is dreaming the cosmic delusion and is not inwardly free. Hence every devotee should meditate on his transcendent blissful Self and preserve that ever newly joyous state of consciousness. It is greater to realize the perfec- tion of the soul, which is immortal, than just to acquire by mental power health of the temporal body, which has to be cast away at the call of death. When the consciousness of the devotee is finally united to Cosmic Consciousness, which sustains and controls the medley of dream forms in the cosmic dream universe, then through that con- sciousness \"all things are possible to him.\" Jesus stressed to his disciples that the way to rouse the power of faith is to realize the presence of God within one's own Self. To produce difficult supernatural healings or other miraculous phenomena, it is nec- essary first to accomplish the supreme miracle: uniting the soul with God to the conscious satisfaction of the Self and the Divine Father. It is in the nature of faith to create anything it wants. One who be- lieves very strongly in the fulfillment of a desire will sooner or later find it comes to pass. But before one can move mountains, Using faith to resolve he must be able to demonstrate that divine power in minor difficulties as little accomplishments in life. One should develop well as to \"move faith by working it to resolve minor difficulties; he mountains\"  will thereby prepare himself to cut through the Gor- dian knots of life's most recondite troubles. \"Therefore I say unto you, what things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\" Those who concentrate prayerfully and continuously on any goal will see that no matter how daunting its attainment they will be led to the means of receiving what they seek. One's strong faith can work miracles by su- perimposing helpful thoughts in the brains of others. For example, be- fore seeking employment or negotiating for something desired, one should concentrate his thoughts and prayers strongly in a positive way. God will respond by dropping into the minds of others those thoughts that are in harmony with whatever one is seeking. It is true that this is not direct materialization as Christ was able to demonstrate. Still, strong thoughts create conditions in kind; they set in motion the minds of others who will later step forward to assist in realizing the goal one 900"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"is visualizing. And when faith becomes very powerful, God Himself will so order the sought-for attainment. Why not? He created every- thing in the beginning by special creation. He told the flowers to be flowers and water to be water and electrons to be electrons. If anyone can image his wants and will them with indomitable strength, and un- waveringly \"believe that ye receive them, ye shall have them\"—but not otherwise.* It is helpful to practice cultivating concentrated visualization. One way is to sit quietly in a totally darkened room and visualize the sur- roundings. Try to think of all the various items in that room, mentally seeing them in minute detail. Then turn on the light and see how ac- curately and completely you were able to identify the decor while sit- ting in the dark. Now turn out the light again and visualize everything in another room. Concentrate deeply until you see every corner and every object in that room. This simple practice works. As one devel- ops the power of visualization, it can, within reason, bring to pass anything one wishes. Nearly everyone at some time has had the expe- rience of attaining something they had long envisioned and wished for, even though fulfillment was unlikely. Concentration is the key, along with faith. However, concentration and visualization alone are not sufficient; merely to think of oneself as having the status of a millionaire will not make it so. In addition to positive thoughts one must have adamant will power and unshakable faith. The will must be made so strong that it can bring whatever one visualizes into reality through one's applied concerted effort. Remember, \"God helps him who helps himself.\" One's goals must be within the bounds of wisdom. When Jesus urged unfaltering belief as the way to achieve what one asks for in prayer, he did not mean that if all people prayed and thoroughly be- lieved they would be as rich as Croesus within a year, their desire would be granted. They could not so expeditiously change their habits, the karma of their present and past lives, and their environ- mental opportunities, just by prayer and belief, to suddenly become opulent. According to the present karmic conditions on earth such a * \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. A double minded man is unstable in all his ways\" (James 1:5-8). 901"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"happening is impossible. Human prosperity requires human meriting and is conditioned by environment. There are in this world scores of people who have superior mentalities and more will power than Henry Ford; but they are not placed in a similarly favorable environment, with the same karmic background, that made it possible for Henry Ford to amass his fortune. In fact, the average person of today will likely have to work hard for many more lives before the law of finan- cial evolution would permit him to enter the millionaire class. All hu- man achievements have to be karmically earned, all human faculties of merit acquired. There are many abilities to be cultivated besides that of making money, many forms of karmic evolution more impor- tant to one's welfare than financial evolution. Nevertheless, by prayer, meditation, and good actions all human beings can develop spiritually and attain communion with God and intuitive conviction of His almighty presence within Fulfillment of Jesus' themselves. Because man as the immortal soul is promise comes with made in the image of God, he can in a short time— realization of God's even within one life—regain his consciousness of presence within oneness with the Divine. Anyone established in that unity can make himself immeasurably wealthy and powerful if he wants to be. But, paradoxically, material gain is never a goal of the enlightened man! Jesus realized, \"I and my Father are one.\"* He could perform miracles, heal the sick, and raise the dead because he was established in his identity with God. Sometimes people pray unwisely or irra- tionally, asking for things their karma and stage of evolution do not permit them to .have at present, believing that their prayers will be ful- filled. But when their desires are not granted, their belief—which was in fact more of an expression of their importunate wants rather than an exercise in faith—turns into doubt about the efficacy of prayers and the existence of a caring God who responds to man's needs. People blunder into this negative state of false reasoning because they take the saying of Jesus, \"All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive,\"f without its context: \"If ye have faith and doubt not....\"t One must have faith, not blind belief but in- *John 10:30 (see Discourse 52.). f Matthew 21:22. t Matthew 21:21. 902"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"tuitive conviction of the omnipotent presence of God within the en- lightened Self, and doubt not that His Presence and power are within. If one first has this intuitive realization of God, through meditation and communion, then one cannot have doubts about the responsive immediacy of His almighty power. Therein lies the truth of Jesus' words. After attaining God-consciousness, then whatever one prays and believes, he can accomplish. These words of Jesus instruct believers in prayer that because of the instability of their faith, there is no assurance that all prayers will be answered in the manner desired. So long as one is in a state of dis- union with God, it is not enough merely to \"believe\" and pray labo- riously. The devotee should first seek contact with God; and even af- ter experiencing God-communion, he must take care to believe — \"shall not doubt in his heart\"—that whatever he desires as he prays is even then coming to him through the almighty power of God; then he shall receive it. A human beggar receives a beggar's pittance, but a divine son who is one with God receives the son's share. That is why man as a human beggar should not expect his prayers for the divine inheritance of great powers of fulfillment to be granted. But when by meditation man dis- sociates himself from his physical limitations and concentrates on the unlimited power of his soul, then he acknowledges his immortality and changes his status from that of a deluded mortal, subsisting on the chance crumbs of his karma, to that of divine sonhood, with heaven and earth at his command. The follower of the scientific path of freedom from material limita- tion works at developing mental power. By yoga techniques of medita- tion, affirmation, and visualization, and by unshak- able will power and faith, the power of mind can A child of God gradually be made to exceed the delusion-imposed should never accept limitations of body consciousness. When the thoughts domination by mortal are brought under control, they become veritable mir- limitations acle workers. The advancing devotee can use that mind power to heal the body and to relieve its suffering. It is tragic to think of persons who endure years and years of cancer or other forms of wretchedness. Man's susceptibility to suffering comes through ignorance of his innate divinity; how indolently he neglects the development of the power that can master the body and keep it in the palm of the hand of his soul. By control of the mind he could become indifferent to the con- 903"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"dition of the body, in health as well as disease, even as a person under anesthetic can be operated on without feeling any pain. The germ of every trouble starts in the mind; yet in that mind is also the Infinite Power that most persons have never used. We are children of God with all His powers latent within us; we must never part with those powers by supinely accepting domination by the mortal self. Life is not just prosperity and health; life is battle. Saint Francis was blind and suffered numerous ailments and depriva- tions, yet he was able to heal the sick and raise the dead, and to re- joice in communion with God and Christ. Those who realize their oneness with God become inwardly free from the seeming ills of this dream life, and behold health and sickness, gain and loss, life and death, only as interesting phases of the dream. Of course, it would be foolish to presume such aboveness until one actually realizes that all matter is energy and that energy is the thought of God. One who strikes his dream head against a dream wall will get a dream fracture! The body is man's cross and he has to bear it bravely and men- tally rise above its complaints. Those who love the body and are at- tached to its happiness rebel against God as soon as suffering comes. Jesus was nailed to the cross and was suffering with all his sensibility; yet he prayed, \"Father, forgive them.\" He could have destroyed his en- emies with the power in his spiritual eye; he had the divine forces of God at his command. But by this singular act of love he demonstrated his greatest miracle as one proclaimed by God as a true divine son. In Jesus there was no trace of egoity with its body-identified at- tachments and enslavement to desires, anger, and vengefulness. By gradual steps, each man has a soul destiny to rise to a Christlike life —to practice the universal Christ principles at all times. Life is a lab- oratory and testing ground in which man is to learn from his divine potentials how to be happy even when bruised by trials and grievous offenses. Man's tests are not sent by God as punishment; His law is not \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\" If God fights man, then He is not God. He knows He got us into this mess and He wants us to get out, and the way is to endure our tests and conquer. Each person must learn to bear his cross while never losing faith in God. When the body suffers and one is yet able to say, \"I am all right,\" he is transcending the body. In this world, nature constrains man to live as an ordinary human 904"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"being, but within we must be gods. Jesus, like ordinary men, ate and slept and wept. In a moment of weakness and pain on the cross he cried out in his humanness, \"My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\" But inside he was divine. He had bridged that gulf between human life and the divine life, and was established in his divinity. God made every man in His image so that by that potential he too might overcome his many tests and become established in his innate divinity. Life is an anomaly; but no matter how hard it is to understand, man ought not to blame God for his ills. The book of life is like a novel. It is read with laughter and weeping and excitement almost to the end, with still many questions left unanswered until in the last chapter all the puzzles are solved. This book of life is written by the Master Novelist. The full meaning of His masterpiece will not be un- derstood by anyone who has not himself become one with the Mas- ter, able then to read His thoughts between the divinely scripted lines. Until you know the wisdom and love that interlaces the plot of life, have faith in God. Live the life divine: Conquer bad habits and do not cater all the time to the body. Give it to God. The devotee says: \"Lord, You are the creator and owner of this body, so it is for You to help me care for it; and I know You will.\" A person with a hundred years of prosperity and health, but with no spiritual realization, is not as fortunate as one who is crippled, deaf, blind, and forsaken, but who has God in his heart. To meditate and practice Kriya Yoga is the scientific way of solv- ing the mystery of life and its inscrutable problems, by first solving the mystery of the Self and its relationship with Spirit. Gradually one at- tains; through the science of the Spirit comes power to do all miracles. To anyone trained in the methods of the masters the knowledge of the masters comes, fulfilling one's hope—the hope of all mankind—to set the spirit free. \"If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed....\" Immortal words! spoken to shatter the bonds of doubt-enslaved mortals and rouse their native all-conquering will: \"Beware, O ye mountains!

In children, before the age when indiscriminate willfulness and past karmic tendencies take control, one can see the natural manifes- tation of some of the attributes of Christ Consciousness. Therefore Jesus cites the example of children as a reminder to the devotee of the childlike qualities so often subverted in the adult mentality and habits —lack of egotism, body consciousness, selfishness, and attachment; and presence of purity, guilelessness, innocence, obedience, humble- ness, meekness, love, trust, and joy. Only when a devotee becomes possessed of these qualities through deep meditation and practice of self-discipline does he prepare himself to receive and manifest Christ Consciousness. The pure child's mind is by nature centered in the paradise, the el- evated consciousness, of the spiritual eye; but with sexual arousal and the strong urgings of the senses for gratification, the mind is thrown out of the higher potentials of paradise and descends into identifica- tion with the fleshly senses and their absorption in the physical world.

Yet disciples often dissent by exalting their own teacher above others. Many Hindus, for instance, say that the Lord Krishna is God's su- preme incarnation; Christians accord that honor to Jesus Christ. But what would Jesus himself say? \"He that is least among you all, the same shall be great, \"f The soul that has lost all egotism of the pos- sessive little self, utterly humbled of I, me, and mine, knows only its identity with God, the One and Only, in whom there is no higher or lower. A liberated saint, however great he appears in his earthly role, never claims to be God incarnate. Even Jesus, though he was one with God, said, \"What my Father knows, I know not.\"| The wave cannot say, \"I am the ocean,\" for the ocean can remain without the wave, but the wave cannot remain without the ocean. It is all right for a fully liberated master to say, \"God has become my- self,\" but he would never say, \"I am God.\" The ocean has become the wave, but the wave is not the ocean. God is the Creator and sustainer of all liberated souls, and His grace grants them to feel, as did Jesus: * See commentary on Jesus' saying \"I and my Father are one\" (Discourse 52). fLuke 9:48.

Many of his followers had told me he was God Himself. In expectant awe and reverence I went to see him, and bowed down before him. But as soon as I looked straight into his eyes, he sought to impress me further and thundered, \"I am God!\" and I shouted back, \"You don't say so!\" To counter my defiance, which he had never heard from those who followed him blindly, he became ridiculously supercilious. \"How dare you blaspheme my presence,\" he shouted. \"I am God!\" I took a little mirror out of my shoulder bag and held it up to his face. I said, \"Look at yourself! You are not God, but a plain egotist and anger slave.\" I rose and, turning my back, started to leave. He followed me for some distance, entreating me, \"Young man, come back!\" I turned back, and looking into his eyes, I said, \"Please do not utter this great blasphemy by proclaiming, 'I am God.' Though God may not expose your audacity, you hurt yourself by assuming a right to the throne of your Maker.\" To be sure he understood, I added, \"If you sit on fire, claiming that you are fire, your body will be burned up, even though the fire doesn't want to harm you. So be forewarned. You who must live on food and drink and have not overcome death, do not be so foolish as to present yourself as the transcendent Supreme Creator of the Universe.\" The saint's eyes welled up with tears. He took hold of my hand and said, \"You have taught me a lesson in humbleness, and from to- day I shall try my utmost to become a true servant of God. I assure you, I shall never again say to anyone, 'I am God.'\" We embraced and parted in tears of joy, having mutually profited by each other's company. He must have been a real saint to have so readily, and humbly, recanted his fault. Egotism is the surest sign of an ignorant man. A childlike humble nature in a wise man is the surest sign that he contacts God. There is • • • a proverb that a few fish in a small vessel make a Egotism: the surest lot of splashing noise, but the movement of whales sign of ignorance and large denizens in the ocean creates no such commotion.

Like the beloved God with whom they identify, they never use their powers for the sake of displaying their awesome spiritual nature. Humbleness is not an assumed meekness; a pretense of humility does not make one a humble being. A person who remains busy within , perfecting himself in God's eyes and to the satisfaction of his own soul, is so intent in so doing that it leaves no scope for any de- sire to impress others with his accomplishments. Thus, when a person is wholly absorbed in being great and in selflessly doing great things so that he never thinks to talk about it as a personal achievement, he is truly humble. Conversely, the egotist remains mentally and physi- cally idle in self-improvement, imagining that he graces the world with his mere presence and small doings; he loses no opportunity to con- vince others how great he is and to join in a chorus to sing his praises. A wonderful child blooms like a flower, with no conscious intent to advertise its unfolding fragrance or beauty. So is the would-be di- vine man: he absorbs himself in expressing the glory of God, unaware, like a child, of his own qualities. The truly great master-minds of India that I have seen are divinely childlike, displaying the qualities that are natural to a pure mind—sin- cerity, frankness, nonattachment, universality, uniformity of action- thought-speech, forgiveness, truthfulness, calmness, sweetness, laugh- ter, and freedom from worry—minus the child's ignorance. A person who does not cultivate the above-mentioned attributes latent in the soul is constantly beset with selfishness, suspicion, wor- ries, fear, and attachment, which steal away his peace and leave him in misery. As a well-adjusted child lives happily, confidently secure in the protecting power and love of parents, so a divine man with child- like trust relinquishes fear, worldliness, and egotistical living by com- pletely depending on the all-protecting power and divine love of God.* \"But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about * \"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has torment.

His spir- itual and physical misery will be far greater than if a millstone be hung around his neck and he be cast into the sea.\" Jesus typifies little children as the incarnation of undiluted divine purity and innocence, as also their counterpart in pure-minded saintly persons. Anyone who physically, mentally, or spiritually maltreats those in whose qualities God's nature is manifest acts against the Di- vine Manifestation itself. Thus Jesus points out that persecution of in- nocent children and saints, through whose purity God is distinctly manifest, is blasphemy against God Himself. There is frequently a metaphorical as well as literal meaning in- tended in the words of Jesus: \"Any person of misconduct who by ego- tism and inordinate kowtowing to his physical body deliberately offends one of the soul's childlike divine attributes, which are manifestations of my Christ Consciousness, will feel the millstone of misery heavy in his life, drowning him in the dark depths of the sea of ignorance.\" This world is vast, peopled with such diverse mentalities that it is impossible to prevent incursions of wrongdoing against innocent chil- dren and saintly souls; but the law of karma knows all, and its in- transigent judgment is dire toward anyone who deliberately offers himself to be a medium of wronging God's \"little ones.\" Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.

In this passage, Christ rejects any notion of his kingdom as a limited locality, thus indicating its omnipresent nature—in Christ Conscious- ness and Cosmic Consciousness. When the other disciples heard the request favoring James and John, they were indignant against these two brothers. But Jesus called all of them to him and said to them, \"You know how appointed rulers exercise dominion over the Gentiles and how their superiors assert au- thority over those rulers. But among you who are the children of God, equal in His eyes, there should be no posturing for authority over one another. \"Anyone who wants to be great among you shall minister to all and be the servant of all; the same shall hold true for whosoever in heaven's eyes would merit a seat of honor in God's kingdom. The Christ Consciousness in me came not to be served but to serve, and to offer divine light through the example of sacrifice and ideal living, that others following may be redeemed and attain the infinite kingdom of Cosmic Consciousness.\" All souls, as with the disciples of Christ's teachings, who are able to attain the perception (baptism) of the Holy Ghost Cosmic Vibra- tion and the wisdom and bliss of Christ Consciousness will be en- throned in the equalizing omnipresence of the one and same eternal God. Jesus points out that the Christ Consciousness in him did not ma- terialize on earth to gather the adoration of people, but to offer the highest service to them by demonstrating divine consciousness in acts of supreme physical, mental, and spiritual sacrifice. By his example Jesus extolled as a cardinal principal in his teachings — frequently 920"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"quoted, but rarely followed—this ideal, this grand truth, that he who is veritably among the greatest considers himself the least, and the ser- vant of all.

But he who gives of himself in ministering to all sits as a king on the throne of love in their hearts. In the so-called civilized world, the one who is served by others, \"he that sitteth at meat,\" is usually considered of a higher social stand- ing than \"he that serveth\"; but it is different in heaven. By illustration and example Jesus stressed that according to divine law the superior position is that of service.

Those for whom the well-being and gratifications of the body supplant the desire to meditate and be in God-consciousness are foolish, \"offending\" one's true Self, the soul, by forsaking eternal hap- piness and immortality in preference for the short-lasting physical pleasures—with attendant miseries—of a few years of bodily exis- tence on earth. 2.

The word hell is from the Anglo-Saxon root helan, \"to conceal.\" Therefore, the word hellfire is very appropriate to depict the concealed flames of agony which stored- up tendencies can produce in earthly life or in the afterlife in the astral world.* Just as an evildoer with any iota of rationality burns with evil conscience during wakefulness and with subconscious terror during sleep, so the consciousness of a man of evil conscience suffers from hell- fire or agony in the \"wakeful\" state of human life, and after death suf- fers the effects of bad karma in the form of \"fiery\" nightmare-like expe- riences in the astral world. Physical misery ends with death; but spiritual misery born of ignorant actions continues in the after-death state and on into new physical incarnations, until by virtuous deeds and renunciation of evil that bad karma is expiated. Thus Jesus goes on to say: \"Every devotee by meditation must sat- urate, 'salt,' himself with the fire of realization, that he may be ac- —— ceptable to God on earth and in the astral world. Advice for aspirants Everyone who makes a spiritual sacrifice of mate- experiencing tempo- rial indulgences for God-communion will find his rary spiritual soul 'salted' or saturated with divine realization. As deterioration salt bestows good flavor on food and also preserves it, so when the human consciousness is salted with divine realization it is saved from the delusion of decay and death and savors its native immortality. But if by concentrating on material plea- sures and egotism the preservative flavor of the divine salt is lost, so also is lost all goodness it could impart in the seasoning of the soul. \"A true disciple is like good salt. He seasons his own life and the lives of others by his spirit of renunciation and his cultivation of di- vine qualities and realization. Just as unsavory salt cannot be used for anything, so a disciple who loses the focus of his renunciation and his sense of self-discipline is useless to himself and to others, until he ac- quires the fresh salt of Self-realization by daily meditation and by ab- sorbing through attentive good fellowship the divine peace of the Self- realization expressed by other God-seeking souls.\" * As cited earlier [see Discourse 27], the word used for hell in the original Greek of the Gospel is Gehenna —from Hebrew Ge Hinnom, the valley of Hinnom southwest of Jerusalem, used as a dump for the filth of the city, where continual fires were kept to consume it.

The devotee may have wondrous perceptions and realizations in meditation—as also the gift of spiritual powers—and yet suddenly, or by slow erosiv- ity, be entrapped by some silently lurking egoic karmic tendency. Sta- bility in the Changeless Spirit requires years—even incarnations—of moral and spiritual discipline and repeated experiences in the ecstasy of God -communion until the devotee's consciousness realizes no loss of God -perception and attunement during the fulfillment of his dutiful ac- tivities in the world. Thus Jesus advises the disciples that they would regain their full Self-realization by renunciation of egotistical desires and especially by meditation-bestowed power to free themselves at will from the ego's whimsical bondage to the attractions and repulsions of delusion.f Then with the newfound salt of Self-realization they could saturat e their human consciousness with soul-immortality in Christ Consciousness. \"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven\" (Matthew 18:10). ^^r^ake care that you do not disdain the simple, humble con- -I. sciousness of children.

God is often conceptualized as a Venerable Being in masculine form with a hoary beard, sitting on a grand throne in a point of space called heaven. It is mistakenly supposed that all good souls who reach this heavenly region see God as this benevolent Elder. \"Face of my Father\" does not signify that God has a body with distinctive physical features and countenance akin to man's form. Under no circumstances could God withdraw His omnipresence from infinity and remain confined within the limitations of one form; His cosmic body of universes would disintegrate without the sustaining presence of His conscious every- whereness.

The souls of children, as- cending prematurely to an astral sphere, typically perceive the Heav- enly Father as reflected in astral visions of angelic beings and in the forms of saints or masters.

If he remains recalcitrant, at least the erroneous one would find himself convicted by his own conscience, stimulated by the loving entreaty and thoughts of the brother, good people, and reli- gious teachers.

Every soul is a child of God and a reflection of God's omnipotent will, but by egoity man isolates his will from the Divine Will and thus limits it.

The devotee ought not to expect the full realization of the power of his will and prayer until he has strengthened them by divine company and God-contact. When Jesus said, \"Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I,\" he stressed the power of united concentration: When two or a few devotees come together for inner worship of God, the stronger divine concentration of one person strengthens the weaker concentration of another. But if such gatherings are merely a cause for discussion and gossip, halfhearted recitation of prayers, or absentminded rituals, with no real inner communing with God, it is unlikely that the Divine Guest of Honor will be felt in their midst. Jesus' exhortation was a call for sincere devotees to unite the depths of their meditation in hearing \"my name,\" Cosmic Vibratory Sound, Aum, announcing that \"there am I,\" Christ Consciousness, \"in the midst of them.\" In the Cosmic Vibration they will feel the Christ In- telligence become manifest within their own uplifted consciousness. Saint John in the Book of Revelation said: \"I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet.\"* The \"voice as of a trumpet\" signifies the great cosmic sound of Aum, which the devotee hears in meditation as he approaches Spirit.

In- stead, he forgave them. By that act, his life became a channel of God's light for all ages to come. To respond to hate with more hate, to fight evil with more evil, is to support the strength of the Evil Force. The power of Satan can be conquered solely by the good force of God. It is a common human blunder to resist anger with anger. The annals of history are rife with wars fought to suppress evil people by fire and sword; but the use of force alone is not lastingly effectual. Their bodies may be conquered by destructive means, but the evil and anger in their hearts will seethe and unless healed will grow stronger, in time finding new outlets for that pent-up hostility. People can be restricted but not wholly con- trolled by force. The ultimate influential power is God's love given through a genuine heart. Only love can truly destroy enmity in malev- olent persons. The vibrations of divine love are a silent force that sub- tly works palliative transformations.

In ac- cord with the tenets of these monastic renunciant orders that have existed continuously in India since India's ideal ofcom- ancient times, Jesus considered no dwelling place as plete renunciation ex- his home and amassed no money for food or cloth- emplified in the life ing; he did not marry or acknowledge his earthly of Jesus relatives as his sole family. He required of his apos- tles, also, the strict life of renunciation: \"And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse: but be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats\" (Mark 6:8-9; see Discourse 40). \"Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple\" (Luke 14:33; see Discourse 58). \"Sell that ye have, and give alms; pro- vide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also\" (Luke 12:33-34; see Discourse 56). The corollary of outer renunciation is the nonat- tachment of inner renunciation: \"Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on\" (Matthew 6:25; see Discourse 29). That is, consider your body a part of God and do not emphasize the material consciousness in it; spiritualize it by tuning your consciousness with God-consciousness, and you will realize that your life is sustained directly by your Creator. A God-surrendered, God-supported life has been extolled by some of India's greatest prophets, including Lord Buddha, Swami Shankara, and Sri Chaitanya. Initiates of the Swami Order, reorganized by Swami Shankara, and of the Buddhistic monastic order (predating the Christian era), follow the above-mentioned tenets of renunciation.* *In The Vision of God (New York: Longmans, Green and Co., 1932), Dr. Kenneth E. Kirk , Anglican bishop of Oxford, points out that Jesus' ideals of renunciation were not derived from traditional Jewish teachings: \"The ascetic outlook of the Gospels is seen to stand out of any recognizable relation with contemporary Judaism. The passages about turning the other cheek, about taking no thought for the morrow, about laying up no treasure on earth, about forsaking parents and possessions, about bearing the Cross are foreign to the genius of the [Jewish] race.\" Though Bishop Kirk concludes that the his- torical origins of these teachings are something of a mystery, other historians relate them to evidence of Jesus' link with India. The distinguished scholar (and former president of India) Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan writes in Eastern Religions and Western Thought (Oxford University Press, 1939): \"In his teaching of the Kingdom of God, life eternal, as- 949"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"People in the West tend to forget that the Bible is an Oriental scripture and that Jesus was an Oriental. He is, therefore, in many ways, more understood in the Orient than in the Occident, where the Christian scriptures are generally interpreted with ample accommo- dation for a lifestyle that is spiritually less demanding. Jesus lived the life of a renunciant and celibate, but the West little cares to follow that . They take from his teachings as much as they can adapt without inconveniencing their mode of living. Some Catholic monastics and a few others in the West do live the single-hearted renunciant life en- joined by Christ (becoming sainted examples); but in the East this ideal has been emphasized both in the material and the spiritual life. In the West and in the East there are those who have exemplified the requisite inner spirit of renunciation in secular life as well as in the hermitages. Bhagavan Krishna, a godly king to whom are ascribed the sublime yoga teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, emphasized how to live i n the world without being attached.* King Janaka, a ruler in ancient Indi a who was an illumined saint of perfect inner renunciation, also demonstrated this ideal. In the modern era, the life of Lahiri Mahasaya offered the same example. Swami Shankara extolled wisdom and renunciation; Jesus em- phasized devotion and renunciation. Jesus, like Shankara, was a san- nyasi, follower of the path of complete outer and inner renunciation. The Sanskrit word sannyas, from roots meaning \"to cast aside,\" de- notes one who divests himself of all encumbrances of identification with a limited body, mind, and ego, acknowledging no other self but Spirit. Jesus, who had expanded his love beyond the exclusivity of family ties and attachments, said: \"Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?\" Shankara similarly expressed his transcendent freedom: \"N o birth, no death, no caste have I. Father, mother, have I none.\" The great swami went on to say: \"Mind, nor intellect, nor ego, chitta; sky, nor earth, nor metals am I. I am He, I am He; blessed Spirit, I am He.\"f Jesus likewise averred: \"I and my Father are One.\" cetic emphasis, and even future life, Jesus Christ breaks away from the Jewish tradition and approximates to Hindu and Buddhist thought.

The family name is indicative of the nation and particular fam- ily to which a person belongs; but members of monastic orders are in- vested with new names indicating their aspiration to achieve identity with God, or to manifest one of His holy qualities, or to emulate one of His saints. The name \"Yogananda\" is derived from yoga, meaning divine union, and ananda, meaning bliss. \"Bliss through divine union\" he who is united with the bliss of Spirit. The original family name was forsaken when I took the sacred vows of sannyas from my Guru and received from him this new designation as a member of the an- cient Swami Order. Some swamis adopt the practice of nonattachment by constantly moving from one place to another, never remaining for more than three days in one dwelling, in order to observe the truth that since God is everywhere, every place is their home in Him. Even when swamis live in monasteries or hermitages, they are enjoined to keep their con- sciousness free of personal attachment, caring for the sacred precincts as a place consecrated to seeking and serving God, and remembering the Spirit as their real Home and Refuge. A devotee who localizes his consciousness to one body or dwelling place loses sight of the omnipresent Spirit within him. Attachment to one's body and locale humiliates the soul with rude limitations. The yogi is the paradigm of renunciant wanderers. His peregrinations are in the infinitude of Spirit. He closes his eyes and consciousness to mor- tal perimeters and meditates on the uncircumscribed eternal sphere of Spirit—above, beneath, and all around him; his soul in ecstatic joy re- claims its forgotten identity with the One who is all-pervading. \"Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool: what house will ye buil d Me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of My rest? Hath not My hand made all these things?\"* To devotees following the path of complete outward as well as in- ward renunciation, as did Jesus, he said: \"Every one that hath for- saken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life\" (Matthew 19:29).!

As my disciple, you acknowledge God as your Father and that your first duty is to Him and to His work of bringing souls to His kingdom; let this not be superseded by social or family expectations.\" Jesus had elsewhere quoted the divine injunction: \"Honor thy fa- ther and mother\" (Matthew 15:4); he was not here advocating that a son disrespect his father. Jesus said to his disciple, Duty to God should \"Let the dead bury their dead,\" only to change in take precedence over the disciple's consciousness his priorities as regards attachment to family his family relation and his divine relation with Jesus in which he assumed a greater obligation to serve the spiritual needs of the expanded cosmic family of Christ. The mas- ter was reminding the disciple that it was more important to answer the call to God-realization by being in tune with Christ Consciousness than to tarry in the delusion-imposed sense of obligation to tend to the burial of the father. There were so many spiritually dead people bound to mortal traditions, heedless of a higher call to God, who were ready and capable of doing the necessary for a no longer useful dead body. In India it is the custom for the son to cremate his father or mother. He is the first one to put the fire in the funeral pyre. But a swami, who renounces ties to his personal family and becomes identified with God's universal family, is enjoined to forswear this obligation as regards any of his deceased relatives. Since in this cosmic motion picture of the world drama he no longer cabins himself in only one family unit, and since in his consciousness he belongs to God's family and does not of- *Cf. parallel reference in Matthew 8:21-22. 952"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"ficiate at the death of all members of that family, why should he single out the dead of the family into which his body was born? Spiritually, it is not a sin for a swami to perform the last rites for his relatives; even the founder of the Swami Order, Swami Shankara, overstepped the letter of the rule of his order and cremated the body of his mother. Because there was no one else to perform that duty, it is said that Swami Shankara came and produced divine fire to con- sume his mother's earthly form. The injunction serves not to prohibit a swami from doing the necessary for any of his deceased relatives if there is no one else to do so, but is a reminder not to identify himself exclusively with the family in which he was born nor to feel obligated to follow its traditions, having altered his consciousness from belong- ing to a singular family to become a member of the universal family, of which his birth family is but a part. A first step in expanding one's love begins in one's home in lov- ing one's family, growing from purely self-interest to caring for family members. Renunciants go beyond that circumscription of spousal and familial caring to love and serve their expanded family. This is a higher ideal of life in that spiritual nurture by sincerely dedicated saintly souls works permanent beneficial changes in individuals and the world com- munity that cannot be wrought by mundane measures alone. This is the principle Jesus was teaching his disciple, the reason to consider God first and to spend the precious moments of one's life in God-contact, rather than allocating to God and meditation a second- ary place. It was not the burying of the disciple's dead father that Jesus reprehended, but the flawed attitude with which that devotee could so casually set aside a divine summons to satisfy a mortal attachment. Jesus sought to stir in that dulled consciousness the understanding that the Heavenly Father is the giver of the earthly father, and to Him should be given at all times supreme honor and attention. The call of Jesus to the disciple to take up a higher cause was an assurance to the disciple that by following him, who held the keys to the mysteries of life and death, the disciple could do greater service to the soul of his dead father by his spiritual good will and devotion to God than he could by merely officiating at the burial of his father's physical frame. It is said in the scriptures of India that the sanctified life of one who is single-heartedly seeking God will automatically spir- itually bless seven generations of that devotee's family—a far greater and lasting bequest than any material offering. 953"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"In his perceptive play on words, Jesus emphasized with incisive wit an important truth: Not only are the physically deceased dead, but • - • the spiritually dead are dead also, and do not even The physically living know it. He was pointing out that the spiritually may be spiritually dead were more to be pitied than the physically dead  dead; for the physically dead, having lost their earthly lives, could not awaken themselves to the truth-teachings of Christ, but the spiritually dead could hardly be par- doned for deliberately making themselves insentient to the life-giving, emancipating message brought to them by Jesus. When one is conscious of God he is really living. Until this awak- ening, the body is a tomb in which the soul is encased, as if dead and buried and awaiting resurrection. To be alive with life everlasting— that is the life that Jesus taught. How many, then, can be said to live even one year during their span on earth? If we posit a lifetime of sixty years, it is safe to assume that, on average, about thirty years are spent in sleeping, eating, and pursuing the comforts of the body. Another fif- teen years are consumed in working, to keep the wolf from the door. Of the fifteen remaining years, it is not unusual for people to waste two-thirds of that time in unproductive socializing and entertainments, and in gossiping about others and putting their finger in somebody else's pie. Only five years out of a lifetime may be left; how many peo- ple use them to think of God? Perhaps a few minutes at night are spared to parrot the Lord's Prayer, or to ask for some needed blessing, or to perform some brief ritual of worship, while the mind is longing to go to bed, wanting to get this requisite moment of devotion over with as quickly as possible. \"Please, Lord, take care of me and my loved ones, but now I want to sleep.\" Thus the time spent with God, the time spent really living, is practically nil. Yet people expect to en- ter the everlasting life of the kingdom of God! Those also who have lost their ambition in life, their will to change and improve themselves and their surroundings, are the walk- ing dead. Whenever one's will is lethargic, that person is not fully alive. It is will that draws fresh supplies of cosmic energy into the body. The self-satisfied inertia-bound worldly masses are those of whom Jesus said, \"Let the dead bury their dead\"; while to the spiri- tually willing he extended the promise of eternal life. The would-be disciple in these verses was inspired by his contact with the consciousness of the living God that Jesus was manifesting. 954"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Therefore Jesus perceived that it was a spiritually auspicious time for the man to realize that his foremost duty was to respond to that inner divine urge lest he risk losing his zeal for God-consciousness—hard- won by good karma and easily lost in the company and influence of worldly vibrations. Jesus knew the importance to all spiritual aspirants of associating with persons who are vibrantly alive with wisdom and God -contact. Thus his words signified: \"Enliven yourself in the con- sciousness of the ever-living presence of God within you. Gain that re- alization, then share your divine joy with others by telling them—by your example and your words—of the kingdom of everlasting Bliss that you feel within you.\" And another also said, \"Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.\" And Jesus said unto him, \"No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God\" (Luke 9:61-62). ere Jesus chides the irresolute devotee, the spiritual aspirant who outwardly renounces a material environment in order to plough his consciousness with discipline and wisdom, but who looks backward with attachment and longing for his forsaken worldly com- forts, pleasures, and companionships. Without the inward renuncia- tion of mortal limitations, the devotee is unable to concentrate on the attainment of the vast kingdom of Cosmic Consciousness. In the above words, Jesus describes very clearly the strict path of the man of renunciation. Single-hearted devotees who are fit to em- brac e this path know that to renounce material entanglements for the attainment of God-consciousness is wise, because nothing can be enjoyed without the consciousness The psychology ofin- borrowed from God. At the call of death, everyone ner and outer is compelled to leave everything instantaneously, of- renunciation ten without notice. It is wiser, for those who are able, to leave everything voluntarily for a life devoted to the attain- ment of God, until God is realized. If He is paramount in the con- sciousness, the performance of material duties cannot produce misery. To take on worldly responsibilities with a spiritually untrained human 955"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"consciousness is to be a victim of greed, anger, selfishness, disease, mis- ery, worry, fear, and ignoble death. The exalted consciousness of saints justifies their having placed God first in their lives, for by attaining Him they know what it is to be really happy, spiritually and materi- ally, no matter what material duties they perform. In ancient times, there was adherence to the advice in the scriptures of India that children should leave their material home environment and live until young adulthood in the company of wise spiritual teach- ers. After receiving an education and thorough spiritual training they would return to the world to lead the lives of householders, ideal ex- amples in society who had learned to govern their material lives by spir- itual discipline, self-control, and divine happiness. Among these stu- dents, some chose to remain renunciants throughout life. Jesus himself lived by that ideal of renunciation, never marrying nor identifying him- self with family ties and worldly ambitions. His parental attachment was to God and his kingdom was the boundless tracts of infinity. Anyone who outwardly renounces material duties and aspirations and retires in solitude but inwardly keeps imagining the joys of a ma- terial environment and its offerings is a pretender and not fit to un- derstand the importance of forsaking the transitory pleasures of a worldly life for the everlasting bliss of Spirit. The psychology of renunciation consists in evicting from the mind confrontational material desires in order to create an inner temple of God-consciousness. Jesus pointed out, as did Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, that a person should not presume divine attainment by out- wardly renouncing material pleasures while inwardly nurturing a longing for them. Such a person does not receive the benefit of God- contact. Along with outward renunciation, there must be inward re- nunciation as well. When that is accomplished, the mind, free from the habits of sensory indulgences, begins to be established in the king- dom of bliss in meditation. It is a psychological and metaphysical impossibility to be free from a bad habit by material renunciation alone. Evil habits are ban- ished only when they are cast off from the domain of thought as well as actions. Since thought is the spring of action, thinking evil may be as dangerous as acting evil. All devotees, householder or renunciant, must realize that mental renunciation is of primary importance in the attainment of God. It is better to practice attaining inner renunciation in the world than, without preparation of purifying the heart to desire 956"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"God supremely, to run away from the world and remain brooding over forsaken earthly joys. By spiritual techniques of meditation, the path of yoga teaches every aspiring devotee to commune with God while living in the world or as a renunciant, precluding mere outward renunciation. Escapists are afraid to struggle for a living or to face life's challenges, so they renounce worldly life for the sustenance and security of an ashram or monastery. They are not true renunciants, but social parasites, depending for food on the earnings of hardworking worldly people. They become physically, mentally, and spiritually in- dolent, and never attain God-consciousness. Only those who leave everything because they are inwardly im- pelled by the sincere love of God are justified in their renunciation. They are the select who have been called and chosen by God to seek and serve Him in unique selflessness. Such renunciants do not shrink from whatever tests or hardships assail them, or care whether they starve or die for the love of God. Their souls are in the holy company of great teachers who renounce the world to offer high spiritual serv- ice, as were the disciples of Jesus.

But Jesus could not be tempted intuition  to demonstrate his miracles like a salesman adver- tising material goods; on all occasions he acted with divine dignity and according to God's command. He meekly but wisely answered his disbelieving brothers that whatever he did, even when incomprehensible to coarsened mentalities, was consonant with divine guidance: \"All aspects of my life, the minute details of my plans and actions, are governed by the influence of the will of God on the free choices made by my will. The time when He will command me to go to the feast has not yet arrived.

My time is precious and divinely planned; but your time is unimportant to you, and thus you are always ready to spend it indis- criminately according to the impulses and desires of the moment. The world will not criticize or bother you, because you are not interested in taking the responsibility of recognizing and removing from your- selves the defects of worldly consciousness, or of pointing out to oth- ers the folly of a whim-led existence oblivious of the divine intent.

Jesus was guided by the wisdom of his loving Father, whispered con- stantly to his awakened intuition. Through that intuition he was also able to discern the most auspicious time for his actions as determined by the cosmic law of cause and effect.

His wisdom was from the infinite scroll of God-consciousness, holy writ enshrined in his soul in previous incarnations.* He challenged his critics that if any one of them were to gain actual experience of God and attunement with His consciousness and will, that person would be qualified to judge his Gospel teachings—to \"know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself.\" Jesus emphasized that his entire life and works were to declare God, not himself: \"He who teaches actuated by ego consciousness al- ways seeks personal fame and glory. But he who feels the presence of Cosmic Consciousness behind his individualized consciousness seeks only to glorify and declare God as his Creator. He is a real prophet of the Lord who thus is loyal to Him. He who is true to God, having shunned the ego, and who feels God constantly, continuously demon- strating God's consciousness through his life, can never do anything that is not in harmony with divine righteousness.\" Jesus went on to point out the irony of his being criticized by the hypocrites in the crowd who outwardly gave lip service to the laws set forth by Moses but inwardly harbored evil intentions: \"Didn't Moses give you the law not to kill? How be it that you obey not that com- mandment, as is evidenced by your desire to kill me?

Jesus points out the inconsis- tency of his critics in allowing the lesser purification symbolized by the rite of circumcision, while opposing the total physical and spiritual re- juvenation accomplished on the Sabbath by the Lord for the man who had \"had an infirmity thirty and eight years.\" \"Judge not actions of others from a hasty, superficial standpoint, but judge wisely according to the righteousness of the motive behind them.\" Then said some of them of Jerusalem, \"Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?

I did not come on earth in the way of ordinary mortals, compelled by reincarnation-making earthly desires or by the necessity to work out seeds of past karma. My desire to come on earth was to act as a message-bearer of my Father, having been chosen by Him to fulfill a divine mission. \"My Father is immanent in all space, even though your con- stricted consciousness does not feel Him in your life or understanding. But my Christ Consciousness is a reflection of the Cosmic Conscious- ness of my Father, therefore I know Him. The omnipresence of my universal consciousness comes from my realization of His Infinity.\" Jesus was hinting to the people not to doubt that he was the Mes- siah based on their rationalizations about where he came from. How- ever, when he said \"I am from Him [God], and He hath sent me,\" he did not mean that he had been specially created as a perfect being who was then sent to earth by God. Through past lives his soul had made the remarkable journey of everyman, wending its way back to God. But long since, he had attained that high state of consciousness that had freed him and fitted him to serve as a divine incarnation, an emis- sary of the Infinite, a world savior for many lost souls. All beings originally were sent to the earth through the will of God. Those who do not realize this truth misuse their God-given free will to wander in a maze of mortal desires, reincarnating again and again as they thread their way in circuitous routes toward ever elusive fulfillment. But those who live a life guided by divine will and wisdom find the opening back to God after completing their God-given pur- pose on earth.* * \"The rishis taught that each human being has been created by God as a soul that will uniquely manifest some special attribute of the Infinite before resuming its Absolute Identity.\"— Autobiography of a Yogi 968"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.

Then said Jesus unto them, \"Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto Him that sent me.

He said that many would awaken spiritually after he was gone and would seek him but not find him. They would have to up- lift their consciousness to \"where I am\" in order to know him, for so long as they remained in worldly consciousness, \"thither ye cannot come.\" In these verses, Jesus speaks of the universal consciousness pres- ent in him as consciousness of the Eternal Now. In Spirit there is no past or future, only the everlasting Present. It is in the relativistic con- sciousness of persons under the influence of maya that Eternity ap- pears separated into past, present, and future. God always is, and His immortal omniscience is not compartmentalized by the dimensional delusions of time and space; He beholds everything as happening in the infinitude of His Being now. Jesus expressed that consciousness by saying, \"where I am,\" instead of \"where I will be after the death of my mortal body\"; and later when he said: \"Before Abraham was, I am.\"* Jesus knew that whether he was in the body or in the Spirit after crucifixion he would always feel the Eternal Now. This consciousness of the Eternal Presence, unreachable by ordinary mortals, is known to the advanced devotee who is able to feel the ever-existing nature of God. Past and future vanish from within him. He realizes he is forever, not that he was or will be existing forever. That is why Jesus said, \"Where my consciousness is, experiencing the Eternal Now, that state your consciousness has not realized.\" Not understanding the inner meaning of the above sayings of Jesus, his critics began to conjecture: \"Where will he go that we may not be able to find him — perhaps to the Jews living in foreign \"•John 8:58 (see Discourse 51).

In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\" (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glori- fied) (John 7:37-39)- I n this recondite passage, Jesus makes an evident reference to the yogic science of God-communion that was the esoteric core of his original teaching to his close disciples. This verse in the Gospel According to St. John plainly states that Jesus was speaking \"of the Spirit\"—that is, of the Holy Ghost vibration of Spirit realized when life force and consciousness ascend from body con- sciousness as \"rivers of living water\" through the spinal centers to God-consciousness. The meaning of this saying would be understood not by those who only believed emotionally or intellectually in Jesus but by those who would be in tun e with his Christ Consciousness (through receiving the Holy Ghost Cosmic Vibration, which he would send to them \"that believe on him\" after his resurrection and ascendant glorification in Spirit). Any devotee practicing the science of meditation can satisfy the thirst of mortal desires, as India's great yogis have proved for millen- niums, by inner renunciation and by reversing the outwardly flowing currents of consciousness and life energy and uniting those currents with the everlasting, ever new bliss of God.

However, these words are very clear to the yogi who scientifically meditates to unite his consciousness with the Divine Source of consciousness. As a mighty river that brings fertility to the plains has its source in the mountains high above, so the source of the river of consciousness is Cosmic Consciousness, Spirit, the ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever- new Bliss that transcends creation. Descending into creation—-into every particle of thought, life energy, and matter constituting the causal, astral, and physical realms—Cosmic Consciousness is called Christ Consciousness (Kutastha Chaitanya). Flowing into the soul and pure mind of man, it is called superconsciousness. Carried on the current of life energy down through the subtle spinal centers (chakras), losing its divine awareness in body identification, it is called subconsciousness, operating the body-mechanism through the life energy in the physical brain, spine, and viscera. Descending further, out into the muscles and senses, the river of consciousness settles in the level of the ordinary waking state, enlivening the muscular and sensory activities of the body, and creating desires for and attachments to material experiences. How far the river of consciousness in worldly persons has fallen from its pristine fount in Spirit! Mired in the brackish lowlands of physical consciousness, in the outflowing energy of the lower three chakras of the spine, man tries vainly to quench the thirst of desires from the wells of sensory experiences. But worldly pleasure is like salt water: Instead of quenching desire, it creates a greater thirst. Jesus declared: \"If any man is maddened with desires and has not found peace; if any man is thirsty for the kingdom of God-consciousness and everlasting bliss, let him tune his consciousness Scientific yoga medi- with the Christ Consciousness, as is manifest within tation quenches man's me. Then, as the scripture has said, he will drink of spiritual thirst the immortal waters of bliss whose source is the all- satisfying Spirit. Any person who will tune his con- sciousness with Christ Consciousness by attentive concentration and de- votion will find that out of 'his belly'—the ganglia of nerves with their astral energy in the solar plexus and in the lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal regions in the spine—many rivers of light or life force, relaxed from the senses by meditation, will flow up through the spine, floating his con- sciousness through the spinal centers of consciousness to the nectar-bliss of Spirit in the brain, from which his thirst of desires of all incarnations will be quenched forever.\" 972"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"The devotee who masters the technique of yoga meditation knows that when concentration becomes interiorized he finds his life force a nd attention withdrawn from the motor nerves, sensory nerves, and heart and accumulated in the subtle astral center in the coccygeal re- gion of the spine. Then during deep meditation this accumulated life force floats his consciousness upward through the subtle sacral, lum- bar, dorsal, cervical, and medullary centers to the highest center of di- vine perception, the abode of Spirit in the thousand-petaled lotus of light and consciousness in the brain. The downward-flowing astral life energy and consciousness in the three lower chakras (the lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal) feed the spine, brain, and organs of the physical body with sensory and mo- tor powers, which under the influence of delusion promote worldly consciousness. The yogi devotee in deep meditation spiritualizes his consciousness and life force and reverses their downward trend to flow upward in the form of luminous rivers of light from the coc- cygeal, sacral, and lumbar regions (collectively, \"the belly\"), to the ocean of light of Spirit in the brain. The devotee sees his wondrous self coursing with these luminous rivers of life forces and conscious- ness ascending from the dark sensory regions to the effulgent bliss of Spirit. Simply stated, the consciousness flowing with the life force through the senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch makes man conscious of matter. But by meditation when consciousness and life force are withdrawn from the five senses, the astral nature of the life force, along with the consciousness and many other aroused divine forces in the spinal centers, look like rivers of light flowing upward to- ward the ocean of light of Spirit in the brain. Earlier Jesus had said: \"But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\" And: \"I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and He that believeth on me shall never thirst.\"* In the present verses, Jesus makes clear that the way man can find that satisfaction of his soul thirst and hunger is to control the outgoing river of life and con- sciousness to free himself from bondage to mortal ignorance and sen- sory desires. * John 4:14 (Discourse 17) and John 6:35 (Discourse 43). 973"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"\"He is full with contentment who absorbs all desires within, as the brimful ocean remains unmoved by waters entering into it—not he who lusts after desires.\"* Though most persons are unaware of the scientific way to reverse the flow of consciousness back toward Spirit, unconsciously they accomplish this to a limited degree each night in sleep, when the life force in the body withdraws from the muscles and senses in the deep dreamless state and the consciousness is transported from the material realm to the land where the soul feels the ever calm Spirit. One realizes he is made in the peaceful, joyous image of God after reversing the outward flow of consciousness from the body to the soul. Yogis can do that at will; and Jesus Christ was one of the greatest yogis who ever lived, demonstrating his God-union and mas- tery of the principles of life and consciousness.

An ordinary person is aware of his consciousness and life force as limited by the body; Jesus and spiritually advanced souls feel the phys- ical universe as their body, with all-pervading Cosmic Energy as the life in the veins of their universal form, and infinite Christ Conscious- ness as their indwelling Self. Jesus' words \"I am\" in the context of this verse thus refer to Christ Consciousness—the subjective Intelligence of the universe. The \"light of the world\" refers to Cosmic Energy, the Word or Holy Ghost, which informs the physical cosmos, endowing all beings and objects therein with the life of intelligent vibratory power—each element from atom to sage manifesting that intelligent life according to its evo- lutionary potential.

The consciousness of the seeker must be actually lifted from the physical realm to the plane of Christ Consciousness where he is to be found. Christians of merely theological understanding picture Jesus Christ as limited by a form and the beauteous features of a human figure; but souls who by meditation have identified their consciousness with the universal, omnipresent consciousness that was manifest in Jesus behold the cosmos as the body of Christ and the energy in it as his life and the Intelligence secreted within that life as his Christ Consciousness. It is by worshiping Christ in the self-erected temple of meditation with its high altar of Self-realization that one can bring within his own soul a \"second coming\" of the Christ Consciousness that was in Jesus. The Pharisees therefore said unto him, \"Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.\" Jesus answered and said unto them, \"Though I bear record of myself; yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.

Egotistical persons extol themselves as something more than they are. But my true Self, being the Christ Consciousness manifest through my con- * John 7:34 (see Discourse 50). Jesus extolled not his bodily form but the Universal Conscious- ness within it 983"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"sciousness, cannot exaggerate or speak untruth when it proclaims it- self. Because you know not how Christ Consciousness descended in my bodily form called Jesus, or where that manifestation will vanish after my body is no more on earth, you are judging after the manner of the flesh — a worldly judgment that sees no further than bodily limitations. \"The Christ Consciousness in me beholds every soul made after the image of the Infinite; therefore I do not judge or measure man accord- ing to his physical or mental attributes. Yet if I use my omniscient Christ Intelligence, I know how much a soul is identified with its physical form and human characteristics, and that judgment is unerringly accurate. If my consciousness were 'alone,' isolated from God-consciousness, then my judgment would be limited and subject to error. But since my con- sciousness is charged with the divine wisdom of the Father, my judgment about everything is true. \"It is described in your human law that the consonant testimony of two individuals is acceptable as truth.*\" I (my human consciousness manifesting the Christ Consciousness) am one witness to the truth I speak; and the Father (Cosmic Consciousness beyond all vibratory cre- ation) that sent me (the Christ Consciousness that is His manifestation in creation) beareth witness of me.\" Egotistical persons are wont to exaggerate their merits. But since Jesus spoke from his oneness with the Father, any of his statements that seemed to extol himself were in fact impersonal references to the Cosmic Consciousness of his Heavenly Father. Therefore, it was en- tirely proper for Jesus to declare himself through his ego-disengaged divine wisdom. Then said they unto him, \"Where is thy Father?\" Jesus answered, \"Ye neither know me, nor my Father: If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.\" These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, for his hour was not yet come (John 8:19-20). * Jesus' citing of the Mosaic law refers to Deuteronomy 17:6 and 19:15. 984"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"have not communed with the Christ Consciousness behind JL my consciousness, nor with the Cosmic Consciousness, my orig- inator and Father.

The word \"above\" in \"I am from above\" signifies the finer astral and causal regions of vibration where dwell those advanced souls who have freed themselves of physical karma, and the vibrationless sphere of oneness with God that is the abode of fully liberated masters. By say- ing \"I am not of this world,\" Jesus signifies that his Christ Conscious- ness was omnipresent in the triune physical-astral-causal cosmos and not tied to one tiny clod of earth in physical space called \"the world.\" The words \"I am He\" used by Jesus are a declaration of ultimate truth that has similarly been ecstatically realized and uttered by mas- —— ter minds of India who lived before and after the \"I am He\": oneness time of Jesus. The Isha Upanishad says: \"That ab- with Absolute Being solute Self abiding in the transcendental effulgence, (Brahman)  verily, I am He.\" Elsewhere in the Upanishads we find, similarly, the sacred truth-affirmations Aham Brahmasmi (\"I am Brahman—Spirit\"), Ayam Atma Brahma (\"This Self is Spirit\"), and Tat Tvam Asi (\"Thou art That\"). The scriptural mantra Aham-Sa or 'Ham-sa (literally, \"I am He\") are potent Sanskrit syllables that possess a vibratory connection with the incoming and the outgoing breath. Thus with his every breath man unconsciously asserts the truth of his being: I am He! Jesus—as did all liberated masters qualified to make such self- declarations—meant that he knew by direct realization that the Christ Consciousness (Kutastha Chaitanya) within himself was one with Cos- mic Consciousness—the Father or Absolute Being (Brahman).* * \"The ancient sage Patanjali, in Yoga Sutras 1:17-18, refers to two basic categories of samadhi: (1) samprajnata and (2.) asamprajnata. As applied to advanced stages of re- alization, samprajnata refers to savikalpa ('with difference') samadhi, or divine union in which there remains some distinction between the knower and the known, as in the realization 'Thou and I are One.' In greater or lesser degree, some modifications of na- ture remain. But in asamprajnata samadhi, all differentiations of nature are resolved into the one Spirit. The consciousness of 'Thou and I are One' becomes 'I am He, who 986"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"When Jesus said, \"For if ye believe not that I am He, ye shall die in your sins,\" he meant that those who are identified with their bod- ies and do not attain the transcendent states in meditation cannot know that their true Self, the soul, is a reflection of Spirit (\"I am He\"). Divine souls who live on earth identified with Cosmic Con- sciousness create no human desires or binding karma and thus, at death, become one with Spirit. But persons who pass their lifetime satisfying the body and gratifying the ego, unaware of the Divine Im- age in themselves, amass earthly karma or sins. When they die with those unresolved karmic consequences and with unfulfilled earthly desires, they must reincarnate again and again to resolve all mortal entanglements. As Jesus said, \"I go my way...whither I go, ye cannot come,\" so also Bhagavan Krishna in the Gita, instructing his disciple Arjuna, de- lineated the paths traversed at death by enlightened —— and earthbound souls respectively: \"I shall now de- Jesus' \"way of light\" clare unto thee, O Arjuna, the path, traversing to liberation in Spirit which at the time of death, yogis attain freedom; and also the path wherein there is rebirth....These two paths for exit- ing from the world are reckoned eternal. The way of light leads to re- lease, the way of darkness leads to rebirth.\"* Jesus declared (in verse 12, above) that those who would follow him \"shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\" The Gita describes how at the time of physical death the soul follows ei- ther the \"way of light\"—the opening of the spiritual eye, the awak- ening of the subtle cerebrospinal centers, and the ascension of life force and consciousness through them to Cosmic Consciousness and liberation in Spirit—or the \"way of darkness\" that is the descension or return to body consciousness or rebirth of those yet unable to open fully all the cerebrospinal doors that lead ultimately to Spirit. That way is followed by yet-to-be perfected souls who are \"of this world,\" of whom Jesus said, \"Whither I go, ye cannot come.\" has become this little form of \"I\" and all forms.' This is not the egotist's proclamation, 'I am God!' — the brass crown of megalomania — but rather the full realization of the absolute truth: God is the only Reality. Thus asamprajnata, in its absolute definition, is tiirvikalpa ('without difference') samadhi, the highest yoga or union manifested by fully liberated masters or those on the threshold of soul freedom.\" — God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita * God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita vm:23, 26. 987"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Saint Paul testified, \"I protest by our rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.\"* He was able \"daily\" in transcen- dent inner communion to make this inner ascension to the realization of Spirit.

Realizing that, you will further perceive that this inherent Christ Consciousness is the reflection of the Cosmic Consciousness. And when you realize the Christ Consciousness within yourself and myself, then you will know why I say I perform no bodily nor mental actions actuated by the ego or human consciousness. As my Father or Cosmic Consciousness has transmitted His wisdom to the Christ Con- sciousness in me, so my consciousness reveals that wisdom alone. \"The Cosmic Consciousness, which projected and materialized my body, is inseparably with me, just as the wave is informed and in- dispensably sustained by the ocean.

It is evident that merely believing in the words of Christ does not make one a qualified disciple of Christ. Jesus wanted true aspirants to strive to manifest the Christ Consciousness which was present in him, to be one who feels continuously in his daily life the guiding presence of the Infinite Christ that frees the soul from ignorance and bestows salvation. They answered him, \"We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, 'Ye shall be made free'?\" Jesus answered them, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.

Some high-caste Brahmins of India also boast of their divine parent- age, as do the hierarchy of many cultures. But Jesus points out that phys- ical good birth in itself is not an adequate credential. Each soul, though an image of God and notwithstanding good parentage, can temporarily become the servant of sinful habits, as Jesus admonished the descen- dants of Abraham.

Thus you have no real concept of the consciousness of one who realizes he has come from God.\" Jesus warns that lust or evil tendencies are implanted in man by Satan, and anyone who acts according to the dictates of these incite- ments invites Satan to be his guiding force. Jesus describes Satan as a liar, for by cosmic delusion he makes God disappear from man's sight behind the illusions of gross matter.

In \"an ultramicroscopic examination of space and time,\" writes Professor Greene, \"the conventional notions of left and right, back and forth, up and down (and even of before and after) lose their meaning.\" Einstein put it succinctly in a letter written shortly before his death in 1955: \"For us believing physicists, the distinction between past, present, and future is only an illusion, even if a stubborn one.\" To ordinary human perception, the \"illusion\" is persistent indeed. \"Such is the great influence of Time which governs the universe,\" wrote Swami Sri Yukteswar in The Holy Science in 1894. \"No man can overcome this influence except him who, blessed with pure love, the heavenly gift of nature, becomes divine; being baptized in the sacred stream Pranava (the holy Aum vibration), he comprehends the Kingdom of God.\" The great jnanavatar (\"incarnation of wisdom\") explained the genesis of time and th e other universal delusions inherent in creation, and how liberated souls such as Jesus transcend them: \"From Aum (Pranava, the Word, the manifestation'of the Omnipo- tent Force), come Kala, Time; Desa, Space; and Anu, the Atom (the vibratory struc- ture of creation)....In its different aspects Aum presents the idea of change, which is Time, Kala, in the Ever-Unchangeable; and the idea of division, which is Space, Desa, 997"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Since nothing can exist without the consciousness of God, an ad- vanced devotee whose consciousness is tuned to the universal Christ Consciousness ubiquitous in the sphere of creation realizes that the light of his God-consciousness illumines and reveals—simultaneously at all times—the objectified dimensions of space and the chambers of past, present, and future. \"O Arjuna, I am aware of the creatures of the past, the present, and the future; but Me no one knows.\"* The in- dividual who is yet subject to delusion is denied perception of the Ever Present as he beholds all events as happening in the continuum of time, and sensory objects existing in relation to one another as occu- pying dimensions of space. If a man dreams he is making a world tour by bicycle in a span of several years, he creates a consciousness of space and time in his own imagination that does not exist when he awakes. The vast mileage and its scenery occupied the limited space of his mind; the events of his tour, unfolding one upon another, transpired in a fraction of the time of his perceived experience. Jesus and great masters who have awakened in God and forsaken the cosmic dream find space and time and their cap- tiv e objects and happenings all sustained in the imaginings of God and thus, though temporarily evident, are essentially unreal. In order to be a part of God's dream-drama, the divine man out- wardly adapts to the nature of the dream while inwardly seeing his Spirit- identified Self as an eternal existence of omnipresent consciousness: \"I am present before Abraham was, I am present in the here and now, and being all-pervading I am conscious of my presence in the infinite future.\" in the Ever-Indivisible.

In any case, since the man was born blind, there was no opportunity for any sin in his present existence to be the cause of his malady.\"\" Nevertheless, being good in his present life, and drawing from past-life virtues, he had accrued sufficient good karma \"that the works of God should be made manifest in him\"—that is, to merit a miracle of divine healing by his coming in contact with God's emissary, Jesus. Evil conditions that befall man may be caused not only by the in- dividual karma of sin, but by mass or universal karma: man-made or natural calamities arising from conditions influenced or triggered by universal forces or the cumulative vibrations and actions of the masses in general. For example, suppose all of the passengers die in the crash of an airliner caught in a thunderstorm; that would not necessarily im- ply that all those persons were karmically predisposed to perish in that disaster. It was an act of nature affecting that area at that time, and the fact that the passengers happened to have chosen that flight. Though no specific past sin was necessarily directly related to their death in that way, the positive side is that at least some adverse personal karma of each individual was consummated by the tragedy. But consider alter- natively that there was a miracle survival of one of the passengers, and of some interference that prevented another person from boarding that flight; some intervening personal good karma specifically saved those individuals. It could be concluded that these persons were spared \"that the works of God should be made manifest\"—that God expresses His compassion and protection in the workings of the karmic law by which the effects of one's personal good actions can neutralize or mitigate in oneself the consequences of some otherwise devastating mass disaster. * In his scholarly study Reincarnation for the Christian (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1974) Dr. Quincy Howe, Jr., former Professor of Comparative Religion at Scripps Col- lege , writes about this incident of the man blind from birth: \"There is a glaring inconsistency in the question posed by the disciples. They ask the Lord if the man himself could have committed the sin that led to his blindness. Given the fact that the man has been blind from birth, we are confronted with a provocative question. When could he have made such transgressions as to make him blind at birth? The only conceivable answer is in some prenatal state. The question as pose d by the disciples explicitly presupposes prenatal existence. It will also be noted tha t Christ says nothing to dispel or correct the presupposition. Here is incontrovert- ible support for a doctrine of human preexistence [in the Bible]....It is perfectly rea- sonable to surmise on the basis of this episode that Jesus and his followers accepted preexistence and thought so little of it that the question of prenatal sin did not even call for an answer....We have here an explicit statement of prenatal existence with all it s implications for karma and reincarnation.\" (Publisher's Note) 1006"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"The mass karma of the time and clime of Jesus subjected new- borns to various illnesses and deformities, and the blind man's birth under those conditions, in general determined by his past life actions, was perhaps the natural cause of his defect. But through divine grace, activated by his good karma, he was blessed to receive the healing gift of sight from Jesus \"who must work the works of Him that sent me.\" When Jesus said, \"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world,\" he was speaking impersonally of his oneness with Christ Consciousness, the light of divine intelligence that ..... guides the cosmos.* His words about doing God's \"While it is day\": the work \"while it is day\" because \"the night cometh, cosmic cycles of cre- when no man can work\" must also be considered ation and dissolution from the point of view of his cosmic Christ Con- sciousness. In this connection Jesus intimated two meanings—one per- sonal, the other universal. The first—an allusion to the short span that his individual incarnation of divinity would remain on the earth plane —may be fully grasped only by understanding the broader metaphys- ical significance of his words, as follows: In the universal sense, \"day\" means the period during which Spirit manifests creation, and \"night\" signifies the period of cosmic dissolu- tion, during which naught exists but Unmanifested Absolute Spirit— alone, undifferentiated, adorned with no tremor of creative vibratory activity (\"work\").f As long as vibratory creation exists, throughout the long cyclic span of universal manifestation, God exists as the Fa- ther (the transcendent Creator), the Son (Christ Consciousness, the re- flected Intelligence of the Father omnipresent within creation), and *See commentary on John 8:12, \"I am the light of the world,\" Discourse 51. fThe Bhagavad Gita states: \"The Aum that causes the birth and sustenance and dis- solution of beings and their various natures is termed Karma (cosmic action)....They are true knowers of 'day' and 'night' who understand the Day of Brahma, which en- dures for a thousand cycles ( yugas ), and the Night of Brahma, which also endures for a thousand cycles. At the dawn of Brahma's Day all creation, reborn, emerges from the state of nonmanifestation; at the dusk of Brahma's Night all creation sinks into the sleep of nonmanifestation\" (vm:3, 17-18). \"By revivifying Prakriti (Aum, Cosmic Creative Vibration), Mine own emanation, again and again I produce this host of creatures, all subject to the finite laws of Na- ture....It is solely My impregnating presence that causes Mother Nature to give birth to the animate and the inanimate. Because of Me (through Prakriti) the worlds revolve in alternating cycles (of creation and dissolution)\" (ix:8, 10).

By periodic universal dissolution ( mahapralaya, complete cosmic dissolution, greater than Noah's Flood, which was only partial dissolution, khanda pralaya ), God withdraws the Holy Vi- bration, dissolving all creation; then automatically God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are resolved into the one Unmanifested Absolute Spirit, there to remain absorbed until the dawn of the next \"day\" or cycle of manifested creation.* Thus Jesus signified: \"While it is day (that is, so long as all cre- ation is in manifestation), the Christ Intelligence must carry on the work of maintaining order in creation, shepherding it and all beings within it to an ever greater harmony and ultimate perfection. But when the night or cosmic dissolution of all creation arrives, the re- flected Christ Consciousness, devoid of the vibratory receptacle in which it is reflected, will be withdrawn in the transcendental God the Father, even as a mooned reflection becomes united with the skyey moon at the removal of a mirror. The Christ Consciousness will then have nothing to work through, owing to the dissolution of all creation in God. But so long as the world or cosmic creation exists, so long the Christ Consciousness throughout the universe and in me shall remain as its guiding light, its intelligent principle.\" In addition to conveying these cosmic truths applicable to the uni- versal Christ Consciousness, Jesus' mention of \"day\" and \"night\" were also a personal reference hinting at the brevity of his physical incarna- tion. Relative to the individual soul, \"night\" or dissolution refers to the dissolving of delusive material body consciousness, which also may be either partial or complete—unconsciously through sleep (partial dis- * Cosmic dissolution may be only partial and temporary or complete and for a long time. In the partial temporary dissolution, portions only of matter and worlds are dis- integrated; but in complete dissolution the entire system of universes, all stars and plan- ets, all beings, are dissolved in Spirit. But the dissolving of all creation in a permanent end of manifestation is impossible until all souls are free from mortal desires and thus become fully liberated in God. To provide ample accommodation for the slow evolu- tionary return of an infinite family of souls to their Maker, God keeps spinning the al- ternating cycles of manifestation (day) and dissolution (night), spanning aeons as reck- one d on the small scale of a solar system calendar. In the night, God gives all unredeemed souls, as well as Himself! a long cosmic rest, after which the Holy Ghost, Aum Vibration, has to create anew the entire universe at the behest of God the Father.

When \"the night cometh\" —when his earthly form and Christ Consciousness would be dissolved in Spirit in the great nocturnal state of complete liberation in Cosmic Consciousness—he would not be readily manifest to the af- flicted people of this earth, f That is why, while his body was yet pres- ent in the world, Jesus wanted to do all the good he could to establish his mission of divine love and lifting souls into God's presence through Christ Consciousness. When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, and said unto him, \"Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,\" (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing (John 9:6-7). * Paramahansa Yogananda wrote in a letter to his highly advanced disciple Rajarsi Janakananda: \"There are two individual dissolutions or 'floods.' First the partial dis- solution of sleep and second, the bigger dissolution of death. (1) The partial dissolu- tion of sleep every day dissolves the daily picture of life; unconsciously, the soul real- izes its invisible blessed nature. (2) Death is a bigger dissolution in which the soul first finds out that the body is only a shadow, a picture played on the screen of the cosmic cinema house. Both of those above processes are unconsciously imposed upon man. Therefore yogis learn to produce partial dissolution and the bigger dissolution con- sciously by pranayama, switching off the life force from the sensory and motor nerves (as in sleep), and further switching off the life force from the sensory and motor nerves, muscles, lungs, heart, spinal cord, seven plexuses, etc. In order to destroy the false re- ality of the body and its surroundings, and to behold this body and world as pictures, an d to understand the invisibility and real nature of the soul, the yogi must be able to produce the partial dissolution—Sanskrit khanda (partial) pralaya (dissolution) and mahapralaya (bigger dissolution) at will.... \"Please practice these two states—of sensory-motor samadhi with heartbeat and sensory-motor relaxation samadhi without heartbeat—and you will know this uni- verse as God's cosmic cinema house.\" t \"Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto Him that sent me.

When a devotee prays intensely to God to know truth, God sends him a true guru to guide him. This divine grace comes to the devotee when he demonstrates his desire for liberation by sincere constancy in supplication to God. If the devotee is persistent in his prayer and in faith, God will surely respond by sending that soul a true guru through whose wisdom teachings and vibrations of God-consciousness the Di- vine Porter will open for the devotee the inner door of salvation.

The divine incarnations of Bhagavan Krishna and Gautama Buddha, born centuries before the time of Jesus, brought complete spiritual liberation to many disciples, and continue to work their works of redemption.

Here, as again and again, Jesus emphasizes that no one finds God until he has become a true seeker and is drawn by God to a God-ordained guru qualified to serve as his savior. Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. Jesus answered them, \"Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?\" The Jews answered him, saying, \"For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.\" Jesus answered them, \"Is it not written in your law, 7 said, \"Ye are gods'\"?

If one hundred people are basking under the sun, ten with their eyes wide open and ninety with their eyes closed, all are revealed by the sun. But the ninety who have their eyes closed see neither the sun nor them- selves as do the ten whose eyes are open. Similarly, souls with open eyes of wisdom behold themselves as emanations of God, while oth- ers, even though they too are \"children of the most High,\" do not re- aliz e it because their eyes of wisdom are closed.

Jesus, who had fully realized Spirit as manifested within him, did not speak of his human nature as God, so there was no blasphemy in his say- ing, \"I and my Father are one.\" Persons identified with their human ego- ity lack that realization; even though they are potential gods, they have no actual perception of the presence of God within themselves.

To love God supremely is to receive from Him eternal contentment and fulfillment, with freedom from all human desires that irresponsibly provoke continuous births and deaths with their unforeseen miseries.

But all avatars and saints have known in their hearts that this is not to appease some quixotic whim of God, but is rather a necessity through which the in- dividualize d soul can make a conscious connection with its Source. God can live without man's love; but as the wave cannot live without the ocean, so it is not possible for man to exist without the love of God. The thirst for love in every human heart is because man is made in God's image of love. So the avatars and saints call upon mankind t o love God, not because of compulsion or commandment, but be- cause the ocean of His love surges behind the little wave of love in every heart. A great saint of Indiaf said: \"He is the cleverest who whole- heartedly seeks God first\"; for in finding Him, he receives, along with Him, everything that is of God. To love God is to contact creation's Munificent Provenance. Many a worldly man foolishly engages his heart, mind, soul, and physical strength in the pursuit of money or human love or earthly power, only to lose them—if perchance he had found them—at the time of death. The wisest use of life is to invest it in seeking God, the one treasure that satisfies for- ever and can never be lost or diminished. Though one must love God in order to know Him, it is equally true that one must know God in order to love Him. No one can love anything of which he is entirely ignorant; no one can love a per- son who is completely unknown to him.

The average religionist rationalizes the fulfillment of his spiritual obligation through absentminded prayers or mechanical rituals, or cir- • • • cuitous wanderings in the forest of theology and Not theology but set- dogma. He may attempt to feel love and devotion entific yoga provides for God in his heart, and to put his mind on God the means to fulfill the as best he can during times of prayer; and he may first commandment try to love God \"with all his strength\" by vigor- ously singing, dancing, or even rolling on the ground as do some sects of \"Holy Rollers.\" When it comes to loving God with all his soul he is at a loss, as he does not even know what the soul is. The only time he knows something of his soul (and then only in an unconscious way) is in deep, dreamless sleep. In that state, the \"strength\" or life energy is switched off from the five senses and withdrawn inward; the consciousness of oneself as a physical being is gone. At night human beings have a glimpse of their real Self, the soul; each morning upon awakening the majority again take up their mis- taken identity as a mortal man or woman. Outward attempts to apply Jesus' teaching usually yield only min- imal external satisfaction, not God-realization. But there is an inner 1030"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"meaning to the exhortation to love God with all one's heart, mind, soul, and strength. Jesus used these simple scriptural terms, but pro- jected his understanding that in them is the whole science of yoga, the transcendental way of divine union through meditation. In India, where spiritual understanding had developed for thousands of years before the time of Jesus, God-knowing sages elaborated these concepts as a comprehensive spiritual philosophy to guide devotees systemati- cally on the path to liberation. When a person makes the effort in meditation to know God, using the sincerity of his heart and deepest feelings, and the intuition of his soul, and all the powers of concen- tration of his mind, and all his interiorized life energy, or strength, he will surely succeed. That system of spiritual culture whereby one learns to \"love God with all your heart\" is known in India as Bhakti Yoga —union with God through unconditional love and devotion. The bhakta realizes that whatever is in a person's heart, that is where his concentration is —o n the thing he loves. As the lover's heart is on the beloved and the drunkard's is on his drink, so the devotee's heart is continuously ab- sorbed in love for his Divine Beloved. To \"love God with all your mind\" means with focused concen- tration. India has specialized in the science of concentrating the mind one-pointedly through definite techniques, so that during the time of worship the devotee is able to keep his whole attention on God. If while offering prayerful devotions the mind is constantly flitting to thoughts of work or food or bodily sensations or other diversions, that i s not loving God with all the mind. The Bible teaches: \"Pray without ceasing\";*' India's yoga science gives the actual methodology to wor- ship God with that fully concentrated mind. To \"love God with all your soul\" means to enter the state of su- perconscious ecstasy, direct perception of the soul and its oneness with God. When no thoughts cross the mind, but there is a conscious all- knowingness, when one knows through intuitive realization that he can do anything just by so ordering it, then one is in the expanded state of superconsciousness. It is the realization of the soul as the re- flection of God, the soul's connection with the consciousness of God. It is a state of exceeding joy: the soul's crystalline perception of the omnipresent Spirit reflected as the joy of meditation. *I Thessalonians 5:17. 1031"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"To love God with all the soul requires the complete stillness of transcendent interiorization. This cannot be achieved while praying aloud, moving the hands this way and that, singing or chanting, or do- ing anything else that activates the sensory-muscular apparatus of the body. Just as in deep sleep the body and senses become inert, that in- ner withdrawal is characteristic also of superconscious ecstasy—only ecstasy is much deeper than sleep. Ten million sleeps do not describe the joy of it. That is the state in which one can know the soul, and with that true Self wholly adore Him who is Love itself. The fulfillment of the divine command to love God with all one's heart, mind, and soul is made possible by the science that enables the ••-•- devotee to \"love God with all thy strength.\" Yoga \"With all thy teaches that science. When one sleeps, the conscious strength \": interioriza- mind is inactive; the strength is withdrawn from the tion of life energy sensory-motor apparatus of the brain and from the through pranayama muscles and nerves and is concentrated in the facul- ties of the subconscious mind. One cannot go into the sleep state of subconsciousness unless, usually passively, the life force has been switched off from the conscious sensory and motor ner- vous system; and one cannot go into the superconscious state, tran- scending the subconsciousness, without consciously switching off the life energy from the senses and muscles. The mastery of life energy that enables one to love God with all one's strength begins with posture (asana, training the body to maintain with ease and without restlessness the correct posture for motionless medita- tion) and breathing exercises for life-force control (pranayama, tech- niques to quiet the breath and heart). By such practice, the heart becomes quiet, effectively switching off the energy from the senses and stilling the restless breath that keeps man tied to body consciousness. The yogi is able to focus on God without the intrusive pull of the flesh. The mind, disconnected from sensations, becomes transcendentally interiorized (;pratyahara ). The devotee can then use that free mind in a communion of love for God. When the devotee can love God with an inwardly con- centrated mind, he begins to feel that love for God in his heart, exqui- sitely permeating every nuance of his feelings with the presence of God. The God-saturated heart then feels the Beloved Lord in the deepest re- cesses of the soul where the little love meets and is enfolded by the Great Love. The feeling of God in the soul expands into realization of God in His everywhereness (the samyama of yoga: dharana, dhyana, samadhi). 1032"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Jesus went very deep in teachings that appear on the surface to be simple—much deeper than most people understand. That he taught the entire yoga system, the scientific method of union with God, is ev- idenced in the Book of Revelation in the mystery of the seven stars and seven churches with their seven angels and seven golden candlesticks. God-realization is attained by opening the \"seven seals\" of these cen- ters of spiritual perception to attain mastery over all astral powers of life and death through which the soul ascends to liberation.* Jesus emphasized that salvation begins with those practices that enable the devotee truly to love God with the supreme offerings of heart, mind, soul, and strength. In India's greatest scripture of yoga, the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord speaks in words that parallel the scrip- tural commandment cited by Jesus: \"Again listen to My supreme word, the most secret of all. Because thou art dearly loved by Me, I will relate what is beneficial to thee. Absorb thy mind in Me; become My devotee; resign all things to Me; bow down to Me. Thou art dear to Me, so in truth do I promise thee: Thou shalt attain Me!\"f The First Commandment leads the devotee into observance of the second great spiritual law, \"like unto it.\" As one strives to feel God within, he has also a duty to share his experience of God with his neighbors: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor (all races and creatures anywhere with whom one comes in contact) as thyself (as you love * See Discourse 6. t God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita xvm:^-^. From the commentary: '\"Absorb thy mind in Me' signifies absorption in the true 'Myself' [the Spirit, reflected in man as the soul] in ecstasy. 'Become My devotee' signifies perception and remem- brance of the blessed 'Myself' during that state of human activity in which the devo- tee's actions are not performed under the influence of the physical ego. 'Resign all things to Me' signifies dissolving mind and life force and desires in the fire of true per- ception of the inner 'Myself.' 'Bow down to Me' has a very deep meaning. The act of bowin g consists in placing the hands, palms pressed together, over the heart, then touching the fingertips to the forehead to express devotion to a person or to God. Hands symbolize activity, the heart symbolizes love, and the head symbolizes wisdom. So a person bowing to man or God symbolizes by this act of obeisance: 'My activity, m y love, and my mind are at Your service.' \"In this stanza the Lord asks Arjuna to dissolve his heart's love, his impulse to physical activity, and his discriminating thoughts in the inner 'Myself' by repeatedly concentrating his attention therein, even though the mind wants to run away and to b e engrossed in physical or emotional activities on the plane of the senses. \"The Lord further intimates to Arjuna: 'You have endeared yourself to Me.

The soul is a reflection —— of Spirit, a reflection that is in every being and in Expansion of love for the vibratory life of all animate and inanimate all beings by seeing cosmic decor. To love parents, relatives, associates, God in everyone countrymen, all races of the earth, all creatures, flowers, stars, which live in the \"neighborhood\" or range of one's consciousness is to love God in His multifarious tan- gible manifestations. Those persons yet unable to love God as His subtle expressions in meditation can nurture their love for Him as manifested in nature and in all beings they contact or sense in any way. It is God who becomes the father to protect the child, the mother to love the child unconditionally, and friends to help that incarnate soul without the limitation of familial instincts. It is God who has be- come the adorned earth with its canopy of stars to amuse His children with wonder. It is He who has become the food and the breath and the sustaining life functions of the multitude of mortal forms. When God's immanence penetrates man's understanding, it awakens man to his duty and privilege to worship God templed in himself (through meditation), and templed in all beings and things in the universe (through love of his neighbor in the proximity of his cosmic home). Even saints who love God in transcendental ecstasy in meditation find complete redemption only after they have shared their divine at- tainment by loving God as manifested in all souls in the omnipresent neighborhood of their soul. Encouraged by love for God in meditation, one might best begin soul neighborliness by reaching out in helpfulness to persons who are outside one's family, yet are nearer than the world at large. Persons in- stinctively show preference in giving to their families rather than to strangers; and the idea of \"the world\" itself is a concept far removed and abstract. But when a person lives just for himself and the select few he chooses to favor as his own, he chokes the expansion of his life, and from the spiritual standpoint he does not live at all. On the contrary, when a person extends his sympathy and caring from the \"us four and no more\" consciousness to his neighbors and to the world, his little life flows into the greater life of God and becomes the Eter- nal Life—the second requisite in answer to the question put to Christ by the lawyer, \"What shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" 1034"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Most people live in narrow walls of selfishness, never feeling the throb of the universal life of God. Anyone who lives without know- ing that his life comes from the eternal life, who abides a solely mate- rial existence, dies and reincarnates forgetful of past lives, has not re- ally lived. His mortal consciousness wandered through delusive dream experiences, but his true Self, the soul, never awoke to express its godly nature and immortality. By contrast, any devotee who by med- itation realizes the eternal life behind his mortal life lives forever, never losing his conscious existence at the time of death, or from one incar- nation to another, or in the eternity of soul freedom in God. Saints and sages who fulfill the two preeminent commandments are no longer subservient to the discipline of other commandments, for in loving God in transcendental meditation and as manifested in others, the righteousness in all cos- mic laws is honored automatically. In the devotee with God-contact, the Framer of Cosmic Law works as a natural intuitive goodness that keeps him always in harmony with the universal codes of God. Millenniums of darkness gathered around the soul may be dispelled gradually by little flames of observance of nu- merous rules of conduct. But when, by supreme effort of the heart, mind, and strength, the all-pervading light of God visits the soul, then darkness is no more; the advent of the Great Light engulfs the flicker- ing illumination of disciplined actions. Therefore, to love God through continuous prayer and meditation, and to love God through physical, mental, and spiritual service to His manifestations in one's universal family of neighbors, is the support and essence of the entirety of other laws of human conduct and liberated lives. Whether one has been righteous or reprehensible, love of God is one's salvation. Each soul should make its rightful claim to God's lov- ing help: \"Lord, naughty or good, I am Thy child; You made me in Your image. I may have been naughty, but that is when Your child needs You even more.\" He is the utmost sinner who turns away from God; he is the utmost sinner who says, \"Changing oneself from vice to virtue cannot be done.\" But he quick becomes a virtuous man, even if scarred with the sins of the world, who says from the sincerity of his heart, \"God, I love You.\" He is safe.

Mirabai knows that to find the Divine One The only indispensable is Love.\"* No one can find God without love, for love given freely from the heart of His children is the only thing man's Maker is seeking. He has everything else. The pangs of unrequited love and of separation from loved ones at death are not to torture man, but that he might at last seek the Lover that is waiting for him—a Lover that is not a man or a woman but the great God who has masqueraded before him as father, mother, friend, incarnations of lovers. It is He who is calling you; He who will never abandon you. He came to Saint Anthony, the desert anchorite in Egypt, centuries ago, when the saint was being severely tried and tor- mented by the devil and his legions of demons in extraordinary attempts to wrest from him his faith. Saint Anthony cried out defiantly: \"Satan, do your worst! Nothing will ever separate me from Christ!\" The demons attacked; the walls of the cave shook with such ferocity that their col- lapse and the death of the saint seemed imminent. At the last moment, suddenly the radiant splendor of Christ appeared, and Anthony was safe. He said to the Lord, \"Where were you, my Jesus? Why did you not come sooner to assist me?\" And the voice out of that Light replied: \"Anthony, I was with you all the time.\"f So never forsake God. The fiercer the tests of life's adversities, the more strongly the devotee clings to Him, even as * Mirabai was a medieval Rajputani princess who renounced her royalty and became a renowned devotee of God.

He knows delusion and its temptations are sometimes terrible for His unenlightened children. They are the test of God, but He never tests beyond the capacity of His devotee's endurance and conquering spirit. Even when the devotee thinks he can stand no more, the Lord is ever with him as He was with Saint Anthony, silently strengthening and supporting the devotee's every effort. When the heart is afire with the longing born of the sorrows of incarnations of separation, the Lord will reveal Himself. And the bliss that engulfs the soul at that meeting, no human tongue can tell. The heart breaks a thousand times — a million times. Saint Teresa was sorely afflicted—ravaged twenty-five years with all kinds of disease, writing in the nighttime shivering in a cold room—but such was her love in communion with Christ that she did not care. One day an an- gel pierced her heart with a breath of fire—not for cruelty, but to show her that pain could not hurt her anymore; she was above all pain. In that experience her heart became tremendous with the ecstasy and joy of God. She said: \"It seemed I couldn't endure it and then sud- denly I was filled completely with the great love of God.\" That is the eternal romance: the little spark of life consumed in a flame of divine love. Many times over the years Teresa beheld her Lord—in form and as formless. The body of Christ became the ocean of Infinite Con- sciousness, which Teresa felt—the realization of the Christ Con- sciousness in Jesus, that which declared, \"I and my Father are one.\"* * Teresa's experience with the angel is recounted in The Saints that Moved the World, by Rene Fiilop-Miller. In her autobiography the saint wrote that experiencing Christ without form is a vision \"of a higher kind.\" In this way, she says, \"we learn how He is God, is mighty, can do all things, commands all things, governs all things, and fills all things with His love.\" — Life of St. Teresa of Jesus, Chapter xxvm (New York: Benziger Bros., 1904). \" I was in prayer one day...,\" she relates in Chapter xxvn, \"when I saw Christ close by me, or, to speak more correctly, felt Him; for I saw nothing with the eyes of the body, nothing with the eyes of the soul.

Hu- man romance is an ephemeral fantasy. Romance with God is a true and everlasting joy of the Life of life, the Love of all loves. God has so much love to give to His devotee that it will burst all boundaries of the heart. When that love of God fills one's being, it embraces everyone in a universal consciousness of love, service, and compassion. As Jesus' great disciple John wrote: \"Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.\"* But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, \"And who is my neighbourf\" And Jesus answering said, \"A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. And like- wise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him. And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, beside me—that I saw Him distinctly, and felt His presence; that the recollectedness of my soul was deeper in the prayer of quiet, and more continuous; that the effects thereo f were very different from what I had hitherto experienced.... \"Afterwards I learnt from Friar Peter of Alcantara, a holy man of great spiritual- ity—of whom I shall speak by and by—and from others of great learning, that this vision was of the highest order, and one with which Satan can least interfere; and there- fore there are no words whereby to explain.... \"He renders Himself present to the soul by a certain knowledge of Himself which is more clear than the sun.

Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?\" And he said, \"He that shewed mercy on him.\" Then said Jesus unto him, \"Go, and do thou likewise\" (Luke 10:29-37). I n the poignant parable of the Good Samaritan, Jesus has pragmat- ically illustrated the meaning of a neighbor in the basic sense of every man's duty to his fellowman. Regardless of the evolving mag- nanimity of one's love, Jesus recognized the mortal limitation of any- one in trying to look after one's own duties and also those of the stricken people of the world. Human life is short and one can do only so much. Even Jesus explained The Good Samaritan: that he came mostly to minister to the needs of a understanding one's certain segment of people during his limited span duty to serve and give on earth.*    aid to others Though Jesus and the masters schedule their time in a manner most helpful to true devotees, still their liberating teachings can be universally followed through all times. Thus, Jesus intimated that though the ordinary man cannot physically or by ma- terial means ameliorate widespread afflictions, he should do whatever he can within his power and means to help any person whose need has been definitely placed in his path, as symbolized in the parable of the Good Samaritan. To relieve someone's distress is to render help as one would like to be helped if he were in the same position. Whether the needy per- son be someone in one's own vicinity or in a distant foreign land, anywhere, anyone who comes in close relationship with a person physically, mentally, or spiritually, that person is a neighbor. Man's duty to help his fellow beings does not necessarily consist of material aid. To give physical help to a neighbor is good, to give him mental and moral help so that he can help himself is better, and to give him God-consciousness and freedom from ignorance through spiritual upliftment is best. One should serve his neighbor appropri- ately in accordance with these criteria. 'Matthew 15:24 (see Discourse 44). 1039"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"In the parable of the Good Samaritan, Jesus contrasted the cal- lousness of the priest and the Levite*—who were accorded high spiri- tual status because of their ceremonial and hereditary positions—with the compassion of the Samaritan, who demonstrated the true spirit of religion despite belonging to a social caste commonly disdained as spir- itually inferior. Whatever be man's social titles of race, religion, na- tionality, they are his defining characteristics for only a little while; but all souls are gods forever. At death, man is rudely divested of his mor- tal adornments; so before he leaves this earth, he should declare his pure nobility as a child of God. Jesus was not proud because he was born of the kingly house of David, but because he was a son of God. If there were no boundaries fancy-frozen by man, all peoples of the earth would have sufficiency in the nurturing bounty of nature. A re- birth of loving God and loving one's neighbor as urged by Jesus Christ would bring a spirit of oneness to heal the ills of the world. Only by fellowship with God will harmony and fellowship come on earth. When one actually perceives the Divine Presence in his own soul, he is inspirited with love for his neighbor—Jew and Christian, Muslim and Hindu—in the consciousness that one's true Self and the Selves of all others are equally soul-reflections of the one infinitely lov- able God. Utopian social and political agendas will have little long- lasting benefit until humanity learns the eternal science by which fol- lowers of any religion may know God in the oneness of soul and Spirit communion. To observe the \"first commandment,\" as cited by Jesus, is the cen- tric obligation of human life, subordinating and making servile to it the host of demanding responsibilities man gathers unto himself. Jesus supported the scriptural command to \"Honor thy father and mother\" but love God supremely. Father, mother, friends, beloved ones, are gifts of God. Love the One Love that hides Himself behind all kindly masks. Love Him first and foremost, or times without numbering He will visit the heart and slip away unrecognized and unwelcomed. To be with God now is of utmost importance. His love is the only shelter in life and death. Time should be utilized to its best advantage; why shouldn't it be to reclaim oneness with the Creator of this Uni- verse, our Infinite Father? * The Levites were members of the priestly tribe descended from Moses' brother Aaron, or those assigned ceremonial temple functions by the priests. 1040"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"One of the most earnest prayers given to me by God, a universal prayer of divine love, is: \"Heavenly Father, may Thy love shine for- ever on the sanctuary of my devotion and may I be able to awaken Thy love in all hearts.\" Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word. But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, \"Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore that she help me.\" And Jesus answered and said unto her, \"Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her\" (Luke 10:38-42). artha, you are conscientious about material things and duties, which cause you worry and scatter your mind.

Mary has chosen that good balancing material single-heartedness of absorption of her thoughts and duties with devotional love in God alone, inspired by my words of wisdom, communion Thus her desire, which has quite withdrawn her mind from these other present concerns, shall not be taken away from her.\" Jesus here addresses all seekers of God, whether they live a secu- lar life in the world or a renunciant life in a hermitage. He extols the \"better part\" of God alone chosen by Mary, but commends the duti- fulness of Martha provided she remember that \"one thing is needful\": to perform her material duties with the thought and love of God. Some renunciants mistakenly think that if they tend to their duties in the hermitage, that alone would qualify them as being spiritual. Other renunciants think they can attain God-consciousness by neglecting ser- viceful activities to engage only in the spiritual duty of meditation. The primary purpose of an ashram environment is to offer a haven in which to seek God.

If some devotees can become so immersed in the God-communion of samadhi meditation that they consequently neglect their material duties, such omission is forgivable; but rare is that soul who qualifies for such ex- ception. (For the most part such attempts are no more than false piety.) Serviceful duties in a hermitage have to be performed by members of the community, and when devotees engage in those dutiful actions with the thought of serving God, and give Him also their undivided atten- tion in regular deep meditation, they are on the right path to receive the grace of God. But those who lose themselves in busy-ness, forget- ful of God and negligent in meditation, receive no spiritual satisfaction and begin to doubt the purpose of a renunciant's life as compared to the offerings of the world. It is better to live a life of service to the world in a spiritual envi- ronment conducive to high ideals and thoughts of God than in a mate- rial environment fraught with evils. Nevertheless, any environment can be spiritualized with the presence of God. Thus Jesus warned Martha, and by extension all disciples engaged in secular responsibilities, that though she was commendably and necessarily tending to material du- ties, she was missing the blessing of her service because her mind was so distracted by external demands it accommodated no thought of God. Jesus upheld the action of Mary because it was from no deliberate wish to shun household work, but from sincere devotion that engrossed her mind wholly in God and the God-uniting wisdom of Jesus. If Martha's works had been infused with Mary's devotion, Jesus would have made no distinction between the two sisters. Both were serving Jesus, one spiritually and the other seeing to his physical needs; but Mary's devotion pleased him more. Had Martha similarly ab- sorbed his spirit, Jesus would have allowed Mary to assist Martha; but he did not want Mary to imitate her sister's material ways, rather that Martha should follow the devotional example of Mary. That is what yoga teaches: In spite of one's duties to the world, the mind should be with God. Duty or no duty, if one tries his utmost to know God as his prime responsibility, that is the highest virtue; for no duty can be performed without borrowing the powers of God.

In simple words, each phrase offered by Jesus in this profound prayer resonates a perfect harmony with the cosmic idealism of the an- cient sacred scriptures of India, the essence of which is grandly epito- mized in the Bhagavad Gita. The prayer can be analyzed as consisting of four distinct parts, the whole of which addresses both the transcendence and immanence of God, and man's relationship with Him as the Heavenly Father of all. The first three parts convey, respectively, the cosmic truths that vali- date the defined systems of Jnana, Karma, and Bhakti Yoga —union with the Infinite through wisdom, right action, and divine love. The fourth, concluding segment is a summary obeisance to the Infinite Spirit as the omnificent God the Father. 1. \"Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come.\" 2. \"Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.\" 3. \"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\" 4. \"For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory for ever.\" The first part will be easily understood if one applies the basis of the philosophy of Jnana Yoga: the realization of Spirit as the only Re- ality. Jesus' concept of God was one of pure idealism—as is that of the highest Sankhya-Yoga-Vedanta metaphysics of India. To follow fully the path of God-knowledge that Jesus followed, the path he evi- denced to all the world, that the whole of common life revolves around a common center and that that center is God, is to find su- preme inspiration from his idealism.* * Vedanta, the end or final message of the Hindu Vedas which appears in the Upani- shads, propounds the philosophy of monistic idealism. Swami Shankara, peerless ex- ponent of Advaita (\"nondual\") Vedanta, wrote: \"The whole universe apprehended by the sensory mind and speech is naught but Spirit (Sat), the Reality transcending Na- ture. Nothing else exists.\"— Crest Jewel of Wisdom, verse 391.

He did not worship an anthropomorphic God—one conceived as having a per- sonal form. He was not thinking of a supreme per- —— sonage seated somewhere away in some unknown \"Our Father\": the region above the cosmos. That personalized God Jnana Yoga realization could not appeal to his universal spirit; such an idea of Spirit as the only was not explicated in his words or his sermons, or Reality by implication harbored in his thoughts. His real- ization embraced the knowing of the Absolute Reality of God as Spirit.* Jesus' lofty philosophy was, to a certain extent, the cause of his being marked as a spiritual revolutionary against many of the or- thodox concepts of his own Hebrew people. To him God could not be limited by any parameters of creation—time, space, causality, form, personality—nor codified by man-made credos. God transcends them all. The expression in the Lord's Prayer, \"Father...in heaven,\" thus refers to the Creator in transcendental infinity who Himself is that Eter- nal Transcendent Consciousness. That Maker of all becomings spins forth the multifarious causal, astral, and physical creations from His One Being and is yet ever untouched by them. In this opening invoca- tion to God, Jesus at once lifts our consciousness to the knowledge— the vision, understanding, realization—of the transcendental God. Per- haps if he were talking in our language today he would have said, \"Our transcendental God\" rather than \"Our Father which art in heaven.\" Now, the idea of a transcendental Deity by itself would naturally foster in man a sense that God is unreachably remote, apart from the of all being....The philosophy that has dominated science for centuries (physical, or material, realism) assumes that only matter—consisting of atoms or, ultimately, ele- mentary particles—is real; all else are secondary phenomena of matter, just a dance of the constituent atoms. This worldview is called realism because objects are assumed to be real and independent of subjects, us, or of how we observe them....The facts prove otherwise; science proves the potency of a monistic philosophy over dualism—over spirit separated from matter. In the idealist philosophy, consciousness is fundamen- tal....From this vantage point we see that some of the concepts of various religious tra- ditions become as logical, elegant, and satisfying as the interpretation of experiments of quantum physics.\" (Publisher's Note) * \"But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Fa- ther in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship Him.

That God has no relationship with the souls He created could not possibly be true, or the whole of the cos- mos would indeed be absurdly purposeless. Jesus emphasized the eter- nal, inseparable relationship between God and humanity with the use of the word \"our.\" He directs the worshiper's attention not merely to \"The Father in heaven\" but \"Owr Father in heaven\"—your God, my God; God of Jesus, Moses, Krishna, Buddha, Mohammed; of all hu- man beings, righteous and unrighteous, saviors and sinners. Not in an ordinary sense but with purposeful thought Jesus used that word \" Our Father\" to bring out the interrelationship between the transcendental God and the created being. The whole philosophy of the connection between the human soul and God is embodied in that one little word our. This God is the Source of all beings, hence He is the Father. Here \"Father\" is a symbol of Jesus' pure idealism: Spirit, the transcendental God, as the source, the Primal Progenitor, of all cosmic creation. From Him all things have come into manifestation, and in His own cosmic omnipotence they find their perfection: a Father. Under His guiding omniscience, all things move in their appointed course: a Father. In His beneficence and love, created beings find their inner strength and joy: a Father. Jesus expressed these metaphysical concepts in understand- able language: \"Our Father which art in heaven,\" the transcendental God inseparably related with all created beings: the source, the suste- nance, and the salvation of all. The whole of this vast concept is given in this opening phrase of the Lord's Prayer. Jesus continues: \"Hallowed be Thy name.\" The meaning of the word name is better understood in the Vedic philosophy; it means cre- ation. As a person's name is an outer symbol of who \"Hallowed be Thy he is, so vibratory creation declares the transcendent name\": the holiness, Creator. The Sanskrit term nama-rupa (nama, akin beauty, and joy per- to English name) translates as \"name and form.\" vading God's creation \"Hallowed be Thy name\" means hallowed is Thy creation, holy is Thy manifestation, spiritual is Thy Self-revelation through the outwardly working Holy Ghost, the Word or cosmic vibration of Aum (Amen). God's creation is divine; it is the spiritual resemblance, spiritual expression, of the Cosmic Reality. But the true nature of creation as a divine emanation of God can be fully known only by ecstatic oneness with God through the open- ing of the spiritual eye.

A person's rai- ment may change or be discarded, but this does not alter the wearer. Birth, maturity, old age; life and death; creation and change; sorrow and suffering; joy and happiness; pain and pleasure—to divine vision all are shimmering undulations in the fabric of time and space belonging to the domain of duality, not to the Supreme Unity. Though God's universe- garment is constantly changing, He remains ever the same; as individu- alizations of His Being, we too are to partake of that changelessness. The purpose of each soul's sojourn on earth is to learn to see beyond the evanescence of phenomena to the Eternal Reality. No matter how com- pelling or enticing are the outer trappings of mayic manifestation, let them not lure the attention away from the Infinite Lord who sports the gossamer cosmos as a mere costume of masquerade. The devotee who transcends the myopia of body consciousness sees with the superior vi- sion of divine intuition, and resolves all formerly incomprehensible du- alities in the ecstatic perception of creation as Beauty and Joy. How expressively the Gita extols this truth: \"adorned with count- less celestial robes and garlands and ornaments\"—the stars are His * God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita xi:8, 10-13. f'O Lord my God, Thou art very great; Thou art clothed with honour and majesty, who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment\" (Psalms 104:1-2). 1051"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"crown jewels; the earth His footstool; the lightning, thunder, storms, and cataclysms the flash of His accoutrements and snap of His cloak as He dances in joy the whirling rhythms of creation, preservation, destruction.

Such was the devotee Arjuna's realization in the eleventh chapter of the Gita; and it is in this connection that we are to understand the wisdom philosophy of idealism represented by Jesus Christ in the Lord's Prayer.* * A parallel example in Judeo-Christian scripture is found in the Old Testament Book of Job, whose extraordinary ordeals and subsequent demand for an explanation from God are proverbial. In the Introduction to his English rendition The Book of Job (New York: HarperCollins, 1992), translator Stephen Mitchell writes: \"Job's outrage at the world's injustice is directed straight to the creator of that world. There are no detours or half-measures, no attempt to deflect ultimate respon- sibility by blaming a devil or an original sin. \"'He [God] does not care; so I say he murders both the pure and the wicked. \"'When the plague brings sudden death, he laughs at the anguish of the innocent. \"'He hands the earth to the wicked and blindfolds the judges' eyes. \"'Who does it, if not he?'... \"All this bewilderment and outrage couldn't be so intense if Job didn't truly love God. He senses that in spite of appearances there is somewhere an ultimate justice, but h e doesn't know where....Of course, the answer Job receives is anything but what he expected....He is taken up in a state of vision, and enters a world of primal energy, in- dependent of human beings, which includes what humans might experience as terrify- ing or evil.... \"These huge symbols of evil, so terrifying to humans who haven't seen, or won't acknowledge, the destructive Shiva-aspect of God, are presented to us as God's play- things. They are a part of the continuum of nature, which runs seamlessly from angel to beast. 'The roaring of lions,' as Blake wrote, 'the howling of wolves, the raging of the stormy sea, and the destructive sword, are portions of eternity too great for the eye of man.'...The only other source in the Bible that approaches [Job's vision] in kilowatts is a passage from the anonymous prophet known as Second Isaiah: 'I form light and create darkness; I make peace and create evil; I the Unnamable do all these things.'\" In essence, God's reply to Job is that he must rise from human consciousness to di- vine consciousness in order to understand the seeming paradoxes of creation: \"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understand- ing. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\" (Job 38:4-7). \"The only scriptural analogy to God's answer,\" writes Mitchell, \"is the vision granted to Arjuna in chapter 11 of the Gita, in which that prince experiences, down to the marrow of his bones, the glory and the terror of the universe, all creation and all destruction, embraced in the blissful play of the Supreme Lord. The manifestations there are more cosmic than in Job, and the realization of God as 'the Self seated in the heart of all creatures' is far clearer....[But] when Job says, 'I had heard of you with my 1052"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Yet there remains the question that has always begged an answer: Why creation?

The Vedas and Upanishads explain that the One wanted to enjoy Its infinite, immortal Bliss-consciousness through the many: \" Eko 'ham bahu shy am —I was One; I wanted to be many.\" But man, in his persistent quest for reasons, asks what happened to Him that He wanted to be many and caused all this misery and sorrow. Theolog- ical answers do not satisfy the rational mind. The boldest, truest answer ever given is that we do not know. It is maya —not an illusion, not a hal- lucination, but a divinely mystical mystery beyond the mental compre- hension, the intellectual rationalization, of the human being. As a philos- opher beautifully put it: \"Whenever an honest attempt has been made to unravel the mystery of the many and the One, mysticism seems to be the only or final answer.\" Can a tiny cup measure the ocean? The limited hu- man intellect can little fathom the Cosmic Reality and never reach the why of God's creation. Thus it is said of those who in ecstasy have en- tered the secret vaults of the heart of God and have perforce returned with no words to tell: \"He who knows, he knows; naught else knows.\" Then Jesus says: \"Thy kingdom come.\" Here he affirms the tran- scendence of the Ultimate Reality made manifest as the Immanent Essence of the universal divine imagings of the Creator-Father. \"Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy king- dom come.\" So sublime, so spiritual, so philosophic is this prayer! Tran- scendental God, immanent God, and creation as God's divine manifes- tation— all are expressed in the first section of the prayer, a grand statement of the Jnana Yoga truth realization of ultimate wisdom. The key to the second part of the prayer is the word \"will.\" \"Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.

Actions are always preceded and sustained by will. Material science de- clares that all things in the universe are different manifestations of energy; the yogi, a spiritual scien- tist, discerns also the subtler underlying energy of prana, life force. But what is energy; what is prana} Energy is the gross manifestation of will, and will is the power or manifesting faculty of consciousness. Though all creation came from God's divine vibration, the rebel Satanic Delusion has usurped the material expression of God's \"king- dom,\" abetted by the sinful actions of the masses over whom has been cast the pall of ignorance that shuts out the light of God's presence. Thus the words \"Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven\": Make manifest in the material vibrations of earth the pristine perfection of the Holy Creative Vibration that went forth from Thy taintless tran- scendence by the divine fiat of Thy Will. \"Give us this day our daily bread\": \"Bread\" means cosmic energy, the all-sustaining cosmic vibration of Aum. f Again, a reference to karma, cosmic action by which God sustains all life. * \"The Aum (Visarga, the two dots representing the duality of Cosmic Vibration) that causes the birth and sustenance and dissolution of beings and their various natures is termed Karma (cosmic action)\" ( God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita vm:3). From Paramahansa Yogananda's commentary: \"The cosmic vibration (Aum) with its law of duality and relativity emanates from Spirit and causes the birth, sustenance, and dissolution of all matter and beings through the law of karma. This law of action holds sway over all activities of man and Nature.... \"Karma signifies all cosmic divine and material activities as well as the spiritual and worldly activities of human beings....The Aum or cosmic intelligent vibration is the first manifestation of God in creation. Therefore all the cosmic activities emanating from the intelligent cosmic Vibratory Being—the Aum —are termed Supreme Cosmic Karma. Man is a miniature or microcosmic manifestation of the macrocosmic Vibratory Being (the in- visible intelligent Holy Ghost, or Aum, or the Word). Man's spiritual, worldly, and evil ac- tivities are termed human karma. God, manifested as the cosmic Vibratory Being or Aum, is the direct Originator of all cosmic and human activities, governed by the law of karma, or cause and effect. The whole cosmos and all its sentient beings are subject to this law.\" f \"Man shall not live by bread [material sustenance] alone, but by every word [unit of cosmic energy vibrating out of the Holy Ghost or omnipresent Aum] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God [descends into the human body through the subtle astral cen- ter of life in the medulla oblongata]\" (Matthew 4:4; see commentary in Discourse 8). \"Thy will be done\": the Karma Yoga way of manifesting God in action 1054"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Jesus Witla M ary ana /.UilJia \"Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.\" — Luke 10:41—42 \"Mary has chosen that good single-heartedness of absorption of he- thoughts and love in God alone, inspired by my words of wisdom.

The devotee who would find God actively initiates those causes that re- sult in soul unfoldment and divine union: Karma Yoga, which unites man's fallible will with the omniscience of God's Divine Will. Thus, in this second part of the Lord's Prayer is contained the whole philosophy of karma, the action of creation and of the univer- sal law of cause and effect. \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\" This third section of the prayer is pure bhakti, devotion. For intellectuals it is a long- standing perplexing question how God could lead man into evil tempta- tion, and why.f But followers of the devotional way to God (Bhakti Yoga) focus on a simple truth: The easiest way to overcome finiteness is to give oneself completely to God, with the totality of one's faults and one's virtues. How quickly whatever is negative within one's character is resolved by love of God! Love, in a most wonderful way, transforms and spiritualizes wherever it appears. By patiently cultivating devotion, the bhakta eventually finds that no matter what temptation of desire arises in his life, it is at once transcended when he sincerely gives that desire to the Divine. By the responding touch of God's perfection, all the nega- tiveness trying to infiltrate the devotee's heart can be instantly overcome. Through everything beautiful and desirable in this world, it is the Cosmic Lover who is calling to man. The lure of worldly offerings is a test of choices, whether God's children want Him or material grati- fications. So long as one chooses God's playthings and not Him, so long will that soul have to reincarnate, unfulfilled, in mortal entan- glements. But the devotee who turns his face Homeward, recognizing behind all lesser desires the desire of the soul for the love of God, is 'Matthew 6:14-15; see Discourse 28.

He transmutes every temp- tation into the one divine yearning for God. Hence, the principle expressed in this part of the Lord's Prayer is not that God leads us into temptation, but that by devotional will one can transform a temptation into a source of spiritual illumination by bring- ing into it the greater power of God. This yoga of absolute resignation —unqualified devotion and divine love, bhakti —is invoked in this sup- plication: \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\" Thus Jnana, Karma, and Bhakti, corresponding to the processes of (i) thought, (2) volition, and (3) feeling, are the basis of the first three parts of the Lord's Prayer, making this prayer inclusive of the highest philosophy of human life. After all, what is the purpose of life? To attain oneness with God, by purifying human reasoning or intel- lect with the wisdom consciousness of God; attuning human will to be an instrument of God's will; oblating human love in God's universal love. Thought, volition, and feeling are faculties of the soul; prayer spiritualizes them. Prayer is the lifting up of the soul, of the entire be- ing of man, to God. The Lord's Prayer in its completeness addresses the spiritualization of the whole spectrum of life. Jesus then concludes with a worshipful encomium in summation: \"For Thine is the Kingdom, and the power, and the glory for ever.\" \"The kingdom\" is the overspreading transcendent-immanent Cos- mic Consciousness of God the Father, the Infinite Intelligence that is the sole Reality of all manifestation. \"The power\" is the omnipotence of God's divine will. And what is the greatest \"glory\" of God but His love? Thus we have God's pure intelligence, God's pure will, God's pure love—the kingdom, power, and glory, all of God. Man's rationalizing mind cannot conceive God as the Nameless Absolute; but He is comprehensible in the concept of a triune nature consisting of consciousness, existence, and divine love or bliss. 1. Consciousness: all-pervading Omniscience; 2. Existence: cosmic will expressing as the objectification of life and all manifestation; 3. Bliss (divine love): Love perfected is bliss. Bliss, love, and beauty —these terms synonymously complement one another. Beauty is the harmonious manifestation of love; the perfection of love is bliss. \"The kingdom, the power, and the glory\": the universal experi- ence of God- realization 1056"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"As Jesus referred to the kingdom, power, and glory of God, so the rishis of India invoked God as Truth, Good, and Beauty.* God's con- sciousness is Truth, the ultimate reality and substance of everything.

God is Consciousness, Existence, Bliss; Truth, Good, and Beauty; God is Intelligence, the Divine Conceiver of Universes; God is Life, the mystery of the many in the One; God is Love, Beauty, Bliss.

This in turn manifests as The ten principal Cosmic Sound and Cosmic Light. The others are: manifestations of God Cosmic Intelligence, Cosmic Wisdom, Cosmic De- votion, Cosmic Love, Cosmic Peace, Cosmic Calmness, Cosmic Bliss.

Cosmic Light may also take the form of some personal aspect of De- ity; or, out of that Light the great ones—such as Jesus, Krishna, Bud- dha, the God-knowing masters and saints—may manifest themselves unto the devotee who is deeply in tune. One who contacts God as Cosmic Intelligence knows the infinity of Christ Consciousness and perceives the working of the divine laws of order and harmony that govern all creation. In Cosmic Wisdom, manifested Intelligence or Truth, one may set aside the study of books; he receives all knowledge through the direct perception of the intuition of his soul. When God manifests as Cosmic Devotion, the devotee is absorbed in sweetest divine longing for and reverential worship of the Lord as Father, Mother, Friend, or in some other ideal relationship. In the manifestation of Cosmic Love, the devotee and God merge as one in unending thrills of ecstasy—the love of millions of human loves com- bined—expanding the devotee's heart to hold the Infinite Love that unites all creation.

Servants of God should not, out of love for human praise, make a false show of piety in their eagerness to gather the flattery and acclaim of spiritually blind devotees. Jesus cited the tawdry sham of the \"scribes and Pharisees\" who sought to appear impressive by \"making broad their phylacteries\"—carrying on their persons large religious scrolls, as amulets—and wearing showy, wide-bordered garments; and re- serving always for themselves the most conspicuous and prestigious places of honor.

They pretended to be pious by mak- ing long prayers, which attract the attention of men but draw no no- tice from God. According to the law of karma, such hypocritical, spe- ciously pious persons can have only one fate—\"greater damnation.\" That is, they will be steeped in even greater self-created delusion; the karmic consequences of their hypocrisy and wanton misuse of spiri- tual authority will condemn them to be far away from God. Hypocritical behavior is not uncommon among priests, preach- ers, and teachers of all climes and times. The unscrupulous use any manner of preaching and prayer in an exaggerated show of fervor be- fore their congregations in order to convince others of their holiness —and thus to receive popularity, adulation, and financial largess. Any- one who uses religion for business, \"holiness\" for personal acquisi- tion, and exploitation of God for material gain creates baneful evil karma. By words and acts such persons blaspheme against God and His laws, and thus attract unto themselves added delusion and a heavy judgment of misery. To his disciples, in the verses of Matthew, Jesus spoke words of caution as to how titles of honor should not be desired as a means of —— elevating the status of one's ego. Exalted titles carry Who may rightly use with them exalted responsibility. Jesus reminded the honorific of the disciples of the onus behind such honorifics as \"rabbi\" or \"master\"? \"rabbi\" or \"master,\" for \"one is your Master, even Christ\": There is only one Master of all creation and created things, the omnipresent God, whose universal reflection is the Christ Consciousness. All are brethren in that Infinite Christ Consciousness. And as we are all children of God, \"Call no man your father upon earth\": Do not limit your paternity as from an earthly fa- ther, for the one transcendent God who gave your father to look after you is your true eternal Father. God works through channels of pure souls as He so chooses, so Jesus reminded the disciples that they must never desire, or appoint themselves, to be called \"master,\" for Christ Consciousness in every- thing is the one divine Master, a reflection of God as the Supreme Guru of gurus. But anyone who is fully in tune with the Christ Con- sciousness, even as Jesus was, is a true master qualified to serve as a guru, if God so wills, to guide disciples to liberation. In most scriptures the terminology is not precise. But the sages of Hindu scripture were peerless experts in carefully using Sanskrit words 1068"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"according to their nuances of meaning. To understand any scripture, it is necessary to understand the definite meaning of the words, not only from their etymology, but also from the philosophical truth they are intended to convey. Master means one who is the master, not of others, but of him- self. He has complete wisdom-control of his senses. He is not a mas- ter who dominates the actions of others by the power of his com- manding voice and will, but he who is the owner and wise ruler of his own actions. God is the ultimate owner, and therefore the Supreme Master, of the universe. Those who are one with Him are themselves masters, and can rightly be honored with that title by others. Being es- tablished in divine consciousness—in fact, not imagination—they can proclaim their godly state as Christ affirmed his, and not in any way be egotistically affected by it. Having completely subdued the ego, a master neither covets nor flaunts an exalted title as his own. His whole being rather than his words declares his divine consciousness. He who says he is not a master is probably not a master; and he also is not a master who finds it necessary to declare to others that he is a master. Essentially, as Jesus pointed out, \"Ye are gods\";* but it is spiritu- ally presumptuous to present oneself as such until he has actually re- alized his divinity and behaves accordingly. One who has not mastered his moods, emotions, and sensory temptations; and who is bothered by life's many irritants, losing inner peace because others can \"get his goat\" by a few words of annoyance, is far from expressing himself as a god or a master. A master may be a jivanmukta, literally, \"freed while living.\" He has conquered all desires for mortal life, thus destroying the root cause of reincarnation. Even so, there may be subtle traces of karma of past lives not yet fully consumed in the fire of wisdom. The jivanmukta em- ploys his spirituality to free himself, through various measures (as in samadhi meditation), from karma and hidden desires of past lives as well as the present. Jivanmuktas are kings among mortals. In their di- vine aloofness they can never be hurt no matter what is denied to them. Once a jivanmukta is completely free from past and present karmic bondage, he is said to be a siddha, \"a perfected being.\" Perfected be- ings on earth may be Christlike souls (their consciousness united with the universal Christ Consciousness); they may manifest the parama- *John 10:34 (see Discourse 52). 1069"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"hansa state, able to enter ttirvikalpa samadhi in which they remain con- scious simultaneously of the world as well as of God—performing the most exacting duties with no loss of God-perception (as contrasted with the lesser savikalpa samadhi experience of God-perception in trancelike interiorization). Every master has a mission of spiritual works to perform, boldly in a public arena or in quiet obscurity away from the masses. When a master has a God-given special mission to do on earth, he is a messiah or an avatar, a world savior whose life and message is a lasting legacy of soul-liberation for others. Many masters of God-realization have graced this world, but only a few were messiahs or avatars. So Jesus was making a very important point when he cautioned his disciples not to be called masters, unless and until they were one with God as Christ Consciousness. That status with its responsibility is no simple matter. Jesus then reminded his disciples: \"The greatest among you is he who is humblest and the most serviceful.\" This is the truest testimony of attunement with God. \"Whosoever shall exagger- ate the merit of his ego in order to attract peoples' praise and favor will instead be found out and draw to himself criticism and depreca- tion, and will be abased in the eyes of God.

People see your beauteous facade, unaware of your inner defilement.\" External purity can hardly influence inner purity, but purity of the inner life invariably brings about purity of the outer life. To hold ap- pearance and superficial actions paramount is to use hypocritical reli- gious manners to hide the gross, unhappy, ungodly, misery-making habits within. Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, \"Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.\" And he said, \"Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers\" (Luke 11:45-46).

Fulfilling the dual role of theologian and lawyer, they expounded the Torah to keep the populace in mind of the rules and regulations governing daily life. Jesus denounced these scholarly experts in religious law as being the kind of teachers who bind heavy duties and financial burdens, hard to be borne, on the shoulders of passively compliant devotees un- 1071"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"der the pretense of making them spiritual. But the scribes and Phar- isees themselves could not bear any burden of such religious disciplines — not practicing what they preached. In their hearts they were not spiritual, performing their religious works and ceremonies only for fa- vorable effect and admiration. It is no secret that in modern times as of old, there have been un- scrupulous lawyers who for mercenary gain and winning their case have obscured truth by clever arguments and legal loopholes, freeing criminals and even sentencing the innocent to ruin or death. The law should be applied with wisdom as a means of supporting divine jus- tice in society, not used as a self-serving expedient that subverts truth and causes suffering to good men. Jesus noted that the scribes and Pharisees who nominally professed fealty to Moses and his precepts now occupied the Mosaic seat of au- thority in the temple, supposedly as custodians of the teachings of Moses. Therefore, Jesus advised his disciples to observe whatever good rules they were asked to follow (good rules are good rules even when imposed by unworthy teachers), but not to copy the hypocritical exam- ple of those teachers who emoted but emitted no actual works of piety. \"Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.

Only later, after 100 c.e., did a 'standard' version of the Bible emerge.\" (Pub- lisher's Note) *The version in the Gospel According to St. Matthew identifies Zechariah as the \"son of Berechiah,\" the chronicler evidently confusing him with the author of the Book of Zechariah (see Zechariah 1:1). The incident referred to by Jesus, however, is recounted in II Chronicles 24:17-21: \"Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Ju- dah , and made obeisance to the king.

He saw through their false pos- evil actions affect the turing and compunctious disavowal of the bloody destiny of nations actions of their fathers: \"If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers of the blood of the prophets!\" However, their wicked tendencies akin to those of their forefathers seethed within them. Their own bad karmic propensities ordained them to attract a birth and socioreligious power in the tradition of their prophet-killing forefathers. \"You human serpents, you generation of evildoers, you shall not escape the many hellish miseries gathering to beset your bodies, minds, and souls.

The self-created tendencies thus brought into this life cannot be overcome by hypocritical, pompous, religious rites and observances; they can be erased only by repentance—the giving up of hypocrisy and bad habits—and by concentrating daily on the purification of the soul in devout meditation.

All the different modern races of people and nations and societies of the earth are composed in great part of the good and evil vibrations of their forefathers since the earth began. As an individual is responsible for all the seeds of actions of his past lives, subtly stored up in his subconscious mind, so every indi- vidual race and nation and social and familial component thereof is heir to the past actions of its forefathers subtly accumulated in the sub- conscious mind—the mind-set—of that segment of humanity. For ex- ample, this is what contributes to racial differences—the Americans, utilitarians; Hindus of India, spiritual seekers; the English, colonists; the French, liberals; and so forth. The Hindus love peace because their forefathers loved peace; and some of the Western nations are prone to dissension and fighting be- cause of their warlike and unforgiving ancestry.

It is quite usual for people who are excessively endowed to be also excessively unhappy; for their nervous system is entangled in caring for and worrying about their possessions, never feeling quite complete and satisfied, unable to enjoy what they do have.* Jesus also points out the great fallacy in thinking that life is made secure by possessions. He illustrates that point by the following parable. And he spake a parable unto them, saying, \"The ground of a cer- tain rich man brought forth plentifully: And he thought within himself, saying, 'What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?' And he said, 'This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.

Such persons are unwilling to learn from the millions who have labored hard in the world for the rewards of possessions and prosperity, per- • • haps accumulating vast fortunes, only to find that Jesus warns of the affluence has made no significant deposits in the false security imparted coffers of inner peace and joy. How foolish it is to by material wealth store up treasures for the fleeting body, which at any moment can be taken away by death; it is wise to give one's primary effort to acquiring soul riches of lasting bliss, wisdom, and divine qualities through daily meditation and service to others, for this is an imperishable wealth from which one is never parted. * Cf.

Spiritual riches may not engage worldly admiration, but they guarantee to the soul in the after-death state the true security of eternal freedom and happiness. The covetous man wants to have more than the next person; but when he has it he is not satisfied, because inevitably he finds someone else with still more than he. People live in a bedlam of misery created by their desires. Materially, the average American has far more than the average citizen of Europe or India or any other nation; but still he is not happy! His satisfaction is seared with anxiety and worry and unending wants. The very nature of maya conditions man to crave material acquisi- tions, when even a little observation would reveal their emptiness. Why waste one's years in pursuit of this or that, only to be disillusioned? Be happy now in contact with the inner kingdom of God. That is what Jesus urged; he lived that truth. His happiness was conditioned by noth- ing; even the body he willingly surrendered. In that inner detachment one is completely free, unaffected by either riches or poverty—change- less within, regardless of circumstances. Such a one enjoys whatever the Lord provides, yet knows in his inner self: \"If I never see it again, that is all right.\" His soul is ever secure in a divine superabundance. And he said unto his disciples, \"Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.

Jesus pointed out the supreme wisdom of \"God first\" as the best recipe not only for individual happiness but also for national and in- ternationa l well-being: \"The nations of the earth seek inordinately and selfishly after material prosperity and power, which inevitably leads to hurtful inequities, wars, and destruction.

The excessive competitiveness of business life is pernicious because each one tries to take away the possessions of others. Thus in a community of 1,000 each businessperson has 999 enemies and competitors. Jesus urged people to share their possessions with all; when that law is observed, each person in a community of 1,000 has 999 helpers. Survival in the present-day cutthroat commercial environment is so demanding that the businessperson is run ragged and is unable to concentrate on making his life truly and spiritually happy. Business is made for the happiness of man; man was not made for business. Only that much enterprise is necessary which does not interfere with the spiritual development of man. Advancement in science and technology is to be applauded when used for the betterment of the human race; but in practical application, nations of the earth could enhance the happiness of their citizens if they advocated a consciousness of plain living and high thinking—concentrating their minds more on spiritual development, inspirational literature, philosophy, knowledge of the wonders and workings of creation, and less on frenetic technologies that encourage money-madness. If the nations of the earth did not complicate civilization by indus- trial selfishness, which leads to overproduction and overconsumption in rich countries, and exploitation and parsimony to- ward weaker nations, then all peoples would have plenty to eat and to live well. But since patriotic self- ishness and material superiority are the aims of al- most all developed nations, regardless of the needs of their neighbors, the world suffers episodes of chaos and confusion of isms resulting in famine, poverty, and the avoidable miseries of wars. The events that have marked the first half of this twentieth century have manifestly shown that national security and prosperity can never be assured by patriotic and industrial selfishness, which have brought on economic disasters, two world wars, unemployment, fears, insecurity, starvation, and the natural calamities of earthquakes, hurricanes, droughts (which by the operation of mass karma are the indirect offspring of the accumulated evil actions of indi- viduals and nations).

Individuals and nations can be protected from self-generated ut- ter destruction if they live by heavenly ideals of brotherhood, industrial cooperation, and international exchange of earthly goods and spiritual experiences. The present economic system of profiteering and exploita- tion has failed; a brotherhood of nations and a brotherhood of neces- sary industries and industrialists can alone bring lasting prosperity to the world. The Great Depression of the 1930s humbled many millionaires who were sure of their financial acumen to preserve their mighty for- tunes. Even the shrewdest businessmen became bewildered children in the hands of destiny and depression, knowing not which way to turn. The spiritual laws of \"unselfishness\" and \"including the prosperity of others in one's own prosperity\" were broken; hence, the worldwide collapse of the industrialist economic system. Industrial selfishness was precipitated from dire human greed for gold, leading to unfair suici- dal competition and the dumping of prices to destroy the competitor. When the materially minded businessman's brain is befuddled with greed, his intelligence institutes plans that fail one after the other. This is the price all materialistic God-forgetting egotists are bound to meet sometime or other. By giving artificial monetary value to industrial production, man has created strife between capital and labor, systematically causing re- current inflations and depressions. Capital and labor, like brain and limbs, should cooperate for the overall welfare of the body and soul of the nation, rather than fighting each other and thereby ensuring their own mutual destruction. Brain and hands both cooperate to maintain the body and share the food in the stomach; so also capital (the brains of society) and the labor (its hands and feet) must cooper- ate to make life prosperous and to share the bounty they produce. Nei- ther capital nor labor should get special preference, avoiding the pit- falls of both imperialistic and socialistic forms of government. Capital and labor each has its confirmed place and both must do their re- spective duties in equality. Everybody should be provided food, cloth- ing, shelter, education, and medical care through sharing of the na- tional wealth; or everybody should equally shoulder the burden of poverty if it comes unavoidably through the inclemencies of nature.

If the nations of the earth wanted to please God, they would live according to Christlike principles as brothers in a United States of the World, exchanging commodities so that no individual would suffer from lack, famine, or poverty. It is imperative now that individuals and nations forsake selfish- ness to feed and clothe the international body. National citizenry should subdue preoccupation with self-interest and learn to acquire wisdom, and to meditate and be in tune with the Infinite, so that they collectively feed the national soul with all-round happiness.

For millenniums In- dia was a land of both spiritual light and widespread material prosperity. The poverty of the last 200 years is, in India's long history, only a passing karmic phase. A byword in the world, century after century, was 'the riches of the Indies.' Abundance, material as well as spiritual, is a structural expression of rita, cosmic law or natural righteous- ness. There is no parsimony in the Divine, nor in Its goddess of phenomena, exuber- ant Nature. \"The records of history present India, up until the 18 th century, as the world's wealthiest nation....The Bible refers to the riches of India, telling us (11 Chronicles 9:21, 10) that the 'ships of Tarshish' brought to King Solomon 'gold and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks' and 'algum [sandalwood] trees and precious stones' from Ophir (Sopara on the Bombay coast). Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador (4 th century b.c.), has left us a detailed picture of India's prosperity. Pliny (i st century a.d.) tells us the Romans annually spent fifty million sesterces ($5,000,000) on imports from India, which was then a vast marine power. \"Chinese travelers wrote vividly of the opulent Indian civilization, its widespread education and excellent government. The Chinese priest Fa-Hsien (5 th century) tells us the Indian people were happy, honest, and prosperous.

One nation possessing abundance side by side with another nation starving to death can never be a formula productive of peace on earth. Nations must look after one another or they are doomed. That is why Jesus speaks to the nations of the earth: \"O you nations, do not be selfish and think only of food, industry, and raiment, in utter for- getfulness of brotherhood and God, the Giver of all things, or you will bring self-created disaster on yourselves through your ignorance and its attendant wars, pestilence, and other miseries.\" Prosperity often dulls the social conscience: \"What do we care for other nations: We worked to create our prosperity so that we could roll in plenty! Why should they not do the same?\" Callous arrogance is shortsighted. Enduring national prosperity depends not only upon natural resources and the initiative of the nation's citizens, but prima- rily upon the moral conduct, harmony, and spiritual living of the peo- ple. No matter how successful a nation may be, if it becomes de- bauched, selfish, and inharmonious, it will have civil wars, treachery, and foreign aggression to disrupt its complacency and good fortune. Hence, the admonition of Jesus that no individual or nation should be selfish and give entire thought to food or raiment or ac- quirement of earthly treasure, but should be humble, share prosperity with needy brothers, and acknowledge God as the only Owner and Giver of all the gifts of the earth. \"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

Every spiritual emancipation man is bound to recover his divinity, even though he be deeply buried beneath the debris of incarnations of delusion. It has been the \"good pleasure\" of the Heavenly Father to stamp His perfect image in the soul of all His human children; and when they forsake their identification with their human nature and bring out their perfect divine image, then and then only the Heavenly Father is pleased to re- ceive His prodigal children back in His kingdom of immortality. Jesus goes on to enunciate the duty of the devotee of absolute re- nunciation who seeks God alone, and toward that end forsakes every- thing else: \"As your single-hearted desire is to know God, for which you have chosen to follow the path of renunciation, divest yourself of your earthly entanglements, sell your property and give the proceeds to serve a greater good and to help the poor and the needy.

And when He comes twice or thrice and is received in the same watchful consciousness of the devo- tees, they will be blessed with spiritual freedom for having passed all the tests of divine communion. \"That devotee is a worthy servant who keeps his bodily and men- tal house well guarded with wisdom, allowing no opportunity for the thief of ignorance suddenly to break through his consciousness and steal his spiritual qualities. Just as a stealthy thief is unable to take by surprise a watchful servant, so also the faithful devotee remains at all times ready for any sudden, subtle coming of the \"Son of man,\" a man- ifestation or experience of the Christ Consciousness, or realization of the infinite Christ Consciousness as incarnate in the body as the soul, the divine Self through whose emergence and intuition God is realized. \"The true devotee is always patient and persevering, devotionally prepared for the Divine Visitation, no matter when it comes unan- nounced; but the fitfully wise devotee, sometimes attentive but then slipping into restless inattention, often misses the opportune moment of spiritual manifestation. That servant who is unceasingly faithful and constantly wise and watchful is made master by the Lord God of the spiritualized bodily and mental house, with the duty of overseeing the servant-senses, controlling and sustaining them with the proper dole of the meat of wisdom. That servant-devotee who is consistent in governing all his faculties with wisdom finds complete self-mastery over himself by the permanent contact of the innate Lordly Christ Consciousness. \"But the careless and whimsical devotee does not meditate duti- fully every day, thinking that his lapses matter little because of a de- lay in the manifestation of God-consciousness. Sensing no immediate need to resume his laborious spiritual obligations, he rather momen- tarily regresses and ill-treats his servant-senses and insults and misuses the maidens of his fine feelings to enjoy sense objects and therewith becomes drunk with delusion. Because of the devotee's intermittent worthy endeavor, the innate Christ Consciousness may come someday to manifest consciously to him; but finding him spiritually negligent 1094"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"and unheeding, will instead separate and go away from the careless consciousness. That devotee, whose devotion had erstwhile given him some contact of God but which was now lost through negligence, be- comes classed with the unbelievers who never have God-communion. \"The devotee who intuitively felt God's will and did not prepare himself to obey that will and to meet the divine tests in order to do so, shall find himself lashed by self-doubts and the acute remorse of los- ing God after finding Him. But that devotee who errs because he is yet unmindful of the joyous fulfillment of God's coming will suffer less. Much watchfulness and spiritual sanctity is required of devotees with wisdom, just as men expect much from responsible social leaders.\" First, Jesus speaks of advanced devotees who should never lower their consciousness by giving undue attention to the body, but should concentrate on the seven receptacles of divine con- - sciousness and energy in the spine and brain so that Three classes of spiri- they might never be invaded by ignorance, but be tual advancement always ready to receive the manifestation of God. The Lord is hidden behind His consort, Nature, busy with creation, but He will disband all delusions of natural phenomena and reveal Himself as light and Cosmic Consciousness to the true devotee \"when He will return from the wedding\" of Spirit and Nature.* Secondly, Jesus speaks of those devotees who have some God- perception, but whose spiritual equilibrium is yet unstable. God may come, owing to the devotee's spasmodic devotion, but go away if He finds the devotee at that moment negligent and careless, and indulging in the senses. Those devotees who have consciously experienced the manifestation of God and yet toy with sensory temptations find that in their dereliction they have missed an unexpected visitation of God because of His precipitous departure from their unprepared con- sciousness. For having found God, the Emancipator of the universe, and then suddenly losing Him, the mental suffering of the slothful devotee is acute—\"That servant, which knew his lord's will, and pre- pared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.\" God always responds to the devotee's devotion; but if the devotee mixes his spiritual aspirations with an unspiritual life, God goes away after granting the devotee a mere glimpse of Himself. Even so, that * See also explanation of metaphysical significance of \"the Bridegroom,\" Discourse 16. 1095"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"tantalizing touch of the Lord should encourage a more sustained di- vine effort. Multitudes do not believe that the actual contact of God i s possible; but the accomplished yet careless devotee knows differ- ently , even if for only a little while. His suffering at losing God is a re- minder that he will be able to know God permanently by forsaking wayward unspiritual habits. Then Jesus speaks of the third class of devotees, those who follow spiritual rules mechanically — \"he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes.\" If by chance suc h devotees contact God for a trice in meditation, they do not suf- fer much for losing Him, because of lack of depth in their spiritual feeling for God. God never inflicts \"stripes\" on His devotees, but they cause them- selves pangs of suffering through their own folly in which they lose God after once having some contact with Him. It is not difficult to attract some inner perception or feeling of God's presence when the devotee's devotion is ripe. But to maintain constant contact with God, the devotee must be ever watchful of his consciousness, practicing the presence of God in wakefulness and re- maining in that awareness even in the states of deep sleep and dreams. Any devotee who emphasizes any bodily or mental activity that pre- empts an inner focus of wholehearted concentration on God cannot retain Him permanently. The soul has the authority to discipline its servant-senses. Each sense is given a special assignment, and the intuition has the impor- • • • tant work of watching the bodily house to prevent Watching the bodily it from being invaded by the thief of cosmic delu- house to prevent the sion. The \"Son of man,\" the Christ Consciousness entry of the thief of incarnate and operative in the body as the soul, is delusion  ever present though hidden deep behind cosmic delusion. The servant-senses should be kept alert for that unknown hour when the master, the Christ within, owner of the bodily house, manifests, lest it find the servant-faculties sleeping the sleep of delusion. The sincere devotee is duty-bound to keep the bodily house im- pervious to invasion by the thief of delusion, preventing it from being broken into and ravaged by misery and ignorance. The faithful and wise devotee becomes the divinely appointed chief steward over his household of senses, and nourishes them with the meat of discipline 1096"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"and wisdom when they have reached the \"season,\" or state, of soul willingness to be good. Blessed is that devotee when the Christ Con- sciousness manifests and finds him meditating and properly governing his sensory servants. That spiritually watchful devotee, having rightly guided all the senses, will also have control of the properties of soul qualities, and with them all requisite material power. By contrast, the negligent devotee succumbs to a feeling that his meditation is useless, as God continues to delay manifesting within him. He thus starts smiting his well-behaved senses with the rod of temptations, and goads them to enjoy sense pleasures, joining with them in drunken delusion. If a Divine Visitation manifests within him due to his past good actions, at that time when he is least expectant and prepared that experience will be summarily severed from his con- sciousness. He will find himself classed as a hypocrite because he made a pretense of performing appointed spiritual duties and yet in his heart he was not convinced that spiritual perseverance would result in God- consciousness. He will weep and be furious at himself for the weak- nesses that have led to his isolation from God. The highest spiritual habit by which the devotee can retain a watchful awareness of the inner presence of God is to keep the con- sciousness always centered on the spiritual eye. The  - ordinary person's mind is habitually restless, given How to retain a primarily to worldly matters, which by their watchful awareness of changeful kinetic nature dissipate the attention, the inner presence of What is necessary is to balance life's duties with God meditation on God, by which one learns to focus the mind in a most wonderful way. When a spiritually equilibrated person wants to accomplish a task, he is able to concentrate the full power of his disciplined attention on it, and it is done! When the con- centration is fixed on God, its outward expression is a dynamic force for accomplishment. Earnest devotees must create the spiritual habit of thinking of God throughout the day. Even when working or talking or mixing with others, one can keep the mind resting in Him. There is an inward stillness and peace that the world cannot ruffle. When one is cush- ioned in the habit of practicing the presence of God, the sharp barbs of mortal habits of body consciousness have no piercing effect. Each night in meditation, the devotee should close his eyes to the world and practice deep meditation and prayer: \"Lord, I have been dragging the 1097"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"body all day long. Give me freedom in Thy consciousness.\" The mind will argue that meditation is a drudgery in darkness, but one must per- severe. He who with faith and perseverance enters the silence each night, and again each morning, will find great reward of abiding peace and calmness, precursor to the unveiled manifestation of the Infinite Presence. Therefore it behooves all devotees to be determined acolytes of meditation, and always to keep the altar of devotion aglow in the tem- ple of the soul, so that no matter when God suddenly manifests, His subtle coming will be detected and received by the devotee. The sage- poet Tagore wrote: \"Have you not heard His silent steps? He comes, comes, ever comes.\"* It is the perpetual spiritual vigil and devotional magnetic expectation of the devotee that hears these silent steps of God's presence. \"I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be al- ready kindled? But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished! Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, nay; but rather division: For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. The father shall be di- vided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.\" And he said also to the people, \"When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, 'There cometh a shower'; and so it is. And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, 'There will be heat'; and it cometh to pass.

They are as a flame of enlightenment, not of chastisement; thus Jesus prevented his disciples when they wanted to \"command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them\"f who opposed the works of Jesus.

True devotees harmonize themselves with truth by raising their vibration through spiritual discipline, and thus remain in tune with its blessings. But ignorant persons who go against truth by wrongdoing make them- selves miserable by friction with the universal law of cause and effect. \"When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison. I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite\" (Luke 12:58-59).* J esus warns of the karmic consequences of wrongdoing, acting without spiritual discrimination. Any devotee who in his intro- spection finds that his adversary, his bad karma from past evil actions, has arraigned him before the magistrate of the cosmic law of cause and effect, must pray for deliverance from reaping the results of his bad actions; for most people condemned by the judge of cosmic law are delivered into the prison of suffering by the officers of karmic ten- dencies arising from evil actions. Jesus then admonishes: \"I tell you that you cannot get away from the tribunal of the cosmic law of cause and effect governing all human actions until you have paid fully by working out your evil karma through suffering, reformation, and prayer.\" Man can be partially and in time wholly free from the effects of his evil karma if with sincere devotion he continuously prays deeply for pardon to the framer of cosmic law, the Supreme Divine Jurist, man's ultimate recourse to contravening grace and redemption.

Jesus knew that the persons to whom he was speaking were themselves trans- gressors, and that justice according to the karmic law awaited them.

The removal of one's physi- of sin is not physical cal body from the earth plane by death, freeing that death, but spiritual soul to move on to the astral realms, obviously is death not always the result of iniquity. Nor does God's law of karma mandate an unnatural physical death as the sole pre- scribed punishment for all offenders of righteousness. Some who live for years, even endowed with health and prosperity, might in fact be more egregious transgressors against divine law than those whose bod- ies suffer or are killed. However, sin certainly causes spiritual death: obliviousness to the bliss and immortality of the soul. Sin brings torture of conscience and corroding inner mental punishment, suffering that is sometimes more painful than physical death. So Jesus cautions, \"Do not presume that the slain individuals were greater sinners than yourselves. Unless you mend your ways and forsake your evil actions, your iniquities will be the death of your spiritual life.\" His words are a warning against the complacency of persons who assume they are sufficiently virtuous be- cause they have thus far been spared misfortune visited upon others. Asleep in ignorance, they never analyze themselves or make an effort to spiritualize their lives until rudely awakened by physical, mental, or spiritual suffering—karmic recompense that could assuredly be less- ened or averted by repentance and cultivation of God-consciousness now.

He had had visions of saints and other wondrous perceptions, but there was always some barrier that kept from him the final vision of God. Lahiri Mahasaya continued to encourage him to \"Meditate deeply; the obstructions of past karma must be overcome.\" But after so many years of ever-increasingly deepening meditation, still the longed -for \"final irrevocable union\" was not forthcoming; he began to feel an unbearable spiritual anguish. One night he was determined to wrest from his Guru a promise of divine intercession on his behalf. A promise of God-union, tearing away obscuring veils of delusion by forgiveness of past errors, is not given lightly. Lahiri Mahasaya tried to stave off his disciple's persis- tence with his accustomed response: \"What can I do? You must med- itate more profoundly.\" But Pranabananda's yearning could not be de- terred. He continued to make his case, lovingly demanding as a son would do to convince his mother to gain from her some favor. After long hours of his imploring the guru, at last Lahiri Mahasaya blessed him and said, \"You may go now and meditate. I have interceded for you with Brahma.\"* The uplifted disciple returned to his home. \"In meditation that night,\" he told me, \"the Goal of my life was achieved. Never from that day has the Blissful Creator remained hidden from my eyes behind any screen of delusion.\" For the illumined Swami, even meditation was no longe r requisite for the perception of Spirit. The Hindu scriptures say, \"The flower falls when the fruit ap- pears.\" The flowers of meditation and prayer must be conscientiously nurtured to blossom in the garden of the devotee's consciousness; but when the fruit of God-realization comes, the flowers of meditation and prayer, having served their purpose, wither away. The Self-realized devotee who has arrived at the very last state of Cosmic Conscious- ness in nirvikalpa samadhi no longer has to engage in the meditative process of divine attainment. The avatar Bhagavan Krishna asked one of his devotees, the sainted Draupadi, why she did not meditate, the yoga way of divine union for attaining salvation. She replied, \"O 'Spirit in Its aspect of God the Creator. When Emerson's poem \"Brahma\" appeared in the Atlantic Monthly in 1857, most of the readers were bewildered.

That being said, it should also be noted that even fully realized masters, especially if actively engaged on the outer world stage, con- tinue the practice of prayer and meditation to set an example of guid- ance and inspiration, and to rejuvenate the bodily instrument through which they bestow great power of spiritual blessing and healing energy on those they serve. This has ofttimes been cited in the story of Jesus. Devotee s who have not reached the final union must not cozy themselves in illusions of God-attainment, imagining they have earned a retirement pension from the labors of cultivating God-consciousness. Swami Pranabananda, for example, did not attain emancipation just by eight years of long hours of deep meditation. His liberating karma had been accruing for several lives of devout endeavor. Even so, his fi- nal union with the Infinite remained obstructed by some stubborn bonds of past negative karma until the intercession of Lahiri Maha- saya, the guru sent by God to lift his soul into the Infinite Presence. Devotees who in their present life have a strong inclination to seek God and are attracted to the path of meditation have surely meditated and practiced inner divine communion in one or more of their recent past lives. Conversely, there are millions who never think of medita- tion, or are otherwise loath to attempt its discipline, owing to unwill- ingness born of materialistic living of past incarnations. Anyone blessed with spiritual tendencies ought to be very much encouraged to further with more and more concentrated meditation the accumulated devotional efforts of incarnations that will surely in time yield the longed-for contact of God.* No devotee can bargain with his meditative efforts to convince God to manifest Himself. The devotee must forsake metaphysical ego- tism, which consists in thinking: \"I have meditated so much, and God is therefore obliged to reveal Himself.\" Along with deep, sustained * \"By diligently following his path, the yogi, perfected by the efforts of many births, is purged of sin (karmic taint) and finally enters the Supreme Beatitude.

It is when the devotee casts the net of unconditional love again and again in the depths of meditation that God can be caught as a willing captive. Be- coming steadfast in repeated experiences of God-contact, and with the aid of the guru's blessing, the devotee receives at last ultimate eman- cipation and irrevocable union with the Infinite Beloved. And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and jour- neying toward Jerusalem. Then said one unto him, \"Lord, are there few that be saved?\" And he said unto them, \"Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open unto us'; and he shall answer and say unto you, 'I know you not whence ye are': \"Then shall ye begin to say, 'We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.' \"But he shall say, 'I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity'\" (Luke 13:22-27). I n these verses, Jesus highlights the importance of following one's di- vinely ordained guru, he who stands as the savior or redeemer of one' s soul from delusion. The blessing, the inter- cession, of the guru is of paramount importance. The guru—one who is \"master of the house\" in his unity with the universal Christ Consciousness — opens the inner \"door\" to transcendence and sal- vation.* \"Enter in at the strait gate,\" for without the saving grace of the guru, \"many...will seek to enter (into the heav- enly kingdom of Cosmic Consciousness) and shall not be able.\" \"Strai t is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it,\" Jesus had said in the Sermon on the * \"I (the God-united Christ Consciousness in me) am the door of the sheep....by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture\" (John 10:7, 9; see Discourse 52). Without the saving grace of the guru, the disciple is unable to enter God's kingdom 1109"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Mount.* The Hindu scriptures similarly speak of the path to liberation as being as narrow as a razor's edge. Successful progress demands single-hearted focus on the goal, for one never knows when some dis- tracting lure of delusion will activate dormant tendencies of the seeker's past bad karma and try to lead him astray. Satan works constantly to divert the devotee from the do's and don'ts of the Godward path, in- sinuating the thought that one is thereby exercising his independence. But persons in thrall to the ego with its karmic accumulation of habits and desires are anything but independent, and are rarely able to adopt the right course for themselves. Nevertheless, an even more potent in- fluence than one's karma is the help and blessing of a God-knowing guru. Through reverent observance of the guidance of a master, one can free himself from all embedded compulsions of past karma. T o be faithful to the principles of the divinely ordained guru- disciple relationship is the sure way to reach God. Whereas the un- guided devotee wanders into spiritual difficulties and disillusionment, the disciple who gives loyalty and obedience to one who has found God makes the spiritual path simple and straightforward. His devotion and faith establish constant inner attunement, so that regardless of any as- saults of Satan, he can rely on the hidden and open aid of his Christ- like master to keep him safe and steady in his progress toward freedom. Tha t is the basis of Jesus' response to the question, \"Lord, are there few that be saved?\" The reply signified: \"All who strive to enter into the kingdom of Cosmic Consciousness by availing themselves of the help of a guru and his liberating spiritual techniques will find the strait gate and narrow way of Self-realization into the Infinite. But there will be many, I say unto you, who will seek to enter the kingdom of God by them- selves , after ignoring the God-given guru sent to them. They will not succeed because they did not heed God's divine messenger. •Matthe w 7:14 (see Discourse 30). The \"strait gate\" and \"narrow way\" are among the many uses by Jesus of the double entendre in his teachings: the \"strait gate\" of vir- tuous inclinations, and the \"narrow way\" of the spiritual disciplines of righteous ac- tions; so also, metaphysically, these phrases refer to the gateway in the subtle astral center at the base of the spine, which opens into the astral spine's narrow, extremely fine pathway through which the life and consciousness ascend to the higher cere- brospinal centers of spiritual perception—the singular path of ascension to Christ con- sciousness and union with God in cosmic consciousness. In these present verses, both meanings are again intended in the context of the guidance and blessing of the guru who not only leads the disciple through the strait gate of the path of virtue, but also ultimately opens the inner astral door of ascension to God. 1110"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"\"When once the 'master of the house,' the Christlike guru, is taken away from the earth, he has to shut the door of his teaching— no further revelations or personal guidance issue from his silenced voice. Those who had the oppor- tunity to benefit from his physical presence, but who failed to cultivate enduring attunement with the master, because of abject rejection of him, dis- loyal or treacherous behavior, or preference for the company of their bad habits and inclinations, will find the master's channel of intercession has been shut to them.* If some then belatedly knock at the door of prayer, the master replies through their con- science, 'You had the opportunity to receive me, but you did not; wherefore I cannot now accept you.' Then shall those persons remind the master of their erstwhile acquaintance with him, 'Lord, we ate and drank in your presence when you taught in our midst. Why should you not respond to our prayers?' The master will intimate through the conscience of the supplicators, 'Because you rejected me and would not enter the door of salvation I opened for you, I know you not as sincere and faithful devotees. You are banished by the iniquity of your own works of ignorance.'\"! Jesus sought to awaken those of his time to the magnitude of di- vine blessing afforded them in the readily accessible presence of God in his incarnate Christ Consciousness. To follow a master with Christ Consciousness who has lived and taught in an earthly incarnation is the only way to receive the sure guidance and intercession necessary for final introduction into the kingdom of God. The Lord does not teach seekers from His Formless Omnipresence, but uses the speech, *See also commentary on John 7:33: \"Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto Him that sent me. Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither y e cannot come\" (Discourse 50). t Jesus repeatedly voiced such warnings to those who rejected him as one sent by God: \"No t every one that saith unto me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord....' And then will I profess unto them, 'I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity'\" (Matthew 7:21-23; see commentary in Dis- course 30). This point is further explained later (in the present Discourse) in the commentary on Luke 13:35: \"Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, 'Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.'\" The fate of devotees who ignore the guid- ance of a God- ordained guru 1111"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"mind, and consciousness of an illumined master in whom His Christ Intelligence has been incarnated. True masters have fully surrendered themselves to God, so He also surrenders Himself as infinite wisdom and love to these masters; He calls undeveloped truth-seekers to come unto Him through these perfect divine representatives. Oftentime s guru and disciple are incarnate at the same time or in a close proximity of time. But masters with a world mission (or some- times with many disciples in divergent stages of development) leave on earth a legacy of their teachings and ideals when they shed their mor- tal forms. For masters who can span the infinity of omnipresence, there is no difference between their seen and unseen presence, or in the blessings they bestow on disciples who are in tune, whether during or after the earth life of the master. Thus Jesus could not have meant that the door of his divine inter- cession would be closed after he had left the body. Rather he warned that when a disciple spurns a God-sent guru owing to his own unsettled mental state of disbelief, or the fickleness of a change of heart, or inner weakness that yields to the iniquities of the delusion-loving ego, then that devotee's salvation is delayed. He has to roam one or more incar- nations until karmically he prepares himself to locate the same discarded God-ordained guru-messenger. To dishonor the messenger of God is to dishonor God Himself. No doubt the Lord says to wayward devotees who appeal to Him for guidance, \"Why are you seeking My aid again, when you refused the help I already sent to you through your guru?\" Those devotees who ignored the channel of salvation sent to them by God will in time realize, in an anguish of fruitless seeking, that they ar e bereft of divine guidance, not only in that life, but in the heavenly astral afterlife as well. However, if in the next life, or in some suc- ceeding incarnation, that self-inflicted punishment of spiritual unful- fillment causes a devotee to renew and sustain his spiritual efforts, preparin g himself to be a worthy, receptive disciple, then he will find through earnest prayer and meditation that God has again sent His di- vine messenger for that devotee's redemption. Jesu s said, \"No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.\"* This is a true statement of a guru, and seekers should realize its importance. Every emissary of God has God behind him.

Su- perficia l seekers, wandering from one pasture of new ideas to another, become lost and spiritually malnourished while gorged with an undi- gested mixture of half-truths and useless dogma. Jesus decried those unstable devotees who failed in their blind ignorance to recognize and receive him as a savior sent in their own time to open the way to God. \"There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the king- dom of God, and you yourselves thrust out\" (Luke 13:28). o one can even casually meet his God-ordained guru without pos- sessing good karma. Therefore, even a negligent devotee who has ignore d the full measure of his guru's guidance, if he later repents and desires sincerely to know God, may have a sufficient store of good karma, or develop it by persistency in meditation and cultivation of spir- itual qualities, to draw close to heaven. Such a devotee may have a glimpse of higher heavenly realms when he leaves the body at death; but that is all he can get. He may behold liberated saints and advanced devo- tees who followed their guru—\"Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets\"—permanently lodged in Cosmic Consciousness, but he himself will not be able at that time to enter that highest kingdom of God. He will in great anguish of spirit be \"thrust out,\" back to earth— the place of spiritual repentance and endeavor contrived for man to per- fect himself. There he must embrace again the disciplinary path of his God-given guru and pray for his intercession to find salvation. Devotees who in the afterlife in the astral world have even a glimpse of the supernal heavens are blessed thereby with an intense longing to attain the kingdom of God.

By prayer and good action and spiritual seeking, their yearning draws them again to where they left off in their relationship with their rightful guru, who stands ever ready to show them the path into the Heavenly Kingdom. Matthew 8:11-12 offers a comparable variant of this verse in Luke: \"And I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnash- ing of teeth\" (Matthew 8:11-12). ^T^his rendering alludes to devotees who are sufficiently advanced JL to enter the highest spheres of heaven inhabited by divine souls. But after some time in the blissful kingdom, their unfinished earthly karma casts them again into the \"outer darkness\" of the delusive re- gion of material embodiment. Entrapped again on earth, these souls are filled with a melancholy of dim unformed remembrances of para- dise lost. They feel subconsciously a resentment, a dispassion, toward the sham offerings of the world—a spiritual agony of divine longing, which the saints refer to as sweet sorrow—which turns them toward deeper spiritual endeavor. \"And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the king- dom of God.

And there will be many that 'are first,' eagerly starting early on the spiritual path, but who will not be regu- lar and deep in their meditation; they 'shall be last,' long delayed but ultimatel y successful if they persist, in final attainment of Cosmic Consciousness.\" In the above words, Jesus gives hope of heaven to all prodigal children of God, in each of whom—regardless of race, caste, or creed —is hidden the potential Divine Image. Responding to the question, \"Can only a few enter the kingdom of God?\" he did not limit the number or make heaven the monopoly of a few spiritual aristocrats. Nor does he speak of God's kingdom as the exclusive reward of mem- bers of any particular faith. Rather, Jesus included sincere seekers af- ter Truth who would be found in all the four corners of the earth and who would attract to themselves a God-sent guru through whose guid- ance and intercession they would \"enter in at the strait gate\" and be led through the spiritual-eye door into Cosmic Consciousness. They will attain who remain resolute in the divine path from the time they first start until they successfully reach the end. According to Jesus, what matters is not whether one begins early or late on the spir- itual path, but one's conscientious perseverance. In a competitive examination, many who were first to enter the course may be the last to pass, and many who are last to register may stand first in the examination, through earnest application. Devotees whose spiritual enthusiasm is uniform and constant from start to fin- ish will be the \"first\" to attain Cosmic Consciousness. But those devo- tees who are first in eagerness to enter the spiritual path and then be- come slothful might take more than one incarnation to at last enter Cosmic Consciousness and attain final emancipation. Jesus assures truth-seekers that they all will surely find God, and that their progress begins when they give up their prodigal roaming in the land of ignorance and material consciousness and follow the lead of their God-knowing guru. All human beings, even the blatant sin- 1115"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"ners, will in time repent when they understand their folly. Those who forsak e their evil actions and fervently try to follow the spiritual path will certainly be ushered by their God-given savior into the transcen- dental state of Cosmic Consciousness; they will finally be able \"to sit down in the kingdom of God,\" to permanently establish their con- sciousness in Cosmic Consciousness. The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, \"Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.\" And he said unto them, \"Go ye, and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.' Nevertheless I must walk today, and to- morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem. * \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!

All —— souls are in essence divine, but as long as they are Do liberated masters in fleshly embodiment they are constrained by accrue karma for the characteristic imperfections of delusive manifesta- work they do on t j on —to a greater or lesser degree depending on earth f the individualized being's state of spiritual evolu- tion. Undeveloped worldly persons, because of their bodily attach- ments and desires, amass much karma of delusion. Even divine incar- nations, though their souls have been fully liberated, must subject themselves to at least some measure of cosmic delusion simply to maintain a finite form separate from Spirit. The \"karma\" thus accrued by liberated masters is the natural working of the cause-effect principle governing all actions in the realm of manifestation; it may also consist of unfinished works of their pre- vious incarnations, such as helping to liberate their advanced disciples, or to state anew and revive truth, or even to toy with some passing fancy , renounced and forgotten, but which God in loving, whimsical wisdom deigns to fulfill.* Masters can work out or otherwise negate their karma by prayer and acts of divine will in meditation or in the afterlife spiritual realms, both of which forms of release were em- ployed by Jesus. Thus the \"karma\" of masters does not bind their liberated souls, but rather serves as earth ties that cling loosely to saviors who choose to spend their freedom doing good on earth, either from God's heav- enly kingdom or by periodic reincarnations. Their human karma may be said to be like burnt rope; it appears to bind, but when so willed it falls away in ashes. Jesus was conscious throughout his mission that according to the law of cause and effect his divine works and words (taking the karma of many he cured and offending the laws of both religious and secular authorities) would surely lead to crucifixion of his body. His divine na- ture was inwardly established in the consciousness of \"I and my Father * For example, Lahiri Mahasaya had, in a previous incarnation, entertained a desire to enjoy the beauties of a palace. Though he had long since transcended bondage to delu- sive personal desires, being a fully liberated master, the Divine Will saw fit to fulfill that wish in a miraculous way.

Jesus regretted that the people of Jerusalem, a city hallowed by prophets of God, had great opportunity in those divine messengers and in himself to be saved, but they did not care to listen to wisdom: \"O people of Jerusalem, marked with a history of killing prophets and stoning those who are sent by God,* how readily I would have gathered you under my divine protection, as a hen would protect her brood under her wings! But you were unwilling to be saved from the ravages of your ignorance. Because of this, you will find the houses of your lives left empty and desolate, for you will be unable to feel me as the Christ Consciousness in everything with the fullness of Its infinite love, wisdom, and bliss. \"O Jerusalem, ye people of the world who do not appreciate me as the Infinite Christ incarnate in this body called Jesus, someday you will seek me as that Christ Consciousness, but you will not be successful un- til you have repented of your material ways and attained spiritual de- velopment.

Humbleness flows like a fountain from the realization of God, ex- pressing naturally through every soul consciously identified with Spirit. As a person who appears to be humble may not in fact possess real humility, so also a person who objectively remarks about his at- tainments or is conscious of his good qualities cannot necessarily be accused of egotism. In contrast to persons who put on a veneer of humbleness in order to pretend to be great when they are not so, peo- ple who are honest and straightforward, without affectation, may speak impersonally of their qualifications without egotistically over- estimating themselves or fostering conceit. King Janaka, a great saint of India, was worshipfully offering flowers at the shrine of God, when suddenly he started putting flow- ers on his own head, saying, \"I bow to myself. I am the sustainer of the universe.\" That was not egotism; in ecstasy, he suddenly saw God in everybody and in himself too. The responsibility of all souls is to know in every circumstance that they are reflections of the Supreme. Egotism steals away all possibility of that realization; there must be complete renunciation of the ego in Spirit. When one identifies no longer with his little self but with his divine Self, he rejoices, as does God, to be the servant of all. <-<=s>> Then said he also to him that bade him, \"When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.

Rather, to use the money, time, and labor to feed the poor and aid the needy, from whom no reciprocity is possible, is to recognize and serve God selflessly in the body temples of the unfortunate. In the words \"resurrection of the just,\" Jesus points out that in due time, when the just actions of those who serve the poor and afflicted will be weighed and judged by the law of cause and effect, those unselfish one s will be karmically rewarded with power to attract goodwill and prosperity for themselves. And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, \"Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.\" Then said he unto him, \"A certain man made a great supper, and bade many: and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, 'Come; for all things are now ready.'

And when that soul returns to the kingdom of God-consciousness, having repented of past errors, the rejoicing of God is shared by His liberated souls in heaven.\" Jesus compares the guru and his disciples to a shepherd and his sheep. The metaphor appealingly illustrates the protecting nature of the guru, who saves his disciples from the predation of the wolves of delu- sion and bad company. The disciples are compared to sheep for they follow the wise guidance of the master obediently, meekly, and humbly, joyously and innocently, with perfect faith. God desires His devotees to have these qualities of sheep, but not their animal stupidity! The shepherd with a hundred sheep is happy with his flock; but if he loses one and then finds it, he has additional joy. The same holds true with a divine shepherd who rescues a disciple who has been lost in the world through disobedience, temptation, evil surroundings, and hidden bad karma.* Jesus uses the metaphor of the woman and her pieces of silver to illustrate the feminine quality of deep feeling. A woman who cherishes with real feeling a little hoard of ten silver coins is emotionally upset at missing even a single piece, insignificant though the loss may seem; and she is exceedingly glad when she recovers it.

Likewise Spirit, being both Father and Mother, is not only aware of the loss when one of His children wanders from His king- do m and knows objectively that that soul by cosmic law will in time return to Him; but also as the loving Mother, God feelingly desires to recover that child from delusion. Unconditionally, wholeheartedly, God loves His untold generations of children and becomes anxious when even one of them becomes temporarily lost. The great love of God for his devotees is beautifully and won- drously expressed by Jesus in the revelation that the Lord, with His liberated angels and saints in heaven, rejoices when a sinning child re- pents of his follies and makes sincere effort to return to God's king- dom. This is illustrated also in the parable of the prodigal son as told by Jesus: And he said, \"A certain man had two sons: and the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me.' And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living. \"And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. \"And when he came to himself, he said, 'How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, \"Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.'\" And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. \"And the son said unto him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.' But the father said to his servants, 'Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes 1132"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"on his feet: And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.' And they began to be merry. \"Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing. And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. And he said unto him, 'Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.' \"And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and entreated him. And he answering said to his fa- ther, 'Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with har- lots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.' And he said unto him, 'Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found'\" (Luke 15:11-32.). A part from the obvious, time-honored moral of repentance and forgiveness, this parable bears also a deeper spiritual implication: \"Two devotees were born on earth with great —— wisdom inherited from their spiritual actions of Deeper spiritual past lives and the grace of the Heavenly Father. The meaning of the para- younger devotee was proud to possess the wealth of ble of the prodigal son wisdom that fell to his lot and became overly con- fident and careless. With the riches of wisdom cached in his bosom, he journeyed into the far country of delusion and temptation and there wasted his virtuous qualities by identifying himself with the sense pleasures of the body. When he was long in delusion, under the influ- ence of bad company, he encountered the mighty famine of inner suf- fering and longed to be nourished again by some food of wisdom, but could not find it in his drought-stricken life. \"He sought refuge with a good man who had devoted himself to disciplining a few unruly animalistic souls ('swine') by training them with some elementary moral instructions. The young devotee who had lost his wealth of wisdom by riotous living was so deeply repentant of 1133"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"his evil ways that he was willing to receive even the 'husks' of rudi- mentary discipline; but it seemed that he could not find anything to satisfy his gnawing hunger for divine bread. \"When the young man by continued repentance forsook his iden- tification with the senses and concentrated on his inner Self ('came to himself'), he introspected thus: 'My Heavenly Father has the inex- haustible supply of the bread of wisdom and divine bliss, and here I perish with hunger for peace, wisdom, and bliss. Now I will arise, lift my consciousness from the plane of sensations, and go back to my Fa- ther in the kingdom of Cosmic Consciousness and vibrate my inner in- tuitive prayers to Him: \"Father, Heavenly Father, I have acted against the laws of heavenly happiness by indulging in sensory promiscuity. I have darkened with ignorance Thy true soul-image within me. So in my present consciousness, I cannot worthily call myself Thy son. Take me back and give me whatever insignificant position and duties I can do on earth to atone for my evil deeds.\"' \"Then this young devotee arose, lifted his consciousness toward Cosmic Consciousness (Father). When he was yet a great way off from the goal of Cosmic Consciousness due to his past debauchery, the Heavenly Father saw him resolutely advancing toward His kingdom. With unconditional love for that prodigal devotee, He showered him with divine consciousness of His blessed Presence, enveloping him with the omnipresent embrace of celestial bliss. \"The Heavenly Father thus received back the prodigal devotee into His glorious astral kingdom where countless advanced and liber- ated devotees reigned with His Heavenly Majesty. The Heavenly Fa- ther commanded His angels to bring forth for the young devotee the best robes of astral lights and inner perceptions to decorate his soul. The devotee was adorned with the diamond ring of truth; his feet shod with eternal power. There was festivity in the astral world for the re- turn of the prodigal devotee, and he was offered the fatted calf of wis- dom and divine bliss. The Heavenly Father told his angels, 'Let us all rejoice in communion with this devotee, for this My prodigal son was spiritually dead and is alive again evermore in My Cosmic Con- sciousness. He was lost in delusion and now is found, having retraced his consciousness to My home of Cosmic Consciousness.' And they all communed in the joy of blessedness. \"Now the elder brother of the young devotee was also roaming in the field of cosmic vision. As he went deep and came nearer to the 1134"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"astral rejoicing, he heard the music of the spheres and the dancing of angels. In his vision he called one of the angels and asked why there was this special festivity in heaven. The angel replied, 'Thy prodigal brother who roamed in delusion has come back to the divine kingdom, and thy Heavenly Father has given him eternal blessings of wisdom and ever new bliss. The Heavenly Father is glad because your younger erring brother has regained his heavenly consciousness and is safe from long imprisonment in the karmic cycles of reincarnation.' \"When the elder devotee heard this he was puzzled and would not go near the presence of the Father. Therefore the Cosmic Conscious- ness approached him through his intuition with some spiritual thoughts and inner perceptions. But the elder devotee in his vision vi- brated his perplexity: 'Heavenly Father, behold these many years I have honored and worshiped Thee faithfully in Cosmic Conscious- ness; never have I broken Thy commandments nor transgressed Thy divine laws by even a desire for sense attachment, yet Thou never gave me such a demonstration of Thy blessings. But as soon as this prodi- gal son arrived in Thy kingdom, he who spoiled Thy gifts of wisdom by his profligacy, Thou hast offered him the fatted calf of wisdom to enjoy undeservedly.' \"The Heavenly Father vibrated the following intuitive wisdom into the heart of the misunderstanding advanced devotee: 'Devotee son, you are ever in My Cosmic Consciousness; and the feast of truth, including the fatted calf of wisdom, has always already been yours. You should not feel less because We felt it fit and proper to especially celebrate with cosmic joy for your own lost brother who was spiritu- ally dead and is now divinely alive, back again in Our kingdom, en- hancing Our joy as well as your joy. Rejoice!'\" In this parable, Jesus points out how greatly it pleases the Heav- enly Father to see His children, once lost in material pleasures, back again in the heavenly bliss of deep meditation and celestial ecstasy. When Jesus says of the prodigal son: \"When he was yet a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him,\" he gives great assurance to suffering mankind that the Heavenly Father meets at least halfway the devotee who dili- gently and continuously prays to go back to the heavenly kingdom. Jesus further notes that devotees who are already graced by God with divine consciousness should not compare their portion with the bestowal of the gifts of grace on any other devotee.

The dishonest steward, Divine principles and about to lose his position after his untrustworthy cosmic laws ofmate- behavior is exposed, extended his unscrupulous rial success and ways in dishonest schemes that benefited others in prosperity order to obtain from them favors that would secure his own future. So adroitly clever was the steward that his rich em- ployer (himself skilled in the materialistic ways of success) could not but admire the shrewdness of his employee, even as he removed him from opportunity to embezzle further from his own treasury. The world lauds successful persons who follow its ways, but it will not share responsibility for the consequences. Jesus points out that materially minded persons, \"the children of this world,\" unethical and morally reprehensible though they may be, often exhibit more cleverness about practical affairs than spiritual per- sons (\"the children of the light\"). Thus Jesus counsels his followers not to be dullards in fulfilling their dutiful responsibilities and satis- fying their material needs.

Money itself is brainless; it cannot be blamed as inherently evil. It brings good or evil only according to the noble or reprehensible use that people make of it. Money is used by both saints and bandits. Virtuous persons attract money by applying the di- vine laws governing material prosperity, and convert its value into sus- taining life and helping others materially, mentally, and spiritually. Evildoers and the sense-enslaved pursue monetary gain by any expe- dient means, regardless of the harm or destruction inflicted on others, and employ their acquisition in all manner of selfish indulgence and depravity. God-knowing sages have declared that the three strongest temp- tations of man are money, sex, and intoxicants. In earlier eras in un- developed civilizations, sex and wine were the primary pitfalls; in our industrial age, with its dependence on finance in individual life and so- v ciet y at large, it may be said that money is the principal tool of delu- sion, for it buys wine, stimulates indulgence in evil sensory passions, and exerts a powerful hypnosis of self-importance and false security. Scriptural wisdom, which condemns worship of \"unrighteous mam- mon,\" needs to be heeded by money-mad modern man. Saint Paul echoed the teachings of Jesus: \"They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of mone y is the root of all evil....But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.

I am tormented by the flames of my unfulfilled material desires and at- tachment cravings for fleshly existence.' \"Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that on earth you received your heart's desire for material prosperity; but being engrossed and en- gorged in it, you forgot God. Lazarus, though plagued with physical suffering, did not neglect to cultivate God-consciousness by the inner communion of prayer and meditation. The law of cause and effect or- dains that as you did not labor for God-happiness in your earth life, you cannot claim a harvest of blessedness in the after-death state; while Lazarus now 'is comforted,' reaping the result of his spiritual ac- tions: the ever new joy of the Great Comforter (the Holy Ghost, the Holy Vibration of God made manifest).

You are used to gross vibrations, so you have to remain in that stratum until you re- solve to improve yourself and thus deserve to be promoted to a more * See Discourse 21, discussion of \"Gabriel's trumpet\" that resurrects souls after death into their karmically earned abodes in the astral world and next incarnation on earth. 1147"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"spiritual earth existence, and thence to the higher existence where we are. Astral beings of finer vibrations who live with us cannot reach you without divine permission, nor can any of you living in the lower regions come here without divine decree.'\" Describing the fate of the sense-attached rich man in this parable, Jesus gives a graphic warning to body-bound persons who are misusing the gifts of God by inordinately indulging material desires in utter forgetfulness of their need to regain their Father's everlasting kingdom of bliss. Accord- ing to the law of cause and effect, in the after-death state such persons will live for a karmically deter- mined time in a self-created hell in the astral world, bemoaning the loss of their sensate physical body, its comforting breath, sensory pleasures, unfulfilled desires, and the accus- tomed sustenance of favored tasty foods (referred to in the parable in which the rich man \"fared sumptuously every day\"). They are unable to enjoy the divine state of ever new heavenly bliss they could have re- alized in the after-death state. Shortsighted people of the world pursue God's ephemeral mun- dane gifts of material objects and pleasures in complete neglect of the Giver who is everlastingly useful to His seeking children. Wise chil- dren of the Heavenly Father who discover that they are made in His image seek first His kingdom of eternal happiness hidden within, and material things afterwards, realizing that no spurious material substi- tutes can ever alleviate the true happiness-thirst of the soul. That is why Jesus had said, \"Bread the men of the world seek after; but ye who are wise, seek ye the kingdom of God first.\" He counseled all souls on earth to learn to live \"not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,\" so that in the after-death state they would be already consciously familiar with living by the word of God, or Cosmic Vibration, and Cosmic Bliss.\"' Great saints who voluntarily practice fasting, breathlessness and heart-control in the samadhi state of meditation, inner renunciation, body-aboveness, and other disciplines find that in the afterlife, rather than experiencing the loss of the body as a sort of anguish in the de- nial of earthly sensations and comforts, they consciously enjoy unfet- tered perceptions of wondrous bliss and freedom.

Most persons can look forward to a glorified experience of peace, freedom, and blessed relief from life's burdens and afflictions when the spirit leaves the body at the time of death.* How- ever, those such as the rich man in this parable who are strongly attached to their physical forms are aghast at being wrenched away from their bodily instrument with its much-indulged materialistic ca- pacities. As the life energy empowering all the senses and organs moves toward the medulla and then out of the physical form, desires urge the ego-bound soul to try to draw the consciousness back into the body. Such persons try again and again unsuccessfully to operate the lungs and other organs or to move the muscles with their disembodied will, but at last surrender their fruitless effort and enter a sort of dreamless sleep, a period of rest from the travails of life. After the initial astral sleep, souls who left the body with power- ful bad habits and dissipation of the senses of the physical form par- tially awaken in intermittent dreamlike astral experiences of unre- quited craving to indulge the sense-desires of the lost physical vehicle. This frustration of unfulfillment and unslaked mortal thirsts causes a mental agony that is the real hell experienced in the afterlife.t When the karmically ordained period of astral suffering or reward is over, the soul wakes up in another body in a new incarnation on earth, en- dowed with the physical instrumentalities to pursue once again its de- sires and learning experiences—this time, it is to be hoped, with at least a little more wisdom learned from previous painful lessons. *See also Discourses 10 and 2.4 for further explanation of the positive after-death ex- periences in the astral world earned by most souls, in contradistinction to the un- pleasant karmic lessons awaiting debased individuals, as Jesus cites in the parable ex- plicated here. fSee also Discourse 48, commentary on Matthew 18:8-9: \"If thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into ever- lasting fire. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is bet- ter for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.\" Understanding the \"heaven\" and \"hell\" experienced in the after-death state 1149"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"The physical body and world are perceived through the two phys- ical eyes; the heavenly astral body and cosmos are purely seen through the intuitional power of the one spiritual eye. \"If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.\"* It is by opening the \"single\" or spiritual eye that one can perceive the luminous pranic forces that compose the astral body and astral cosmos. Extremely materialistic persons, those who have led a terrible life, are unable after death to awaken fully into the consciousness of the wondrous potentials of their astral body. Their beclouded conscious- ness remains aware only of a region of darkness and mental distress. Even while incarnate on earth, advanced souls who meditate deeply experience through their spiritual eye the all-knowing intuition of the soul as an illuminating lightless light that dispels the darkness of closed eyes; with that single power they can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch in the inner astral world. Thus when they die, intuition comes to their aid as a revealing light by which they can perceive the shining beauty of the astral world and their astral body. Only those who have developed soul intuition and have cultivated before death the body transcendence of God-consciousness can attain conscious as- cendence into, and full awareness of, the highest regions of the heav- enly astral world; and they can also, if they so desire, see across the vibrational gulf that divides heaven from earthly life. Everything one has done to develop the \"sixth sense\" of intuition while on earth helps one after death. Since it is the degree of realiza- tion and the amount of virtue one has expressed on earth that deter- mines one's experience in the astral region, there is much work to be done to purify the indwelling consciousness by God-contact and by persistence in exercising the godly virtues. In depicting the astral ascension of the afflicted beggar Lazarus, Jesus gives comfort to suffering virtuous persons by the assurance that they should not feel discouraged, nor should they envy those with ma- terial advantages. Earthly blessings, if improperly used, may be fol- lowed by experiences of extreme discomfort in the after-death state. Righteous persons who retain their goodness until the end of their lives, no matter what suffering or deprivation they endure, will find when they leave the body that they have earned a heavenly freedom and joy in the astral kingdom.

Jesus explains in the parable, through Abraham's comments to the rich man, why Lazarus could not be sent to solace him in his astral sufferings. Abraham makes reference to the \"gulf\" —— of dividing vibration separating the astral vibratory Can souls on earth or spheres one from the other. As the material universe in the lower-astral is divided into the principal vibratory regions of hades receive help earth, water, air, and fiery energy, so there are sev- from heavenly beings? eral distinct regions of the subtler cosmos, each of which has many subdivisions, with the exception of the highest plane —there all is one. Ether-filled space acts as a vibratory rampart that prevents materialistic persons on earth from entering the heavenly as- tral kingdom; likewise, increasingly subtle vibratory forms of etheric space divide the lower from the higher astral regions, and the even finer causal realm from the astral.f Thus, the astral realm to which the rich man was consigned was separated by a vibrational barrier from the finer heavenly abode to which Lazarus's spiritual karma had drawn him, \"so that they which would pass from hence to you can- not; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.\" The more advanced a soul is, the freer its movement within the vast territory of God's kingdom. Fully liberated souls have no bound- aries of movement. But karma-restricted souls cannot move freely from one sphere into another sphere. People who are dark with delu- sive ignorance, crimes, or other wrong acts and have thus attracted temporary residence in the \"slums\" of the astral land after death would not even be able to stand the finer vibrations of a higher sphere and its residents of spiritual souls, just as in this world evil ones can- * \"Without real sacrifice, O Arjuna, whence comes any better world (any better existence o r elevated state of consciousness)?\" ( God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita iv:31). tSee Chapter 43 of Autobiography of a Yogi, \"The Resurrection of Sri Yukteswar,\" for my Guru's incomparable explanation of the astral and causal realms. 1151"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"not bear to be in spiritual environs or in the company of saintly per- sons. On earth people cannot touch a high-voltage electric current without being burned; similarly, in the astral realm souls whose con- sciousness is of low vibrational quality experience energy shocks when they come in contact with higher vibrations. As man suffers in this world from collision with matter, so the astral body suffers in that world from collision with vibrations higher than its own. Nevertheless, God in His mercy does not leave suffering souls in any region of creation bereft of help. In the astral world there are ad- vanced good souls who help repentant bad ones to work out their karmic penances — as also do the prayers and goodwill that reach them from their loved ones on earth. Only those who have sufficiently developed their spiritual consciousness and the enlightenment of intu- ition during their earthly incarnations are consciously able to devote themselves to the good works of helping others in the astral world, and are also able to give invisible assistance to souls on earth. In the afterlife, as on earth, souls must either ascend or descend; none can remain stationary until the permanence of God-union is at- tained. Those who have gone into the astral world at physical death with material desires must return to the gratifying playground of the physical world. Souls who have freed themselves from earthly karma, and who continue to develop in God-consciousness in the astral world, ascend into the supernally blissful causal heaven. Most average persons, those whose sins are venial and few, are re- born on earth relatively sooner than more advanced souls; after their soul-renewing sojourn in the astral, they wake up in a new physical body with fresh opportunities to progress. Sinful persons are often confined longer by the force of their karma to whatever astral sphere is most conducive to learning the lessons that will prepare them for ul- timate redemption. Virtuous souls may stay longer in the astral than do ordinary souls, reaping the blessed rewards of their good karma. Although the rich man in the parable was caught in the self-created hades of his dissolute ways and unfulfilled desires and failed to gain al- leviation of his miseries, he was generous enough in spirit to ask Abra- ham to send Lazarus to warn his wayward brothers and thereby save them from a similar fate. Even though divine law did not permit Abra- ham to comply with that wish, the implicit lesson in the story is that the rich man's repentance and marked unselfishness in thinking of his broth- ers' freedom, even while in the throes of his own torment, would aid in 1152"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"working out the effects of his own profligate actions and help to liberate him from his lower-astral suffering.

Abraham's refusal to send Lazarus to earth to warn the five broth- ers of the rich man about the consequences of riotous living was in ac- cord with divine decree that God does not impose spectacular inter- vention of His powers to coerce the free will of man. Nor does He send the dead as His spokesmen.* His way is to send divine prophets whose message, exalted lives, and spiritual service encourage His error-led children to realize the rewards of following liberating paths of righ- teousness. If man be so inured to ignorance that he cannot be moved by the wisdom, love, and holy bliss-vibrations of God's chosen emis- saries, neither would lasting beneficial change be effected by the testi- mony of any lesser spirit appearing from the astral world. Man of his own free will must make a resolute choice to attune his life with the teachings and blessings of God-sent gurus, saints, and prophets. * \"Many persons erroneously imagine that 'the dead'—human beings who have passed over to the astral world—are in touch with great masters or are themselves deep founts of wisdom.

Only those persons who possessed enlightenment while in the physical body are empowered, upon leaving it, to unite with God and to impart illumination to others. \"The Gita points out that those who believe in consulting 'departed spirits' are ig- norant men.

His expanded awareness, spread over the vast uni- versal circumference, could feel every event on the earth's surface or within it, or anywhere in the material universe, or in any of the finer spheres of vibratory creation. A person jostled by others in a crowd can feel exactly when and where on his body each touch falls, even if he does not see each contact. The Heavenly Father, through His ubiquitous Christ Consciousness, is aware of everything occurring in His immense body of the cosmos. Lord Jesus, Bhagavan Krishna, all souls imbued with Christ Consciousness, Ku- tastha Chaitanya, likewise possess that universal feeling of all-pervading Infinite Intelligence, by which they can be instantaneously aware of dis- tant happenings, even as Jesus was cognizant of the death of Lazarus. When Jesus said to his disciples, \"Our friend Lazarus sleepeth,\" he signified: \"Lazarus is sleeping the delusive sleep of death.

Christ knew the uni- verse as a cosmic dream, so he said: \"I see the soul of Lazarus is dream- ing the sleep of death.

It is that particular time when any soul after death is judged by the cosmic law of action (karma) and accordingly is resurrected to live in one of the astral regions or on earth in a new incarnation.* Resur- rection in that context signifies the rising of souls from the after-death state of sleep or rest to the wakefulness in higher or lower astral spheres, or to the transition of a soul from one body to another on earth, as Elijah was reborn as John the Baptist. Resurrection can also mean the revival of life in a dead body, as illustrated in the case of Lazarus. In addition, resurrection indicates the elevation of consciousness from lower to higher states—especially from body identification to superconsciousness, Christ Consciousness, or Cosmic Consciousness through communion, respectively, with the Holy Ghost Aum Vibra- tion, the Infinite Christ, or Spirit.

Any advanced soul who learns to feel permanently the eternal life, as is incarnate in me, and who believes in, communes with, the Christ Consciousness that is in me, and in himself, shall transcend mortal death: he shall never again be forced to reincarnate and experience the consequent ignoble change of death that befalls the physical body. Dost thou believe all this I say?\" Whenever Jesus speaks of \"I am,\" it is from the consciousness of his soul being one with Christ Consciousness.* In contradistinction, when the ordinary person says, \"I am,\" he refers to his body, his ego consciousness and its physical possessions or intellectual acquisitions; as for example, \"I am strong,\" or, \"I am rich,\" or, \"I am a specialist in literature or philosophy.\" Whenever he says, \"I am sick,\" or, \"I am full of vitality,\" he speaks of his life as limited by the condition of his body. When Jesus says, \"/ am the resurrection,\" he means, \"I am Christ Consciousness in which souls rise from a lower state of consciousness to a higher state of inner development.\" When Jesus says, '7 am the life,\" there is no taint of egotism in his voiced realization of \"My life is one with the Cosmic Life in everything, whereby I feel all living crea- tures are born out of me and sleep in me.\"f *See commentary on similar usage of \"I am\" in John 6:35, \"I am the bread of life\" (Discourse 43); and in John 8:12, \"I am the light of the world\" (Discourse 51). Jesus speaks impersonally from his divine ego, or spiritualized human consciousness, that was one with the infinite Christ Consciousness and its permeative presence through- out all vibratory manifestation. fBhagavan Krishna, speaking from the same universal consciousness, similarly de- clared: \"Understand, O Arjuna! that My different and higher nature (Para-Prakriti) is the jiva, the self-consciousness and life-principle, that sustains the cosmos\" (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita vii:5). 1165"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"\"He that believeth in me\" refers not to those who merely believe in the physical existence and works of Jesus, but to those advanced devotees who have begun to realize the expansion of their conscious- ness to the Christ Consciousness in everything. ——  \"Though he were dead\" relates to both physi- Owe in tune with cal death and spiritual death. \"Yet shall he live\" Christ Consciousness refers to the resurrection of life in the physical body overcomes physical or the resurrection of a soul from a lower sphere to and spiritual death a higher sphere of consciousness. One who is in tune with Christ Consciousness can re-enliven and reappear in his formerly dead body if he wishes. But repairing and reanimating the same deceased clod of earth is an unnecessary trouble and conservancy of the limitless creative sub- stances of life. Unless they have a specific exceptional purpose, resur- rected masters rather re-create a body in the likeness of their discarded physical form, equally true to the material specifications of their for- mer image, as was the living manifestation of my master Sri Yuktes- warji in his after-death appearance to me.* One who is temporarily spiritually dead in the dream of delusion can regain by divine endeavor his soul's unity with Christ Consciousness. \"Whosoever liveth and believeth in me\" refers to anyone who per- manently communes with Christ Consciousness within him and hence believes or is convinced of the immortal Christ Consciousness equally present in himself as in Jesus. \"Shall never die\" refers both to spiritual and physical death. All souls who can permanently commune with Christ Consciousness will never witness spiritual death through ignorance, or physical death through forced reincarnations. Souls who are identified with their bodies create human desires that bring them back to earth many times until those desires are worked out. Liberated souls, those who over- come material desires, become pillars in the mansion of God and \"go no more out\"; they are unloosed from the exigent cycles of alternate births and deaths.

Then, projecting his own divinely invulnerable consciousness into the dead body of Lazarus, he absorbed and neutralized, by taking onto himself, the force of the specific karma that had compelled Lazarus' soul to leave that form. Once that karmic imprint of death on the bodily cells was no longer operative, Jesus was able by command of his God-united will to direct Cosmic Energy to restore the viability of the cells, so that they were capable once again of accommodating a living soul with its astral and causal faculties of life and consciousness. Finally, he invited the soul of Lazarus to reinhabit its renewed fleshly residence; in effect, resurrecting it from the state of inert matter by reinvesting it with the powers of knowledge and action, mind and energy, that had fled with the departure of the astral and causal bodies. \"And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin.

There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.\" And he said unto him, \"Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole\" (Luke 17:11-19). J esus is pointing out the material nature of most people, who, even when they are the beneficiaries of providential gifts, rejoice in their good fortune but remain thoughtlessly lacking in recognition of the Giver. Just imagine! out of the ten lepers who were blessed with in- stantaneous healing of their insidious disease by the divine power in Jesus, only one was moved to express due gratitude. The purist Jews in the time of Jesus esteemed themselves and their religious traditions as spiritually superior to their contemporaries. So Jesus made an issue of the fact that it was a \"stranger\" to those tra- ditions, a \"low-caste\" Samaritan of mixed race and customs,* who ha d the spiritual sensitivity to thank Jesus and glorify God. And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, \"The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: Neither shall they say, 'Lo here!' or, 'lo there!' for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you\" (Luke 17:20-21).

The Gospel records that at the very outset of his public ministry, \"Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God.\" His exhortation to \"seek ye first the kingdom of God\" is at the heart of his Sermon on the Mount. The only prayer he is known to have given his disciples beseeches God, \"Thy kingdom come.\" Again and again he spoke of the kingdom of the Heavenly Fa- ther and the method of its attainment: \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot en- ter into the kingdom of God.\"* \"Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.\"f \"No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.

The incipient origin of all material forms and material vibrations lies in Cosmic Consciousness. Matter is condensed physical energy; phys- ical energy is condensed astral energy; and astral energy is condensed prototypic thought force of God. Hence Cosmic Consciousness lies hidden within and behind the layers of matter, physical energy, astral energy, and thought or consciousness. As in the macrocosm, so in the microcosm of the human body: Cosmic Consciousness, which is marked by ever new joy and immor- tality, is the creator of human consciousness and as such lies within it. From the infinite Cosmic Consciousness, individual souls were con- ceived; these individualized ideations of the thought of God were cloaked in two further layers of external manifestation by condensa- tion of magnetic causal forces of consciousness into the astral body of luminous life energy and the mortal body of flesh and blood. Thus the kingdom of God is not separate from the kingdom of matter, but is both within it—pervading it in subtle form as its origin *See Discourse 37 for explanation of the meanings of \"kingdom of God\" and \"king- dom of heaven\" as used both distinctively and interchangeably. 381"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"and sustainer—and beyond it, existing in the infinite mansions of the Father beyond the circumscribed physical cosmos.* That is why Jesus said it is futile to look for heaven with the con- sciousness concentrated on material vibrations—identified with bod- - ily sensations and pleasures and earthly comforts.f Heaven is found by In the kingdom of matter and body consciousness turning within to the man finds disease and mental and physical suffer- cerebrospinal centers ing; but turning within to the inner kingdom he of spiritual  finds the Comforter, the Holy Ghost or Cosmic Vi- consciousness bration of Aum, manifesting in the subtle cere- brospinal centers of spiritual consciousness.

Communion with the holy Comforter brings attunement with Christ Consciousness indwelling in the body as the ever perfect soul. * \"If those who lead you say, 'Look! the kingdom is in heaven,' then the birds of heaven will precede you.

His disciples said to him, \"...When will the new world come?\" He said to them, \"What you are looking forward to has come, but you don't know it\" (The Gospel of Thomas, verse 51). Jesus' disciples said unto him: \"When will the kingdom come?\" Jesus answered, \"It will not come by waiting for it. People will not say, 'Look! Here it is!' or 'There it is!'

The tissues of the physical body are made up of cells; the tissue of the astral body is composed of lifetrons—intelligent units of light or life energy. When man is in a state of body attachment, characterized by tension or contraction of life energy into atomic components, the lifetrons of the astral body become compacted, circumscribed by iden- tification with the physical form. By metaphysical relaxation, the lifetronic structure begins to expand—the grip of the flesh on one's identity loosens. By deeper and deeper meditation, the energy frame of the astral self expands beyond the boundaries of the physical body. The lifetronic body, being of a sphere of existence unconfounded by the delusional stricture of the three-dimensional physical world, has the potential to become one with the Cosmic Energy pervading the whole universe. God as Holy Ghost, Holy Vibration, is the Light of Cosmic Energy; man, made in the image of God, is composed of that light. We are that Light compacted; and we are that Light of our Uni- versal Self. 387"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"As a first step toward entering the kingdom of God, the devotee should sit still in the correct meditation posture, with erect spine, and tense and relax the body—for by relaxation the consciousness is re- leased from the muscles. The yogi begins with proper deep breathing, inhaling and tensing the whole body, exhaling and relaxing, several times. With each exhalation all muscular tension and motion should be cast away, until a state of bodily stillness is attained. Then, by con- centration techniques, restless motion is removed from the mind. In perfect stillness of body and mind, the yogi enjoys the ineffable peace of the presence of the soul. In the body, life is templed; in the mind, light is templed; in the soul, peace is templed. The deeper one goes into the soul the more that peace is felt; that is superconsciousness. When by deeper meditation the devotee expands that awareness of peace and feels his consciousness spreading with it over the universe, that all be- ings and all creation are swallowed up in that peace, then he is enter- ing into Cosmic Consciousness. He feels that peace everywhere—in the flowers, in every human being, in the atmosphere. He beholds the earth and all worlds floating like bubbles in that ocean of peace.* The inner peace first experienced by the devotee in meditation is his own soul; the vaster peace he feels by going deeper is God. The devotee who experiences unity with everything has established God in the temple of his infinite inner perception. In the temple of silence, in the temple of peace, I will meet Thee, I will touch Thee, I will love Thee, And coax Thee to my altar of peace.

God intimates Himself in the temple of silence and then in the temple of peace. The devotee first meets Him as peace flowing out of the mental state in which all thoughts have become transformed into pure intuitive feeling. He touche s the Lord with his heart's love and feels Him as joy; his pure love entices God to manifest Himself on the altar of the perception of peace. The advancing devotee feels God not only in meditation, but keeps Him always on the altar of peace in his heart. In the temple of samadhi, oneness with the peace that is God's first manifestation in meditation, the devotee finds a state of ever new bliss, a joy that never grows stale. Bliss is a much deeper state than peace. As a mute person drinking nectar imbibes but cannot describe the ambrosial flavor, so the rapture of bliss found in the temple of samadhi moves the experiencer to wordless eloquence. That joy alone can satisfy the innate craving of the human heart. In patient, persis- tent meditation, day after day, year after year, the devotee lovingly de- mands of his Lord: \"Come to me as joy in samadhi- oneness, and re- main forever in my heart on the altar of bliss!\" When in our hearts, in harmony with the hearts of all who love God in the interior temple of silence and bliss, we rejoice in the joy of our one Beloved, that united joy is a vast altar of God. It is incumbent on man as a soul to practice that inner silence; to fin d God now. In the use of the senses amid the exigencies of daily life, the devotee holds to the consciousness: \"I am sitting on the peace throne of inner silence.\" In the midst of activity, he remains in- wardly recollected: \"I am the god of silence sitting on the throne of each action.\" His equanimity is upset by no unruly feelings: \"I am the prince of silence sitting on the throne of poise.\" His inner Self, at one with eternity, in life and in death rejoices: \"I am the king of immor- talit y reigning on the throne of silence.

Infinite supreme happiness is happiness and peace are always at hand, just be- the birthright of every hind the screen of man's ignorance.* How could it soul  be possible for anyone to be forever barred from the kingdom of God, when that divine realm is right within him? All one has to do is turn from the darkness of evil and follow the light of goodness. The proximity of happiness is as close as one's own Self; it isn't even a matter of attaining, but only of lifting the soul-shrouding veil of ignorance. The very word \"attaining\" implies something one wants but does not have—a metaphysical error. Bliss is the irrevocable di- vine birthright of every soul. Tear away the intrusive veil, and at once there is contact with that happiness supreme. Spirit is happiness. Soul is the pure reflection of Spirit. Body-bound man fails to perceive this becaus e his consciousness is distorted: The lake of his mind is con- stantly roiled by the incursion of thoughts and emotions. Meditation quiet s the waves of feeling ( chitta ) so that God's reflection as the joy- ous soul is clearly mirrored within.

If one resolves never to go to sleep at night without meditating and feeling the Divine Presence, into one's life will come happiness beyond all expectation. Effort is necessary, but that effort will make one a king enthroned in the king- dom of peace and joy. Time spent in the pursuit of extraneous mate- rial things is a waste of man's precious opportunities to know God. I am telling you this from my heart: Blessed is he who makes up his mind never to rest until he has found God. A subsistent inner happiness unconditioned by any external in- fluence is evident proof of the responding presence of God. Progress in divine communion comes only by meditating with regularity and with deep concentration and devotion. Every day's meditation must be deeper than yesterday's. The devotee who makes the divine quest his overriding concern will find in the kingdom of God eternal safety; no tremor of trouble or trials can cross the threshold of his sanctuary of silence wherein naught is allowed ingress but the blissful, all-loving Father-Mother God. One who finds within himself that \"secret place of the most High\" becomes suffused with supreme happiness and divine security.f Whether he is mixing with friends or sleeping or working, he keeps that place only for God.

Just behind your perceptions, just behind your thoughts, just behind your feelings, He is. Every grain of food you eat, every breath you take, is God. You are not living by food or oxygen, but by the Cosmic Word of God. All powers of mind and action that you use are borrowed from God. Think of Him all the time—before you act, while you are engaged in activity, and after activity. In fulfilling your duty to man, remember foremost your duty to God, without whose delegated power no duties are possible. Feel Him behind your senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Feel His energy in the arms, and legs, and feet. Feel Him as life in each exhalation and inhalation. Feel His power in your will; His wisdom in your brain; His love in your heart. Wherever God's presence is consciously felt, mortal ignorance melts away. Those who are wise never miss their daily engagement with God in meditation. They make it the consuming goal of their existence to contact Him. All who persist with that sincerity shall enter the king- dom of God in this life; and to abide in that kingdom is to be eternally free.

By way of illustration, he posits a case in which a hard-hearted, indiffer- ent judge finally acquiesces to the relentless petitioning of a belea- guered widow; even so, he promises, God in His infinite kindhearted- ness will respond far more readily to sincere, unceasing prayers. True devotees in continuous prayer seek deliverance from the tor- ment of sly satanic delusion, desiring that enemy to be punished by banishment from the precincts of the mind so that their worship of God may be without taint of distraction.

Jesus repeatedly emphasizes the importance of faith in receiving and understanding God's response. Belief is uncertain, the initial con- dition of the mind when it tries to speculate about God; but faith is the ultimate immutable conviction attained after the devotee knows God for certain by contacting Him in meditation. When a devotee deeply meditates and intensely prays, he intu- itively knows the presence of God as a feeling of unsurpassed joy that comes over him.

I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.' \"And the publican, standing off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, 'God be merciful to me a sinner.' \"I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted\" (Luke 18:9-14).* 'This last verse is repeated in Luke 14:11 (see Discourse 58 for additional commentary). 394"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"T he publican, though of less virtue than the Pharisee, nevertheless had humbleness and sincerity and thus created the good karma by which he was justified to receive the purifying vibration of God. The proud Pharisee could not gather and hold on the mountain- top of his ego the raindrops of divine blessings showered equally over him and the publican, whereas the drops of mercy settled copiously in the deep valley of the publican's humble heart. A pretentious man who imagines himself to be great is a fool in the eyes of God and of his own soul. He who is saturated with a natural humility exudes a divine magnetism, that special something throbbing behind his eyes and demeanor, that draws appreciation and recognition both human and divine. Jesus, in upholding the sincere prayer of the sinful publican and depreciating the egotistical prayer of the Pharisee, does not imply that the opprobrious publican was superior in virtue to the law-abiding Pharisee. Jesus meant only to emphasize the value of humility in at- tracting divine mercy.

These were enunciated by the Vedic rishis and also encapsulated in the Book of Genesis, whose verses Jesus himself referred to in replying to the Pharisees. As explained in the commentary on the opening verses of Saint John's Gospel — \"Genesis According to Saint John\"* — before the be- ginning of creation the Spirit was One: ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss. But He thought within Himself: \"Verily, I am Joy; but there is none to enjoy Me.\" As He thought this, He became divided into Creator and created, Transcendent Spirit and Cosmic Vibratory Nature. By cloaking a portion of His unmanifested consciousness with the illusion of difference, or particulars, Spirit manifested finite ob- jects, using the law of duality and relativity to differentiate His One Consciousness and Cosmic Energy into countless pairs of polarized forces and forms: positive and negative elements, male and female, man and woman. The universal everything is made of the singular consciousness of God. When a spark of that consciousness is individualized by God, it becomes a soul, capable of ultimately expressing the God-image in which it is made. In essence, the soul is perfect and complete, an ex- act reflection of God's ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new bliss. But when incarnate, it takes on the dualistic nature of creation, out- wardly expressing primarily either a masculine or feminine, positive or negative, half of its essence. This is why it is said in Oriental scriptures that when God reflected His consciousness in created forms, they became \"half-souls\" by tak- ing on through identification the qualities of the manifested units of creation—positive or negative, reason- or feeling-impregnated, male or female. These dual qualities are \"soul mates\" of each other to be even- tually reunited—\"they twain shall be one flesh\" in order for the fully expressing soul to find liberation in Spirit. God's creative manifestation is Omnipotent Force (God's Bliss stirred by the will to create) and Consciousness (Omniscient Feeling). These produce the Intelligent Cosmic Energy from the womb of which is born all manifestation. The souls of man and woman are made of these divine potentials, perfect individualized reflections of this three- fold essence. The incarnate being experiences these as reason (dis- criminative will), feeling (that which makes man conscious and able * See Discourse i. 1198"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"to enjoy), and energy (the substance that creates and activates the bod- ily instrument). When God divided Himself as man and woman, both dualities ex- pressed the same unified consciousness, rather than the differentiation or polarity necessary to sustain the illusion of indi-  »  viduality in the manifested world. So He conceived Marriage is to bring a clever plan, a trick to keep man and woman dif- out the hidden feeling ferent from each other and separate from Himself: in man and the hid- He created superficial distinctions in their bodies den reason in woman and minds. When He made man, He used reason and feeling and cosmic energy, keeping reason uppermost and feeling hidden; that is why man's features manifest dispassionate reason. God mad e woman by using feeling, reason, and cosmic energy, keeping feelin g uppermost and reason hidden; that is why her features express softness and call forth feeling. Reason, being aggressive, made man positive with positive sexual processes; and woman, with deep feeling, wa s negative and thus formed deep sexual recesses.* The ideal spiritual union between man and woman was ordained that man might bring out the hidden reason in woman, and that the woman might help man uncover his hidden feeling. By so aiding each other to develop a perfect balance of these pure divine soul qualities, they would transcend their delusive differentiation as man and woman and realize their true nature as inviolate souls. Liberation was to be accomplished by their becoming united first to each other in divine friendship, the purest expression of God's love shared between two in- dividuals; and then, thus perfected, ready for the ultimate union with God . It is clear from Jesus' references to Genesis in these verses that he was citing the law of true soul mates, the immutable law of spiritual love, which should motivate all marriages. This was, as Jesus empha- sized, the divine law \"at the beginning\": that for every true man there was a true woman, and each one who lived rightly on earth would au- tomaticall y be drawn together in soul-companionship with a mate by the operation and decree of this law. True marriage serves as a spiri- tual device for perfecting the full expression of souls and freeing them into God by proper union—a process of evolution through which souls projected away from God into creation would be brought back * See also Discourse 2, explanation of immaculate creation, direct materialization. 1199"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"through restoration, realization, of their divine nature assisted by the companionship of the ideal helpmate. The concept of soul mates is entirely misleading without knowl- edge of the basic truth that it is only on the plane of creation, where the law of relativity prevails, that a soul identified with a form (jivat- man) may be considered as being a male or female Essential nature of \"half-soul.\" The true nature of the Self (the pure at- each soul is complete man) as a reflection of Transcendent Spirit beyond and perfect, free from the delusive requisites of the created worlds is free sex and duality from sex and duality. In Chapter i of Genesis, cited by Jesus in these verses, we read: \"Male and female created He them...\" (Genesis 1:27). This refers to the creation of these two natures in the spiritual (causal/astral) body, in which male and female natures were united— \"at the beginning,\" Jesus emphasized. God created man and woman, the first pairs of ideal beings, as soul companions. Every vibratory particle, whether material or etherically spiritual, has a positive or a negative force or quality (male or female); and, whereas these were united in the spiritual body of divine beings,* these characteristics be- came separated, or differentiated, when God created the material hu- man body. This dichotomy of masculine and feminine and their in- tended reunion by spiritual marriage is described in Chapter 2 of Genesis, from which Jesus also quoted: \"And the Lord God caused a dee p sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; and the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man....Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh\" (Genesis 2:21-24). He slept refers to the power of avidya (individual illusion as op- posed to maya, or universal delusion), by which differentiation is made between man and woman. Rib means vibration. From the vibra- tion of God-force that created man, or Adam, manifesting a reason- predominant nature, God drew forth a rib or feeling-predominant vi- bration to create woman. *Cf. commentary on Mark 12:25 (pages 12.16 ff.): \"For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.\" 1200"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"Thus man and woman are the two natures of God—reason (knowl- edge) and feeling (consciousness, emotional reaction)—expressed on the material plane in differentiated bodies. God gave the first human beings the power to commune with Him in spite of this delusion-imposed dual consciousness. He placed them in paradise—the unified consciousness of the soul manifesting in the awakened spiritual eye and the pure divine expression of the causal-astral body. In the original plan of creation, man and woman, ideal soul mates, were to lead a heavenly life by keeping their minds in the divine region of Bliss-Will in the forehead. Spiritual marriage consisted in the feminine force or feeling uniting with the mas- culine force or reason and thus becoming whole in oneness with God. The souls that went out of God were to be brought back to God by the process of harmony in body, mind, and soul. The harmonious balance of reason and feeling leads to intuitive perception and the ability to know what is Truth. Achieving this bal- ance, men and women become gods. In the unbalanced human con- sciousness, the feminine quality, or feeling, loses its calm intuitive pow- ers under the influence of the restlessness of body consciousness and emotional excitation; and the masculine attribute, or reason, loses its calm intuitive powers when it succumbs to the restlessness of body consciousness and egotistical self-sufficiency. The original man and woman fell from the awareness of their divine state by physical mis- use of the sex force, forfeiting the heavenly union of reason and feel- in g and becoming identified with their material body rather than their heavenly causal-astral consciousness with its faculty of intuitive per- ception of God and knowledge of their souls as one with Him.* When two souls come together and bring out the wholeness in each other and ultimately unite with Spirit, that union is a true marriage between soul mates. Soul compan- ions, being primarily united in Spirit and love, find the ever new joy of God as the breath of their exis- tence. The more strongly they become united in Spirit the less they concentrate on sex life. Soul com- panions in perfect marriage—even if they have sex- ual union for the propagation of spiritual children to bring good souls to earth—have their minds primarily engaged and engrossed in the per- fect love of God. * See Discourses 2. and 7, explanation of the fall of Adam and Eve.

Being together in perfect love, they become united with God. Any so-called soul mates who have not yet extinguished their sexual appetites are not truly united as soul mates. A marriage that is very harmonious but without God-realization may be a moral marriage, an ideal socioreligious relationship on the hu- ma n level, but falls short of being an actual spiritual marriage between soul mates, the end of which is liberation in God. In his words to the Pharisees, Jesus automatically assumes that any tie between man and woman rightfully called marriage is to be primarily based on the spiritual laws of divine union. He meant that a mismated union—one in which man and woman come together principally for the satisfaction of lust—is not a real marriage as intended by God: a divine institution for propagation of the species and to offer ideal soul mates liberation into the spiritual world. Matrimony without a foundation of spiritual life is not true soul-marriage but chance union as exists in the animal kingdom. By indiscriminate opportunistic breeding, animals pro- duce perfectly good offspring and propagate their own kind; but the orig- inal marriage institution decreed by God for man—His special creation, above the animals, capable of expressing divinity—was formulated by the Divine Father of creation on a basis of spiritual love. A marriage without spiritual love remains on the level of Nature's law of animal union and cannot be termed a divine true marriage, a union of souls. The foregoing must be remembered in reading Jesus' words about divorce. Though it was permitted by the law of Moses, Jesus again em- phasizes that \"from the beginning it was not so.\" Spiritual meaning of Improper marriages and consequent separations Jesus' words about were not a part of God's original plan. Divinely en- adultery and divorce lightened beings of advanced vanished civilizations in higher ages, unknown to history, lived more nat- ural, spiritual lives in harmony with God's will. Men and women were mated rightly so there was no cause for or necessity of divorce. But with the decline of civilizations, in cosmic aeonic cycles of rising and falling, people became materially minded, due to the misuse of their will and reason. Owing to the impurity of their hearts, they could not draw unto themselves their rightful soul companions. This was the condition in Moses' time, for which he found it nec- essary to give the conditional law of divorcement as the means of sav- 1202"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"ing mismated wives from the tyranny of abusive husbands and to pro- tect husbands from their mismated cruel wives—specifically for either partner being guilty of fornication in mind or body. \"Fornication\" implies coition wherein partners are not married to each other. However, when Jesus said, \"Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery,\" he was speaking more specifically of true spiritual marriage, as described above. He meant: \"If any soul, having found and joined with a true spiritual soul companion according to the divine purpose of marriage, forsakes that mate under the influence of temptation and marries another for the satisfaction of lust, he or she breaks the law of holy union in God and is thrown into the pit of the sin of adultery with its karmic consequences.\" Ordinarily, persons go through a process of selection of compan- ions and the misery and trials of a wrong marriage or marriages until they spiritualize their consciousness sufficiently to attract a true soul companion. It is only after soul mates have come together in spiritual marriage—whether for the first marriage or after the experiences of untenable wrong marriages—that if they separate through sex temp- tations they commit adultery and foil the only purpose of all spiritual marriages: liberation in God by real matrimonial union. The very word \"adulterate\" means to debase, corrupt, or make impure. Great prophets warn against improper use of sex not because the procreative force is inherently evil—having become nature's way of propagating the species when man lost his spiritual creative power of direct materialization—but because when dissipated indiscrimi- nately it vitiates the heavenly soul consciousness and deludes man by identification with the sensual physical body and material world. Consequently, Jesus implies that when a man and woman have coition primarily to satisfy sexual instincts, it is, metaphysically speak- ing, \"fornication.\" The intended union of souls, the true mating, is forsaken to cohabit instead with the senses of the physical body—un- faithfulness to the true marriage partner, the soul, by lustful cohabita- tion with the body. The minds of the parties involved, being wholly concentrated on the sensual physical expulsion of life force, fall from the heavenly joy of spiritual union. The stronger the sex union, the more the disunion in Spirit. Adulterous union is diametrically opposed to the divine union of soul mates in spiritual marriage. In the state of consciousness from which Jesus was speaking, on the high esoteric 1203"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"plane of truth, marriages that are not spiritual marriages between ideal soul companions and in which sexual indulgence eclipses the higher goal are \"adulterous,\" and are to be spiritualized if a married man and woman are to find divorce-free lasting happiness and soul evolution together. Thus, socioreligious marriage alone does not free one from metaphysical adultery; but spiritual marriage, which has as its object a gradual rising above sexual impulses to lift up the consciousness and reenter the Eden of God-union, ultimately frees one from the \"origi- nal sin\" of the fall of Adam and Eve inherited by ensuing adulterous generations. This is neither to disparage the modern institution of marriage, nor to discourage the practice of its noble ideals as commonly under- stood in man's present state of evolution. Some structure of commitment sanctified by vows before God is not only commendable but essential to con- strain spiritually man's wayward inclinations. Com- paratively few beings are able to outstrip the snail pace of natural evolution and live ahead to the time when the commonality on earth will be a return to the lost Eden of di- vine consciousness. Nevertheless, Eternal Verities that were breathed forth in the pure ideas of God that informed the cosmos need to be reillumined from age to age, though their pristine character intrude without welcome on the mindset of a generation comfortable in its socially acceptable norms. Spiritual progress moves at a pace commensurate with man's willingness to displace effortless convenience of pleasurable impulses with higher aspirations. Absolutes light the way, though attainment be less than instant! Thus, Jesus' statements express the pure absolutes of God's ideal- ism in sending forth creation, extant in the beginning and in the high- est evolutionary spiritual cycles (referred to in Hindu scriptures as Satya Yuga—in which man again lives in his soul essence). But the ap- plicatio n of those absolutes, having devolved with the fall of man's consciousness, as noted by Jesus, requires in each age an interpretive code that, while highlighting and honoring immutable truth for those capable of such aspiration, acknowledges the current evolutionary stage of man's understanding and capacities. The Ten Commandments as expressed through Moses are an example of eternal spiritual laws adapted to assist man in regaining his lost pure divine consciousness Right interpretation of absolute truths for the present stage of human evolution 1204"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"of the soul. In obeying the \"Thou shalt not\" of physical adultery, man takes the requisite step of fealty that empowers his self-control toward the attainment ultimately of self-mastery, soul realization. Neither Jesus nor any other great master would expect celibacy from persons unprepared spiritually and emotionally for such lofty dis- cipline (Jesus speaks of this discipline in the verses that follow).* Wise counsel is rather that of gradual overall sublimation of physical con- sciousness, including sex, into spiritual consciousness through daily practice of scientific methods of meditation along with cultivation of pure soul qualities. In marriage, spiritual aspirants should observe mod- eration in physical relations, and above all the culture of a spirit of love, service, loyalty, and divine friendship between husband and wife. The spiritual purpose of family life is to expand one's conscious- ness through cultivation of purifying divine love and friendship that is not conditioned by sex or any selfish motivation. In • • marital coition, love should be uppermost. In time, Ideals for a spiritually as real love is cultivated, sex consciousness will harmonious marriage wane naturally, replaced by the supreme joy of soul bliss and communion. When love, respect, and friendship are upper- most, the relationship will be successful and will progress surely to- ward fulfillment of the high divine purpose of marriage. To love one's spouse with the pure love of God, and to share a marriage blessed by self-control through mental development, and to create spiritual children, is a noble way to live. To be drowned by ma- terial cares, weariness, overwork, greed for money, overindulgence in amusements , buying more things, and slaving for more money and saving no time for God leads marriage partners to the misery kingdom of Satan. A happy, contented, simple, harmonious married life of self- control and meditation leads them to God. Success in marriage is very difficult if partners expect too much fro m their spouses. When each demands fulfillment from the other and that demand is not met, they become enemies. That is why I be- lieve that a lasting and fulfilling marriage is in most cases impossible without spirituality—without a mutual effort to seek satisfaction of the soul's yearning for perfect love and the joy of fulfillment where alone it can be found: God-communion. *See commentary on pages 12.10 ff. regarding Jesus' words on those who \"have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.\" 1205"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"The animal instinct of uncontrolled sexual appetites is the chief reason for failure of modern marriages.

Errors in choosing matrimonial candidates, divorces, and multiple marriages are frantic misguided efforts arising from the soul's pure de- sire to find one's real life companion. Selfishness, lust, physical attrac- tion, external beauty, financial lure in marriage, animal magnetism of the opposite sexes—these are the evil forces that misdirect a person from traveling in the right path that leads to the discovery of a proper soul companion.

I know one very famous lady who was persuaded by her parents in her younger days to marry a man whom they incorrectly thought would be a good husband for her. But he wasted all her money and was lustful and never lived up to the vows of matrimony. One day in a spate of temper he tried to hit her with an uplifted chair. In the strength of divine innocence she fixed the spiritual power of her gaze deep into the personality of her husband and saw him for what he was, and that she was united to a wicked person. In a firm voice she said, \"I recognize you now; get out.\" The upraised hands of the hus- band froze; he dropped the chair and ran out of the home, in utmost dread and fear, never to return again. He could not stand the pene- trating magnetic spiritual vibrations of the wife. Long afterward, this lady developed greatly in spirituality and at- tracted an ideal soul companion. By my protracted observations I found that their marriage was a real union between soul mates. After temporarily living on the sexual plane, they have for years been living on the plane of love and spiritual communion, absolutely without sex relations. Every day they are as eager to see each other as though newly married; and when they come together they feel in their unity the God within them. I am certain that Jesus would not have condemned this just divorce, and would have blessed her spiritual remarriage. However, the truth about spiritual marriages and soul compan- ions—that in every man and woman there is a pattern whose coun- terpart exists somewhere in another person—should not be abused by anyone. Lustful individuals indulge and consequently stimulate their sex consciousness by seeking new sexual companions—often under the guise of searching for their soul mates. Such persons even discover \"soul mates\" in the alleys, saloons, and dance halls of questionable re- pute. The instinctive desire to find the perfect soul companion, being heaven-born, can never be satisfied by any amount of lustful experi- ences. Promiscuity is disgraceful and degrading to the pure image of God in man's soul. As the fulfillment of the union of soul mates is spiritual and not physical, the consummation does not necessarily require the coming to- gether in a marriage partnership on the material plane. Sometimes even a chance meeting between soul mates fills one with a sense of com- pleteness and pure love that wholly vanquishes all sense of need for 1207"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"physical union. This is true of relationships that have evolved through past lives as soul helpmates. One such instance was brought about by the intercession of my guru, Sri Yukteswarji. A man tormented with debauched desires sought the help of Master.

There was a train on the siding in which a beautiful girl was sitting at one of the win- dows. Master exclaimed to the man, \"There she is, the one you have been seeking. Look at her!\" The man was transfixed in an emotion of joy. From that time on, he led a saintly life devoted to God. Soul mates living on different parts of the earth, or even if one is on earth and the other in the astral world, may come together in a liberat- ing union of God's love. The ideal man or woman who does not live on the sexual plane develops a spiritual magnetism by which he or she can attract the right soul mate on the earth plane or the dream plane or as- tral plane or the plane of conscious visions experienced in deep medita- tion. In the meeting of one's soul mate by whatever means, there will be n o further desire to live according to worldly norms on the material plane. The reunion of masculine-feminine, positive-negative, reason and feeling, brings forth the immutable image of God in the soul. There is no necessity for physical marriage at all. It will be consummated right within one's heart. There is an even higher way of fulfillment than spiritual union of sou l companions on the physical plane: union with God by divine —— communion in meditation and ecstasy. Seeking soul Highest form of \"spir- liberation through union with a soul mate is a spir- itual marriage\": union itually dangerous course for those who are not al- of the soul with Spirit ready advanced in wisdom, for temptation may cause them to sink into the delusion of wrong liv- ing that will take them away from God into the karmic bondage of further reincarnations. But once the soul of man or woman is united with God, the Consummate Soul Mate, that soul never can fall from liberation. This is why Jesus, Swami Shankara, and other saviors have shown this highest path of liberation by uniting their souls directly with God alone. This method of perfection and matrimony with God is the holiest marriage, between soul and Spirit, where God is the Divine Beloved, positive and masculine, and all human souls are negative and femi- nine, beloved spouses of God. This concept is posited on the duality 1208"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"of the cosmic creative principle: Spirit and Nature. Spirit, being the source and upholder of manifestation, is the Positive Masculine Ab- solute, whose active creativity is His outgoing Negative Feminine Power, Nature, of which all incarnate souls are a part. Together, Pos- itiv e Spirit and Negative Nature with their offspring of masculine and feminine forms and forces propagate the grand universal scheme. Essentially, therefore, we are all the brides of God. He is the Di- vine Lover perpetually wed to every soul, never forsaking any soul though it forsake Him in its adulterous roaming in delusion. God as the Perfect Lover pursues each soul through incarnations until it re- turns to Him. Of all the love that has ever been promised, pure love, love that is eternal, is found at last in God. He is all the love of all the lovers that ever loved. When the soul meets Him, it knows He is the One it was waiting to meet. If one lives rightly and learns the higher forms of meditation, one develops the spiritual magnetism that neutralizes the animal magne- tism of the physical body. With freedom from the \"original sin\" of sex attraction, one finds the true soul mate in a spiritual marriage on earth, or in a dream or vision, or in the astral world; or supremely, in direct union with God. The love and friendship with the Divine culti- vated in the bower of meditation can never be lost. It shall last beyond th e portals of the tomb unto Eternity. The full implication of the words of Jesus, an impossible view for body-bound spiritually nearsighted persons, is best understood by those who meditate deeply and merge their concentration in the Christ Consciousness which Jesus possessed. Otherwise, much truth is lost in misinterpretation, mistranslation, or shallow cognition. His disciples say unto him, \"If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.\" But he said unto them, \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given. For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eu- nuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.

Anyone who is worthy and able to understand this precept, let him follow it and he will find the kingdom of God.\" After alluding to the original ideal of spiritual marriage (for at- taining soul union and perfect love in God as one means of liberation for worldly people), Jesus goes on to commend those men and women who completely renounce the husband-wife relationship of marriage and seek direct union with God through the self-mastery of celibacy. A man or woman, singly, by completely renouncing sex pleasure and practicing those spiritual disciplines that unite the soul with God, finds perfect divine love and liberation in that consummate union. In linking celibacy with the attainment of the kingdom of God, Jesus em- phasizes that the consciousness of sex must be sublimated by all peo- ple, married as well as celibate, in order to free the life force from this compelling impulse that binds the consciousness to the physical body. Spiritual eunuchs are those who withdraw their will, energy, desire, and sex force completely from the sex nerves by proper methods of natural sublimation, such as yoga, so that they no longer feel any over- bearing physical impulse of sex. Spiritual eunuchs are not those who maim their sex power and become eunuchs because of impotency, but are those who attain self-mastery by such means as daily meditation and ecstasy and thereby never permit sexual desires to rouse their physical sex nerves. All persons may learn to govern sex urge by wisdom, the pure in- tuitive intelligence that discriminates in guiding the will to choose the liberating bliss of Spirit \"for the kingdom of heaven's sake\" instead of the enslaving sensual pleasure of the gross physical body.

Or during the appearance of sex conscious- ness in the body, one may sublimate that force into great mental power by concentratedly engaging the attention in creative work, such as writing or music or art. Or the wayward sex force may be used pro- pitiously to create the spiritual power of self-control, mastery of body consciousness, by being transmuted in meditation—the taintless life force then being absorbed in the higher states of consciousness in the subtle centers in the spine and brain.* Jesus himself embraced a life of celibacy, never allowing intrusion of the pleasures of the flesh that would pull his consciousness from its seat in the inner kingdom of God. The Order of Swamis in India also emphasizes the renouncement of sex consciousness for the attainment of the everlasting joy of Cosmic Consciousness. When I asked my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, to make me a swami, he tested my resolve and asked my reasons for not marrying. I thought of a lot of reasons; but principally I some- - • how felt I had outgrown it—I could not allot God Those who renounce a secondary place in my life. Master spoke of the family life should give many who renounce the world and lead selfish lives unselfish service to dependent on society to look after them while of- society fering nothing in return. Married people, he said, have to renounce much in sacrifice for each other and responsibility for the welfare of their families. The family unit is a micro-organization in which all must do their part. The world itself could not go on if every- one were selfish and did not participate in the services essential to the 'Medical doctors consider it a well-established fact that replenishing the seminal fluid, a concentration of vital bodily elements, requires a significant expenditure of physical energy; and that the body will reabsorb the constituent vital materials if they are con- served in the body rather than dissipated outwardly, making their inherent energy avail- able for other purposes. The pranayama techniques integral to yoga (taught as part of the science of Kriya Yoga in the Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons) automatically in- duce the process of transmutation of the conserved energy into pure life force and con- sciousness for awakening of the higher centers of consciousness in the spine and brain. One of the basic disciplines of Patanjali's Eightfold Path of Yoga is brahmacharya (self- restraint); yoga treatises refer to the successful celibate brahmachari as urdhvareta (lit- erally, \"keeping the semen upward\"), one in whom the physical reproductive fluid is converted into pure conscious life force, bestowing bodily strength, immense creative intelligence , and spiritual magnetism.

After Master had made these points, he concluded, \"Remember that he who rejects the usual worldly duties can justify himself only by assuming some kind of responsibility for a much larger family.\" I started with a residential school that quickly grew into a family of three hundred children. I cared for them as father-mother-friend- spiritual instructor. I was on call to their needs day and night. I had never imagined in all my dreams what our parents go through for us. The mother sleeps just a little bit; and then the baby wakes up and cries, and the mother has to renounce her need for rest to respond. With what patience and tender love most of our mothers have raised us, and the sacrifices our fathers made to support us. We do not real- ize that until we have children of our own. If we do not choose fam- ily life, that does not condone a selfish existence. Those who are sin- gle can work out their evolution by extending their interests in service to others among God's children. The propagation of the species means not only to give birth through one's own body, but to leave in others something of one's nobler ideals and example—just as it is the duty of parents to instill the better part of themselves in their children. The teacher does likewise; he leaves to posterity his thoughts and ideas propagated in others. An exemplary life of service and love for God is a divine inheritance bequeathed to the world. The privilege of life God has given to us bears with it a great re- sponsibility. I well understood what this entailed when I identified my life with caring for the children of my How-to-Live School. They metaphorically took half of my life; half of my salvation I had to give to them. Now with the many souls God has sent into my large world family, I save nothing for myself. My gain is in my loss for others, be- cause they are my own self. This is the way to liberate oneself in un- married life, uniting feeling and reason—love and will — by giving oneself to others, just as Jesus did. For those who are able to receive Jesus' edict to remain unmarried \"for the kingdom of heaven's sake,\" service to humanity is their work. Their obligation is to be even more busy than are family members in their compact unit of society. By God-contact in meditation and selfless service that gives birth in others to some of one's noblest ideas, one not only unites feeling and reason in oneself, but cultures in one's expanded family of spiri- tual children, feeling to balance the reason in men, and reason to bal- ance the feeling in women.

That is detri- on the spiritual path mental to the nervous system and weakens the vi- tality and immune system in the body. Spiritually, it is impossible to lift the consciousness into the kingdom of heaven, the Eden of the higher centers of God-perception, without raising the life force from the lower spinal centers of sensual compulsions. Mastery in the marital state begins with moderation and self- control and the joyous contact with God in meditation. Hypocritical renunciation, attempted abstinence by the sense-tortured individual, is unnatural, even harmful; that is why Saint Paul said: \"It is better to marry than to burn.\"* Moderation in married life, supported by tast- ing of the Infinite Bliss of deep meditation and the unconditioned di- vine love of God in the soul, transmutes the consciousness in a natural way. When the joy of God, felt in meditation with stillness of breath, remains continuously in the soul, then the physical temptation vanishes forever through contrast: The joy in God becomes more tempting than all temptations. One can even love husband or wife with the love of God and not love of flesh, as did Lahiri Mahasaya (my Guru's Guru). His marriage was to show people how the consciousness of God can tame temptation and how God's love can spiritualize and transmute conjugal love. When one is irrevocably established in union with Di- vine Bliss, that consciousness can exist under all conditions of life. Real freedom can be accomplished in no other way.

Children were placed under qualified masters who taught them how to live by truth and self-control. At maturity, even if they then decided to marry, they maintained practice of those soul qualities as applied to marriage and householder responsibilities, never allow- ing their material life to bring them down from heaven. They married for love, and their souls entered into an ideal life. When their family duties had been met, with their own children settled in life, the par- ents retired to a forest hermitage or other place of spiritual seclusion for meditation; many also gave of themselves in service to humanity. In a God-centered life there is liberation. Adults should learn by their own and society's mistakes and help children to understand and observe the spiritual purpose of marriage and the creative sex force. They are taught mathematics, history, lit- eracy, but academic education does not give them the art and science of discriminative behavior and self-control of sex. That should be taught in the schools everywhere and exemplified in the home. Out of such training and influences, ideal people will come. When spiritual marriage of soul union in God is understood and cultured in unmarried or married life, sex is so completely and naturally sublimated in a greater joy of divine love that man and woman become again as \"little children...for of such is the kingdom of heaven.\" Pure reason (Adam) and pure feeling (Eve) reunite in soul consciousness in union with the Will (reason) and Consciousness (feeling) that went out of God to create man and woman. The two are no longer so differ- entiated; in liberation from bodily identification, they are perfect chil- dren of God, made in the one and same immortal image of their Divine Creator.* * Cf. Gospel of Thomas, verse 22: \"Jesus saw infants being suckled. He said to his dis- ciples, 'These infants being suckled are like those who enter the kingdom.' They said to him, 'Shall we, then, as children, enter the kingdom?' Jesus said to them, 'When you make the two one, and when you make the inside like the outside and the outside like th e inside, and the above like the below, and when you make the male and female one and the same, so that the male will not be male nor the female be female....then you will enter [the kingdom].'\"—J.

Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed. And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third like- wise. And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also. In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? For the seven had her to wife.\" And Jesus answering said unto them, \"Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven. And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, 7 am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err\" (Mark 12:18-27). * J esus chided the Sadducees for having made a rudimentary blunder by mixing earthly edicts with heavenly experiences. They under- stood neither the scriptures they quoted nor the transcendent power and wisdom of God, and so their assumption was faulty in trying to link earthly with heavenly matters. Physical marriage practiced in this world is meant for the self-controlled propagation of the species and for assisting one another to learn the selflessness of love in faithfulness, giving, and shar- ing; and for the advanced few, it is one means of soul union for liberation after finding the perfect love of God by in- tense spiritual discipline, sexual sublimation, and meditation. Couples learn many lessons in the marriage partnership, such as uniting feel- ing and reason (positive and negative) to make two flesh as one through mutual respect and unselfish cooperation.

Hence, the physical discipline of marriage—or even divine seeking in meditation is wholly unnecessary for those souls who have become immortals in \"heaven.\" When the fruit comes, the flower falls. Human experi- ences of marriage, love, success, study, meditation, exercise, discipline, all are necessary to produce the fruit of Self-realization. But when en- lightenment is attained, and subsequently liberation, all human expe- riences in the realm of delusion, having served their purpose, are no more. Every liberated soul in heaven is married to God. Hence there can be no question of physical marriage for those souls who are complete and perfect in their union with the eternal love of God—the One Per- fect Soul Mate. Souls liberated from earthly ties and promoted to live in the finer vibration of the astral heaven enjoy that sphere with exquisitely re- fined astral sensibilities. They are able to create according to their slightest desire any object, scene, or luminous atmospheric condition by the sheer exercise of their will. Through the powers of their supra- mental astral bodies they can materialize other astral bodies by will power. Only on the earth plane is sexual union a requisite for physi- cal birth. In the heaven of liberated souls, all have the same spiritual status—immortality—and are equal in the eyes of God. Jesus was cer- tainly speaking of these supremely resurrected beings when he said they \"are as the angels which are in heaven.\" Of the other many souls in the various regions of heaven, or the astral world, they are there only temporarily to rest awhile before re- turning to earth's disciplinary experiences to continue the struggle for liberation. For example, the hypothetical woman mentioned in the question posed by the Sadducees — a childless widow of the seven brothers—would in the astral world be a sexless soul with an astral body, and thus she could not be the wife of any one man there. Indeed, throughout her numerous earth incarnations she no doubt would have been the wife of many, many husbands (or even a husband herself in some incarnations as a man!). If during her earth life this widow had not found spiritual emancipation, then, after a karmically predeter- mined respite in the after-death state, she would have to reincarnate on earth, most likely as a woman. She would have a fresh opportunity to live rightly, perhaps to find the perfect love of God and liberation 1217"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"with the aid of a soul companion, or in direct union with God through concentrated spiritual endeavor. The souls of all men and women in reality belong to God alone — in spite of certain spiritual affinities between soul companions. Hence, in the after-death astral state, the souls of men and women are reminded of their sexless immortality; \"marriage,\" with all its mortal connotations, becomes impossible there. Nevertheless, souls who are deeply in love with each other or who share bonds of pure friendship during their stay on the earth plane will recognize each other and con- tinue to feel the love and divine friendship imprinted on their souls, even in the astral world after death. It is said that the Sadducees were especially antagonistic toward the doctrine of resurrection preached by Jesus. He put forth the argu- ment that all things coming out of the living God must themselves be \"living,\" even after so-called death. When souls pass through the por- tals of physical death, they merely change place and form, resurrected into that new existence. Jesus tried to make the Sadducees understand that as the prophets such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, are not dead but living in God, so all souls who pass from this world are everlasting in the ever-living God, either in heaven or in reincarnated forms on earth. Souls cannot die. Jesus reminded the priests that the book of Moses relates how God vibrated His presence as the ever-burning light of wisdom ignit- ing the bush of ignorance in the consciousness of Moses.

Divin e laws bequeathed to humanity as the foundation principles of all true religions—such as the Ten Commandments conveyed by Moses and cited in part here by Jesus, or the yama-niyama principles enumerated by Patanjali in the Yoga Su- tras —are not arbitrary edicts of a Cosmic Auto- crat. They are given to enable man to live in this world of cosmic delusion and satanic temptation as God's child, manifesting His im- age of divine qualities, rather than being helplessly identified with the flesh and its capricious senses, which are subject to delusive evil.

It is behavior governed by th e recognition of the One Life omnipresent in all beings. It is the in- spiration to be helpful and serviceful to others, without which one is tacitly, in some way, doing harm to them by such omission. Murder is highlighte d as a heinous form of injury, a mortal offense to the In- dwelling Spirit. Murder is committed through identification with greed, selfishness, anger—all of which are satanic qualities and de- stro y the consciousness of soul peace. To kill is to perpetuate the evil example of killing, inviting wrath and impulses of murderous revenge from the relatives and friends of the victim and the aggregate social conscience. To kill is to destroy the God-created temple of life be- longing to the soul. A life cut short deprives man of the karmic learn- ing experiences by which the soul can expand its influence and spiri- tualize the temple of life to find God therein. It is a cruelty that inflicts great suffering on a brother soul. Such cruelty to others creates an alienation between the perpetrator and God. \"Thou shalt not commit adultery\" is elevated by Patanjali to its purest connotation as brahmacharya, \"continence, self-restraint.\" Pro- miscuous behavior, in or out of wedlock, is abuse of Nature's sacred creative force, limiting the consciousness to identification with the physical body with loss of the consciousness of the soul's transcendent omnipresence. \"Thou shalt not steal\" is closely allied to another of the Ten Com- mandments, \"Thou shalt not covet...anything that is thy neighbour's.\" Corresponding to these are Patanjali's proscriptions of asteya, refer- ring to any form of misappropriation; and aparigraha, \"noncovetous- ness\"—absence of greed and possessiveness. Far from enriching one's life, acquisitions obtained through stealing and greed develop an ex- treme impoverishment of selfishness and loss of the consciousness of all-possession that comes from the inner assurance of divine contact. Misbegotten, covetous acquisitions, be they of money, property, repu- tation , friends, or someone else's husband or wife, inflicts misery on * See also reference to niyama, the prescriptive practices necessary to the spiritual life linked by Patanjali to the prescriptive practices of yama (Discourse 61). 1228"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"others; one who causes grief to another excludes himself from the ever joyous aura of God's presence. \"Thou shalt not bear false witness,\" and \"Defraud not\" (added in the account of Mark), are tantamount to Patanjali's satya, \"truth- fulness,\" avoidance of falsehood in all of its aspects. Bearing false wit- ness develops spiritual blindness with loss of intuitive perception of truth. Defrauding develops mental insincerity, which obtrudes itself as a veil between human consciousness and divine consciousness. Fact may bear little relationship to truth. Truth is exact correspondence with reality, unconditioned by the imposition of man's attenuating suppositions or rationalized motives. To know truth, man must begin by purifying his discrimination, purging himself of deviousness and egoistic rationalizations and schemes. \"Honor thy father and thy mother\" and \"Love thy neighbor as thyself\" are umbrellaed under the realization that recognizes the One who has become the many. \"With a vision of equality for all things, the yogi beholds his Self (Spirit-united) in all creatures and all crea- tures in the Spirit....The best type of yogi is he who feels for others, whether in grief or pleasure, even as he feels for himself.\"* One who honors father and mother honors in them the presence of the Divine Father-Mother, who protects and nurtures the child by manifesting as reason and feeling in the physical forms of the human parents. Expansion of love beyond the confines of self-centeredness begins with family—the role of parents provides the initial instinctive introduction to reaching outside of oneself. One who can then love his neighbors—human beings, birds, an- imals, flowers, every living thing existing in the neighborhood of the Self, his soul—as expressions of God feels the Divine Presence in them all. To love these expressions of the One Life as one loves the Self is to know the presence of the Infinite Self, the Spirit, as all-pervasive. He whose love contracts in divisive self-interest shuts out of his con- sciousness the universal consciousness of God. He whose mind is pre- pared to love his fellow beings as he loves himself experiences the joy of feeling his little self expanding in the omnipresence of God.

Religious efforts that encompass these rudi- ments may produce a measure of inner peace and good karma, and are doubtless far better for a person than flouting the do's and don'ts altogether. But full awakening of man's divine consciousness requires a deeper discipline for refining and spiritualizing the soul's body-mind vehicle with its karmic accumulation of psychological and emotional tendencies, habits, and desires.t Jesus analyzed the young man who had obeyed the command- ments yet lacked God-consciousness: he was in bondage to materialis- tic attachments. Jesus counseled him, succinctly and \"Take up the cross\": candidly: \"Sell whatever thou hast\" and \"take up the practice of inner the cross\" — adopt the liberating attitude of inner renunciation, self- renunciation and those methods of self-discipline discipline, and and meditation that free the mind from bondage to nonattachment body and possessions; \"and follow me\" — follow the path my consciousness has taken through the door of the spiritual eye into Christ Consciousness, that you may join me in God's kingdom of everlasting life and bliss. * Indeed, it is the higher disciplines of yoga that make possible for the average person a n effective and lasting practice of moral observances, not by outer suppression of harmful impulses but by inner transmutation. See Discourse 48, yogic explanation of Jesus' moral admonitions in Matthew 18:8-9: \"If thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off....And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee.\" f \"Free from ever-hoping desires and from cravings for possessions, with the heart (waves of feeling) controlled by the soul (by yoga concentration), retiring alone to a quiet place, the yogi should constantly try to unite with the soul.... \"Established on that seat, concentrating the mind on one point, and controlling the activities of the fanciful faculty ( chitta, feeling—the power that visualizes) and the senses, let him practice yoga for self-purification\" (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bha- gavad Gita vi: 10, 11). 1230"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"Though he was morally upright, the young man's attachment to his earthly treasures precluded acceptance of Jesus' admonition: \"He was sad at this saying, and went away grieved.\" Jesus then explained to his dis- ciples: \"Those who are satisfied with temporal pleasures feel no incli- nation to seek the subtle everlasting happiness of God-consciousness.\"* He pointed out that materially minded rich persons who identify their souls with idle habits of indulgences find their wonted ways obstructing the cultivation of spiritual habits. Even as a camel cannot go through the eye of a needle, so \"spoiled aristocrats\" inured to restlessness-producing luxuries and extravagances are unmotivated, and find it difficult, if not impossible, to quiet the mind and focus it within for God-contact in med- itative calmness.f The more hedonistic one's habits are, the less sensitive one is to God-consciousness; the more one develops God-consciousness, the fewer materialistic habits remain. Attachment to wealth consists of not being able to live simply and contentedly without the luxurious surroundings and accoutrements that cater to self-indulgent desires and pleasures. However, merely be- cause one lives in a palatial residence among material comforts does not necessarily imply dependence on them. It is not the possessions of a rich man that destroy his God-consciousness, but his mental en- slavement of being possessed by his possessions. Jesus condemned the material habits of the rich man and not his wealth per se, for there are persons who have been blessed with prosperity who serve as examples of true seekers of God-consciousness, and who with Christlike com- passion help to relieve the miseries of others. They utilize their good fortune in the right way. Jesus used the term \"rich man\" to indicate a person who is de- luded with an inflated sense of possession when in reality he is but a debtor, a recipient of a temporary loan from God's cosmic treasury. It is when a person of wealth becomes so intoxicated with his temporal power that he forgets to acquire the imperishable riches of divine at- tainment that he is to be censured. Pride of possession, as well as the presumption of security it produces, is foolish, as even the most might- ily endowed discover when all is taken away by death, if not sooner. * See also Discourse 33, commentary on Luke 6:2.4: \"But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.\" fSee also Discourses 29 and 59, commentary on Matthew 6:24 and Luke 16:13: \"Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\" 1231"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"He is truly rich who owns everlastingly the full realization of his soul qualities of immortality, divine bliss, omniscience, and omnipres- ence.

A close observation of the habits of most materially enhanced per- sons makes it is easy to understand why Jesus spoke as he did. Too of- ten they are perpetually busy thinking of money and acquisitions, no matter how much they have, and devising new avenues of physical en- joyment. It is next to impossible to concentrate on God in meditation and prayer when excitement-addicted thoughts constantly waver and flit toward the numerous allurements available to them. Yet Jesus also gives assurance that regardless of what is seemingly impossible, \"with God all things are possible.\" Materially minded per- sons—those who possess little as well as those who possess much— whose bad habits and slavish engrossment in worldly temptations make them despair of ever finding God must remember: With the help of Him who is almighty, they can and will pass through the gate to the divine kingdom — provided they seek that help through repentance and perseverance in meditation.

And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them, \"Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again\" (Matthew 20:17-19).

They shall condemn it to death; and they shall deliver it to the Gentiles who shall mock my presence, scourge my physical body, spit on it, and ultimately crucify it. But on the third day, after freeing my spirit from the threefold karmic imperatives that held it incarnate in its physical, astral, and causal bodies, my physical body will be spiri- tualized by divine energy and resurrected.\" Jesus mentions for the first time to his disciples the predictions of earlier prophets about his future life. For centuries, God-knowing prophets of Israel had intimated Jesus' life and mission as a messiah or savior of his people, and had foretold that he would be put to death as recompense for the sins of many.I The prophets could foresee the mass karmic evolution of the future, unto the advent of the incarnation of Jesus. The circumstances of that future era, and the effect it would have on the coeval timely appearance of a messiah with a message of liberation into the kingdom of God, formed a pattern of eventuality that could be clearly read by the prophets and keenly known by the intuitive Christ-perception of Jesus. *Cf. additional parallel reference in Mark 10:32-34. fFor example, Isaiah 53:3-8: \"He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief....He was wounded for'our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed....He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shal l declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.\" See also Discourse 10, commentary on John 1:44-51; and Discourse 22, com- mentary on Matthew 4:12-17. 6 6 7TT) ehold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all pre- J1 Ddictions that have been made by the prophets concerning my physical body —in which the Christ Consciousness is encased—will come to pass.

Sometimes the masters speak of it to others; some- times they do not. Jesus had been liberated long before his advent in that incarnation; he came as a special messenger of the Heavenly Fa- ther and to give demonstrative evidence of an exemplary life on earth. As his mission was ofttimes contrary to the political and socioreligious laws and traditions of his times, Jesus saw how the karmic law of ac- tion and its effects would mandate his crucifixion; he also foresaw his God-ordained glorious resurrection. Thus the Father permitted him to reveal these events to his disciples. Though the import of his words \"was hid from them\" at the time, their truth would echo as the fore- told events were made manifest. It is significant that Jesus did not say \"the Son of God shall be de- livered.\" \"Son of man\" referred to his human body; his God-united Christ consciousness (\"Son of God\"), being immortal and invulnera- ble, was subject to no such iniquity. And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature. And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, \"Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for today I must abide at thy house.\" And he made haste, and came down, and received him joy- fully. And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: \"Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, 1 restore him fourfold.\" 'John 2:18-22 (see commentary in Discourse 12). 1240"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"And Jesus said unto him, \"This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham. For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost\" (Luke 19:1-10). A s Jesus passed through the crowds in Jericho, he telepathically felt the eager soul-call of Zacchaeus striking a responsive chord in his heart. This seemingly unlikely but fortuitous encounter illus- trates Jesus' former statement: \"No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.\"* Even as Zacchaeus was anx- ious to meet Jesus, so the Christ Consciousness in Jesus was respond- ing to this pure-hearted seeker in fulfillment of the inward promptings of the Heavenly Father: \"Zacchaeus, I recognize your thoughts about me. Now make haste in coming down from the tree, for it is the wish of the Father that I come to your home.\" Jesus plainly declared to Zacchaeus, \"This day salvation is come to this house....for the Son of man has come to seek and to save that whic h was lost.\" He signified that Zacchaeus and his family members wer e worthy descendents of Abraham, devoted children of God, who through some delusion had been lost in the deserts of incarnations; and that now, through divine decree, he had been sent as their God- chosen guru-savior to deliver them from further blind wanderings to spiritual emancipation. And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear. He said therefore, \"A certain nobleman went into a far coun- try to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, f and said unto them, 'Occupy till I come' But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, 'We will not have this man to reign over us.'

And he said likewise to him, 'Be thou also over five cities.' \"And another came, saying, 'Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.' And he saith unto him, 'Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked ser- vant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow: Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?' \"And he said unto them that stood by, 'Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.' (And they said unto him, 'Lord, he hath ten pounds.') 'For I say unto you, that unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him. But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.'\"* And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem (Luke 19:11-28). ^T^his parable was to disabuse the people of the false notion that iL the kingdom of God of which Jesus spoke would be established by him as a sovereign realm on earth. Jesus admonished that God's kingdom would be built within themselves by their realizing their soul potentials through the proper use of the spiritual endowment he had given to them in his teachings. Soon he would be absent from them in body, working elsewhere for the liberation of souls; but when in Christ Consciousness he \"returned\" in Spirit, he would judge their endeav- \"•Cf.

Some would wisely earn their spiritual rewards, others would by thei r sloth forfeit the grace that had been offered to them to advance in all-fulfilling Self-realization.   ——   The parable thus interpreted is as follows: Parable of the ten \"A master, born on earth to redeem many souls, pounds: proper use had ten devotees in his hermitage. He summoned the spiritual wealth them one day to say that he was going to preach his a master's teachings message to another group, a materialistic people who lived in delusion, far from truth. The master declared that after he had established his soul teachings in that distant kingdom, he would return to the hermitage. He instructed his disciples to follow strictly the moral and spiritual precepts and commandments, and to keep their consciousness engaged with the holy vibrations of peace permeating the hermitage. With a wealth of blessings, symbolized by a parting gesture of the ten pounds, he left. He knew his disciples would meet with many temptations during his absence, because the worldly people of the city in which the master had his hermitage were scornful of his ideals. They even sent to the master after his departure a message of derision, hop- ing he would not return. \"But after some time, he appeared again at the hermitage and ex- amined the state of spiritual health of his disciples. He found one of them to be far advanced, tenfold. The master said: 'Thou hast been a good disciple, improving thyself and others. Because of thy faithful- ness to truth and discipline, thou wilt become master over ten spheres of divine powers.' \"The master observed that another disciple had also grown in spiritual stature, fivefold. In praise, the master said, 'Thou wilt come into possession of five spiritual powers.' \"The master was grieved to note that another disciple had made no spiritual progress. As an excuse, the disciple said: 'I have not for- gotten your disciplines and technique of meditation which you left with me, but I have kept them unused, secure within myself. I was afraid I could never be austere and strict like yourself. I thought I could not as- pire to reach your high state of spiritual eminence in which, without observing the human law of cause and effect—endeavor for rewards —you are able to acquire everything by your will power.' \"The master was displeased and said: 'I will judge you by your own words. You know in your heart that it was by great austerities that I have attained this state of transcendence above the ordinary 1243"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"laws of nature. My methods of discipline, though difficult, would have brought you great results if you had followed them as I instructed you. Even if you had mechanically practiced them, they would have circu- lated deep into the bank of your subconscious mind and would thus have yielded you—and consequently me, as your teacher and well- wisher—an increase in spiritual experience.' \"The master then said to the assembled group: 'Behold this dis- obedient disciple; because of his mental folly, he did not stimulate his spiritual desire by my methods of discipline. Therefore, what little spirituality he ever had is going away from him, due to the enlarging strength of bad habits. On the other hand, my beloved disciple who has broadened tenfold his spiritual capacity will receive from me the additional spiritual wealth I would otherwise have been able to bestow on this erring one, for whom I can now do nothing. For I say unto you: Every disciple of truth who has acquired spiritual habits by deep meditation and self-discipline shall attract unto himself more and more spirituality; but the disciple who is irregular and neglectful shall lose what little spiritual power he starts with; it will wither away through lack of nurturing.'\" Jesus illustrates in this parable the great force of habit. A person who possesses good habits, and practices those habits in his life, will • • • attract unto himself even more goodness; while a The immense power person who has a latent tendency toward virtue, of good and bad and does not encourage it by daily acts of goodness, habits to elevate or de- will find in time that he loses that inner incentive to grade one's life become good. Similarly, if a person has evil habits, he will create an exclusive taste for the temporary pleasures of sense-attachment; and the more he indulges his sensuous tastes, the more his evil habit will grow upon him. With the increase of evil habits, he will attract abundant evil experiences unto himself. But if a person has an evil tendency and does not care to feed that in- clination with further acts of the temporary pleasures of evil, then he will find in time that his evil tendency has disappeared.* While stressing the spiritual application of the attracting power of habit, Jesus used in metaphor one of man's most common longings— the desire for financial security. Whether one is seeking God, the bet- *See also Discourse 37, commentary on Matthew 13:12 in which Jesus repeats this saying . 1244"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"terment of oneself, or the abundance of material prosperity, the fol- lowing analysis will illustrate the paramount importance and influence of the law of habit: A wealthy person, having made habitual those actions that bring financial success, will attract, by fresh acts of creative ability, more riches unto himself. But a person with a latent conviction that he could be financially successful, and who has a little money but who cares not to buttress his optimistic outlook by daily acts of creative financial ef- fort, will lose even the little financial means he has as well as his in- ner conviction that he can succeed. Jesus' words do not mean that only those who have riches will grow richer and that the poor will become ever more destitute. The law of karma governs all departments of life. A person who (owing to past good karma) is born wealthy, and has the tendency and inborn conviction of prosperity, will attract more riches in this incarnation because of two reasons: (i) his prenatal habits of financial success stimulating his will to succeed, (i) his exercise of free will and deter- mination in further success-producing actions in this life. Many people who are very creative and are determined to succeed financially nevertheless do not do so because in this life their financial- failure karma of past incarnations has placed them in circumstances not conducive to prosperity. Some are born in this life with a power- ful determination to succeed financially because of failure in their pre- vious life. Such persons achieve prosperity after a long struggle, dur- ing which their latent prenatal habits of financial failure and past poverty-karma are overcome. Therefore, a person who is poor in spite of many attempts to succeed must continuously make greater efforts for financial success, so that he can overcome the influences of a la- ten t poverty consciousness carried from a prenatal existence. This same principle is to be applied by all spiritual seekers of the kingdom of God. If a person meditates regularly and consistently and still does not attain Self-realization, he should realize that—owing to past karma of failure to create and sustain successful habits of medi- tating in past lives—his determination to succeed in meditation has to be newly created in this life, perhaps stimulated only when he en- counters some misery. Therefore, instead of giving up the practice as impossible, he should apply himself to deeper and deeper endeavor un- til the meditation habit is firmly established and begins to bestow the joyous experiences of Self-realization. These will create in him even 1245"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"stronger habits of meditation, which in turn will attract abundant ever new bliss of God-contact. The reward of ten cities, or five cities, mentioned in the parable, refers symbolically to the powers that develop in the devotee who strictly follows God-given spiritual command- The spiritual powers ments.

With each virtue that is mastered, as with every step of ascension the consciousness achieves, there is bestowed on the devotee a corre- sponding power or stage of enlightenment—revelations of the soul's innat e omnipotence and omniscience. Thus, for example, referring to the commandments cited by Jesus in the earlier story of the rich man [in the opening verses of this Discourse]: By destroying the instinct or impulse to kill, one gains a divine magnetism by which he secures the confidence of man and even beasts and birds. Saint Francis of Assisi was one such exemplar, as are great yogi-ascetics who live in secluded haunts in perfect harmony with oth- erwise fearsome cobras and tigers. One who physically and mentally overcomes all sex temptations becomes filled with divine bliss and constant spiritual enthusiasm im- pregnated with tremendous transmuted life energy that imbues him with the magnetism of self-mastery. One who has banished from his mind and actions all desire to steal (to misappropriate anything not rightfully his), or to possess wealth by any unscrupulous or selfish means, will by his freedom from material bondage attract to himself whatever he needs in life. One who has removed all impulse to misrepresent or distort truth, never bearing false witness in any circumstance for any personal mo- tive or advantage, establishes within himself a great power whereby his words always come true. He who is never duplicitous and deals justly in mind and deed with everyone acquires a discernment and a divine simplicity and in- sight into all human nature.

There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him, \"Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?\" This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. Then said Jesus, \"Let her alone: against the day of my bury- ing hath she kept this. For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.\" Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; be- cause that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus (John 12:1-11).* J esus bestowed his recognition of the woman's perpetual honor for one reason only—the sole reason that ruled his every action on earth. This was his instancy of acceptance that God  - alone can be the highest Goal of life. Good works The relative priority for the poor, compassion for the suffering, can only of fulfilling one's complement, but never supplant, man's need for ac- spiritual duties to knowledgment of dependence on his Creator. God and to humanity Saint John, in recording that this significant in- ciden t took place in the home of the resurrected Lazarus (rather than \"in the house of Simon the leper\" as stated in Matthew and Mark) identifies the woman who anointed Jesus as Mary, sister of Martha and Lazarus — she whose single-hearted devotion Jesus had com- mended earlier: \"Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be *Cf. additional parallel reference in Matthew 26:6-16. 1253"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"taken away from her.\"* Because the woman had the spiritual dis- crimination to offer openly her homage to God—whose reflection she saw in Jesus—in preference to man, even the poor, Jesus gave her his praise as a discerning devotee whom the ages would finally acclaim. Jesus, nonattached as he was to his body, had no desire for at- tention or honor, or for man's extravagances of adorning and per- fuming a mere clod of clay. He was not extolling the personal devo- tion given him by Mary, but was commending her sagacity in worshiping the great God of the universe whose presence he con- sciously felt in his Christ Consciousness. He pointed out impartially Mary's wisdom in offering adoration to the holiest of all holy mani- festations: the Christ Consciousness that was templed in him—the liv- ing reflection of the One Giver of all life, all consciousness, and all virtue, including charitable impulses to help the poor. Thus when Ju- das and others of materialistic attitude and hypocritical morality as- serted that Mary would have done better had she sold the ointment and used the income to aid the poor, Jesus reminded them that they have a perpetual opportunity to attend to the poor, but they would not readily have another chance of showing devotion to a visible manifes- tation of God's presence in a bodily form; for such is a rare occurrence on earth. Jesus' words emphasize that devotees should wisely grade their spiritual duties and righteous actions, keeping God as the first and supreme object of adoration. Mary with her instinctive divine devo- tion knew exactly what she was doing—that, first, it was her sacred privilege to honor the visible Christ in whom was the reflected mani- festation of God; and, secondly, to serve God in others. She did not hesitate to anoint her Lord with the costly ointment, knowing that there is nothing in this world precious enough to show adequate rev- erence to the Supreme Beloved of all souls. Jesus saw clearly how men's minds are open to every form of side- tracking, prone to any commandeering by a detail. There is only one problem in human life—establishment of unity with God—but this prime simplicity has been befogged by a million issues. Man will not give a monotheistic love to God, and disguises his infidelities by punc- tilious respect before outward shrines of charity. These humanitarian gestures are virtuous, since for a moment they divert man's attention *Luke 10:42 (see Discourse 53). 1254"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"from himself, but they do not free him from his single responsibility in life—h' s sense of gratitude to God. This responsibility, assumed with man's first breath of an air freely bestowed by his only Benefac- tor, was discharged by the woman whom Jesus so powerfully upheld, silencing the thousand illogics that would put man before God.* By his commendation of Mary, Jesus signified, as at countless other times, that God alone is worthy of all honor, not of outward ointments merely, but of every ego-sacrifice the love-filled hearts of devotees can devise as token of their joy in Him. As Jesus well knew every scene to be unfolded in the divine drama of his life, he made two prophecies on the occasion of this repast at Bethany. His crucifixion was very nigh, since it was from this table that Judas went forth to bargain with priests for the price of his Mas- ter's life. That is why he declared of Mary, \"She is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.\" His second reference to the future, \"wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world,\" made clear that he was aware of the destined scope of his mission. Though his teachings were then known only to sections of a small Jewish province, they would ultimately spread in all lands. And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disci- ples, saying unto them, \"Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me. And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, 'The Lord hath need of them'; and straightway he will send them.\" All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spo- ken by the prophet, saying, \"Tell ye the daughter of Sion, 'Be- hold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.'\" * Paramahansa Yogananda's commentary on the Bible verses covered in this Discourse was being prepared for publication in Self-Realization magazine during the period in which he was also working on Autobiography of a Yogi. Segments of the commentary, which may seem familiar to discerning readers, were adapted by him for inclusion in both works. (Publisher's Note) 1255"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them, and brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon. And a very great multitude spread their gar- ments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them in the way. And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, \"Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.\" And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, \"Who is this?\" And the multitude said, \"This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee\" (Matthew 21:1-11). Parallel reference: And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying, \"Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither. And if any man ask you, 'Why do you loose him?' thus shall ye say unto him, 'Because the Lord hath need of him.'\" And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them. And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, \"Why loose ye the colt?\" And they said, \"The Lord hath need of him.\" And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon. And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen; saying, \"Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.\" And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, \"Master, rebuke thy disciples.\" And he answered and said unto them, \"I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.\" And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, saying, \"If thou hadst known, even thou, at last in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! But now they 1256"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"are hid from thine eyes. For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation\" (Luke 19:29-44). * S piritually interpreted as relevant to man in every age, Jesus' tri- umphant entry into the city of Jerusalem inspires a beautiful sym- bology. Man's consciousness is that city of Jerusa- —— lem; his thoughts and feelings are the inhabitants. The beautiful spiritual Jesus' coming into Jerusalem evokes the opening of symbolism in Jesus' the gates of man's devotion to receive the entrance entry into Jerusalem of Christ Consciousness, in its omniscient power, into the bodily kingdom, with all its citizens rejoicing: \"Blessed be the Kin g that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.\" The literal event, this striking day in Jesus' life, speaks once again of his cosmic Christ Consciousness in which nothing was outside his perception and command. With a few simple words, he directed two of his disciples to an exact distant location where they would find an as-yet unridden colt, and further empowered his messengers to procure the owner's permission to take the beast by offering nothing more than the ambiguous explanation: \"Because the Lord hath need of him.\" In every exigency of his life, Jesus proved that he had no need for the persuasion of gold; he ever found ready to his hand all material accessories to his plans. The drama of this day in Jerusalem, as the disciples later came to realize, f was centered in its literal fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy (Zechariah 9:9-10): Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jeru- salem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having *Cf. additional parallel references in Mark 11:1-11 and John 12:12-19. tSee John 12:14-16: \"And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, 'Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.' These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glori- fied, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.\" 1257"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass. And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth. Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem was in very truth one in which the daughters and sons of Zion did \"rejoice greatly\" and \"shout\" as they beheld, and saluted by title, their King, \"riding...upon a colt the foal of an ass,\" as Zechariah had anciently foretold. That Christ would choose the lowly ass for his mount is as sym- bolic of his way of life as that he was born in a stable. Zechariah spoke trul y of a Messiah who would \"cut off the chariot...the horse...and the battle bow...he shall speak peace unto the heathen.\" The Prince of Peace, whose only battle cry could be: Victory to the Meek! rode no fiery charger amidst a panoplied army, but sat a gentle steed, small and serviceable to the daily ways of peace. His \"warriors,\" no ostentatious stalwarts, were only an unimposing band of selfless disciples. Verily, this King, before whom the multitudes spread their branches of palm, demonstrated once again that a son of God celebrates his dominion in meekness and lowliness of pride. When Jesus rebuked the Pharisees, he meant that scripture must be fulfilled this day; that Zechariah's words, which required the mul- titudes to \"rejoice greatly\" and \"shout,\" should come to pass. If men were forced to \"hold their peace,\" the very stones—permeated too with God, essential in every atom of creation—would be empowered to hold faith with the scriptures. Men of divine realization, like Jesus and John the Baptist, know that God alone upholds the structure of the universe, and that He can flame forth from every clod and molecule. Because to mortal eyes a stone appears inert and Spiritless, both Jesus and John used it, on sim- ilar occasions of public rebuke, as a challenge to faith. The story con- cernin g John is as follows: Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, \"O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of re- pentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, 'We have Abra- 1258"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"ham to our father'; for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham\" (Luke 3:7-8). There is a further interpretation of Jesus' reference to the stones. If the cosmos is against might, if the sun wars not with the planets but retires at dueful time to give the stars their little sway, what avails our mailed fist? Shall any peace indeed come out of it? Therefore, Jesus implied, by his repudiation of the Pharisees' re- —— quest, that divine justice is no figurative abstrac- Peace draws its tion, and that a man of peace, though his tongue be strength and support torn from its roots, will yet find his speech and his from the universal or- defens e in the bedrock of creation, the universal or- der of God's creation der itself. Jesus said to the Pharisees, \"How think you to silence men of peace? As well may you hope to throttle the voice of God, whose very stones sing His glory and His omnipresence. Will you demand that men not celebrate peace, but war only? Then make your preparations to overtopple the foundations of the world; for it is not gentle men alone, but stones, or earth, and water and fire and air that will rise up against you to bear witness of His ordered harmony.\" Thus, as Zechariah had long ago foreseen, Christ on this occasion spoke \"peace to the heathen,\" proclaiming that not cruelty but good- will arms the universal sinews. He who \"is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass\" will know the endless fruits of victory, sweeter to the taste than any nurtured on the soil of blood. \"O Jerusalem, I weep for you! If you only knew at the present time all the political, social, and divine peace you are enjoying due to my presence! But you fail to see this great opportunity the Divine Father is giving you to acquire everlasting peace. The day will arrive, O people of Jerusalem, when the wisdom of you and your children will be shrouded beneath the soil of ignorance and the edifice of order and harmony will disintegrate into stony rubble because you neither know nor appreciate this visitation of the Divine—as expressed in me—which was ordained for your benefit and upliftment.\" The sorrowful compassion Jesus expressed was not spoken ego- tistically, but as an impersonal glorification of the presence of God made manifest within himself. He grieved that the people of Jerusalem did not realize the importance of the magnanimous grace of this di- vine manifestation through which liberation was offered to them. He 1259"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"observed that their blinded intelligence and foolish misuse of free will could neither appreciate nor receive the unlimited Divine Power of sal- vation within him. Because of this lack, precluding their redemption, Jesus prophesied that the people of Jerusalem in the future would be pestered by war, famine, and increasing spiritual darkness.* And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, and said unto them, \"It is written, 'My house shall be called the house of prayer'; but ye have made it 'a den of thieves.'\"f And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them. And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the tem- ple, and saying, \"Hosanna to the son of David\"; they were sore displeased, and said unto him, \"Hearest thou what these say f\" And Jesus saith unto them, \"Yea; have ye never read, 'Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise'?\" And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there (Matthew 21:12-17). IT a yp you never read in the scriptures that out of the mouth of iL A God's littlest ones, sincere and guileless, shall burst forth praise of Divinity in power to quell inimical dissenters of truth?\":): * Jesus' prophecy came to pass in A.D. 70, when the city of Jerusalem was completely de- stroyed by the Romans after the Jews' four-year violent revolt. Wars between the Jews and Romans continued until A.D. 135. Encyclopaedia Britannica states: \"After this defeat Jerusalem became a Roman colony; a temple to Jupiter was erected there, and Jews were prevented from entering the city until the 4th century. When the Romans had entered Palestine in 63 B.C., they practiced a relatively humane occupation until c. A.D. 66-70. They did not interfere with religious practices unless they considered them a threat to Rome, and their rights of requisition were precise and limited.\" fCf. parallel references in John 2:12-17 (commented on in Discourse 12), and in Mark 11:15-17 and Luke 19:45-46. X \"O Lord our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth! who hast set Thy glory above the heavens. \"Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou ordained strength because of Thine enemies, that Thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger\" (Psalms 8:1-2). 1260"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"In citing the Psalm of King David, Jesus chided the arrogant priestly authorities who took offense at the children in the temple glo- rifying the Divine Presence he manifested, hailing him as the son of David , the prophesied savior. (\"Hosanna\"—a joyous shout of devout acclamation, from the Hebrew hoshi 'an-nna, \"pray save\" us.) Jesus pointed out that praise is perfected into a mighty force when it is a genuine response to truth. The minds and speech of pure children that are yet unsullied by politics, insincerity, manipulativeness, and false- hoods have a responsive appreciation of truth through a clearer innate intuition that is not distorted by prejudicial rationalizations. Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered. And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, \"Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever.\" And presently the fig tree withered away. And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, \"How soon is the fig tree withered away!\" Jesus answered and said unto them, \"Verily I say unto you, if ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this moun- tain, 'Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea'; it shall be done. And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believ- ing, ye shall receive\" (Matthew 21:18-22).* I n the incident of the hapless fig tree we have a provocative contrast between the human and the divine, manifesting simultaneously in one man: human reaction at a disappointment, taking form in divine power. Jesus was hungry and looked for fruit on the leafy fig tree, but at the wrong season.f Finding no figs, he just willed the tree to cease to exist! The will and life force present in the body of Jesus, being in tune with the Cosmic Will and Cosmic Life, simply withdrew the life *Cf. parallel reference in Mark 11:12-14 and Mark 11:20-25. Regarding this inci- dent, the Gospel According to St. Mark relates that Jesus cursed the fig tree in the morning on his way into Jerusalem, where he cast the money changers out of the tem- ple; and that leaving the city in the evening he and the disciples passed the tree again and saw that it had withered. fMark 11:13: \"...he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.\" 1261"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"and will that erstwhile had sustained the fig tree. Just as an electrical engineer who has access to all the switches of the main dynamo that controls the electricity in a city can put off or on at Jesus' withering of the will a single light or all the lights, so Jesus, being fig tree: a glimpse of one with the Cosmic Electrical Engineer, was able his contrasting human to switch on life in the extinguished lamp of the and divine natures lifeless body of Lazarus, or switch off the life that coursed through the fig tree. Though rationally viewed as unreasonable for Jesus to expect the fig tree to yield fruit during the off-season (for it produced in accor- dance with nature's laws, instituted by the Creator), still the impulsive act was yet another demonstration to show the disciples that the God- image in man is unconstrained by even the irritating implacability of the material universe. Man owns the omnipotence of God, provided he forsakes delusion and, by meditation, lifts his consciousness from the body and unites it with God's perfect reflection within him. The Hindu scriptures say that one who knows the Spirit becomes the Spirit. Jesus demonstrated that oneness with Spirit by his Spirit-united dominion over all things. When the disciples expressed surprise at the prompt response of the fig tree to this sentence of destruction, Jesus spoke of the power of faith—not blind faith, but perfect conviction born of God-realization and the personal command of great metaphysical laws that have the power to move mountains and grant any prayer. * * See Discourse 46 for commentary on Jesus' teachings about the power of faith ex- pressed in these verses. 1262"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"DISCOURSE 65 Jesus TeacL.es in fLe Temple at Jerusalem for fLe Lasf Time Jesus Extols the Advancement of Repentant Sinners Over That of the Spiritually Arrogant • S.

Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, 'Tell them which are bidden, \"Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.'\" But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them. \"But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and 1265"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"burned up their city. Then saith he to his servants, 'The wed- ding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.'

Aware of their conniving, Jesus deliberately chose not to answer the chief priests and scribes when they asked him to declare by whose authority he did these works. He knew their query was to press him to proclaim before them, as he had to others, his oneness with the Father, grounds on which to arrest him on charges of blas- phemy.t By answering their question with his simple question con- cerning the source of the powers of John the Baptist, he effectively balked his attackers: To admit John's divine authority would draw a deserved rebuke from Jesus as to why, then, they had not treated John a s a holy prophet; and to deny that John's authority was heaven- bestowed would arouse the anger of the people. Having confounded his enemies into silence, Jesus then made clear to them, by means of a parable, the searing truth that their ar- rogant priestly and social consciousness had denied them the blessing of salvation through John: \"A master had two devotees on earth, and he said to one of them: 'Son, go into the vineyard of meditation and labor there to grow the precious grapes of divine realization. After successful cultivation, those ripened fruits will yield to you the intoxicating wine of unending di- vine bliss.' But the devotee, succumbing to a temporary spate of delu- sion, replied: 'I will not meditate, for I am not in the mood to do so!'

Jesus extols the ad- vancement of repen- tant sinners over that of the spiritually arrogant 1269"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"given only for the devotee's good. With deep devotion and resolve, he became faithful in his practice of meditation. \"Then the master came to the second devotee and asked him also to cultivate the fruits of meditation. The devotee answered readily, 'I will do so, Lord,' but failed utterly to keep his promise. Now, is it not evident to you which of them obeyed the will of the master?\" They all agreed that the first stubborn devotee, who had mended his ways, was the obedient one; not the courteous devotee whose com- pliant words were not expressed in action. Jesus then pinpointed the issue at hand: \"Out of the truth within me, I declare unto you that even the publicans and harlots are superior to you in realization. For the great master John came to all of you, and yet you did not understand or accept him. But those you call sinners—who formerly had not lis- tened to the voice of truth—deliberated when John came to them, then shook off delusion, repented, and began with faith to seek God through inner divine communion and obedience to His command- ments. That is why they will soon work out the effects of their past evil actions and enter the kingdom of Cosmic Consciousness, long ahead of all of you chief priests and elders who proudly hold your- selves as superior by dint of your effete titles. \"Even after you had seen the change John wrought in erstwhile sinners—proof of his righteous life and God-wisdom—still you did not repent and enter the vineyard of meditation to labor for God- communion. No, you believed not in him nor his advice; neither did you repent of your haughty disobedience that you might be saved by following his example. Now you can judge for yourselves why the publicans and harlots who tuned in with the God-saturated John, can enter into the kingdom of God before you.\" Jesus' words are an assurance to repentant transgressors of divine law: By following a God-inspired guru and by forsaking the ways of delusion, they can surely be received into the kingdom of God. Indeed, they will find salvation more quickly than will persons whose vanity about their own limited understanding and presumed moral suffi- ciency makes them disdain the help of the God-sent guru, being ego- tistically misled into thinking they have no need for such assistance in order to attain entry into God's presence in Cosmic Consciousness. 1270"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"\"Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a wine- press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country: And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.

He hedged in the earthly vineyard with the aura of His divine vibrations, and He dug into human consciousness a winepress of intuition and built * Jesus is citing Psalms 118:22-13. fCf. parallel references in Mark 12:1-12 and Luke 20:9-19. 1271"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"there a tower of spiritual vision. He then gave this vineyard into the care of His incarnate soul-laborers and \"went into a far country,\" hid Him- self in the transcendent plane of Cosmic Conscious- ness for the duration of that cycle of creation.* Then, \"when the time of the fruit drew near\" —when God expected that the tillers of the vines of wisdom to whom He had lent the fruitful vineyard would reap the harvest of many beautiful experi- ences—He sent out His prophets to gather from them some of their harvest of wisdom-nurtured love and gratitude. But the people of the earth, their pristine soul consciousness having devolved under the influence of delusion, refused to accept God's di- vine messengers, rejecting them violently. Many other prophets were sent to the earth and likewise were maligned and killed. One of these came in the form of John the Baptist. He too was treated shamefully. Finally, the Lord of the vineyard resolved to send to the unappre- ciative, cruel people of the earth His sole reflection in all vibratory cre- ation—the Son or Christ Consciousness—made manifest in the form of an avatar. God expected that His ungrateful people would now ac- knowledge Him by revering His son. But the people were drunk with delusion. In their perversity they wished to enjoy the blessings of the earth without interference of the guiding precepts of God or His emis- saries . Notwithstanding the evidence that this son was \"the heir,\" a true representation of God in whom His Consciousness was fully ex- pressed, they slew him, hoping \"to seize his inheritance,\" to rule the earth according to their own desires instead of according to the ways of righteousness. Of course Jesus was now speaking of himself, foretelling the cru- cifixion that would climax the ill-treatment these self-serving officials had given him, and the result that would inevitably follow: The Lord of the vineyard of the earth through Cosmic Law would punish those responsible for the evil done to His son, and would give the vineyard * At the beginning of each recurring manifestation of creation (Day of Brahma), hav- ing set in motion the cosmic laws governing the universal structure, the Father-Creator turns over the operation of those laws to the Holy Ghost (Cosmic Vibratory Nature) and withdraws to the transcendent realm of Cosmic Consciousness beyond the vibra- tory universes, but reflects Himself in creation as the immanent Christ Consciousness.

When his listeners of malign in- tent had heard these parables and their omen of punishment, they \"perceived that he spake of them.\"* The \"other husbandmen,\" those who would render to the Lord of the Vineyard \"the fruits in their seasons,\" refers to future generations of devotees who would reverence Jesus' exemplary life and teachings. By devotion to the Christ Consciousness in this divine son, they would reap from their labors in the vineyard of the earth a bountiful harvest of God- wisdom: realization of the divine kingdom within them as a region so exceedingly abundant in bliss that they would willingly return to the Lord, in the form of praise and worship, the fruits they had gleaned. Jesus went on to prophesy that the Christ Consciousness, which the builders of his own civilization rejected, would be the principal stone required in constructing the temple of a heavenly life on earth. '\"This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes,'\" he quoted from scripture. \"Therefore I say unto you that because you rejected the Christ Consciousness and me in whom that reflection of the Fa- ther was sent to you, the kingdom of God-consciousness will not man- ifest in you; but it will be manifest in those persons who will in future appreciate my message by establishing these truths in their conscious- ness. Anyone who shall resist the adamantine stone of these truths will find his life broken up with delusion, disharmony, and unhappiness. And those who will deliberately lead wrong lives, and willfully defile my teachings and persecute those who are my true followers, will find that through their own folly the Cosmic Law inherent in this stone will fall upon them to their utter destruction.\" Anyone who strikes a stone with his fist is hurt through his own unwise action and not because of any desire of the stone to harm him. Likewise, Jesus warned that anyone who is foolish enough to resist consciously the unbreakable truths set forth in his teachings will hurt himself by activating the Cosmic Law to destroy his spiritual life and delay his evolution toward salvation. 'As also expressed in the parallel reference to this story in Luke 20:16: '\"He shall come an d destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others.' And when they heard it, they said, 'God forbid.'\" 1273"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said, \"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son, and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come. Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, 'Tell them which are bidden, \"Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.'\" But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them. \"But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. Then saith he to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the mar- riage.' So those servants went out into the highways, and gath- ered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests. \"And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: And he saith unto him, 'Friend, how earnest thou in hither not having a wedding garment?' And he was speechless. Then said the king to the ser- vants, 'Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' \"For many are called, but few are chosen\" (Matthew 22:1- ow the kingdom of heaven can be entered by the appreciative devotee, through a proper response to the invitation of God, was illustrated by Jesus in the following way: The Heavenly Father (\"a certain king\") sent one of His liberated devotees (the king's \"son\") to be born on earth so that, when the proper time came—when he had spiritually prepared his incarnate human instrumentality to accord with his God-ordained mission—his wedding with divine wisdom could be celebrated as an example for mankind, and earnest devotees might learn something of the joys of *A similar parable is related in Luke 14:16-24 (see Discourse 58). 14)•* 1274"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"divine union through witnessing in his God-united life this sacred mar- riage. * Just as the wedding ceremony of an ideal couple inspires guests who are attuned with them with a moving example —— of love, so also, the ideal truth-wedded life of a Jesus describes the saint or prophet inspires truth-seekers with the de- karma reaped by those sire for their own union with wisdom.  who accept or reject Whenever a prophet is ready to begin his work God's messengers on earth, God sends forth vibratory messengers to call all who are aware of these high vibrations to follow the illumined soul . It is a spiritual law that God Himself thus celebrates the Divine Union on earth of a liberated devotee truly wedded to truth and ex- alted principles, usually (except if the work of the liberated one is car- ried on behind the outward scenes of man) by means of these servants of magnetic vibrations issuing forth from Him in different directions as determined by the purpose of the prophet's mission. Seekers are thereby drawn to join the joyous festivities of spiritual feasting in honor of the liberated one wedded with the lovely Spirit of Truth. So, in the instance of this parable, the initial invitation to \"them that were bidden to the wedding\" was wholly ignored. Then the Di- vine Father sent forth again the magnetic, vibratory messengers to sig- nify to truth-seekers that they might join the ecstatic celebration of the prophet's God-united life, during which the choice delicacies of wis- dom would be offered for all. But many of those invited remained heedless out of sheer spiritual carelessness, failing to recognize this in- vitation as a response of God to their former prayers. They dishon- ored God's call to attend the soul-liberating event and continued with their material occupations. Others, superficial and rigid in their igno- rance, stifled (\"killed\") outright the messengers of divine vibration that radiographed the announcement to their hearts. When the Heavenly Father felt the wrong vibrations of rejection emanating from those He had sought to bless, He could not stay the armies of cosmic and karmic laws that govern all human actions. These laws punish willful \"murderers\" of good vibrations by igniting the city of their consciousness with the unseen fire of purifying discipline. In * See, for example, references in Discourses 4, 7, and 8 to the simultaneous dichotomy and unity of the human and divine nature in incarnate liberated souls.

As cited in the parable, the Gracious Lord yet a third time sent His invisible vibratory servants to speak to the hearts of other seekers. In response to the announcement of this ignorance-quelling ceremony, many would-be followers—of both high and low caliber—from the highways of life came to witness the liberated prophet's wedding with Truth. Sincere souls on the path of Self-realization appreciate and are re- ceptive to a prophet and his teachings. But among the throng there are also hypocrites who associate themselves with great masters—and with organizations promulgating their paths of truth—just for the glamor and festivity, or for personal prestige. So the implication of the parable is that the Divine Father came, as the Host, to examine the guests who had been attracted by His invitation. He discovered that a hypocrite had joined the devotees; he wore not a wedding garment of sincerity. When the Host accused him of hypocrisy, he could make no reply in his defense and remained speechless. So the Omnipotent Host had the powerful spiritual vibrations force out this hypocrite whose understanding had not evolved suffi- ciently to join the good company of devout seekers. He was cast back int o the land of self-created darkness. Too late the hypocrite be- moaned his ignorance, and wept and gnashed his teeth at his lost chance to attain light in his darkened state. Many truth-seekers, owing to the varying degrees of intensity of their spiritual urges, intermittently draw the attention of God and re- ceive His invitation into the heavenly consciousness within them; but only those few are chosen to enter into God's kingdom of Cosmic Consciousness who are meritorious according to their earnest, sus- tained interest in truth and in God, shown through their sincere efforts to spiritualize their lives by unceasing prayer and deep meditation. Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might en- tangle him in his talk. And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, \"Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.

But even while fulfilling worldly obligations, they should inwardly pay their soul's homage to God alone, to Him who is the King of kings, who as Creator of one's native land, earth, heaven, is Owner of all things therein of whatsoever nature—familial, social, national , international, and cosmic. Jesus had upheld this same principle on a previous occasion, cited in Matthew 17:24-2.7.! His words and their miraculous sequel on that occasion illustrated that man's proper fulfillment of heavenly laws automatically aids him in satisfying his liability to edicts made by man. True religion is an art of living that harmonizes all aspects of man's dharma, righteous duty—material, mental, social, moral, and spiritual —neglecting nothing needful for balanced harmony in body, mind, and *Cf. parallel references in Luke 20:10-26 and Mark 12:13-17. t \"And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, 'Doth not your master pay tribute?'... \"Jesus saith unto [Peter]...'Lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.'\" (See Discourse 47.) \"Render unto Cae- sar\": the spiritual atti- tude toward fulfill- ment of worldly duties 1277"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"soul. Jesus' words, \"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God, the things that are God's,\" are a reminder that as long as one lives in the material world, to shirk material responsibilities is to be lacking in wisdom. Bhagavan Krishna, by fulfilling perfectly his de- manding material, social, and spiritual roles as both avatar and earthly king, without letting one duty interfere with the others, exemplified in a unique way this equilibrated consciousness. The serenity of a saint in Himalayan solitudes is not ruffled by conflicting crosscurrents of social and spiritual duties; but greater is the devotee whose spiritual attain- ments can pass undiminished through all tests of the world's harsh prov- ing grounds. Jesus' statement is also a warning to persons whose thoughts and desires entangle them in worldly life: They will have to \"render unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar.\" Material involvements create material obligations, exacted according to the law of karma; but one whose heart and mind are fixed on God alone, the Utter Simplicity, is only minimally involved in the obligatory give-and-take of human existence. And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, \"How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David? For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, 'The Lord said to my Lord, \"Sit thou on My right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.\"' David therefore himself calleth him 'Lord'; and whence is he then his son?\" And the common people heard him gladly (Mark IZ: 3S~37)- Parallel reference: While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, saying, \"What think ye of Christ? Whose son is he?\" They say unto him, \"The son of David.\" He saith unto them, \"How then doth David in spirit call him 'Lord,' saying, 'The Lord said unto my Lord, \"Sit thou on My right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool'\"?* If David then call him 'Lord,' how is he his son?\" * Psalm 110:1. 1278"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions (Matthew 22:41-46).* T he scribes and Pharisees, as likewise many Christian believers to this day, did not understand the difference between \"Jesus\" (\"Son of man\") and \"Christ\" (\"Son of God\" or \"only be- — gotten Son\")—between the incarnate Messiah and Son of God or son of the infinite Christ Consciousness he embodied. David: Christ Con- Jesus' intent was not to deny that the human body sciousness in the of the Messiah or Christ was descended from King Messiah David, as both he and his listeners knew had been prophesied in scripture;! but to make clear that the all-pervading Christ Consciousness could not be limited to the physical body of a son of David or any other human being. Jesus spoke to the Pharisees from his realization of the \"Christ\" as the Universal Consciousness present in all vibratory creation, and fully reflected in his own body, known as Jesus—and also that the Christ Consciousness was manifest to David through a vision, de- scribed in the Book of Psalms. David \"in spirit\" — after spiritual upliftment by the Cosmic Vibration of the Holy Ghost—wrote that the Lord God (the Father existing beyond all vibratory creation) expressed His will to the Christ Consciousness (the Lord of Creation). The Father's vibratory message articulated in interpretation might be expressed thus: \"The Lord said unto my Lord, 'Be Thou the Abiding Existence of My true reflected Presence in creation, enthroned by My side in My con- sciousness of Immutable Righteousness and Truth. Exert Thy reign- ing influence over all workings in creation until, through My almighty power of love in You, I make Your satanic enemies of delu- sion—who constantly obstruct Your perfect works—Your footstool and Your slaves.'\" Jesus made the indisputable point that David would not have used the title \"my Lord\" in speaking of a son4 David clearly perceived the *Cf. additional parallel reference in Luke 20:41-44. fSee Discourse 36. ^For a father to speak deferentially to a son or descendant would be completely out of keeping with the patriarchal culture to which Jesus and David belonged. 1279"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"distinction between the Universal Christ and its manifestation in hu- man form as the Messiah. The interchange of the Intelligence between the Transcendent and the Immanent \"Lords\" (Cosmic Consciousness and Christ Conscious- ness) manifested only temporarily in the consciousness of David by means of a vision. But since the Christ Consciousness was steadily and fully reflected in the life and consciousness of Jesus, he let himself be called \"Christ,\" but explained that the Christ Consciousness in him could not accurately be called the son of David. And he said unto them in his doctrine, \"Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the mar- ketplaces, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts: Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.\" * And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing. And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, \"Verily I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living\" (Mark 12:3 8-44).t J esus was not only observing the people and the amount of their of- ferings, but with his intuitive perception he was also analyzing their motivating spirit. He called to the attention of the disciples the action of the widow because her generous spirit made her tiny gift shine before God. Jesus cited the incident as a beautiful illustration of a divine principle: Although this poor widow put only a farthing in the temple treasury, her devotion magnified her offering; in the eyes of God she gave far more than all the rich and indifferent people who gave greater amounts but with no reverence or devotion in their * See Discourse 55 for commentary on these verses. fCf. parallel reference in Luke 21:1-4. 1280"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"hearts. Those who made impressive contributions were disbursing only a token of their abundant riches, at no inconvenience to them- selves. But the widow, notwithstanding her own needs, gave unto God's cause all she had, even unto The widow's mite: her very livelihood.    spiritual value of giv- Ther e is spiritual profit in heeding the lesson ing with heartfelt Jesus' disciples learned that day: to give unto God's devotion cause in a reverent spirit of selflessness, not pride. A rich man whose bequests are motivated not by devotion but by pride in his wealth will no doubt earn some good karma by benefiting the temple, but such an act does not meet the criteria of a great virtue according to Cosmic Law. It will not elevate the giver's consciousness in God nor activate the law of karma to yield spiritual fruits.* In con- trast, when a person of meager means gives to God's cause even a few coins from a charitable heart, that offering, though small materially, is spiritually enriched and enriching. God recognizes not the quantity of the gifts given to His cause, but the quality of devotion accompanying them. Giving more does not necessarily signify greater devotion, nor does a smaller gift signify less devotion. Nevertheless, when a well-to-do person gives generously from his largess with pure devotion and no ulterior motive, the gift is accepted by God and reciprocated with blessings, and when a less- endowed person gives of his little store but prides himself that it was well given considering his means, or gives that pittance with an indif- ferent attitude, then his act, unlike the widow's, is spiritually deval- ued. A temple or church welcomes all benefactions; but God especially blesses those that are given in a spirit of sacrifice, love, and devotion. In Oriental temples, flowers, fruits, and monetary donations are given as offerings to God. These help to maintain the temple, and God Himself receives the devotion that rises from sincere human hearts ex- pressed in those gifts purely offered as symbolic oblations.f * \"Whatever sacrifice is offered, gift bestowed, or austerity performed without faith (devotion) is called ' asat .'

Then Jesus clarified that the ethereal voice of God which had spo- ken was not for his sake but to prove the truth of the testimony of his life as God-ordained. This is a thrilling account in that only rarely through the passing centuries does the usually taciturn God speak other than individually to His devotees in the secluded sanctuary of their souls; yet here, at the prayerful call of Jesus, He instantaneously broke His si- lence and, like a human father, within the hearing of many, assured the disciples and the faithful that Jesus truly represented His divine majesty. Jesus went on to prophesy that according to the cosmic law of karma (the \"judgment\" visited upon this world), \"the prince of this world\" (the Christ Consciousness, God's reflection reigning in the ma- terial cosmos) would be \"cast out\" (ejected from bodily manifestation in Jesus). In this reference to \"what death he should die\" Jesus also added, \"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me\": If during the painful death by crucifixion (his body elevated above the earth on the cross), his soul were lifted by the grace of God from the body and consciousness of its earth-imposed limitations into the infinite Christ Consciousness—victorious in spirit over death— word of his divine life and teachings would then attract the attention of all peoples for all times, and would be a beacon light of wisdom to lead receptive souls to freedom from cosmic delusion and its miseries.f 'One such revelation is recounted in Luke 3:21-22: \"Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened , and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, 'Thou art My beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.'\" (See Discourse 6.) Of the works of Jesus that would manifest the salvation-bestowing Holy Ghost, John the Baptist had declared: \"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but h e that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shal l baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire\" (Matthew 3:11; see Discourse 6). t Twice earlier Jesus had referred to \"the son of man\" being \"lifted up\": See com- mentaries on John 3:14 (Discourse 14) and John 8:28 (Discourse 51). 1289"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"A struggle between the physical and divine natures of Jesus is in- dicated in his expression of uncertainty concerning final victory over the flesh.

Man's ignorance-born prejudice, greed, and sense-enslaved selfishness are the true cause of his inability to live in peace with his fellows. Jesus knew that until these were checked, they would inevitably result in the race wars, religious wars, and the innumerable bloody conflicts over land and material re- sources that have with horrifying regularity wrought destruction and misery among the nations.* He further perceived that the veritable del- uge of negative vibrations released into the ether by wars (as by the other evils of worldly civilization, to greater or lesser extent) would generate additional catastrophes: \"And there shall be famines, and * \"I believe there will always be wars, until perchance we all become so spiritual that by the evolution of our individual natures we will make war unnecessary....War is like poison in the system. When we have toxins in our body, that impurity has to get out somehow. So we suffer from disease. Likewise, when there is too much selfishness in the international system, that poison breaks out in the world as the disease of war. Many people are killed, and then for a little while there is a lull. But war comes again — and will come again and again—so long as there will be ignorance, and so long as the individual man has not become a perfect citizen of the world.\" — Paramahansa Yogananda, in \"A World Without Boundaries,\" The Divine Romance (published by Self-Realization Fellowship). 1304 The metaphysical cause of wars, fam- ines, and natural catastrophes"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.\" Again, history confirms the accuracy of Jesus' words; tragic instances are recorded from every era and every portion of the earth. In this twentieth century, for exam- ple, the Spanish influenza epidemic immediately following World War I killed more people than did the fighting. And after World War II, mil- lions starved during famines in various parts of the world created by crop failures—the result not only of wartime conditions, but of \"nat- ural\" causes such as plant diseases, flooding, and severe storms. Rarely has a decade gone by without devastating earthquakes, floods, conflagrations, and other disasters that have ravaged man's life and livelihood. Such fearful experiences have been severe warnings sent by the heavenly cosmic law to the people of the earth that they might realize the uncertainty of life and do their part to stabilize it by chang- ing their ways. The vibrations of the evils of earthly civilizations accu- mulate in the cosmic blueprint of the astral regions and adversely af- fect the subtle energies and laws that empower the forces of the earth. These effects of man's collective folly and evils are stored in the ether as hidden vibratory bombs ready to explode in the form of nature's in- clemencies or national disasters.* Jesus prophesied truly that these wars and troubles are only \"the beginning of sorrows,\" unless people heed these portentous signs and reform their thoughts and actions. The admonition of Jesus concerning the law of habit governing individuals applies equally to the earthly habits of civilizations: \"Unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.\"t If the people through their collective evil karma generate wars and miseries, such calamities will by their perfidious nature keep on multiplying; whereas if people did not persistently create evil karma and its proliferation of suffering, even those evil inclinations that remain would diminish and vanish. \"When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) Then let them which be in Judea \"See Discourse 39, discussion of the operation of the law of mass karma. fLuke 19:26 (see Discourse 63). 1305"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"flee into the mountains: Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house: Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. \"And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!

This sheltering Presence is the only true sanctuary impermeable to human affliction. \"But for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened,\" promised Jesus. Then, or today, if man had to pay all the karma accrued through incarnations \"there should no flesh be saved.\" But, as he explained, even if true devotees have seeds of past evil actions in them, they will find that, because of their virtue and the grace of God, much of their karma is allayed and the term of suffering lessened. \"Then if any man shall say unto you, 'Lo, here is Christ, or there'; believe it not.

Thus the disciples had no cause to seek out any other prophets, lest in diffusing their spiritual focus they break the divine law of loyalty to him, their God-sent messenger, ordained to be their Guru-savior, who would look after them until they attained final emancipation.* The promise of the guru, as Jesus intimated to the disciples, is that \"If you are loyal to me, then even when my body is gone from the earth I will guide and protect you through my omnipresent consciousness.\" \"As lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west,\" so the Christ Consciousness that entered into the body of Jesus and illumined his whole being and his teachings •• - would spread out to enlighten not only the minds of The true \"second hi s immediate disciples, but all humanity for all time: coming\" of Christ: in \"Although my body, the Son of man in which each devotee's own the Christ Consciousness is personified, has to go consciousness through persecution and crucifixion and will be re- jected by this generation, the significance of my life and teachings— becaus e of their universality, completeness, and all-satisfying nature— will be accepted later throughout the world, as lightning covers the en- tire heavens.

Souls thus transformed from material body consciousness to refined soul realization find that the eagles of desires that feed on sen- sory temptations have fled, and in their stead the heretofore distant eagles of divine yearnings are attracted to feast on truth realizations.* Alas, through the misinterpretation of the above passages, many think that Jesus will return to earth again like lightning out of heaven. The Christ Consciousness of which Jesus spoke can come a second time in anyone, at any time—provided that devotee enlarge the cup of his consciousness until it can hold the infinite ocean of Christ Con- sciousness. A thousand Christs sent to earth would not redeem its peo- ple unless they themselves became Christlike by purifying and ex- panding their individual consciousness to receive therein the second coming of the Christ Consciousness, as was manifested in Jesus. It is futile to look for another coming of Jesus out of the clouds of the sky (see pages 1311 ff.). God, who is taciturnly humble, though almighty, will never permit such a spectacular demonstration of His glory be- fore the undevotional gaze of wicked people. But by moral discipline, continuous devotional prayer, and deep meditation, God can be con- tacted in inner silence as Ever New Joy. This joy felt in meditation de- notes also contact with Christ Intelligence in its essential oneness with God. When the devotee feels God and His reflected Christ-Son as the tangible bliss of meditation, he should offer the unctuous worship of his love on the altar of that divine perception—with all the devotion of the heart, with all the intuition of the soul, with all the undivided Son of God is the macrocosmic, universal, omnipresent Christ Consciousness: the pure reflection of God in all creation. The Son of man refers to the manifested Christ Con- sciousness as experienced and expressed in and through incarnate consciousness, as in the life of Jesus—or in any advanced devotee who intermittently or permanently up- lifts his consciousness to the state of Christ-realization, in which he perceives the Christ Consciousness reflected as his own soul, or manifested as a divine form.

And such devotees will also behold, in the light of their awakened Christ Con- Modertt World (New York: Ballantine Books, 1999), British journalist David Keys writes of one such incident whose particulars are strikingly reminiscent of Jesus' prophecy: \"In A.D. 535-36 mankind was hit by one of the greatest natural disasters ever to occur. It blotte d out much of the light and heat of the sun for eighteen months, and the climate of the entire planet began to spin out of control. The result, direct or indirect, was cli- matic chaos, famine, migration, war, and massive political change on virtually every con- tinent.\" The author has compiled evidence that the source of these changes was a super- massive volcanic eruption in Indonesia, which ejected such a huge volume of ash and dust into the atmosphere that the climate was changed worldwide. He goes on to say: \"The contemporary Roman historian Procopius wrote of the climate changes as 'a most dread portent.' In describing the climate that year, Procopius wrote that 'the sun gave forth its light without brightness like the moon during this whole year.' Other ac- counts of the event say that the sun became 'dim' or 'dark' for up to eighteen months. Its light shone 'like a feeble shadow,' and people were terrified.\" Keys cites similar accounts from historical records of Arabia, China, Japan, and other countries, as well as scientific evidence such as analysis of tree-ring growth in northern and western Europe and North America, where \"trees virtually stopped growing in the years 536 and 542-43\" and did not return to normal until more than twenty years later. *See also Discourse 73, commentary on Matthew 26:64: \"Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.\" 1313"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"sciousness, a gathering of the manifested presence of liberated souls (the \"elect\" or selected) from the four directions, or uttermost corners of the earth, and from distant parts of the astral heaven.* In this revelation to his disciples, and to any future devotees, Jesus spoke of the science of yoga. \"Look up and lift up your heads\": When devotees will have looked up into the spiritual eye and lifted the con- sciousness to the cerebral throne of light ( sahasrara or thousand-rayed lotus of life and light in the brain, which shines like a thousand suns in its power and glory) they could behold, through the manifestation of th e above-mentioned visions, some materialized form of Christ Con- sciousness, and perhaps see liberated souls as angels in the astral world. Then such devotees would know that they were spiritually advanced enough to be redeemed soon from earthly miseries and reincarnations — \"your redemption draweth nigh\"—to become lodged in the sor- rowless , fear-free, ever-new joyous state of Cosmic Consciousness. This veiled promise given by Jesus has created great misunder- standing among many Christian sects. These firmly believe that God will literally produce Jesus out of the clouds in the sky in a glorious display and with His power will destroy the \"wicked\" (non-conforming) people of the earth and give redemption to selected wor- shipers. Jesus said, \"This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.\" Yet, twenty cen- turies have passed, and Jesus has not yet come out of the clouds openly before the different nations, \"tribes.\" Many true devotees throughout the ages, however, have in ecstatic states of de- vout meditation seen Jesus coming out of the clouds of darkness of their closed eyes, resplendent in great power and glory. Saint Francis, * All personalized reflections of God are individualizations of His one omnipresent Christ Intelligence, referred to in the scriptures of India as Kutastha Chaitanya, the ubiquitous Universal Consciousness of Spirit. The angels and archangels (the Biblical Gabriel, Michael, etc.), the Hindu trinity of Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva (representing cre- ation, preservation, dissolution) and other deities (depictions of God's qualities and creative forces), and liberated masters at one with formless Spirit or serving souls in the supernal astral or causal regions, as also avatars who at God's behest incarnate for a time on earth as God's messengers to man and then return to the Cosmic Con- sciousness of Spirit or dwell as saviors in the highest heavenly realms—all can become manifes t to the advanced devotee. In vision, they are informed by the Cosmic Vibra- tion from the one Christ -Kutastha Intelligence that is the Essence of their being—as in the present verse wherein Jesus promises such an appearance of himself.

But it is a sadly futile wait for those who expect at some fu- tur e time for Jesus to come out of the clouds to establish and rule an ideal kingdom in this world (or for that matter, to take only a select few from earth to such a kingdom patterned after a glorified earth in heaven) . Jesus reigns everlastingly in God's kingdom of Infinity, redeeming souls who look to him for help in making their way to God. It is an ab- surd proposition—not least, a selfishly unkind one—to want the infi- nit e consciousness in Jesus to be confined forever in a limited form to rule a kingdom on earth (or in heaven) of a chosen few from the mul- titudes of God's children, the masses of which (even perhaps one's own beloved kin) would perforce forever thereafter exist in torment in perdi- tion. That would not be an act of the Almighty God I know whose love has filled my heart, nor the judgment of the exquisitely compassionate Jesus who forgave and blessed those who had fallen into sin. From his home in Infinity, Jesus observes with omnipresent aware- ness, along with other of God's angels and liberated masters, the affairs of man and the ordered destiny of the cosmic drama. The presence of Jesus and the Great Ones in the immanent Christ Consciousness re- sponds to any outreach of man's heart, and maintains a constant pull toward God in the tug-of-war with the outgoing influence of satanic power. Redemption is nigh at any time for those who loosen their souls from the bonds of maya and absorb their consciousness in the uplift- ing power of divine intercession and God's grace.

But to emphasize that his message was for all time, he affirmed that the truth of his words as a path to salvation—being the reflection of Cosmic Consciousness— would outlast even the dissolution of earth and astral worlds. Truth, and its manifest expression of wisdom, are changeless and eternal; cre- ation and its forces are subject to change and extinguishment. The words of Jesus embody eternal truth and hence they will abide to out- live the presumptuous perdurability of all created things. When Jesus said of the signs of the advent of liberation: \"But of that day and hour knoweth no man, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only,\" he was praising the singular grandeur of Almighty God who alone can know certain things, concealed even from His greatest devotees. God is the sole Knower unrestricted by the consequential relativities of time and space, cause and effect; everything is revealed in His consciousness of the Eternal Now, while even the angels have a conditional existence and overview in their purpose of serving the universal order through cos- mic law. As has been explained, the time of liberation of an individual is entirely problematic, dependent upon the use of one's free will and sub- ject to the acquired spiritual merits and the degree and depth of the de- votion with which one imbues one's efforts. Therefore, since the devotee himself determines the day and hour of liberation, according to his spir- itual ardor and quality of meditation, which can quicken it or delay it, only the Cosmic Consciousness within Itself knows and can foretell that auspicious moment. Liberated souls, however, who can say with Jesus, \"I and my Father are one,\" can thereby realize in a transcendent state the omniscience of God's Cosmic Consciousness; but this knowing is not al- ways immediately relatable to the here and now of a tedious cause-and- effect cosmos of conditional perspective. \"Take heed therefore, continuously pray, meditate, and watch the tricks of the fickle mind to see if it is centered on God or not; for you know not when trials and delusions will overtake you and test you as to whether you are qualifying for liberation.\" \"But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coining of the Son of man be.

One person may be a great devotee of God and the other, very material. God bestows sal- vation (Self-realization) upon people not according to any outward condition or attainment, but commen- surate with their inner spiritual qualifications.

The spiritual as- pirant must continuously ward off the invasion of delusions as he awaits the hour when Cosmic Consciousness and Christ Consciousness will visit him—\"when your Lord doth come\"—to offer final liberation. In Luke, when Jesus said \"one shall be taken and the other left,\" the disciples inquired, \"Where, Lord?\" and Jesus replied: \"Whereso- ever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.\" The verses in this context convey a further metaphysical truth: \"In that night—when the night of confusion and karmic dissolu- tion will come (when one's day of earthly activities is karmically dis- solved in the bewildering mystery of the nighttime of death)—then of two souls sleeping on one bed, at rest in the after-death state in the as- tral world, the virtuous one will be taken toward liberation, and the unvirtuous left behind ready to reincarnate again on earth. Of the souls of two women in the after-death state who were striving to work out their karma, the successful one will be liberated, and the one of inferior accomplishment left to reincarnate on earth to continue to work out her karma on the earth plane. And of two devotees roaming in the field of meditative divine communion after death, the advanced one will be taken into Cosmic Consciousness, and the other left to reincarnate for further spiritual endeavor on earth. \"Wherever the soul is encased—in the physical body or in the as- tral body or in the causal body—there the eagles of desires will gather to keep the soul a prisoner.\" A soul, being invisible, can only be distinguished by the presence of its body, whose existence is made possible by desires, the cohesive force of the three bodies. If salt water is encased in a jar, and that jar sealed within a second jar, and the two sealed within a third jar and immersed in the ocean, the imprisoned salt water, though within the ocean, cannot contact it. If the outer jar is broken, still the salt water cannot contact the ocean water. Only when the two other jars are broken also, can the salt water, freed from its containers, become one with the sea. The soul (individualized Spirit) is similarly encased and imprisoned in three bodies, existing one within the other. The soul is enveloped in 1320"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"the causal body, a matrix of thirty-five elemental ideas of conscious- ness, which in turn is encased by the astral body of nineteen elements, which itself is surrounded by the physical body of sixteen elements.* In earthly life, when one's will is broken by trauma that severs the desire to live, death comes. The soul, however, remains encased in the astral and causal bodies, which are held together by the power of un- fulfilled physical desires. The soul must work out all physical, astral, and causal desires in order to break the limitations that keep it imprisoned. Only then can the soul mingle with the eternal Spirit. Thus Jesus signified, in reply to the inquiry of the disciples, that the location of a soul can be known according to the presence of its bodies. Invisible souls can be distinguished, as to whether they are in the physical, astral, causal, or in the cosmos, according to their en- casements in the three little bodies or the great cosmic body. Where there is a gathering of the eagles of physical desires, the soul is evi- denced in a physical body. Where there is a gathering of the eagles of astral desires, a soul will be found wearing an astral body. The pres- ence of a causal body signifies a soul tenuously imprisoned therein un- der the influence of the eagles of causal desires. When the soul is liberated from its three small limiting bodies, it becomes united to its omnipresent cosmic body, where the eagles of noble perception soar high in the infinitude of Cosmic Consciousness. Whereas the three little bodies are held together by their distinguish- ing physical, astral, and causal desires, the cosmic body of infinitude is manifest in the Divine Will. The eagles of desires are both material and spiritual. So Jesus sig- nified that the eagles of physical desires gather around the physical body to feast on sensory temptations. The eagles of desires in the as- tral body thrive on finer astral sensations. Everything is enjoyed as wondrously changing and manipulatable forms of light and vibration. Astral beings see, hear, smell, taste, and touch all forms of astral cre- ation as mutable vibratory light. The eagles of causal desires consist of enjoying everything by ex- quisitely keen perceptions of pure consciousness only. Souls encased only in the causal body know the whole of creation to be materialized dream ideas of God. Souls awake in the causal body can materialize * See Discourse 6. 1321"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"anything they desire in thought forms more \"real\" than any physical sensation or astral perception, which are grossly dull and stifling to the soul's fine causal sensibilities. Souls encased in the thin veil of the causa l body work out their desires by manifesting them into dreams or condensed imagination, even as the Heavenly Father holds into be- ing all creation as a cosmic dream. As man transcends physical desires and progresses to the finer consciousness of astral and causal desires, he is endowed with a deeper realization of reality in his mastery of materializing anything in terms of astral light or in terms of condensed thoughts or dreams. He feels less tempted and bound by astral perceptions or the even finer causal perceptions than one experiences when attacked by the gross physical temptations endemic in the denser vibrations of material delusion. When the soul has overcome all desires and leaves the imprisonment of the three bodies, the eagles of superconscious perceptions soar in the Infinite in the soul's cosmic body, one with the cosmic-bodied Spirit.\"\" \"Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

The wise devotees had secured within their hearts enough oil of spiritual enthusiasm and deep regular med- itation to keep steadily aflame their lamps of wisdom.

But at the middle state—when they had moved partway to- ward the dawn of divine attainment — there was a vibration from within their souls that signified the approach of the bridegroom, the manifestation of Christ Consciousness, and that they must lift the light of their consciousness to meet him. The prepared celibates lifted their lighted lamps of Self-realization, but the five foolish devotees remained in darkness. Then they requested of the wise ones, \"Please give to us some of the oil of your devotion and vibrations of good habits, for the light of our Self-realization has gone out for lack of continuous spiritual enthusiasm.\" But the wise renunciants answered, \"It cannot be done. The oil of devotion cannot be transferred. This precious fuel cannot be obtained unless you yourself acquire it by your daily spiritual practices.\" So while the unprepared devotees were busy trying to attain the necessary devotion to reillumine their darkened lamps of Self-realization, the bridegroom of Christ Consciousness manifested in the consciousness of the five devoted celibates who were prepared and able to follow him to the realm of Spirit. There within their own consciousness they wit- nessed and participated in the uniting of the Christ Consciousness to Cosmic Consciousness, forever wedded to the Blissful Absolute. And then the door of divine manifestation was closed for awhile, so that when the five foolish devotees—trying to relight their delusion- extinguished devotion—prayed: \"Lord Christ Consciousness, manifest yourself in our consciousness,\" the inner voice replied, \"Verily, you are not yet ready to know (contact) the Christ Consciousness within you.\" Lest any sincere aspirants be found wanting, it behooves them to meditate deeply and devoutly to keep the intuitive inner consciousness always watchful and prepared for the unknown day or hour when the Son of man, the manifestation of Christ Consciousness, will manifest to them. When Jesus related this parable of the ten virgins, it was to em- phasize that even austere celibate renunciants cannot receive God with only a momentary illumination in their lamp of Self-realization; they must also have the oil of devotion and constant meditation and spiri- tual zeal to keep the inspiration of Self-realization continuously burn- ing. All who maintain the steady flame of spiritual ardor will surely be ready and able to receive the Divine One when unexpectedly He enters the inner chamber of consciousness perpetually lighted by the devotion of the heart and the wisdom of Self-realization. 1324"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"DISCOURSE 68 WUt J esus Meant Ly Everlasting PWnislknient The True \"Day of Judgment\" for the Righteous as Well as the Evildoers • Serving the Christ Spirit in the H ungry, the Sick, and the Destitute • Selfish Unsympathetic Persons Cannot Remain in the Astral Heaven of Beauty and Freedom • God Is Not a Merciless Judge Who Cond emns Souls to \"Everlasting Fire\" • Man Decrees His Own Punishment When He Accedes to the Evil Influence of Satanic Delusion • All God' s Children Are G iven Unending Opportunities to Find Salvation \"Even aeons of ignorance and wrong actions could not change the eternal soul's intrinsic divine nature....Since the soul is an emanation of God's own Being, it is manifestly impossible for man's true Self to be degraded into an evil entity meriting everlasting damnation.\""},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"J   V X' iiCXkJhen the Son of man shall come in his V r glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from an- other, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. \"Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, 'Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.' \"Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, 'Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty and gave thee drink?

A million years of persistent sin could attract a million years of vile incarnations, no more.

To my surprise, the man suddenly cried out, \"We are all sinners!

I then spoke soothingly, and quietly changed the subject. Presently I asked him, \"What about your unhappiness over that wicked son of yours?\" My host was astonished at my words and admitted that he experienced a constant sorrow over a wastrel son whom he seemed to be helpless to correct. \"I have a remedy for your misery,\" I said. Now the man's eyes gleamed with hope, and he smiled. \"If you can do anything for me— anything ,\" he said, \"I shall be grateful to you for the rest of my life.\" With a mysterious air, as if about to reveal a precious secret, I asked him in a low voice, \"Have you a stove with a large oven?\" With my hands I described the dimensions I wanted.

You, who are human and far from the perfection of God, cannot bear to inflict tor- ture on your son, no matter how evil he may be. Where did you ac- quire this instinct of love, if not from your Heavenly Father? Even a human father could not abide the cruel thought of punishing an erring son by roasting him alive. How, then, can you think of your supremely loving Heavenly Father as one who burns His own children in eternal hellfire and brimstone? God's love is infinitely greater than your fa- therly affection!\" The gentleman's eyes filled with tears of understanding. With new tenderness, he looked at me gratefully and said, \"Of course—I have always thought of our Heavenly Father as a God of love. He would not punish us forever for our ignorance.\" I concluded, \"We alone punish or reward ourselves here on earth by the effects of our own actions.\" When a man works evil, the seed tendencies of his sinful actions become lodged in the deep recesses of his consciousness, ready to ger- minate in the soil of favorable circumstances, and thence to sprout into evil habits in the present or a future incarnation. Once evil tendencies become evil habits, they compel one to more evil actions. In this way, a sinner creates for himself an endless hell of generative, compulsive tendencies that drive him to desperate depths of evil. He experiences in this cycle of torment what is meant by eternal damnation. Temptation to perform ignoble acts arises in man's consciousness through cosmic delusion, the influence of Satan and his agents of evil: anger, lust, greed, selfishness, and the myriad other enemies of godliness. By choosing to accede to malevolent promptings, man al- lows the devil a place in his life—the more heinous the act, the greater Man decrees his own punishment when he accedes to the evil in- fluence of satanic delusion 1333"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"the inroads made by satanic forces. Subtly ensconced in the ignorance that enshrouds man's soul, they stimulate ever-increasing evils of delu- sion and stoke the constantly burning fires of material craving in all unenlightened minds. Thus the Christ-imbued cosmic law's after-death decree of reincarnation on earth for the evil-obsessed: \"Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his an- gels\"— Satan and his agents and those mentalities, good as well as bad, they hold in the ignorance of delusion. Under human law a murderer, when apprehended, may be exe- cuted; but he goes free if his guilt is undetected. No such escape is pos- sible under the all-seeing cosmic law; from the very time the crime is committed, that evil couches itself in the perpetrator's consciousness as a cause-effect imprint that foreshadows an inevitable justice. This is not to say that the killer will necessarily be killed by some other in- dividual; the divine law does not write its verdicts according to the tit- for-tat policy, \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.\" Instead, the murderer begins to punish himself continuously, through conscience and a subconsciously present inner terror of the consequences for fail- ur e to act according to the law: \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\" He is haunted, perhaps only with searing sub- conscious effect, with the burning mental horror of the physical pain and loss of life he inflicted on his victim, now turned inward as ap- plicable to himself. If he does not free himself by repentance and spir- itual reformation in meditation, prayer, and God-communion, or at least satisfy his conscience by giving himself up unto the law, then, even if he goes scot-free in that incarnation, in his next life he will carry within his consciousness a karmic bomb of murder tendency, as well as a subconscious fear of being victimized himself. Under the in- fluenc e of anger or other violent emotion, that habit bomb might ex- plode into another sudden homicidal impulse, wherein he, in turn, migh t be slain. The circumstance of his death would not be decreed • • by the cosmic law for his past crime.

However, it is only that sinner's surrender to a sense of helplessness that condemns him to re- main under the damning influence of \"the devil and his angels.\" There is no sinful habit, however strong, that cannot be broken by good company, meditation, and continuous effort to adopt the counteracting transmuting power of an opposite good habit. A person with pernicious habits tends to forget that that mind-set was formed through repeated performance of wrong actions. Thus, even if former evildoers are very willing to be good, they should not expect that by one or a few good efforts they can be free from their past. But if they persist in right behavior and shun evil company and evil thoughts, which stimulate evil actions, they will certainly in time replace iniqui- tous habits with virtues. All erring children of God are given as many incarnations on earth as they need to work out their karma, until they become liberated by realizing and manifesting the perfect image of God within them. But in- stead of using their lifetimes to seek salvation, they create and feed the singeing fires of continuous earthly desires that keep the soul on desig- nate d rounds of incarnations on earth, a place of everlasting, or at least continuous, misery due to the constant presence of cosmic delusion. In that sense, the words \"everlasting punishment\" do describe earth. If man recalled all the sorrows and sufferings of his countless past life- times, he would know he has already endured the fires of hell and that now is the time to seek the everlasting heaven in God. If, however, the errors of one or many lifetimes are insufficient to warrant eternal damnation, how can virtuous actions of one or more incarnations merit eternal liberation? The answer lies in the immutable perfection of man's soul, All evil is only a tem- which becomes only temporarily identified with a porary graft on the mortal body. So long as a person thinks he is mor- immutable perfection tal, so long must he suffer the taunting challenges of the soul of the dualities of mortal existence. The delusion of mortal consciousness may distort the outer expression of the soul for a few or many incarnations; but sooner or later, through self-effort and evolutionary law imbued with God's uplifting grace, the soul re- gains its expression of wisdom. All evil accruing to man's nature is a passive graft, a transitory par- asite on the tree of life, which can be incised with the scalpel of wis- 1335"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"dom. As soon as man realizes that evil promises happiness and results only in unhappiness, he begins to wish for emancipation and starts in earnest his search for God. The desire for goodness and freedom invites God to come into one's life with His guidance and blessings. By soul-revealing meditation and right action (observing God's moral laws and the exhortations of His emissaries), the devotee pro- gresses surely toward Self-realization—the awakened consciousness of his soul and its oneness with God. Thus illumined, his age-old dark- ness of mortal ignorance vanishes. He returns to his home of Cosmic Consciousness to be liberated forever by the Father.* So although the notion of everlasting hellfire and damnation is untenable and should be banished from the superstitious minds of men, the existence of an Eternal Heaven in God is incorruptibly true. At the end of the trail of reincarnations, along which man has been led by his wandering material desires, he will find the blissful Heav- enly Father waiting to receive His children into His ever new Joy of \"life eternal.\" * \"One who is united to cosmic wisdom goes beyond the effects of both virtue and vice, even here in this life.

Like every God-ordained shepherd of souls, Jesus was attentive not only to the disciples in his im- mediate presence, but even to distant devotees who were in tune with him and ready to carry out his wishes. He wished to observe the feast of the Passover in the house of an especially devoted disciple, who made available the choice upper room in his home at his Master's request.* It is a custom in India, when great souls prepare to leave this earth, to celebrate with a banquet their release in Spirit. Jesus, too, just before his passing, observed this Oriental custom when he sent Peter and John to prepare, for him and the twelve disciples, not only the tra- ditional Passover but also a last supper. And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the Passover. And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.

Jesus intimated to Peter and John that the man would accede to their request without question and without their even mentioning Jesus' name; also, in the Aramaic and Persic manuscripts of the Gospel, \"the master saith to thee...\" is given as \"our master saith to thee\"—another intimation that the man was a brother disciple.

In any case, Jesus and the disciples in the aura of hi s blessings were in such an advanced state of consciousness that a little wine could have no ill effect on them; they were under the in- fluence only of the wine of ecstasy in the ever new joyous contact with God. Grossly inferior material intoxicants stimulate the senses, oblit- erate reason, and bring spiritual degradation. Satan invented the temptation of wine and sensual indulgence to delude people with counterfeit substitutes for the infinitely satisfying bliss of God-contact found in deep meditation. Seekers of divine ecstasy are adjured to ab- stain strictly from inebriating substances and sensual stimulants, which keep the life force and consciousness bound in body con- sciousness and easily become habit-forming. Sense-enslaved persons who are controlled by habits of wine or sex find themselves unable to partake of the supersensory, supremely intoxicating ecstasy of God- communion. The contents of the cup offered to the disciples was charged by Jesus with his divine vibrations of Holy Ghost Cosmic Energy, that the disciples might feel an upliftment and purification as they celebrated together the rites of Passover (liberation from bondage).* * The Feast of the Passover, one of the principal holy festivals of the Jewish year, com- memorates the deliverance of the people from their bondage in Egypt. As recounted in the Book of Exodus, God said to Moses: \"I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered My covenant. Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, 'I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyp- tians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: And I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians'\" (Exodus 6:5-7). The Biblical account relates that it took ten devastating plagues, prophesied by Moses, to convince the Pharoah to release the Israelites. The final punishment was the sudden death of the firstborn son of each Egyptian household. God had told Moses to have each Israelite family, on the specified day, prepare a meal of lamb, unleavened bread , and bitter herbs—and to daub the doorway of their homes with the blood of the lamb. \"For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. \"An d ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever....It is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, who passed over the houses of the chil- dren of Israel in Egypt, when He smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses\" (Ex- odus 12:23-24, 27). 1343"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, \"This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.\" Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, \"This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you\" (Luke 22:19-20).

Thereby, you will have found the way to liberation from suffering the cause-effect consequences of your past sin- ful actions.\" Jesus spoke of his sacrifice on the cross as the cup,*' and of the spir- itual lesson involved in his crucifixion as the contents of the cup of sac- rifice. When he asked his disciples to drink all of that cup, he did not mean that literal physical crucifixion is necessary in order to know God —nor that physical crucifixion alone bestows Christhood. To manifest his exalted state, Jesus had crucified ignorance by wisdom, restlessness by meditation, desires by renunciation, sense temptations by interior- ization of his consciousness, hatred by love, selfishness by unselfishness, before he was ready to take on victoriously the sufferings of the cross. These are the important prerequisites to Christhood. Anyone who can crucify physical attachment by God-communion will reach the state wherein even bodily crucifixion, in whatever form, can be endured, if necessary, for God and truth. Jesus' request that his disciples share the cup, therefore, was an ex- hortation to absorb into their own being his \"blood of the new testa- ment\" that would awaken in them the Christ Consciousness-imbued qualities of his exemplary life. His selfless sacrifice on the cross was the ultimate demonstration of his immortality-bestowing teachings of for- giveness, divine love, unshakable fortitude, wisdom, judgment, will power, supreme love of God, love and compassion for God's children, overcoming brute force by spiritual force, self-surrender (supplanting the wishes of the little ego-self by obedience to the will of God). In saying that his blood was to be \"shed for many for the remis- sion of sins,\" Jesus never meant that his crucifixion could wash away the sins of mere \"believers\" for all time to come. Such a possibility suggests a profound nonunderstanding of the complexity of \"sin\" and its roots in the universal law of karma. Obtaining forgiveness is *As he also prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane before his trial: \"Father, if Thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but Thine, be done\" (Luke 22:42). 1345"},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"more than a matter of belief. It requires the neutralization of the residual tendency seeds — and their potential for painful conse- quences— left in a wrongdoer's consciousness by his sinful actions. Certainly a master can partially or wholly free repentant devotees from the fruition of such seeds, cauterizing them by use of divine will force and cosmic energy, or working out the associated karmic burden on his own body. But it is a metaphysical error to think that merely because of professed be- lief in Jesus as Savior, one can feel free to act in any way one pleases within variably broad moral constraints—behaving in worldly ways and clinging to material desires and attachments—and yet be saved from after-death consequences by the sacrifice Jesus made on the cross nineteen hundred years ago. The awe-inspiring selflessness of his suffering and death no doubt absorbed and mitigated much of the karma of his disciples.* However, in his reference to the remission of sins Jesus was stating primarily that the extraordinary example of his sacrifice on the cross, through which he attained complete liber- ation in Cosmic Consciousness—freedom from the willingly accepted bonds of his mortal incarnation—would serve to inspire earnest truth-seekers to forsake inferior material attachments for the supreme attainment of God-consciousness. Reaching this state, they would be free from all sins, from the law of karma that keeps souls chained to the wheel of births and rebirths with their compensatory miseries from past wrongdoings.

Dur- ing the original Passover each Hebrew family sacrificed and partook of the flesh of a lamb, and the lamb's blood with which they marked their homes procured their safety during the divine punishment visited upon the Egyptians. Jesus used the familiar symbology of the Passover rites to declare the new testament, the covenant brought to the world through his life. Jesus would not have alluded to a practice even metaphorically equated to a concept of cannibalism [as cited in Discourse 43]. People desecrate the name of Jesus more than honor it by such su- perstition. He showed again and again that his \"body\" was not him- self. He was Spirit; he could pass through walls and walk on water be- cause he knew the real substance of his form to be consciousness. So \"flesh of Christ\" means his consciousness. \"Blood\" means the life of Christ, the Holy Ghost Cosmic Energy that is the life and the light of his little body called Jesus and his cosmic body of the universe. The out- ward ritual of symbolically celebrating the Lord's Supper or Holy Com- munion with bread and wine blesses sincere churchgoers with devo- tional upliftment and inspiration; but those who have true communion with Christ can perceive Jesus not merely in a ritualistic symbolic form, but in his formless infinitude as one with the all-pervading Christ Con- sciousness and universal light of the Holy Ghost Cosmic Energy. * Teresa of Avila spoke of seeing the formless Christ. She was much persecuted by the church officials for this abstruse assertion, until they discovered that centuries earlier the great church philosopher Saint Thomas Aquinas had also written of communion with the formless Christ.

This is the real import of partaking of the blood of Christ. By bathing in that Light, which was and is his manifest life and power, deeply meditating devotees are cleansed in the \"blood\" of divine energy that cauterizes their igno- rance, bad habits, and seed tendencies of past karma.

The species expressa is the reaction of the mind as a cognitive process. The former is impressed in the faculty which it de- termines , and corresponds to the passive phase of knowledge which is a necessary condition but is not yet actual knowledge. The latter is the active response of the fac- ulty, the cognitive process itself by which the mind reaches the object....In the beatific vision God's essence takes the place not only of the species impressa, but also of the species expressa.\" In familiar terms relevant to his knowledge, Aquinas echoed the truth of ecstatic realization voiced by the great sage Patanjali in his Yoga Sutras 1:17-18. \"He refers to two basic categories of samadhi: (1) samprajnata and (2) asamprajnata ,\" Paramahansa Yogananda explains in God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita. \"When used to define the preliminary stages of realization rather than its advanced states of fulfill- ment, then samprajnata and asamprajnata are relative terms used to distinguish initial supersensory experiences in meditation (samprajnata) from true samadhi or union with the object of meditation (asamprajnata). Samprajnata then refers to those primary states wherein the object of meditation is 'known accurately or thoroughly' through intuition that is still somewhat mixed with, or interpreted by, nature's subtle instru- ment s of perception—an interaction of the knower, the knowing, and the known....By contrast, asamprajnata then means those superconscious experiences that are perceived through pure intuition or realization—the direct perception of the soul by being one with the object of meditation—transcendent of any intervening instrument or princi- ple of nature.\" (Publisher's Note) * First Epistle of St. John, 1:5-7. 1349"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"tune in with his consciousness have truly tasted his \"flesh\" of Christ Consciousness, \"the bread which came down from heaven\" of which \"he that eateth...shall live for ever.\"* It is this that Jesus desired all devotees to do \"in remembrance of me.\" But among those who were with him at that Last Supper, not all had ears to hear. \"But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.

As explained earlier [Discourses 25, 35, 46, 57, The law of karma in and 66], Jesus was fully aware that his death \"was de- relation to Jesus' cru- termined\" karmically by his own actions: taking onto cifixion and the fate himself the burden of many sins of his disciples and of his betrayer followers, and inviting retaliation by his defiance of the man-made laws of the social and religious hierarchy. The scriptures predicted the ordeal of Jesus because the prophets intuitively calculated the karmic effect to be incurred in carrying out his God-given mission. Jesus himself made it clear that he could have chosen at any time, even up to the moment of his crucifixion, to avert his fate. It was his own free choice, gladly made, to offer himself in supreme sacrifice for the healing and ultimate salvation of many by alleviation of their karmic burden. Jesus' words in the above verses emphasized that Judas, too, must perforce bear the responsibility as well as the consequences of his own choices . The karmic law would decree fearsome retribution on Judas for voluntarily choosing to act as a tool of Satan's delusion and evil in betrayal of his God-given master. Jesus readily bestowed understand- ing and forgiveness on the woman taken in adultery, telling her ac- cusers, \"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.\" And on the cross he asked God's mercy even for those who car- ried out his torturous execution. But of the traitor Judas he said: \"Woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! Good were it for that man if he had never been born.\" Clearly, treachery is an extreme sin. Man's culpability in sins of the flesh is mitigated because he is en- slaved by the maya- imposed compulsion of the senses. But treachery is deliberate, willful — the most heinous sin before the tribunal of God's cosmic law. One who vows loyalty to his guru, and then breaks that vow in an act of betrayal, commits the ultimate treachery. God's laws deal severely with anyone who thus turns against one's God-sent messenger; it is thereby a betrayal of God Himself. Yet even in such an egregious case of wrongdoing, Jesus did not for- sake this soul he had accepted long before as one of his spiritual sons in the unconditional divine relationship of guru and disciple.

And he said unto him, \"Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.\" And he said, \"I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me\" (Luke 22:33-34).

But there are inherent defects in this method, inasmuch as the conclu- sion may be entirely wrong if there is the slightest mistake in discerning that person's behavior or underlying motives.

Prac- tical wisdom prompted Jesus in the above verses to emphasize the ne- cessity for commonsense adaptability in applying spiritual truths rightly in the world of relativity. He pointed out that high-minded, ad- vanced disciples experiencing the manifestation of Christ Conscious- ness need neither personal possessions nor any mode of protection; all their needs are supplied through their attunement with that Universal Intelligence. Such devotees never worry about taking care of the body, what they shall eat or what they should put on, for all these things shall be added unto them as a part of their divine realization. They are fully satisfied in the nonchalant sufficiency of having much or little. But Jesus further notes that persons whose consciousness is not yet set- tled in God-consciousness should exercise common sense and good judgment in supplying themselves with bodily necessities and reason- able protection. He knew that when the aureole of his divine presence would be withdrawn, his disciples would go through many tests and \"•Isaiah 53:12: \"...and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.\" 1355"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"trials, which might demand the use of money—or even the appear- ance of protection in the carrying of a sword. Jesus signified that the God within him would be humbly un- moved, even though classified, in the eyes of ignorance, as an ordinary criminal. Everything in his life and his death would accomplish a di- vine purpose. Against the dark background of human nonunder- standing that reckoned him \"among the transgressors,\" the light of his divinity would shine all the more brilliantly. Jesus' practicality foresaw that if his disciples carried visible weap- ons they would have reasonable protection from unscrupulous perse- cuting fanatics. But he did not want all of his faithful apostles to be equipped like soldiers! Their most powerful protection lay in their virtue and wisdom, not in swords. Two swords would be a sufficient statement of their courage that would deter cowardly persecutors. That, in reality, was the purpose Jesus wanted the swords to serve; he never desired that they be used for bloodshed. Deeply spiritual persons who, by the very nature of their practices, are meek and humble within do not allow themselves to be inwardly distressed by persecution. Nevertheless, they need not offer themselves as doormats to be unnecessarily trampled upon by the ignorant. Righ- teous persons should display righteous thoughts and fearlessness to overcome their abusers. Jesus foresaw that Peter's fierce loyalty to his master would result in the regrettable use of a sword to cut off the ear of one of the guards who came to arrest Jesus.* Though Jesus did not wish for such violence, he preferred his disciples to be courageous in righteous indignation rather than to fly away through cowardice. He well understood that the impending persecution would strike terror into the hearts of some of his disciples, and he wanted to prepare their consciousness to be strong and fearless in defending the divine cause. Jesus had already taught the disciples that to conquer evil by spir- itual force is the highest way—to turn the left cheek when slapped upon the right one.f But he points out here that it is sometimes nec- essary to resist evil by a show of physical force if the power to resist evil spiritually is lacking. To flee from evil through fear is cowardly and unspiritual; to resist evil by physical force is better than that; but to conquer evil by superior spiritual force is the consummate ideal. \"John 18:10 (see Discourse 73). fSee Discourse 27, commentary on Matthew 5:38-42 and Luke 6:29-30. 1356"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"These verses speak of Jesus' pragmatic application of divine wis- dom.

If I, as your guru and as a true manifestation of the Christ Consciousness that rules all creation, have in humbleness washed  —  you r feet, then you ought to serve each other like- Washing the feet of wise. For I have given you an example, that you the disciples: Jesus' di- should do unto all as I have done to you.\"  vine example of hum- Since the spiritual servant, the disciple, is not ble service to all greater than his master or guru as regards his state of realization, and is not equal until he attains final liberation and be- comes one with the consciousness of his master in Cosmic Conscious- ness, so also neither Jesus nor his disciples, who were sent on earth by God, could be greater than God. And if God in Jesus served the disci- ples (who, being created by God, were subordinate to Him), it cer- tainly behooved them to follow the divine example by humbly serving all, even to the least, no matter how high their own spiritual status. With this compelling demonstration, Jesus hoped that his disciples, in turn, would be inspired not only to \"wash the feet\" of each other— to treat each other in the same spirit of love and respect he had shown to them—but also to extend that spirit of service to all people, physi- cally, mentally, and spiritually. He assured the disciples that if they un- derstood and remembered the lessons he had taught them, and gov- erned their lives accordingly, they would realize the immutable spiritual happiness of a life sheltered in the pure humility of selflessness. Even the Heavenly Father serves impartially in silent humbleness: He has created the water in the well, and as the indwelling Spirit in the water and in every person, it is He who washes the feet of His children 571"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"—even the egotistical and materialistic persons who never honor Him. By washing the feet even of Judas, who was going to betray him, Jesus intimated that those disciples who would be like their master ought to act like him by ministering unto others without discriminat- ing as to whether they were friends or enemies—to render help to everyone alike whenever they were in dire need. It was because of his foreknowledge of the impending betrayal by Judas that Jesus said, \"What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.\" He wanted to bring out, through the drama of washing the feet of each one of the disciples, the fact that one among them was spiritually unclean. When Peter refused to be ministered to in this way, Jesus admon- ished him: \"If I wash you not, you are not spiritually connected with me as a disciple is with his master.\"* Jesus was emphasizing the im- portance not of physical washing but of spiritual cleansing as first and foremost. This is made evident by his saying, in effect: \"He who is spir- itually washed needs only an occasional physical cleansing to be clean in every way. Most of you are spiritually clean, but not all of you.\" Thu s he dramatically foretold his knowledge of the betrayal of Judas. \"I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, 'He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.'f Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he. \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth Him that sent me.\" * Washing his disciples' feet also afforded Jesus the opportunity to impart to them pu- rifying blessings through the magnetic exchange of vibratory energy. As explained ear- lier, the hands and feet function as positive and negative poles which when contacted generate a flow of subtle currents of life force. In the time-honored custom of touch- ing the feet of great souls, the disciple is the negative pole that is surcharged with di- vin e power from the master who is the positive pole. When Jesus washed the feet of his disciples he operated this same law, the meeting of positive and negative poles— with himself as the positive, the disciples as the negative—and thereby through the touch of his hands blessed the disciples with spiritually purifying vibrations. t\"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me\" (Psalms 41:9). 572"},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and tes- tified, and said, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.\" Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake. He then ly- ing on Jesus' breast saith unto him, \"Lord, who is it?\" Jesus answered, \"He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it.\" And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, \"That thou doest, do quickly.\" Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, \"Buy those things that we have need of against the feast\"; or, that he should give something to the poor. He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night (John 13:18-30). ^TTam not speaking of all of you as being defiled by ignorance and ILtraitorous intent; I know whom my intuition has detected ('cho- sen') from amongst you as the one who would vol- • - untarily through evil karma and influence of delusion Through intuition, betray me.

Jesus merely stated that his divine intuition detected the malign thoughts of Judas whose intent was to betray him, being un- der the influence of satanic delusion.* The love of God that characterized the greatness of Jesus re- sponded to the pure immediacy of John's devotion, so that notwith- standing the usual reserve in the presence of divinity, this beloved dis- ciple was often allowed by Jesus to lean on his breast—as would a child seeking succor from its mother. This divinely human nature of Jesus, an avatar in whom God was fully manifest, was so tenderly lov- ing that it shows how intimately personal is the love of God that can be received by anyone who loves God deeply, as John did. The love shown by Jesus is the love of God; this Jesus expressed in one of his greatest sermons, when he said (in the next series of verses): \"A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you.\" Jesus thus conveyed to the disciples that he loved them as God loved them; and that it was of no use for them to love him with a selfish love that did not include love for one another as he loved them. Divine love is a transcending power, elevating and all-embracing; mun- dane love is self-seeking and circumscriptive. Jesus taught his disciples not only to feel God as the great manifestation of love and ever new joy in meditation, but also to love God in His tangible presence in the temples of human bodies. In answer to John's query as to the identity of the betrayer among them, Jesus said he would point out the malefactor by giving him a piece of bread he had dipped. Jesus' words after giving the bread to Judas signified: \"O Judas Iscariot, you are possessed by satanic cosmic delusion due to your evil karma; therefore, do quickly what you have made up your mind to do and get it over with, lest you harbor your evil impulse longer and become ready to do greater evil.\" * See also Discourse 69, explanation of karma and free choice in the context of Luke 2:2:2.1-23. 574"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, \"Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.

Regardless of troubles, remain securely focused on the Divine Consciousness on both planes—in the cosmic vi- bratory region and in the quiescent realm beyond all vibrations. \"See also commentary on John 15:12 and 15:17 (in which Jesus repeats this com- mandment), Discourse 71. 576"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"\"In the kingdom of Cosmic Consciousness and cosmic creation (the Father's house) there are many mansions, regions differing in their vibrations, where souls dwell according to their earth-acquired good or bad vibrations.

And when the Christ Consciousness in me has thus merged in Cosmic Con- sciousness, I will try to bring you there. My Christ Consciousness, at- tracted by your devotion and ecstasy, will come again—be manifest a second time in your consciousness—and merge your body-born con- sciousness in Itself, that you, too, may become omnipresent.

And once you know the abode of Christ Consciousness as omnipresence, you will know the way to commune consciously with that Universal Intelligence at any time.\" When Jesus said, \"Let not your heart be troubled,\" he voiced an exact parallel to a profound spiritual aphorism in the Yoga Sutras, the preeminent ancient treatise on Raja Yoga. There the -•-•- illumined sage Patanjali says that yoga, union with The imperturbable God, is possible only by stilling the restlessness of the calmness advised by heart (chitta, the feeling faculty of consciousness).\"' Jesus and the science The restless disturbances of chitta that distort man's of yoga perception of his real Self, the soul-image of God within, are agitations born of the likes and dislikes of the body-bound ego, or pseudosoul. The mind made restless by the attractions and re- pulsions of the senses cloaks the soul in an appearance of imperfection; but the soul, being an individualized reflection of Spirit, is immutably ever perfect. The divine nature of that Self is clearly perceived as soon as the heart, the responses of feeling, becomes perfectly calm. This is what Jesus intended, advising his disciples to take the entirety of human experiences calmly, like the Oriental yogi, without forming egoistic likes and dislikes—attraction to what is pleasant, aversion to what is painful or difficult. Souls are sent on earth by God to watch His cosmic motion pic- ture with a calm, nonattached consciousness befitting souls made in * Yoga Sutras 1:2.

But when they respond to earthly experiences with the permutations of likes and dislikes, they lose their immortal con- sciousness. Any soul who forgets its spiritual status during its earthly sojourn forms mortal attachments, and thus has to reincarnate until th e mundane desires are worked out and the lost divine consciousness is regained. That is why Jesus and Self-realized yogis advise all truth- seekers to pass through trials, fortunes and misfortunes, struggling for righteousness with an undisturbed state of heart, as the way of at- taining salvation, Cosmic Consciousness.* Thus when Jesus says, \"In my Father's house are many man- sions,\" he warns his disciples that unless they attain Cosmic Con- sciousness, after death they would have to dwell on one of the variously graded planes of existence where unredeemed souls go according to their mer- its and demerits. His promise, \"I go to prepare a place for you,\" refers to the fact that the blessings of a true guru can help his disciples to gain a better place in the many-mansioned vibratory spheres in the after-death state. In my autobiography I have recounted how, dur- ing my experience of the resurrection of my guru, Swami Sri Yuktes- warji, he described his dwelling as a savior in a supernal region of the astral heaven inhabited by souls who have overcome earthly ties. His words were a wondrous assurance: \"There you and your exalted loved ones shall someday come to be with me.\"t So when Jesus said he would prepare a place for his disciples, he signified his role as their guru who, even after his passing, would con- tinue to help them toward their attainment of Cosmic Consciousness. * \"When the chitta (feeling) is absolutely subjugated and is calmly established in the Self, th e yogi, thus devoid of attachment to all desires, is spoken of as the God-united.... \"The state of complete tranquility of the feeling (chitta), attained by yoga meditation, in which the self (ego) perceives itself as the Self (soul) and is content (fixed) in the Self; \"The state in which the sense-transcendent immeasurable bliss becomes known to the awakened intuitive intelligence, and in which the yogi remains enthroned, never again to be removed; \"The state that, once found, the yogi considers as the treasure beyond all other treasures—anchored therein, he is immune to even the mightiest grief; \"That state is known as yoga—the pain-free state. The practice of yoga is there- fore to be observed resolutely and with a stout heart\" (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita Vl:i8, 20-23). tSee Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 43.

Thereby their consciousness would expand into the om- nipresence of Christ Consciousness, \"receive you unto myself,\" through which they would attain final liberation in Cosmic Consciousness. When Jesus says, \"Whither I go ye know, and the way ye know,\" he reminds his disciples that the abode of Christ Consciousness is om- nipresence, and the way to that abode lies in the art of keeping the heart untroubled by earthly experiences, remaining settled in the om- nipresent Christ Consciousness in the soul, and thereby uniting human consciousness with Cosmic Consciousness. Thomas saith unto him, \"Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?\" Jesus saith unto him, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

No human being who is a part of vibratory creation can take his consciousness to Cos- mic Consciousness, \"the Father\"—which lies beyond vibratory cre- ation and the immanent Christ Consciousness—without first experi- encing the Christ-imbued Cosmic Vibration, or Holy Ghost, that \"I am the way\": At- tunement with Christ Consciousness is the only way to the Father's kingdom 579"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"manifests vibratory creation, then passing through the God-reflection of Christ Consciousness. In other words, to \"come unto the Father\" every human consciousness has to expand and attain realization of the Cosmic Vibration first, and then know Christ Consciousness, in order to reach Cosmic Consciousness. Jesus went on to say that everyone who had \"known\" him (con- tacted the Christ Consciousness in him) should realize that they had also automatically contacted the Cosmic Consciousness (the \"Father\"), for the Cosmic Consciousness and Its only begotten reflection om- nipresent in creation—the Christ Consciousness—are one. Here Jesus clearly explained his inner Self as Spirit. He never em- phasized his body, always the omnipresent Spirit within the body. It is important to remember the above point as a basis of understanding the spiritual cosmography: that the Christ Consciousness is the pri- mary substance and essence, \"the truth, and the life\" of vibratory cre- ation—the noumenon existing behind every phenomenon. When Jesus said: \"Ye know Him, and have seen Him,\" he never meant that the thousands of people who saw the body of Jesus realized that here was a manifestation of Christ Consciousness, and therefore of the Father. Only those advanced disciples who attuned themselves with Christ Consciousness by deep meditation could realize the presence of the Fa- ther as one with the Christ Consciousness manifested in the incarnate form of Jesus. Philip saith unto him, \"Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\" Jesus saith unto him, \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip f He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, 'Shew us the Father'?

It is evident that Philip had A not yet fully \"known\" Jesus, had not perceived the Christ Con- sciousness so long manifested in the body of Jesus. So when Philip asked to see the Father, Jesus ex- \"I am in the Father, plained once more; he spoke briefly, meaning: \"He and the Father in me\" who has, by ecstasy, contacted the Christ Con- sciousness in me, my true Self, has automatically also contacted the Cosmic Consciousness whose reflection I am. Then how is it that you ask me to show you the Father when you cannot contact Him with- out first contacting the Christ Consciousness, even that which is with you in myself?\" Since one must raise the consciousness by the degrees mentioned above, Jesus repeated the same thought as when he de- clared, \"No man cometh unto the Father, but by me,\" telling Philip that the Christ Consciousness in him was in the Cosmic Conscious- ness and that the Cosmic Consciousness was reflected in that Christ Consciousness. Jesus went on to say that the words of wisdom uttered through his voice were actuated not by himself, but by the vibrations of Cos- mic Consciousness to which his consciousness was attuned. Most hu- man beings are guided by their ego working behind the instrumental- ities of the body; but Jesus recognized that the Cosmic Father, dwelling behind his Christ Consciousness, was the sole Doer working through his body and Christ mind. He suggested that the disciples should first believe that his Christ Consciousness was one with the Cosmic Con- sciousness, and thus that he was \"in the Father, and the Father in me,\" knowing that they could then in time realize this truth by their own experience in meditation. But meanwhile, if they could not fully con- ceive that the Father was in him, he asked that they at least believe in the Father's divine manifestation in all the sacred and good works manifested through his life. Then—by the totality of the present, past, and future truth which Jesus perceived within himself—he prophesied to the disciples that any devotee who, by deep meditation, realizes the presence of the om- nipotent Christ Consciousness in himself, as it was in Jesus, shall be able to perform the miraculous acts of healing, raising the dead, and 583"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"every manner of good works that were manifested through the body called Jesus. This prophecy included future devotees, for he meant that all who were (and all who are now or will be) in tune with Christ Consciousness would perform what he had done, and even greater miracles than he had demonstrated. Jesus foretold these truths because he knew that his Christ Consciousness was soon to be re- leased from the body to be united with the Cosmic Consciousness. He wanted to assure the world through his disciples that the manifold miraculous happenings of his life were not the end of the wondrous works of God. Since God is infinite, His miraculous works are infi- nite; and they would from time to time be revealed through the lives of great saints and in the patient researches of generations of scien- tists. Jesus' words foreshadowed the miracles of modern aviation, ra- dio, television, submarines, control and cure of diseases, the unravel- ing of the mysteries of the atom — as well as the reason-defying miracles of great saints who are in tune with the omnipresent Christ- Kutastha Intelligence. In Autobiography of a Yogi I have written of man y God-knowing saints whose powers yet confound the known sci- entific norms by the workings of higher laws whose secret chambers are still to be unlocked to common knowledge.

One who overcomes the bondage of delusion is said to possess the eight principal powers, or maha siddhis —the aish- varyas, \"ascetic majesties.\"* The potential in the soul, the God-image in man, is limitless once it breaks the bodily circumscriptions and unites with its infinite Self. The soul's manifesting powers increase with its expanding identifica- tion with its superconscious cosmic body, then with the infinite Christ * \"The eight principal divine powers, referred to as aishmryas, which can be manifested by the incarnate being who has attained mastery over the forces of creation, are as fol- lows: the power to make one's body or any object (i) as small as desired ( anima ), (2) as large as desired (mahima), (3) as light in weight as desired ( laghima ), and (4) as heavy as desired ( garima ); the power (5) to obtain anything desired ( prapti), (6) to bring anything under his control ( vashitva ), (7) to satisfy all desires by the force of his will (prakamya), and (8) to become Isha, Lord, over everything. In the Yoga Sutras of the sage Patanjali, other powers ( siddhis ) are also discussed.

And scientists will discover the method of carrying on interplanetary communication, and far bet- ter ways of treating human maladies. So many yet-to-be revealed mar- vels are what Jesus referred to when he spoke of the \"greater works\" that would in some future time be manifested. Science has already done great things; but still it has very little control over the nervous system and mind for elevating the human consciousness, which can be attained by the science of yoga as taught by God-realized masters, as also by Christ to his disciples. Their path of God-realization is not one of negative deprival, but renunciation of delusion's petty offerings in order to realize the all-inclusiveness of God's kingdom. The miracles of Jesus were not an end in themselves, but to convince people that finding God is much greater than any worldly accomplishment. His wonders were not to entertain people or just to give them temporary succor—or to so establish himself that for the centuries to come generations would adore his name and build churches in his honor, while never understanding what he meant for them to learn: that they also are intended to achieve oneness with the omnipotent Christ Consciousness.* When Jesus declares, \"Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do,\" it is not so simple as just saying, \"Jesus, please make me as spiritually great as Saint Francis\"; or, \"Jesus, make me as rich as Henry Ford,\" and it will be so.

That is why Jesus promised that whatever a devotee asked while intuitively perceiving the Cosmic Vibration and the Christ Consciousness in him (in his \"name\"), he would materialize, that the Cosmic Consciousness (\"the Father\") might be glorified through its all-powerful reflection in the Christ Consciousness (\"the Son\"). \"If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Fa- ther, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him: but ye know Him; for He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.

If a devotee loves him (that is, loves contact with the Christ Consciousness in him) then he or she must faithfully follow the commandments—the laws of bodily and mental discipline and medita- tion—which are required to manifest the Christ Consciousness in the individual's own consciousness. Then Jesus said that if their love was actively expressed in the ardor of spiritual endeavor, he would pray, intercede, for his disciples, and all truth-seekers, that by their deep meditation they might contact another Comforter of all human sorrows—the Holy Ghost or Cosmic Vibration which exists in every human soul forever * This meditation technique is taught in Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons (see page 1575 and \" Aum Technique\" in glossary).

Cosmic Consciousness is an oceanic Presence that can- not be received in the small cup of worldly human consciousness. But when the devotee hears within himself in deep meditation the cosmic sound of the Holy Ghost vibration and then merges his consciousness in that vibration, he experiences an expanding consciousness and awareness that this sound is the repository of Truth expressing the presence of the Infinite. The devotee at first has moments of intuitive perceptions of Cosmic Consciousness dwelling within his soul, and in time learns to be aware of it constantly. Finally, Jesus told the beloved advanced disciples that although his body would soon be gone, yet he would leave with them the art of contacting the great comforting Bliss present in Cosmic Vibration; and through that contact, the Christ Consciousness would be revealed to them a second time. \"Yet a little while my body will be present in the world, and then the world shall lose sight of this body and the Christ Consciousness in it. But those of you who are advanced, contact the Christ Conscious- ness; in it you will find my life and your life and know that Infinite In- telligence to be the condition of all life existing in the cosmos and in the hereafter.\" Jesus added that on the day divine wisdom manifested in them through an expanded consciousness, they would know that all forms are related: Christ Consciousness is in the bosom of Cosmic Con- sciousness and the devotee's consciousness is manifested in Christ Con- sciousness and Christ's life can manifest in the awakened devotee's life. Jesus then declared that any truth-seeker who is in tune with his commandments of self-discipline, and practices them in every aspect of his life, will eventually be able to contact and devotedly love the Christ Consciousness that was present in Jesus (and is within every- one). And any devotee who loves the Christ Consciousness receives the love in that Consciousness and also the love present in the Cosmic Consciousness, manifesting itself to him through his divinely attuned consciousness .

He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me. These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. \"But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Fa- ther will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you\" (John 14:22-26). J esus knew that his body was not ordained to appear, after resurrec- tion, to the people of the world en masse. So he said that after res- urrection he would be visible only to his advanced disciples and en- lightened followers—those who \"love me\" and \"will keep my words.\" • •  Further, it was important for them to realize that he How the devotee's was not speaking primarily of his physical body and consciousness becomes its appearance to devotees. Rather, whenever a devo- an altar of Christ and tee loves the Christ Consciousness, the reflection of Cosmic Consciousness the Heavenly Father that was in Jesus, and wishes to contact that manifestation through meditation, he will surely follow Jesus' words of wisdom and the forms of self-discipline that will lead to such contact. The devotee who can regularly contact the Christ Consciousness will also feel the love of the Cosmic Consciousness, \"the Father,\" and both will appear in the consciousness of that devotee; and Their united vibrations, which bring forth manifestations of Their Divine Presence, will permanently dwell in him. But the person who does not follow the teachings of contact with the Cosmic Vibration, \"keepeth not my sayings,\" finds no realization of the Christ Consciousness within himself, and thus feels no attachment to it, \"loveth me not.\" When Jesus said, \"We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him,\" he specifically cited the advanced devotee who by meditation attains the state of Christ Consciousness and holds on to it with an increasing fer- vor of divine love, and who thereby gradually feels the state of Cosmic Consciousness. Such a devotee can experience Christ Consciousness in all creation and Cosmic Consciousness beyond all creation. His con- sciousness becomes an omnipresent altar where both reign—and both \"make Their abode\" with him. Just as a man can have both great wis- dom and devotion for God, so the advanced devotee is endowed with 588"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"many differing exalted states of consciousness. He feels the Holy Ghost as great bliss, Christ Intelligence as great wisdom, and Cosmic Con- sciousness as the essence of bliss, love, wisdom, and everything that is in the cosmos and in Infinity. The ordinary man is guided by his book knowledge, worldly experience, and habits acquired in past incarnations; but the advanced devotee is guided by the omniscient intelligences of God, Christ, and the Holy Ghost. Again Jesus reminded the disciples that the Cosmic Vibration or \"word which ye hear,\" the Holy Ghost whose sound they heard within themselves, was not a manifestation of his power, \"but the Father's,\" the emanation of Cosmic Consciousness, \"which sen t me,\" which also reflected Itself as the Christ Consciousness present in him. By divine ordinance, Jesus revealed many truths to the disciples while he was present with them, but promised that when, by meditation, they contacted the Holy Ghost, the Cosmic Vibration made sacred by the presence of Christ Consciousness within it, then they would know that the Father was sending that Cosmic Vibration, or Comforter, \"in my name.\" And from this Holy Vibration that they were to contact in meditation would emanate the great Christ Bliss present in it, to comfort them in all miseries. Jesus further stated that the Christ-imbued Cosmic Vibration would not only give them great comfort and bliss, but would bring them the knowledge of all things and recall from their memory the wisdom he had implanted within them, for the Holy Ghost is the source of all materialized creation and hence of all earthly and astral wisdom. It was that Cosmic Vibration which manifested in the disci- ples on the day of Pentecost: And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. Now when this was noised abroad, Contact with \"the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost\" im- parts divine wisdom and bliss 589"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language. And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, \"Behold, are not all these which speak Galileans? And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?\"...Others mocking said, \"These men are full of new wine.\" But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, \"Ye men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jeru- salem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; And it shall come to pass in the last days [the culmination of divine realization], saith God, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh....And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved\"' (Acts Z:I-ZI). In this experience, the apostles received baptism in the Holy Ghost Cosmic Vibration, the great Amen or Aum (\"a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind\"), which had been promised to the faithful disciples by Jesus.* It bestowed on them the awakening of the spiritual eye: \"There appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them\"—the cleft rays of life energy, pranic light, emanating from the astral center in the medulla oblongata (ajna chakra) converged into the single divine eye of superconscious per- ception ablaze in their foreheads. The astral center in the medulla is the switch that transmits life- force currents into the two physical eyes. These two currents, concen- trated outward through the physical eyes, empower their perception of the material world. When the eyes are upturned, their gaze fixed at the point between the eyebrows in meditation, they become supernat- urally still; then the bifurcated life currents flowing from the medullary center into the two eyes converge as one at the Christ -Kutastha cen- ter, producing the vision of the luminous single eye. Penetrating the in- ner portals of this astral eye of light, one can cognize, successively, all physical, astral, and ideational qualities and vibrations of the Holy Ghost realm of Cosmic Nature; Christ Consciousness reflected in that universal sphere; and Spirit beyond all form and vibration. •Acts 1 :5 (see Discourse 69). 590"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"The Holy Ghost Cosmic Vibration, being the source of all sounds and hence of every language, enabled the disciples to speak in diverse tongues.

Every baby, before he becomes famil- language iar with a particular language and learns to vocalize it, is already equipped with thought and sensations. Babies throughout the world cry out in the same language and same sounds. Sensations of light, sound, smell, taste, and touch produce certain thought perceptions and the baby tries to express those thoughts in language. Universal emotions of pain and joy, love, anger, all such feelings, were originally expressed in the same language. Gradually, mispro- nunciation, geographical separation, and climatic conditions with their influence on the bodily instrument of speech, gave rise to diverse lan- guages. Yet at the bottom of these languages is a commonality of sen- sation and thought. God, and His emanations of Christ Consciousness and Cosmic Vi- bration, are the conscious intelligent forces behind the consciousness of all beings. Having no constraints of evolutionary verbiage, these In- telligences instantly know and decipher the thoughts and languages of the different nations of the earth. Any devotee who is as advanced as the disciples of Christ, and can in a state of ecstasy tune in with the Cosmic Vibration, can likewise know the thoughts of all men and translate them into any language. This is how the disciples on the day of Pentecost, being filled with the Holy Ghost, manifested omniscient knowledge and could vocalize their thoughts in diverse tongues. \"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Ye have heard how I said unto you, 'I go away, and come again unto you.' If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, 7 go unto the Father': for my Father is greater than I. \"And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.

But that the world may know that I love the Fa- ther; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence\"* (John 14:2.7-31). U nlike the world, which gives only perishable things, Jesus left with his disciples imperishable Christ-peace. That peace he gave to all who were able to attain it, so that they could enjoy it always in meditation and ecstasy. The heart is the center of the emotions, so Jesus referred to it in tell- ing his disciples to keep their feelings free from the roiling vibrations of —— restlessness and fear, so that the lake of consciousness \"My peace I give unto might remain calm to reflect the Christ Consciousness you\": Let not your without distortion. He then reminded them, as he had heart be troubled or told them before, of his departure and return (his im- afraid  pending crucifixion and resurrection), and of the fi- nal dissolving of his body into Spirit, from which time on his Christ Consciousness would manifest in each devotee's meditating consciousness.! He added that if they loved the Christ Consciousness in him, they would rejoice for his sake because he was going to be reunited with the Cosmic Consciousness, absolute liberation in Spirit, greater than his incarnate state of universal Chris t-Kutastha Consciousness.^: * Though Jesus concludes by saying \"Arise, let us go hence,\" his discourse to the dis- ciple s at the Last Supper continued, as recorded in Chapters 15-17 of St. John's gospel (to be commented on in Discourses 71 and 72). fCf. John 16:7 (Discourse 71): \"Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.\" tThe Bhagavad Gita speaks of the devotee's perception of Transcendental Spirit, higher than communion with the Christ-Kutastha Intelligence that informs creation and em- bodied Sons of God: \"There are two Beings (Purushas) in the cosmos, the destructible and the inde- structible. The creatures are the destructible, the Kutastha is the indestructible. But ther e exists Another, the Highest Being, designated the 'Supreme Spirit'—the Eternal Lord who, permeating the three worlds, upholds them. \"I (the Lord) am beyond the perishable (Prakriti) and am also higher than the im- perishabl e {Kutastha). Therefore, in the worlds and in the Veda (the intuitive percep- tion of undeluded souls) I am proclaimed Purushottama, the Uttermost Being. \"Whosoever, freed from delusion, knows Me thus as the Supreme Spirit, knows all, O Arjuna. He worships Me with his whole being\" ( God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita xv:i6-i9). 592"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"\"I have prophesied to you about the things that will come to pass, that when they happen it will strengthen your faith in the truth of what- soever I have said to you.

Christ Consciousness, the prince of cosmic creation, is manifesting fully in my consciousness and absorbing my human con- sciousness—leaving little power for outward expression in words. The Christ Consciousness in me will manifest such actions as would declare m y utmost love for the Father. And as the Father, Cosmic Conscious- ness, revealed ideal wisdom within me, so I reveal to you that wisdom, the commandments and laws that should govern your actions.\" When Jesus said, \"I go away, and come again unto you,\" and also in the several references in preceding verses—\"I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter....I will not leave you com- fortless: I will come to you....He will keep my —— words: and my Father will love him, and We will Through yoga tech- come unto him.... the Comforter, which is the Holy niques of meditation Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he on Aum, one receives shall teach you all things\"—Jesus clearly assures the Second Coming his disciples that the passing of his body was not of Christ the end of his relationship with them. Instead, Jesus was describing himself as not the body but omnipresent Christ Con- sciousness. Uncircumscribed by the physical body, the real body of Jesus is the Holy Ghost manifested as Cosmic Vibratory Creation, and the soul of Jesus is the Christ Consciousness present in all creation. Jesus conveyed to his disciples that even though he would appear to them after resurrection in the physical body, still that was not the real Second Coming of Christ. The Second Coming is possible when any devotee expands his consciousness by deep meditation and can feel the bod y of Jesus as the Cosmic Vibration or Holy Ghost, and the spirit of Jesus as the Christ Consciousness. Many who saw Jesus after resurrec- tion did not realize the true Spirit-essence of Jesus. They were satisfied t o behold Jesus' spirit materialized as the familiar human body of the Master. So it is today with all who utter prayers to the Holy Ghost and Christ without ever realizing them in their consciousness. They are sat- isfied with ceremonies that they believe bring the contact of Holy Ghost and Christ.

Advanced devotees who not only hear in meditation the blissful cosmic sound of the Holy Ghost, the Word, the holy Aum vibration, but merge their consciousness in the omnipresence of this sound, and feel the universal Christ Consciousness in it, they are the ones who witness the second coming of Christ in their consciousness. Though Jesus can and has informed Christ Consciousness to appear in his Jesus-form to God-realized saints, it is neither necessary nor a fact that Jesus will appear in body again before souls can be redeemed. When he manifests as the Cosmic Sound and the Christ Consciousness in the devotee, then that is the true redeeming Second Coming of Christ of which Jesus spoke. As a human being has a soul, mind, and body, so also God is the inactively active soul of the universe, Christ Intelligence is the active mind of God planning and guiding the work in creation, and the Cos- mic Vibration materialized as the physical cosmos is the physical body of God. Any devotee who wants to bring Christ Intelligence a second time in his consciousness and through that Christ-wisdom reach the Father, or the Cosmic Consciousness, must first master the technique of communing with the Holy Ghost Cosmic Sound, and then realize the Christ Intelligence in it. Simply believing in the Trinity could not give anyone the God-realization of Cosmic Consciousness. The Holy Ghost Cosmic Vibration appears to the devotee during meditation as Cosmic Light, Cosmic Sound, Cosmic Joy, and Cosmic Wisdom. The devotee must not be satisfied to be merely an observer of these inner glories, thinking thereby that everything has been at- tained. When the devotee can see the divine Light spread over the whole cosmos, feel the Sound of Aum thrumming throughout the cos- mos, merge in the Joy in every atom and particular of the universe, in- tuit the wisdom of Christ Intelligence in every speck of space, then he has communion with the Holy Ghost. This contact of Holy Ghost will be found by the advanced student to be an Incomparable Comforter, giving inner freedom from physical, mental, and soul miseries, and awakening in the soul the intuitive omniscience of Christ-wisdom— as was promised and emphasized by Jesus. 594"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"[An ecstatic experience of Paramahansa Yogananda in commun- ion with the Holy Ghost Cosmic Vibration of Aum:} \"When sensory perceptions vibrate their pleasures in the body, I experience a heaviness; a weighty load hangs on the bosom of my soul, and I feel drawn down to matter.

And with the sickle of spiritual tests, the Cosmic Consciousness prunes every branch of human intelligence whose maturity brings forth the choice fruits of wisdom, that by such husbanding it might produce more abundantly divine realization, love, and bliss. The disciples of Jesus were very fortunate because he had cleared their consciousness of the evil karma and wrong vibrations of incar- nations through \"the word which I have spoken -•-•- unto you\"—the all-comforting Cosmic Vibration, \"Abide in me\": Know which he had caused to manifest within them.

No devotee can mature the fruits of wisdom (knowledge of God) as an isolated self, a branch of human consciousness cut off from the vine of omnipresent Christ Consciousness. But any devotee who practices meditation and repeatedly attains ecstatic communion—feeling him- self by intuitional realization abiding in the Christ Consciousness, and that Christ Intelligence manifesting in him—draws into himself Its immortal-life power that nurtures the growth of the fruits of imper- ishable wisdom and divine bliss. It is clear that Jesus was not speaking as a man, nor intimating that the beginning and the end of God's manifestation on earth coincided with the birth and passing of his body. He spoke from the realization that the Christ Consciousness within him was the same universal guid- ing Intelligence of the Infinite Cosmic Energy that lights the lamps of atoms and all lives. Thus he could say of his universal self, \"Without me ye can do nothing.\" To some degree, the power of universal Christ Consciousness is manifested in all persons, for without conscious or un- conscious contact with the Christ Consciousness hidden behind ordi- nary human consciousness, man could not live, breathe, see, hear, smell, taste, touch, think, will, or feel, let alone produce the fruits of Self-realization.

Immerse thy mind in Me alone; concentrate on Me thy discriminative perception; and beyond doubt thou shalt dwell immortally in Me.\"* In saying, \"If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered,\" Jesus meant that it is not sufficient that Christ Con- sciousness sustains all human beings; each must know, by conscious realization through intuitive perception in meditation, that he is sus- tained by that immanent Divinity. Persons who live in obliviousness o f the Source that maintains their lives eventually find their happiness withered due to lack of spiritual communion, just as an isolated branch shrivels away because it does not receive nourishing sap from the vine of which it is a part.

But throughout his teachings Jesus also gives assurance that even materialistic individuals, no matter their present suffering in the hades of delusion, can be saved by good company, meditation, loy- alty to a worthy guru, and communion with Christ Consciousness. \"If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is my Father glo- rified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. \"As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in His love. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full\" (John 15:7-11). * God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita xii:6-8. 1396"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"66]Tf your consciousness is in tune with my Christ Consciousness ILand the emanations of Cosmic Vibration coming from me, you will be able to accomplish whatever you wish due to your will work- ing through the Cosmic Intelligence and Cosmic Vibratory Energy, the creative Word of God.\" Jesus promised his disciples that \"if ye abide in me, and my words abide in you\"—if their consciousness were perfectly in tune with the Christ Consciousness and Its emanations of Cosmic Vibration—they would be able to demonstrate untold wonders through operating the universal creative principle. Any devotee, of any era, who is in tune with Christ Consciousness materializes the glory and wisdom of Cos- mic Consciousness (the Father) hidden in and beyond all creation. Those who would discipline their consciousness for expansion into Christ Consciousness—such were considered by Jesus to be his real disciples. Then Jesus spoke to them precious words, none dearer to the devotee's heart, that he loved them with the same divine, impartial, undying love with which the Heavenly Father loved • — — him.

What love could be purer; what love could be greater than the love that Jesus ex- presses here for his disciples? Human love requires human meriting and is subject to whims of feeling; but God's love is unconditional, eternal, unchanging. Try to imagine the love spoken of by Jesus in these verses. Close your eyes, put your attention on the heart, and feel the greatest love that you ever felt for another person. Let that love saturate every cell of your body. Now expand the feeling of love, like an encircling sphere embracing your family, friends, all your loved ones. Feel your love ever increasing; include in that sphere all the people in your city, then all of your country. Now everything in the world is bathed in that love. The whole earth, the solar system, the far-flung galaxies and island universes—everything is floating in this vast sphere of love. Feel, med- itate on, merge yourself in that love which permeates and upholds the infinitudes of manifestation—a demonstrable presence of God's heart- beat of bliss, setting the pace of cosmic harmony and unity, and known to the devotee as the All-in-all fulfillment. 1397"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"The love felt in the heart at the beginning of this visualization is human love. And the love that expanded until it encompassed every- thing is the universal love of Christ, the infinite love of God. The love that most persons feel for dearest family and friends, Jesus felt for the whole world and every living being. The Christ Consciousness that en- compasses everything in its love was born in the body of Jesus, in the body of Krishna, in the body of Buddha. Only one who has had the perception of the Infinite can fathom that indescribable love of God that suffuses all creation—the Christ- love, the divine power of attraction that draws all beings into an ever greater harmony and ultimately reunites them with God. It is a love unflawed by any selfishness or physicality or mortal instinct, uncir- cumscribed by the limitations that taint even the grandest human love. The love that dwells in the souls of all creatures—the sum and per- fection of the love of all mothers, all fathers, all friends, all lovers— that is Christ-love: the love of the Father reflected in the consciousness of Jesus and every God-united master. To feel that soul-love of all pure hearts is to be transported in an ecstas y of joy so great, so overwhelming, that it cannot be contained —a charge of bliss passing through one's being, a thousand million volts of rapturous power. This divine emotion is beyond description —a communion of unutterable sweetness with the Infinite Grace, the Indescribable Glory, the Eternal Protection. That is the love of God which Jesus felt, and in which he sheltered his disciples: \"As the Fa- ther hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.\" Jesus wanted to be sure that when his body passed away the dis- ciples would continue to be aware of the divine love he had helped them to feel within their hearts.

Jesus pointed ou t that any devotee would be able to abide in the unending divine love in the bosom of Christ Consciousness and God by following the laws of God he had emphasized: primarily, as he himself had demonstrated to them, by loving God as the joy of med- itation, with all the heart's devotion, mind's concentration, soul's in- tuition, and body's \"strength\" (withdrawing the energy from the senses to focus the attention on Him); and loving Him as present in 1398"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"the souls of all living creatures (\"neighbors,\" all those one happens to meet).* By keeping those two foremost commandments of the Father, Jesus, and all liberated devotees, abide eternally in the Lord's unend- ing, ever joyous, ever new love. \"These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full\": The truths by which the disciples would be able to abide in Christ-love were vibrated by Jesus into their receptive consciousness through the Holy Ghost Cosmic Vibration, that God's ever new Bliss present in him and omnipresent in the Cosmic Vibration might remain with them permanently after his body had been dissolved in Spirit. He wanted them, through the unshakable communion attainable by deepest med- itation, to transmute the conditional joy of their current stage of real- ization into the full, absolute joy of Spirit.f The Gospel preserves a record of Jesus' words on this holy occa- sion; but readers should realize—and try to feel within themselves as though they, too, were present—that behind those words was the tan- gible vibratory presence of God. During times of divine fellowship (sat- sanga) such as Jesus' Last Supper with his disciples, those who are re- ceptive feel transported into a higher consciousness of God-perception pouring into their hearts and minds as the master speaks. This attune- ment imbues the devotee's consciousness, in the highest way, whenever he summons the guru's grace in the inner temple of deep, worshipful meditation . \"This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.

Ye have not chosen me, but I have cho- sen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, He may give it you\" (John 15:12-16). R epeatedly in this final dissertation addressed to his disciples, Jesus emphasized his loving command to them: \"Love one an- other with the divine, unconditional love with which I have loved you.\" He wanted them to uphold the ideal of love in its most sublime —— human aspect: divine friendship. The highest form of Friendship is the purest human expression of human love: divine God's love, because it springs not from any dictates friendship between a of biological or social instincts but from the free-will guru and his disciples choice of the heart. All other forms of love—be- tween parent and child, husband and wife, brother and sister, lover and beloved, master and servant—are partially moti- vated by instinctive compulsions and prospect of selfish gain, and, as such, are imperfect. Blood relatives are imposed upon an individual, but one is free to choose his friends. The love of friends, which grows from the spontaneous mutual attraction of hearts, affords the possibil- ity of a relationship truly based on unselfishness; it therefore more nearly approximates the perfect love—that between God and His devotees, between soul and Spirit. I t was that consummate, unselfish love which Jesus bestowed on his disciples by addressing them as friends, souls whom he highly es- teemed. Poignantly, facing his own death on the morrow, he affirmed to them: \"Greater love hath no man than that he sacrifice his life for th e highest good of his friends.\" Such friendship is truly of God, for purely selfless sacrifice is possible only when human love partakes of God's love. When one can express the almighty power of intoxicating divine love, it awakens the living heart of God's love in the lives of others. The preeminent instinct in man is to love himself first. When there is danger of any kind, one's first impulse is to save oneself. Spiritual- ity begins with the effort to place the well-being of someone else above one's own interests. The smallness of ego's self-centeredness must be resurrected into the largeness of caring and self-sacrifice, by which others are felt as a part of one's own expanded self.

But in divine friendship each one thinks only of the highest welfare of the other; that was the friendship Jesus demonstrated. The supreme expression of friendship is the relationship between a true guru and his disciples. In a Christlike guru, the love of God Himself is made manifest in human form. In the pure love of friends on e glimpses God the Invisible made partially visible, but in the guru He becomes manifest in actuality. Through the guru, God the Silent talks openly. What greater satisfaction could one have, than when the heart is aflame with yearning for the unknown God and He actually comes as guru? What greater consolation could one receive, than to find that when one's devotion is strong and incessant the Inconceiv- abl e Infinite manifests in the visible form of guru? God commingles His desire for the devotee's liberation with the desire of the guru to help the disciple forsake the ways of darkness and follow the illumined path to God. He who follows a God-sent guru walks in the everlast- ing light of God. The Silence becomes expressive through the voice of guru; the Intangible becomes tangible in the God-realization of guru. The unconditional divine friendship between guru and disciple, the most sacred of all human loves, is the love of which Jesus spoke in calling his disciples, not servants or inferiors, but ..... friends.

Devotees who by transparent purity of mind and heart receive and reflect the impartially shining sunlight of God's love are true sons of God. Jesus knew that disciples who would follow his command- ment to \"love one another, as I have loved you\"—who could feel the love of God in all—would find their consciousness transmuted into Christ Consciousness. To those who were in tune with him, he had conveyed \"all things that I have heard of my Father\"—transmitted the wisdom vibrations he received from Cosmic Consciousness. Therefore he would henceforth not speak of his advanced disciples as \"servants\"—those who serve the Master but are ignorant of the ways 1401"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"of the Master (the Christ Consciousness, the Lord of all creation) — but as divine friends who shared with him the knowledge of Christ Consciousness.* Souls in the divine kingdom are equal in God-realization and hence enjoy equally the fulfillment of infinite happiness. But people in the kingdom of the earth are draped in delusions of inequalities and fraught with jealousy, trouble, and discontentment. Souls who have overcome delusion and have attained the complete enlightenment of Self-realization are honored in the divine kingdom as equals in the eyes of God; only ignorant disciples argue the superiority of some masters over others. (Of course, there are differing degrees of Self-realization of advancing devotees; but once they reach the pinnacle state of liber- ation in Cosmic Consciousness, there is no longer any difference. Completely liberated prophets of different religions cannot be accu- rately judged according to the outer expressions of wisdom they give for a particular clime and time, for inwardly they possess the same Self-realization and God-consciousness.) Jesus earlier had said, \"No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.\" The guru does not call any soul to him- self. It is God who calls. God uses the vehicle of the guru to bring the devotee to eternal freedom. Thus Jesus pointed out that the disciples did not choose him, but that, in response to their prayers of many lives and to the will of the Heavenly Father, his particular incarnation of Christ Consciousness had been chosen to guide them in the soul path. They did not know that he was coming to them, but he came inten- tionally, as their God-sent guru, for the sake of their souls' liberation. Acting in accord with the command of God, Jesus recognized and consciously selected the disciples; that is why he said, \"I have chosen you, and ordained you....\" That is, \"My Christ Consciousness has chosen to guide you through my form called Jesus, and to saturate you with divine ardor by means of which you will be able to go into deep *That divine friendship and love was sublimely expressed in the relationship between the avatar Bhagavan Krishna and his beloved disciple Arjuna, recounted in the epic Mababharata and specifically in the holy Bhagavad Gita.

But their inter- ests and values were of a higher order, \"not of the world,\" for Jesus ha d chosen to guide them out of worldliness.

Rather, if the Christ Con- sciousness in Jesus had not been made manifest unto the world by his open declaration of his personal realization of the Cosmic Father and demonstrations of God's immanence in the miracles he performed, then the worldly persons who disbelieved in God as manifested in and through Jesus and his teachings—those who \"know not Him\"—would not have been guilty of the evil of deliberately ignoring God in defiance of such evidence.

This, Jesus tells his dis- ciples, referring to the significance of his own God-given mission. \"Since the invisible, silent Almighty God distinctly and abundantly demon- strated Himself and His commandments for self-discipline through me, those who were ignorant before have no excuse now in which to hide their guilt for not following the spiritual path, nor justification for for- getting God on the pretext that He is too elusive, mysterious, unattain- able, hidden, or perhaps even nonexistent. \"He that hateth me (that spurns the demonstrations of God's ex- istence and glory shown through my life) hateth my Father also (the Cosmic Consciousness that sent me to earth to declare God's presence in a powerful but humble way).\" Jesus knew that through his resur- rection the omnipotence of God was to be revealed, while his crucifix- ion would exemplify the humbleness of God who wants to teach His ignorant, rebellious children by love only. If Jesus had not performed divine miracles to glorify the existence, power, and love of God as no ordinary being ever did or could, then the disbelievers could not have been accused of deliberately shunning God. But after having seen the manifestation of Divinity through Jesus' life, they were guilty of the sin of hating God when they hated Jesus in whom Divinity was templed. Jesus spoke emphatically, for to ignore God (either willfully or out of sheer ignorance) is a paramount sin; it is submission to cosmic delu- sion, the father of all sins and consequential physical, mental, and spir- itual discontentments and suffering. To forget God is to lose sight of one's real nature. A soul in ignorance of its inherent divinity remains entangled in incarnations of mortal miseries enforced by unfulfilled desires.

If my body is not taken away, you will continue to perceive me as this limited form; and the unlimited Cosmic Vibration, imbued with the comfort- ing Christ-wisdom omnipresent in creation, will not be manifest to you. I do not want you to think of me as a little physical body; know my vast body as the whole cosmos emanating from the Cosmic Vi- bration of the Holy Ghost, and my soul as the Christ Consciousness present in every cell of my Cosmic Vibratory Body. The little body that holds your attention now will go away, and your minds will be able to concentrate on and receive Aum, the Holy Ghost—the bestower of everlasting comfort by removing from within you all wrong vibrations of delusion. \"Because my little physical body is departing, I will manifest within you in my Christ and my Cosmic Consciousness; the Vibration of Aum will dislodge all your grief and fear.

The omniscience of the Father or Cosmic Consciousness is also inherent in the Son or Christ Consciousness. Therefore, I have said that the Holy Ghost will transmit to you from me all knowledge which I, in turn, have received from the Father, or Cosmic Consciousness. \"I am present with you now, but in a little while you will not see my body—for that will have been crucified. And again, a little while after crucifixion, you will behold my resurrected body. Whether I ap- pear before you, or disappear from mortal sight, I am ever-living in the Father's Cosmic Consciousness.\" In this, his last long discourse with his disciples, Christ reveals many beautiful metaphysical truths. When he said: \"I go my way to Him that sent me,\" he signified, macrocosmically, that the Son or Christ Consciousness in all creation Why Jesus wanted the mus t ultimately be merged in the Father, the su- disciples to concen- preme Cosmic Consciousness. Similarly, speaking trate not on his form, of God-union relative to the microcosm of the in- but on his infinite dividualized soul, \"my way\" refers to Jesus' earlier consciousness declaration, \"I am the way...no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\"* Jesus was telling the disciples that soon the outward manifestation of his life would be withdrawn into the form- less infinite Christ Consciousness immanent in Holy Ghost Cosmic Vi- bration, and thence into transcendental Spirit (\"the Father\"; \"Him that sent me\")—thus following the \"way\" that all souls must travel to reach the ultimate goal of Cosmic Consciousness. Jesus warned his disciples that if they knew him only as the ma- terial body, they would suffer when that body would be taken away. If they concentrated only on his little form called Jesus, they would not know his vast Cosmic Body, which consists of countless cells of stars , atoms, ions, and life force of all vibrations. Disciples who would fail to commune with Jesus as Spirit would be rudderless when his body passed away. Disciples who realized Jesus as Spirit would find him to be the same living Lord throughout eternity. •John 14:6 (see commentary in Discourse 70). 1411"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"No prophet is allowed by God to remain on earth before the pub- lic gaze forever. Mahavatar Babaji has kept his body indefinitely, but he is not permitted to flaunt that special dispensation before the world. That is why he is not available to mankind, except through the silent bestowal of his blessings. Though ever-living, he is ever-hiding.* So is Jesus. Whether with a body or without, liberated souls are ever- living in Spirit. They can openly appear anytime and anywhere they wish, but are not allowed to remain visibly accessible to the masses. God does not permit any master to do that, for it would create a com- pulsion that would disrupt the cosmic order based on man's free will. People would idolize the phenomenal personality and forget the Spirit. They would attempt to confine God to a human form and compla- cently neglect to seek His omnipresent, immortal, formless Self. Fur- thermore, the general populace would flock to that one prophet, but the many who disbelieved in that particular divine aspect would be left behind. God does not want that; through His various emissaries He fulfills His commitment to the needs of all His children on all evolu- tionary levels. His message, always the same eternal truths, is yet ever new in terms essential to the time and place. As soon as a saint fulfills his own unique mission, God pulls him away to serve from behind the cosmic scene. I have heard great saints in India say, \"I am giving too much. God will pull me away.\" None would presume to tamper with God's ways. There are millions of Christians who know Jesus the Christ as a divine historical personage; they worship his image and they worship the cross as his symbol. But those who adore Jesus solely as a person- ality do not know Christ as a savior. Of the many who call themselves Christians, not all have been accepted by Christ. Those who show the valiancy of spirit and continuity of prayer and meditation necessary to commune with the Infinite Consciousness, they are the accepted ones who know Christ as savior. To perceive the formless Christ is the greatest Christ-ianity—to behold not just a man encaged in a little body-frame, but the efful- gence of Christ glory spread over the stars and wheeling universes, shining in every atom and throb of vibratory force. The devotee can talk to that Power, and It can take any form to respond. One who feels that Power realizes that God is both personal and impersonal.

It is the formless Spirit that we should worship, and worship- ing Him we become free.* Jesus in the above verses therefore tells his disciples not to think of him as a body subject to death, but as the eternal Spirit. His body, he says, must be removed in order to free them from the delusion that he was a physical being. Only after the withdrawal of that delusion could his disciples be able to tune in with his vast body of Cosmic Vi- bration, the great Comforting Holy Ghost. By these words: \"When he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment,\" Jesus signified that through the omniscient Christ Intelligence inherent in the Holy Ghost Cosmic Vi- bration, his disciples would receive the spiritual insight that would re- veal the karmic consequences of the evil actions of those who had per- secuted and judged Jesus and thereby opposed the law of righteousness. Jesus calls the Holy Ghost \"the Spirit of Truth\" because it is the essence of all vibratory law as manifested in the cosmos. The Cosmic Vibration is the Invisible Power which, through variations of vibration in accord with cosmic order, materializes and maintains the outward forms of all created things. Jesus explains that the Holy Cosmic Vi- bration does not declare anything of itself, but faithfully manifests whatever it receives from the guiding Christ Intelligence. In other words, the variations in Cosmic Vibration are created by the Christ •Saint Symeon the New Theologian (949-1022), a monk of the Eastern Orthodox Church, wrote: \"Having been made rich with Him, they shall see invisibly the inex- pressible beauty of God Himself. They shall hold Him without touching. They shall comprehend incomprehensibly His imageless image, His formless form, His shape without shape which, in sight without seeing and in beauty uncompounded, is ever var- ied and unchanging. \"What is it that, comprehending, they will see? The simple light of divinity, this is what they will see richly with the eyes of their intellect; this what they will also han- dle, drawn by irresistible love, with immaterial hands; what they will eat without con- suming with the spiritual mouth of their intellect and soul. They will never have enough , never be satiated with the contemplation of that beauty, of that sweetness. For, stranger still, the light which wells up in them is always increasing in sweetness and kindling their desire ever the more greatly.\" — On the Mystical Life: The Ethical Dis- courses, Vol. 2, trans.

The Holy Ghost Cosmic Vibration does not act of it- self (is wholly free from the egoistic principle); it is solely guided by Christ Intelligence.* That is why Jesus says: \"For he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak.\" When Jesus says: \"All things that the Father hath are mine,\" he sig- nifies that Christ Consciousness is the complete and perfect reflection of Cosmic Consciousness, and that devotees who attain Christ Conscious- ness by deep meditation receive, further, all the wisdom and power of Cosmic Consciousness. Every human being who discards the conscious- ness of the limited ego and identifies himself with Cosmic Consciousness will claim as his own possession the universe and all things in it. Then said some of his disciples among themselves, \"What is this that he saith unto us, 'A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me': and, 'Because I go to the Father'?\" They said therefore, \"What is this that he saith, 'A little while'?

You sorrow now, but your sorrow will vanish and your hearts will rejoice with an irrevocable joy eternal! \"You question among yourselves now, but soon, in your omni- science, you will ask nothing; whatever wisdom you require will be given you from Cosmic Consciousness through the Cosmic Vibration and the Christ Consciousness in it.

The mind of the devotee will then no longer be the seeker in the game of hide- and-seek with God played in the labyrinth (\"proverbs\") of questions and doubts. Jesus assures us that God is real and can be contacted without being hidden behind the screen of mystery and mystical sym- bolization of the scriptures. This plain declaration given by Christ of contacting the Heavenly Father should inspire every truth-seeker to re- double his efforts and enthusiasm for seizing God, so long concealed behind the veil of intellectualized uncertainties. His disciples said unto him, \"Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou earnest forth from God.\" Jesus answered them, \"Do ye now believe?

When he said, \"I have overcome the world,\" he sought to strengthen the spiritual determination of his disciples by citing the ex- ample of his own victory over the delusions of his human incarnation. Though tempted by Satan and the physical demands of bodily limita- tions, he overcame every temporal desire by choosing the imperishable bliss of God-consciousness. Of all such supremely victorious devotees, the Gita says: Their thoughts immersed in That (Spirit), their souls one with Spirit, their sole allegiance and devotion given to Spirit, their beings puri- fied from poisonous delusion by the antidote of wisdom—such men reach the state of nonreturn....

However, the karmic outcome is conditional on certain circumstances; events can be changed by the interjection of the strong influences of free will and power of yoga concentration. On more than one occa- sion, Jesus distinctly told Judas that he was going to betray him.* Ju- das, by the exercise of free will and prayer, could have freed himself from that karmic compulsion to succumb to evil. Jesus did not men- tion the betrayal to torment Judas, nor to provide him with a justifi- cation of inevitability, but to warn him against the treachery that his karma was fomenting within him. Through his omniscient knowledge, Jesus scanned the inner nature of Judas and his karma of past incar- nations, and thus lovingly gave Judas a chance to change his malevo- lent karmic pattern. Jesus had said: \"Woe to that man by whom the Son of man is be- trayed! Good were it for that man if he had never been born.\"f Jesus thereby told Judas that he would reap untold misery by choosing to betray him. But Judas was so intoxicated with the delusion of his own preconceived ambitions that he ignored the opportunity to save him- self from evil and went ahead with the work of betrayal. It is clearly seen in this drama of events that man is the architect of his own des- tiny; he is free to act as he pleases, for good or ill. for they feared the people. Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. \"An d he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them. And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.\" * E.g., \"Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? He spake of Judas Is- cariot...\" (John 6:70-71; see Discourse 43). fMark 14:21 (see Discourse 69). 635"},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"No matter the greatness of a master, he cannot influence the God- given free will of an individual in order to save him unless that indi- vidual wishes to use his free will to help save himself. The guru is con- strained to disavow responsibility for any disciple who places himself outside the aura of the guru's grace, until through repentance and ref- ormation—sometimes requiring many lifetimes—the disciple demon- strates his readiness to rejoin the master's liberating presence. When one's delusion-empowered ego becomes one's \"guru,\" even God Him- self cannot force open any door of receptivity to truth and divine guid- ance in a fallen disciple. Neither Christ nor Satan can influence an individual unless he chooses to be influenced. Judas, through his vastly accumulated evil of past lives and insufficient spiritual effort in this life, was impervi- ous to the holy influence of Jesus. But later Judas did repent of his evil karma and in devastating remorse hanged himself.* (It must not be inferred that hanging helped Judas to be free from the heinous sin of betraying Jesus, but his self-destruction was evi- dence of his repentance. Suicide is a very serious spiritual crime. Judas would have done much better had he chosen to live and confirm his repentance in a life of reparation, spiritually expiating his sin by trans- muting the evil in his consciousness through redemptory acts of righ- teousness and devout meditation. Weak-minded people who want to commit suicide are foolishly hoping to get away from manfully shoul- dering the burden of life through which they free themselves from their bad karma. Suicide only increases the karmic burden instead of ban- ishing it. A troubled person, by meditation and prayer, should patiently work at neutralizing his evil karma by spiritualizing the inner self with soul awakening and God's grace.) Because of his betrayal of Jesus, Judas had to roam through nu- merous incarnations to gain his salvation. It was only after twenty cen- turies that Judas was redeemed in India, through one of the great saints of modern times. Jesus appeared to the saint and sanctioned Ju- das's release, saying, \"His sin is paid for.\" The incarnation of Jesus Christ was at a time and place of great ignorance and wickedness among the people around him.

Just as a father does not forsake a wicked son to be among his clos- born of his own blood, so a guru cannot forsake a est disciples spiritual son who becomes wicked, so long as there remains a possibility to save him from evil. Judas had been a good dis- ciple; but at the end of his former life, just before his death and rebirth as Judas, his mind had become dark with egoistic greed and desire for power, evil temptations to forsake his better nature. Nevertheless, Ju- das had within him a plenteous store of good karma by which he at- tracted in his present life the blessing of close association with Jesus. As a spiritual doctor, Jesus diagnosed the life of Judas as a com- posite of his good and evil actions and tendencies in many incarna- tions. He knew of the latent seeds of evil hidden in Judas's subcon- scious mind, which would dispose him to be the foretold betrayer of the Messiah. Foreknowledge of the potential betrayal did not prevent the magnanimous heart of Jesus from accepting Judas in the divine family of his disciples. In his love for Judas, Jesus gave him an unpar- alleled opportunity of being better, of overcoming the evil within him in the environment of the Christ in Jesus and the company of his other disciples . In the life of Jesus, as with that of all divine incarnations who come o n earth with a world mission, there was a cosmic drama to be played out between good and evil, God and Satan. The Cosmic Evil Force was arrayed against the manifestation of God in Jesus for what he was go- ing to do to destroy the kingdom of delusion. This conscious force of evil focused on the weakness of Judas to betray Jesus and thereby ini- tiate the events that would lead to the crucifixion of the Christ. God and Christ in turn knew how Satan could influence Judas through the invitation of his own bad karma. But though the satanic forces of evil would cause the death of Jesus, Christ would attain fi- nal victory over the powers of satanic delusion by liberating his soul through the sacrifice of the body, and then by resurrecting his body through the soul power of his freed spirit. God did not overthrow Evil by the evil of material force. Jesus did not exercise his prerogative to use supernatural force against Satan; 637"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"instead, he played out the human drama to demonstrate the spiritual power of good over evil in every man. Resisting evil with evil entan- gles one in the toils of evil; but overcoming evil by good conclusively bring s victory over all evil. Evil destroys itself. Evil ultimately becomes a tool of God in an indirect way. For evil, trying to destroy good, makes it a martyr and thus immortalizes it. \"All things work together for good to them that love God.\"* Jesus, b y holding with steadfast faith to the unequaled power of God's love during his suffering and death on the cross, transformed the perfidious betrayal of Judas into the occasion of his greatest victory—a supreme demonstratio n of godliness for the inspiration of humanity. In that sense, Judas may be said to have been Jesus' best \"publicity agent,\" in- suring that word of his life and message would be broadcast through- out the world as an example for all mankind for the ages to come. Jesus continues his prayer to God, interceding for the disciples: \"I have given them Thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. \"Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth. As Thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.

Unwillingness of the body to meditate is much easier to remedy than is resistance of the inner spirit. Physical frailties indulged mechanically out of mortal habit, against the will of the inner spirit, only affect the devotee temporarily; those habits may be removed by consciously culti- vating the will to mastery. But inner unwillingness to make such effort is the sign of one's spirit steeped in ignorance, which can be removed only by sincere, unceasing spiritual practice and self-control, never by mere outward pretense. Worst, of course, is when habits of weakness beat down both the spirit and the body. That state is much more detrimental than if only the flesh is resistant and the spirit is courageously willing to strive; eventually the spirit will infuse strength into the recalcitrant body, for if the spirit is truly willing, the flesh will be made strong. He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, \"O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, Thy will be done.\" And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, \"Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

In spite of sleep, whenever you have willingly prayed, that is sufficient to please God and to destroy bad karma.

Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, \"Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.\" And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, \"Hail, master\": and kissed him. And Jesus said unto him, \"Friend, wherefore art thou come ?\" (Matthew 26:47-50).

Jesus speaks of \"the Son of man\" being betrayed because, mate- rially speaking, the body of Jesus could be betrayed; but the Christ Consciousness in him (\"Son of God\") could not be subjugated or harmed by anyone. The inviolability of the divine consciousness of Spirit that inhab- ited the body of Jesus was demonstrated in the exchange between Jesus and the arresting guards as recorded by Saint John. When the weapon- bearing mob announced whom they sought, Jesus confronted them with the simple declaration: \"I am he.\"* That is, \"I am the Christ Con- sciousness manifested in the body of Jesus which you want for perse- cution. \" Though roused and ready to seize the master with violence, instantly the crowd \"went backward, and fell to the ground,\" by the sheer power emanating from Jesus as he thus declared his divinity. He then acknowledged that he was Jesus of Nazareth whom they sought: \"If therefore you are seeking my body, let these my disciples go their way in freedom.\" This was the beginning of his sacrifice of great love for his disciples in which he bartered their freedom, physi- cally and spiritually, by giving his body over to the Satan-ordained, karma-ordained trial of crucifixion.

J esus decries the use of the sword in his defense: \"Although the ter- rible treatment that I am receiving in the hands of my enemies is causing much righteous indignation in you, Peter, you must learn to tolerate it, even if my enemies go thus far to maltreat me in spite of my innocence. \"Put your sword into the sheath, for all individuals and nations who use the sword against others, being under the influence of anger, revengefulness, territorial greed, national selfish- — ness, or industrial covetousness, will find them- \"All they that take selves inviting the use of swords against themselves, the sword shall perish The bitter cup of the spiritual test that my Father with the sword\" has given me I must drink.

In human nature, hatred rouses hatred: If anyone in anger, or in any wise under the influence of evil, lashes out with a sword against his enemy, he will find a sword drawn against himself. Evil is like a boomerang; a murderous person attracts a commensurate hurt- ful vibration against himself. A \"sword\" may be any instrument of killing or aggression. Gang- sters who keep themselves armed with guns, and who are ready to use them, inevitably face the same threat of death by gunshots. Those who try to kill others will themselves become targets of murderous assaults. Likewise, when one nation brandishes its armaments against a brother nation, the latter invariably is roused to array its weapons against the perceive d aggressor. Jesus asked the nations to put up their swords of hatred in the sheath of self-control and abolish the gunpowder of re- vengefulness. Modern-style warfare—in which the unarmed populace far from the front lines is a target for long-range bombs and destruc- tion just as much as the combat troops—is a grim testimony that ag- gressive wars of conquest bring to the invaders as grievous losses as to the invaded. All conquerors and aggressive nations, take heed, for those who use the sword shall perish by the sword!* Whereas the sword most likely will defeat its purpose, love, when administered timely with wisdom, never fails to produce, sooner or • - •  later, the desired result.

With the amplitude of his spiritual mastery, notwithstanding his incarnate status, he could completely contravene the law of karma, which was playing out its role of cause and effect; but he preferred not to demand special privileges. He had *See also Discourse 27, commentary on Jesus' admonitions to \"resist not evil,\" \"turn the other cheek,\" and \"love your enemies\" for discussion of the practical application of the scriptural ideal of nonviolence ( ahimsa).

However, for the sake of the wicked people he wanted to reform, and the souls his sacrifice would save, he had determined to suffer the consequences—even as an ordi- nary man would suffer under similar circumstances — in order to demonstrate the power of love and God's nature of love and forgive- ness. Though the magnitude of the power he could summon to flow through his bodily instrument was akin to God's omnipotence, Jesus did not want to use any force other than the power of love to conquer th e wickedness of his human brothers. Moments earlier Jesus had fervently prayed that the cup of suf- fering be removed; now, his self-mastery fully reestablished, he chides the well-meaning Peter: \"The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?\" He admonished the disciple to express soul qual- ities even when severely tested by unjust treatment. To give a slap for a slap is human behavior; to give kindness for slaps is godliness. Jesus proved his Son of God identity by acting like a god and not like a man. Even in the moment of struggle when he was seized and the disciples were in a fury, he did not lose his soul calmness and self-possession or forget to be divine.* What is amazing is that Malchus, and those who witnessed Jesus' instantaneous healing of the servant's ear, as also his lov e for an afflicted enemy, were not thereby moved to soften their delusion-hardened cruel hearts, creating God-awakening within them- selves. Yet such was the grip Satan had on their consciousness in that hour when the satanic \"power of darkness\" was given by the law of karma temporary ascendency even over the miracles of Christ-love. In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, \"Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled\" (Matthew 26:55-56). *\"He who unites his spirit to Me, having subjugated all his senses, remains concen- trated on Me....The intuitive wisdom of that yogi becomes steadfast whose senses are unde r his sway\" (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita 11:61). 1451"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"Parallel reference: Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the tem- ple, and the elders, which were come to him, \"Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?

Here Jesus signifies that when he was performing sanctified works of preaching and healing in the temple under the pro- tecting power of Goodness, nobody had dared touch him; but that the karmically determined time had now arrived when he would submit himself to the spiritual test of the evil \"power of darkness.\" Satan, the Cosmic Delusive Intelligence, could punish Jesus only according to the law of karma. Having failed to turn Jesus against God by luring him with earthly temptations, Satan bided his time un- til, by Jesus' actions against the evils of the prevailing hierarchy, suf- ficient cause and effect had accrued that Satan was able to assail him through the instrumentality of the ignorance of the chief priests. That is why Jesus distinctly contrasts the two periods of his life's mission: the first, when he was freely preaching in the temple protected by the power of God; and second, when the satanic power, by using the law of karma set in motion by Jesus' actions, was causing his arrest and leading him to crucifixion. It is important to understand these little- understood deep meanings within the words of Jesus. *Cf. additional parallel reference in Mark 14:48-52. tSee, for example, Luke 4:28-30 (Discourse 39); also commentary on Luke 13:31- 35 (Discourse 57). 1452"},{"pageNumber":663,"pageContent":"Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.

He preferred that the high priest receive their testimony rather than defend his teachings himself. Also, he was disappointed that his disciples had left him at his hour of trial; he wanted to find out if any were left who would stand up for him. Of course, Jesus did not mean that he never gave private spiritual instruction to his disciples. To his closest advanced disciples he taught the esoteric science of meditation, giving to them \"in secret\" what the general populace in that dark era was not spiritually prepared to un- derstand— \"Therefore speak I to them in parables.\"* So when Jesus said, \"In secret have I said nothing,\" he meant that nothing he had said or taught, in public or in private, was evil and needed to be con- cealed—nor had he ever covertly conspired against the country's laws. Whe n one of the officers struck him for his reply, Jesus meekly and yet firmly displayed his impeccable spiritual character. Jesus, who had power over all creation through his Christ Consciousness, who had raised the dead and healed the sick, and to whose prayers the Heavenly Father Himself replied through the clouds, was yet humbly nonresis- tant to the ignominious slap of an ignorant little man. The Christ Con- sciousness in Jesus, the Electronic Engineer controlling the lamps of all lives , could at the command of Jesus switch on or switch off life force from any person. Even as he had by a mere word caused the fig tree to wither, so could he have removed the life from his enemies in Jerusalem, or from all the people in the world if such a course were necessary and proper. Instead, Jesus, like God, behaved with humility, and meekly submitted his great self to the tyranny of a few wicked people. As God though all-powerful does not raise His hand in wrath to punish any- body who blasphemes Him, so He expects a faithful devotee to behave like Him. It was because of Jesus' preeminent desire that his life in all * Matthew 13:13 (see Discourse 37). 1454"},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"ways should please God that he behaved in a godlike manner when he was abusively struck by an officious ordinary individual. Jesus had a perfect sense of justice; he did not fail to apply it im- partially even in judging himself. He calmly points out to the offensive human brute: \"If I have spoken evil, hold that against me; but if I have spoken well, wherefore do I deserve to be smitten?\" All \"kings\" of earthly empires, all egotists, remember! If Christ, with power over the entire cosmos, could yet be so humble, how much more should you strive for humility, you who are so far inferior in achievement! It is in- deed evident from the life of Jesus that humbleness is one of the req- uisite signs of God-contact. Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; but found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, and said, \"This fellow said, 7 am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days'\" * And the high priest arose, and said unto him, \"Answerest thou nothing? What is it which these witness against thee?\" But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, \"I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.\" Jesus saith unto him, \"Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven\" (Matthew 2 6:59-64).

And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying, 'We heard him say, I will destro y this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.'

J esus in a remarkably selfless way confirms to his enemies his true Self by letting them declare it. (See also Mark 14:62 in which he replies simply, \"I am.\") In this oblique manner he affirms: \"Thou hast truly said what I am—the prophesied Christ, the Son of God in whom —— is incarnate the Christ Consciousness, the reflection Humbly yet fearlessly, of the Father, Cosmic Consciousness.\" He could Jesus acknowledges have in truth openly declared to them, \"I am the that he is indeed the Christ.\" Instead, in an ingenious avoidance of any Christ  appearance of egotism, which would have set an uncharacteristic bad example, Jesus was shyly dif- fident in expressing the full measure of the greatness and power of the God-realization within him. Nevertheless, he fearlessly acknowledged the truth in his humble way, even though he knew that the conse- quence would be death. According to the account in the Gospel Ac- cording to St. Luke, Jesus added, in effect: \"If I tell you that the Christ Consciousness is in me, you won't believe, for you do not know what I am. And if I ask you what I am, you will not be able to answer me, nor let me go free. So to what end is my saying anything to you? \"After the drama of this bodily existence is over, the Son of man, my body after resurrection, will be beheld in the astral world by ad- vanced devotees as a manifestation of the Christ Consciousness that upholds the vibratory realms of all creation.

Jesus' reply did not mean that in the future the people of the world, ignorant and wise, would see him \"coming in the clouds of heaven.\" God, who is moving universes in space, has no need to im- press earth-dwellers into submission by such a demonstration. If God so desired, He could cause collisions of all the island universes roam- ing in space and dissolve them into Himself amidst a colossal burst of flame. Or He could people all space with angels. But God, whose way is love and who suffered Jesus Christ to be crucified on the cross rather than send \"twelve legions of angels\" to protect him by creating fear in the hearts of the evildoers, would not countenance a spectacular reappearance of Christ coming out of the clouds, thus terrorizing peo- ple into subjugation. In so answering the chief priest, Jesus was in fact giving a message to seekers of all times: Any true devotee who opens his spiritual eye can not only see a vision of Jesus, but also know the Christ Con- sciousness in himself as the \"right-hand\" power of God. Just as an owner of a factory has his \"right-hand man,\" so the Owner of the uni- verse, the transcendental Cosmic Consciousness, has Its \"right-hand man\" in the Christ Consciousness omnipresent in creation. This Christ Intelligence is the immanent channel of God the Father of creation, the sole medium through which the power of Cosmic Consciousness ma- terialized into creation—God, reflected as Christ Consciousness, as the Essence of all that is. As the transcendent region of Cosmic Consciousness is hidden be- hind the \"clouds\" or darkness beheld with closed eyes, and as the clouds in earth's atmosphere seen with open eyes hide the regions be- yond, so also the darkness of closed eyes and the dark depths of the sky as seen with open eyes both act as walls that hide the luminous re- gion of the astral heaven, concealed behind the transparent yet opaque vibratory rampart of the ether. True visions may be seen with open or closed eyes. Every highly developed spiritual devotee who can look through his telescopic spiritual eye finds that the clouds of darkness of closed eyes and the etheric firmament obstructing the perception of 1457"},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"open eyes thereby vanish into the nothingness of their illusory essence. When the devotee through the aid of the spiritual eye thus banishes the inner darkness of closed eyes and the outer opacity of the skyey firmament, the heavenly astral cosmos appears, revealing the angels of God and many luminous wonders.* Jesus signified that after his earthly incarnation, he would exist not only as Spirit but as a materialized form, perceptible in vision to any devotee in attunement, coming out of the darkness of closed eyes from the heavenly astral region whose elements of light and life force pro- vide the substantive appearance of all visions. Jesus gave his answer to the chief priest to attest that as a son of God he had all power and could abide as Spirit or could materialize his body as the Son of Man or as a Christ body, any time—even after death from crucifixion. Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, \"He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. What think ye?\" They answered and said, \"He is guilty of death.\" Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, saying, \"Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, who is he that smote thee?\" Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, \"Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.\" But he de- nied before them all, saying, \"I know not what thou say est.\" And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, \"This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.\" And again he denied with an oath, \"I do not know the man.\" And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, \"Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech be- wrayeth thee.\" Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, \"I know not the man.\" And immediately the cock crew. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, \"Before the cock crow, *See also Discourse 10, commentary on John 1:51, \"Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God....\" 1458"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"thou shalt deny me thrice.\" And he went out, and wept bitterly (Matthew 26:65-75).* I T* ven though in his hour of trial Jesus was abandoned by Peter and Mother of the disciples, most of them later repented of their weak- ness and atoned for their sin; strengthened in their recollected realiza- tion of the grace and blessings Jesus had bestowed on them, they re- gained their faith and courage. Tradition holds that Peter, who was eventually killed for preaching Christ's truth, asked his persecutors to crucify him with his head down and his feet up, for his sin in having thrice denied Christ when, as Jesus had predicted, Peter fell tem- porarily under the influence of satanic delusion. When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor. Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, saying, \"I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.\" And they said, \"What is that to us? See thou to that.\" And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, \"It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.\" And they took counsel, and bought with them the pot- ter's field, to bury strangers in. Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value; and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me\" (Matthew 27:1-10). f *Cf. parallel references in Mark 14:63-72, Luke 22:56-71, and John 18:16-27. |Cf.

And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in He- brew, and Greek, and Latin. Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, \"Write not, 'The King of the Jews'; but that he said, 'I am King of the Jews.\" Pilate answered, \"What I have written I have written.\" Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.

Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead al- ready, they brake not his legs: But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water. And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe. For these things were done, that the scripture should be ful- filled, \"A bone of him shall not be broken.\" And again another scripture saith, \"They shall look on him whom they pierced.\" And after this Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus. And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.

Since Matthew 26:18-20, Mark 14:12-17, and Luke 22:7-15 all clearly state that Jesus ate the Passover supper with his disciples on the previous evening, this ref- erence in St. John's Gospel (as also John 19:14, cited later in this Discourse) has led to much scholarly disputation. However, many authorities find no contradiction, since Passover observances lasted for seven days, not just the day of the ritual supper. A de- tailed discussion may be found in Smith's Bible Dictionary under the heading \"Passover.\" (Publisher's Note) fThis phrase is repeated in John 12:32-33, in which it is clear that Jesus is referring to his crucifixion (see Discourse 66): '\"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.' This he said, signifying what death he should die.\" Thus in the pres- ent verses the implication is that the Jewish officials, by giving Jesus to the Romans to be put to death (since the priests themselves were powerless to render that verdict for 1422"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, \"Art thou the King of the Jews?\" Jesus answered him, \"Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?\" (John 18:28-34). J esus wished to escape answering, over and over, the demeaning queries about his God-given divine credentials. Thus in his reply to Pontius Pilate, he sidesteps the question by shaming the Roman gover- nor for having asked at the prompting of those who were his subjects. Pilate answered, \"Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?\" Jesus answered, \"My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence\" (John 18:35-36).

But my king- dom is 'not from hence'—not here in a particular time and place in this material creation. Kings of a little tract in finite space-time find their dominion demarcated by delusory boundaries of past, present, and future; and marred by the ravaging hand of change. But 'now is my kingdom': My Christ Intelligence is enthroned everlastingly in the unchangeability of the Eternal Now, as Lord of the overarching causal and astral realms as well as the subordinate fiefdom of matter.\" In a few potent words Jesus illumines the difference between the earthly and the divine kingdom.

His consciousness omnipresent in myriad universes with their countless suns and moons and planets, he could not even dream of aspiring to a delimited regal- ity. Divinely humble rather than humanly domineering in his posses- sion of supreme power, his life on earth manifested the quintessential humility of the Cosmic Sovereign. By meekly allowing himself to be crucified, which set the stage for his resurrection, Jesus would prove his immortality and that of all souls. What conceivable fascination with an impermanent mortal king- dom could prevail when one is consciously heir to the empire of Eter- nity? Therefore Jesus' reply to Pilate meant that, being the ruler of an imperishable super-realm, he had trained his disciples not to fight for temporal power or for the purpose of saving a perishable earthly life. By precept and example he inspired in them the supreme wisdom of sacrificing mortal life for the sake of gaining eternal life and bliss. The lesson inherent in his words: \"Since my kingdom is omnipres- ence, I teach my disciples to fight the delusion of earthly attachment to the body and possessions, and thus to secure their own reign in the in- finite kingdom. Those who fight for an earthly domain may or may not receive earthly power. In those who desire worldly dominance there is n o interest in the spiritual quest to acquire immortal invincibility; in those who are interested in acquiring omnipotence in Spirit, there is no inclination to fight for material power and possessions only to lose them quickly at death. Therefore, it is better, if necessary, to forfeit the body and its inconstant treasures to gain realization of the immortality of the soul and its perpetual happiness. It is foolish to waste the precious mo- ments of life in conquests for the impermanent body and its pleasures in utter negligence of the acquisition of everlasting life.\" This world is a place of ambiguity and imperfection; man was not meant to find lasting peace and happiness here. Rather, souls are sent on earth to slough off their delusive mortal guise and regain expression of their divine nature by learning to behave according to the teachings of such exemplars as Jesus Christ, Bhagavan Krishna, the Lord Buddha. The histrionics of life are a motion picture shown in the movie house of God; His individualized selves are the actors who have become lost in identi- fication with their portrayals. Jesus accepted his painful role of death on the cross to show that the earth was not his kingdom—and that for all souls the material world is not their kingdom—by proving his im- mutability despite the body's crucifixion.

Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice.\" In these few words Christ spoke vol- umes. A child of God \"bears witness\" by his life. He embodies truth; if he expound it also, that is generous redundancy. Truth is no theory, no speculative system of philosophy, no in- tellectual insight. Truth is exact correspondence with reality. For man, truth is unshakable knowledge of his real nature, his Self as soul. Jesus, by every act and word of his life, proved that he knew the truth of his being—his source in God.

They will crave death rather than to live and endure such misery.

He accepted his suffering knowing that it was not because of any wrongdoing, but that he was martyring himself for the sake of truth. In exchange for the tem- poraril y painful sacrifice of his body he would receive unqualified eter- nal bliss for fulfilling his God-given mission. Thus Jesus refused to cower in feeling sorry for himself, and in- stead warned those who were weeping for him that they should pity themselves. His words showed no lack of appreciation for the sympa- thy of the women who wailed for him; on the contrary, he was moved by their sympathy to advise them to take steps of spiritual reforma- tion and reparation to alter the course of the impending evils of their own future. * Jesus is quoting from the book of prophet Hosea (10:8). fCf. additional parallel references in Mark 15:12-15, 21. 1474"},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst (John 19:17-18).

Silently and invisibly our Creator shows infinite for- bearance, despite the transgressions of His children —every day of every year in a lifetime, and for all of each one's many lifetimes—sins committed by the misuse of God-given free will. Jesus elsewhere told his followers to forgive their enemies \"seventy times seven.\"* I used to feel confidently virtuous for forgiving my enemies even up to ten times, so I was amazed when I first read those words of Jesus. I couldn't under- stand how we could get along in this world if we were to express such a forgiving nature to enemies who deliberately and repeatedly try to injure us. In answer to my prayers, I heard the Divine Voice speak to me: \"Behold, how many times I forgive man every day of every year throughout countless incarnations!\" I could but humbly acknowledge that it is not too much to ask all to forgive their enemies seventy times seven. (To forgive does not mean to cooperate with or condone evil, but rather to harbor no feelings of hatred or vengefulness nor engage in acts so motivated.) Nearly all persons unknowingly sin against God every day. It is easy to break, or at least bend, His laws and commandments to satisfy impulses and desires. It is not that we should be forgiven because He made us weak human beings and left it to us to somehow become per- fect. Rather, He has placed within us, within this imperfect bodily in- strument, the perfection that belongs to Him. That is why He is so ex- acting, and why He forgives us with repeated opportunities to reclaim our true soul nature. At last He takes us back in spite of all the trans- gressions of misspent lifetimes. Thus it is said, \"Saints are sinners who * Matthew 18:22 (see Discourse 35). 1476 The example of Jesus shows that God is all-forgiving and that man need never fear Him"},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":"never gave up.\" They keep on trying and trying until they conquer. God's standard of perfection—His own image in which He has made us—is absolute, but nevertheless attainable because man's flawed hu- man consciousness is only a graft on his divine consciousness. Those who concentrate steadily on manifesting their native divinity will one day be so overwhelmed by the perfection of their soul nature that they will wonder how they ever behaved so sinfully as human beings! Multitudes of God's children would little know how loving and forgiving the Heavenly Father is, but for the example of Jesus' spirit of forgiveness on the cross. That Jesus, who fully represented almighty God, did not retaliate with his miraculous powers even though he was sorely tried by his persecutors, was an assurance to all mankind that God is ready to forgive His children in spite of their sins and errors. They need never fear their Heavenly Father nor think themselves un- worthy to repent and seek His kingdom. The God in Jesus showed Himself as meek, humble, unconditionally loving, and ever willing to help His children no matter how egregious their offense against Him, His laws, and their own well-being. Of all the miracles performed by Jesus, none was equal to that mightiest miracle of the spiritual victory of divine love over evil: \"Fa- ther, forgive them; for they know not what they ..... do.\" These words have created in human hearts an Greatest of all mira- everlasting monument to Christ-love.  cles performed by Jesus could not be tempted to use divine power Jesus: the love he ex- or any other means except love to conquer the ha- pressed on the cross tred of his wicked brothers. With his spiritual eye opened to Christ and Cosmic Consciousness, Jesus was able con- sciously to wield power over all creation, and could have easily disin- tegrated his enemies. Satan's intent in the crucifixion of Jesus was that it serve as a final temptation, that he might use his miraculous power to save his temporal body. The ever presumptuous Satan expected that the spirit of Jesus would break down under the test on the cross, suc- cumbing to inner weakness of fear or revengefulness that would make him forsake his God-consciousness and thus come under the domin- ion of delusion. But Jesus defeated Satan with the superior powers of his God-united spirit. He conquered with godliness and thus forever banished satanic delusion from the precincts of his soul. Though Satan succeeded in getting Jesus crucified, still the Evil Force had no victory. Jesus used the Satan-created ladder of crucifix- 1477"},{"pageNumber":690,"pageContent":"DISCOURSE 74 JOHN 19:19-24 ion to ascend from all satanic delusion into transcendental freedom in God. His act of forgiveness on the cross was the utterance of a divinely human Jesus who had attained final victory over flesh and cosmic delusion and passed the greatest test to which the flesh can be subject. Even while the dearest thing in life, the human body, was suffering the pangs of torment and imminent death, Jesus did not falter in mani- festing his divine nature. No matter the tortures of the flesh and the severity of the indignity, mockery, and hatred, still he did not succumb to the promptings of human nature. Out of the limitations of flesh he manifested the power of his unlimited spirit and the image of God within him. There are martyrs who have willingly, even smilingly, undergone \\ the tortures of death; but there have been few spiritually advanced enough to possess and yet not to use their miracle power to bring evil- doers to their senses. Jesus never gave signs of his powers or miracles to dissuade his enemies from crucifying him. He gave up his body but never yielded his spirit. The forgiving spirit of the Heavenly Father so perfectly demon- strated by Jesus manifests in all who have attained the Christ Con- sciousness that he had. Here and there on rare occasions we find ex- pression s of that spirit in great devotees of God. And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin. Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, \"Write not, 'The King of the Jews'; but that he said, 'I am King of the Jews.'\" Pilate answered, \"What I have written I have written.\" Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. They said therefore among themselves, \"Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be\": that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, \"They parted my raiment among them, 1478"},{"pageNumber":691,"pageContent":"and for my vesture they did cast lots.\"* These things therefore the soldiers did (John 19:19-24).

And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, \"He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the cho- sen of God.\" And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, and saying, \"If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.\" And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, \"If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.\" But the other answering rebuked him, saying, \"Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.\" And he said unto Jesus, \"Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.\" And Jesus said unto him, \"Verily I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with me in paradise\" (Luke 23:34-43).f 6 6 O) y the truth that I feel within me, I promise unto you that to- iLJ/day after I leave my body thou shalt be in the visible presence of my astral body in the astral world of celestial bliss.\" We see the wonder of divine intercession in how a thief, by his prayer to the almighty Lord manifest in Jesus, was granted liberation in Spirit. Amazing also is that Jesus, though consumed in his own suffering on the cross, did not fail to respond to the appeal of the conscientious thief crucified beside him. One would fain be crucified by the side of Jesus, that he could appeal to Christ for final emanci- pation and be instantaneously assured, \"Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.\" The evil actions of an individual, when he is repentant * Psalms 22:16-18. fCf. additional parallel references in Matthew 27:35-44 and Mark 15:24-32.

Thus it is that the thief had almost paid his karmic debt for his sins by being crucified. And at this juncture, when he was extremely repentant and prayed for redemption in the presence of Christ, he forthwith found it at the hands of Jesus. No matter how great one's sins, they will be forgiven if the devotee loves God deeply enough: \"enough\" is the decisive factor. Jesus ' words speak not only to the thief, but to all humanity about the definite presence of God and His omnipresent abode of bliss (\"paradise\"), where virtuous souls in the after-death state gather befor e His Heavenly Majesty and all the liberated saints. In heaven, unlike earth where every being is recognized by his form, souls do not necessarily see God in the form of a human personage. But if they have sufficient good karma, they may behold Him Reality of the Bliss- as a Light, or a Voice, or as a blissful Presence Abode where Jesus speaking through the intuition of all assembled as- took the thief after trally embodied souls. Advanced souls visiting the death  astral land may see, according to their devotion and degree of Self-realization, any materialized form of the infinitely aspected Father their hearts desire. Just as in- visible hydrogen and oxygen gas can be frozen into ice, so also the invisible Spirit can be frozen into a form by the condensing power of deep devotion. Jesus meant that on that very day, after his soul and that of the thief had transcended their physical bodies by death and gone on to the astral realm, by his divine power he would summon the astral body of the thief into the blissful presence, the realized perception, of the Father. Jesus knew that the thief, because of his evil actions, was headed fo r a lower region of the astral land; but when he found him wholly repentant, he promised him a journey to the higher astral realm, or paradise. The better regions of the astral world, where everything is con- trolled by the will power of the mind independent of physical forces, are free from the limitations and miseries of the material earth; nev- ertheless, its inhabitants are subject to some karmic constraints. The supreme, untrammeled paradise is the state of Cosmic Consciousness and Cosmic Bliss.

After death of the physical body, the soul that is not fully released in Spirit retains its visible luminous astral body of nineteen supra- mental and lifetronic elements and its invisible causal body of thirty- five thoughtronic elements. In the three days between his crucifixion and resurrection, Jesus freed his soul from all ties to his incarnate physical, astral, and causal bodies.* When the soul is liberated from the bondage of all three bodies, it merges with Spirit and remains in- visibly present in Infinitude, retaining a formal individuality but in essence becoming one with Spirit. But every soul immediately after physical death has to go first into the astral paradise of certain limitations. From this paradise, souls may be promoted to the supreme paradise of Cosmic Consciousness, or the super-paradise of the causal world, or demoted to earthly reincarna- tion. It was in the astral paradise that Jesus promised to meet the thief, where both of them would be \"today,\" immediately after physical death. After Jesus reached the supreme state by ascending out of his astral and causal bodies into Cosmic Consciousness, he could then also take the soul of the redeemed thief into the abode of the com- pletely liberated. A person with the divine integrity of Jesus Christ would not have promised the thief paradise unless that Bliss-Abode actually existed. Hence each rationally intelligent human being, instead of remaining stupefied with doubt and spiritual indifference, should try with utmost fervor in meditation to break through the static of material restless- ness and tune in with the higher realities of the astral paradise, and with the invisible aid of God's angels and liberated saints who dwell there to assist God in the governance of creation and the evolution of souls toward liberation. All devotees who are crucified by evil ten- dencies and miseries should ask and pray to their Christ Conscious- ness within, which is crucified by ignorance, for the redemption of the soul from the physical world and its limitations into the greater free- dom of consciousness of astral existence, and the eternal paradise of complete liberation in Spirit. * See Discourse 75. 1481"},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magda- lene. When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, \" Woman, behold thy son!\" Then saith he to the disciple, \"Behold thy mother!\" And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home (John 19:25-27). J esus, feeling a deep spiritual state as he was about to leave his body, spoke to his mother concerning the beloved disciple John, who was with her at the foot of the cross: \"Woman, behold thy son.\" That is, \"Take my disciple as your spiritual son.\" He could not think of Mary as \"mother\" because in his spiritual consciousness he knew that God alone is Father, Mother, Beloved. Thus Jesus called his mother \"woman\"—a God-created woman. In asking her to adopt his beloved spiritual disciple, Jesus was try- ing to console this exceptional woman who had born his body. Then saying, \"Behold thy mother (behold her as your mother),\" he sought to please the grief-stricken disciple with the solace of regarding as his own mother the one who had born the incarnate Christ. After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, \"I thirst.\" Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth (John 19:28-29). * Parallel reference: Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.

The rest said, \"Let be, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him\" (Matthew 27:45-49). * J esus foresaw much of what was to happen to him, not only through the prophecy of the scriptures but through his own intuition and the analysis of the law of karma governing his life. He had willingly accepted the role God had asked of him. Still, on the cross he unmistakably showed th e signs of human struggle against the last tortures and tests of flesh before he entered Spirit. His hu- manness does not detract from the greatness of Jesus; rather, it exalts him in human eyes. It also infuses hope in frail hearts that by the exercise of sheer will force over the body and its temptations man can conquer the flesh and, as did Jesus, rise from the human to the divine plane. If it is reasoned that Jesus was purely divine, or God descended on earth, then it must be concluded that he did not truly feel the agony of sorrow and struggle on the cross. God, being pure Spirit, could not be affected by the tortures of flesh, mere dream changes in a dream body in His dream-created world. It would be hypocrisy or ridiculous dramatization for Jesus to say, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou for- saken me?\" If Jesus were God, how could he feel he was separated from Himself? Or if Jesus were a divine being fashioned in perfection by the Creator and sent to earth only to carry out a preordained ex- emplary mandate, still in his intensity of suffering he would have been merely playacting. Why would God, who is a God of truth, send Jesus to do or to say something that was just a sham? A veritably human and divine Jesus who struggles with the tor- ture s and temptations of flesh, and by dint of soul force attains vic- tory over them and inherits eternal life, is a great source of inspiration and assurance for weak, sorely tempted human beings. A divine, temp- tationless Christ who comes on earth to play out mechanically a pre- *Cf. additional parallel reference in Mark 15:33-36.

A mortally tran- scendent god can conquer temptation because he is not tempted at all; but how could that be expected of a weakling of flesh who is con- stantly subject to inner and outer temptation, from the very beginning of his life, without any definite warning from God except the feeble voice of indistinct conscience? It would be easy for an immortal god, wearing a body but being unaffected by it, to play out a part of sor- row, forgiveness, and crucifixion; but it is formidably difficult for an innocent human being to conquer hatred of others with love, and to accept and endure an unjustified bodily crucifixion at their hands. Jesus, by his divine nature, vanquished the promptings of flesh conjured by satanic temptation.* In his human nature, he felt the ex- cruciating pain in the flesh due to the influence of the satanic intelli- gence, which never waned in its efforts to make Jesus forget God. Thus when the suffering on the cross was intense, Jesus for a while felt God slipping from his consciousness, and in exceedingly great sorrow he cried out, \"Father, Father, why hast Thou forsaken me?\" God played hide-and-seek with Jesus, concealed for a moment be- hind the pangs of Jesus' suffering. And Jesus, childlike, desiring noth- ing but his Father, was prompt in crying out for his Father's reassur- ing presence. Just as a little child led by the hand by his father in a dark forest cries out when he momentarily loses his grasp and the sight of him, so also did Jesus when he felt the guiding hand of his Heav- enly Father, which had led him through the dense forests of incarna- tions, slip away in the darkness of suffering. When Jesus' agony be- came more intense than his awareness of God's presence within himself, he voiced his anguish: \"My God, why am I feeling this pain more than Thy presence? Come to me immediately.\" * As previously noted, even fully liberated masters subject themselves to some degree of cosmic delusion as a prerequisite to incarnating and living in the material world in a physical body. Jesus himself had spoken of his attainment of absolute oneness with Spirit as occurring after leaving his physical form: \"On the third day I shall be per- fected.\" (See commentary in Discourse 57.) \"For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren. ...For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted\" (Hebrews 2:16-18). The limitations voluntarily assumed by God's emis- saries descending into earthly incarnation were previously explained (in Discourses 7 and 8). 1484"},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"Jesus addresses God as his very own: \"My God, my God\" — \"my own Father-God.\" God is a truer friend to man than man is to Him. Thoug h continuously ignored by man, God constantly thinks of him and helps him with power to live, think, feel, and enjoy. He is the Rel- ative of all relatives, without whom we cannot love any kin nor can they love us. For the most part, man's indifference forces God to re- main incognito. But to His devotees, as with Jesus, God is known, per- sonal. He comes out of His hiding place in human desires and the folly o f delusion and lives on the altar of the devotee's conscious devotion. Thus when in the mordant gloom of physical pain Jesus felt the per- sonal contact of God slip away, he prayed, \"My God, You whom I have known consciously to belong to me always, why have You for- saken me?\" That mortal consciousness of separation from God was Satan's test of delusion, opportunely seized upon when God had slipped away to see if Jesus would miss Him. But as soon as Jesus cried out for God, Satan's delusion was defeated. God quickly revealed Himself and restored Jesus' di- vine consciousness with the realization that the suf- fering on the cross was a delusive mental dream with no intrinsic reality, and that he was Spirit, ever- lastingly untouched by suffering. In a dream the solid physical body, the luminous astral body, and the ideational causal body can be perceived as real; when the dreamer completely awakens, those \"realities\" are understood to be a dream, the result of frozen mind, or materialized imagination. Likewise, in the cosmic dream Jesus was bound by his physical, astral, and causal bod- ies with their functional instrumentalities of perception and conscious- ness. It was only when Jesus was completely awake in God, three days after the crucifixion, that the cosmic dream was totally banished in the realization that Spirit alone exists. But that did not ease the difficulty for Jesus while he was on the dream cross and under the influence of the cosmic dream. Pain in a dream causes very real suffering to the dreamer. Only when Jesus lifted his consciousness into Christ Con- sciousness and Cosmic Consciousness was his suffering on the cross dissolved in the bliss of Spirit, in a rejoicing that his life and travails on earth served then and everlastingly to help awaken other souls in Spirit.

Devotees who are in tune with God can realize the thought-dream essentiality of the universe—a dream universe that can be seen as a universe of thought in ecstasy of deep God-communion in meditation. Just as it is impossible to convince a man having a nightmare that he is not suffering, until he is awake, so also it is very difficult to con- vince any human being under the influence of this cosmic dream that he is dreaming delusion. But by continuous good company, ever in- creasingly deep meditation, forsaking evil habits, associating with God-realized saints by emulating their lives and teachings, a spiritual aspirant can awaken in Spirit and prove to himself that this cosmos is a dream. Anyone who would live the teachings of Christ, and keep his I godliness intact when crucified by temptation and the unkindness of misunderstanding people, would realize the dream delusion of the body and its limitations and would find emancipation in God. Jesus proved that he was ready to relinquish the delusive dream, in that he did not want his consciousness of God to be even for an in- stant obliterated by his giving reality to the body and its painful tor- ture on the cross. While he was capable of accepting the most intense physical suffering, he could not stand the pain of even a moment's sep- aration from God. Jesus showed to all humanity that no matter how great the temptations and tortures of the flesh, if one would continu- ously cling to God he would surely find ultimate response from Him and complete emancipation. Jesus demonstrated the human qualities of the Heavenly Father, in that He readily responds to human heart- appeals, even as the earthly father is moved by the entreaties of his child. God does not expect man to be completely free from delusion so long as he wears a human body; but that is not an excuse to surren- der to body consciousness. Everyone has in his soul the same power that God has to destroy this delusion; therefore, one must not yield to its incursions, but courageously resist it. It is best to stay away from evil influences by use of the soul power of discrimination, and to com- mune regularly with the inner Self so that one will know and experi- ence the stronger power of the soul's bliss. God-consciousness is hard to attain, but it is unceasing throughout eternity once it is made one's own. Rather than giving in to the body in any way, one should endure with evenmindedness every experience that comes. It is not that suf- 1486"},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"fering should be invited, but that the mind should be kept strong when pain and misfortune do come. One who conquers mentally finds there is no more suffering. While entertaining the delusive dream of the body, Jesus felt forsaken by God; but when with all his soul force he summoned the Divine Presence, he regained the realization that the body was made of energy and the nails were made of energy—there was no more suffering. He was free. The more one cedes reality to suf- fering, the more one will suffer; there will be no end to it until that dream is transcended. Jesus underwent the terrible ordeal on the cross to show us all that experiences of earthly life have no more power to affect us than our nightly dreams when we realize God.* When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is fin- ished\": and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost (John 19:30)- Parallel references: Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent.... Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, \"Truly this was the Son of God.\" And many women were there beholding afar off, which fol- lowed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children (Matthew 27:50-56). * \"The ideas of heat and cold, pleasure and pain, are produced by the contacts of the senses with their objects.

After death, ordinary persons experience a sort of deep sleep, checkered by certain astral experiences and visions according to the degree of their good karma.

But divine devotees who by successful meditation and pure devotion to the Lord have freed their souls from the attachment of worldly desires find that death opens a portal to ascension into the blissful omnipresence of the infinite transcendental Father. When Jesus was to launch his soul into Spirit, all nature recog- nized the event. The rending of the temple veil, symbolically inter- preted, signifies that the spiritually victorious life of Jesus tore aside th e veil of mystery that hides the ultimate truth. In a poetic sense it can be said that when Jesus, who was omnisciently present in the cos- mos as well as in the temple, passed away and was lost to the physi- cal gaze of the world, even the temple veil could not hide its sorrow: its atoms burst forth and let loose their hidden grief—as did the trem- blin g earth and the darkened sun. During earthly existence an ordinary individual is only conscious of his body, which, moving from one place to another, sees during the state of wakefulness different portions of materially circumscribed space. However, even the ordinary individual during the state of sleep perceives the higher power of mind working in dreams, unfettered by constraints of the normal laws of physics; and also, during the state of deep dream- les s sleep, a limited sphere of the quiescent joy of the soul. In contrast, the Christlike person, even during earthly existence, sees not only limited portions of space through his physical eyes, but also beholds through his spiritual eye of intuition the entire manifested cosmos, illumined by the astral light and Christ Consciousness, with all the planets and stars like glowworms glimmering in the immeasurable vastness of space-time. Nevertheless, even a saint with Christ Consciousness has certain limitations, in that his awareness embraces all creation—the inconceiv- ably varied maya- show of forms and forces interacting in the cosmic ma- trix of sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic qualities—but not the vibrationless transcenden t realm where the Creator Himself abides. In the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord declares: \"It is difficult indeed to go beyond the influence of My divine cosmic hypnosis, imbued with the triple qualities. Only those who take shelter in Me become free from this power of illusion.\"* Jesus Christ demonstrated the utmost fulfillment of this divine promise, lifting his God-surrendered soul into full transcendence with the words: \"Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.\" * God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita vil:i4. 1489"},{"pageNumber":702,"pageContent":"God the Father is not limited to the transcendental infinitude; He is simultaneously conscious of the eternal void beyond the manifested cosmos as well as every atom and vibratory force within it. Great saints and masters in transcendent states of samadhi can commune with the Father present in all creation, but when they reach the final state their \"communion\" is oneness with the Absolute within and be- yond creation. Cosmic Consciousness or God the Father exists in its pure state beyond all creation, and in secret as the Christ Consciousness in all creation. Spirit, in order to manifest creation, divides Itself into the Father-Creator who transcends creation, the Son or reflected Christ Consciousness within creation, and Cosmic Vibration or Holy Ghost, the substance of creation. Since God has thus created Himself into these three aspects, and into the cosmos and all its creatures, human beings seeking to reunite with Him first have to rise by meditation from the consciousness of plurality to the consciousness of trinity: Holy Ghost, Christ Consciousness, and God the Father. After that, the devotee must attain the final realization of the trinity or triune mani- festations of God as the One Absolute Spirit—the ever-existing, ever- conscious, omnipresent, ever-new Bliss. While incarnate in his human body, Jesus with his Christ Con- sciousness could feel his omnipresence in the entire cosmos and knew that Christ Consciousness to be a reflection of God's Cosmic Con- sciousness; but embodiment precluded complete unity with God the Fathe r as the transcendental Absolute. After working out through cer- tain ecstatic purification rites the remaining seeds of his physical, as- tral, and causal incarnate karma in the three days after crucifixion, Jesus was able to merge his Christ Consciousness with the Cosmic Consciousness, or God the Father, the Absolute beyond all delusory relativities of vibratory manifestation.

In the resurrection of Jesus we have the assurance of our Creator that God-realized devotees, if they wish, can find not only immortality of the soul but also of the body. The whole drama of Jesus' life was a testament to the supremacy of man's spirit over matter. He had willingly incarnated in a human form, partaking of its inherent limitations, to show matter-bound souls the way to conquer every form of delusion imposed on them by the overreaching power of Cosmic Satan.

Though restoring life to a deceased body, as Jesus did for Lazarus, is in- deed one form of resurrection, what Jesus evidenced after his crucifixion was much higher. It was the resurrection of the soul into oneness with Spirit—the soul's ascension from delusory confinement of body con- sciousness into its native immortality and everlasting freedom. Lazarus and others whose bodies were raised from the dead by Jesus gained new life, new opportunity for spiritual advancement; but Jesus' resurrection lifted his consciousness beyond all relativities of vibratory creation and merged his Self with the transcendental Father, Absolute Spirit. After attaining oneness with the Absolute, Jesus infused his Spirit- expantled soul back into his crucified body, immortalizing it, and re- turned to his bereft disciples in physical form. Jesus accomplished this ascension in definite steps after his cruci- fixion. To Mary Magdalene, who was the first disciple to see him on Easter morning, Jesus said: \"Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\" Why did he tell Mary not to touch him? What did he mean when he said, \"I am not yet ascended to my Father\"? There is deep signifi- cance here. Jesus had prophesied that he would rise again after \"three days\" or \"on the third day\" after his crucifixion: Three stages of Jesus' '\"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise ascension into Spirit it up.'...He spake of the temple of his body.\"* after death  \"Three days\" means in three periods. Jesus was not emphasizing in a literal sense the twenty-four hours in each day, but three phases of expression required to liberate his soul from the physical to the astral plane and then to the spiritual or causal plane, and from there to complete mergence in the Cosmic Conscious- ness of the Father. Many incarnations are required for an unevolved soul to accomplish this. But Jesus knew the process of descent into flesh that had been required for the incarnation on earth of his previously liberated soul, and with this knowledge and power he needed simply to employ the creative principles that would reverse that process. Thus he would quickly be able to free his soul again from physical, astral, and causal limitations by three distinct efforts, and would be able to reunite it with the omniscience and omnipotence of the Spirit. *John 1:19-21.

Similarly, when Jesus entered mahasamadhi, a God-realized soul's conscious ascension from the physical body at the time of death, he merged his consciousness in the blissful presence of the Cosmic Con- sciousness of God the Father and thence returned to his yet-to-be relin- quished heavenly garbed astral form. Therein in Christ ecstasy he began expeditiously to unloose, with the supreme soul-science of liberation, the knots of life and consciousness that both enabled and resulted from his earthly incarnation. Expressed succinctly, human nature is an interaction of the three gunas or essential creative and motivating qualities of Cosmic Nature, identified in the scriptures of India as sattva, tamas, and rajas —the good or elevating mode, the evil or grossening mode, and the activat- ing mode.* The seeds of one's past actions, actions that were stimu- lated by the good, bad, and activating qualities, remain subtly lodged in the astral and causal bodies of the physically dead individual. As the Bhagavad Gita states: \"All action is universally engendered by the attributes (gunas) of primordial Nature (Prakriti)....Deluded by the at- tributes of primordial Nature, the ignorant must cling to the activities engendered by those gunas .\"f Overcoming the sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic karma invading the three bodies of man is required for any incarnate soul to disengage from Nature's delusive domain and return to oneness with the eternal bliss of Spirit. \"The gunas inherent in Prakriti— sattva, rajas, and tamas —imprison in the body the Imper- ishable Dweller....Having transcended the three modes of Nature— the cause of physical embodiment—a man is released from the suf- ferings of birth, old age, and death; he attains immortality.\"^: *The gunas, quiescent in Spirit, are stirred by God the Creator to bring forth cosmic creation in its spiritual, gross, and active manifestations; and in the microcosm of man to manifest the instrumentalities of consciousness, mind, and senses and to influence the expression thereof.

The soul and its astral and causal bodies are knotted to the physical form in the seven subtle cere- brospinal centers. When the mortal karmic sentence determining one's lifespan is over, the astral- and causal-bodied soul is loosed from those knots in the seven centers that had tied it to that physical body. When the ordinary person dies, his life and consciousness withdraw from the physical spine and exit the material body through the medulla oblongata—remaining in an astral body in the astral world until his karm a ordains graduation to the higher causal world or reincarnation on the physical plane. But the yogi who has opened his spiritual eye per- ceives with it that hidden in the physical spine are four concentric tubes or tunnels—three lifetronic and one of ideational magnetism—through which his soul has descended into the causal body, the astral body, and finally the material body. The yogi reverses this descension by taking his soul through these four tunnels and seven secret obstructing doors or centers, ascending to freedom beyond encasement in all three bodies. Within the physical spine is the outermost astral spine or sushumna, wit h its outward-branching astral nadis, the subtle counterpart of the physical nervous system. Within the sushumna is the vajra lifetronic tunnel, and within that is the chitra lifetronic tunnel.

Otherwise one passes only through the outermost, golden ring of the spiritual eye and exits the material body through the astral center in the medulla oblongata at the base of the skull. But departure can also be through the top of the head, through the occult portal known as the Brahmarandhra, Brahma's Door. This\\s in the seventh astral center, the sahasrara or \"thousand- petaled lotus\" in the cerebrum. It is closed in the ordinary individual; but when one is highly advanced this Brahma's Door opens. Through it one reaches Brahma directly; by exiting consciously through that opening in the thousand-petaled lotus center of Cosmic Consciousness one ascends directly to the God the Father region. The golden disc is the portion of the telescopic eye through which all astral creation is visible. To reach the astral universe, one must go through the gold of the spiritual eye. Through the blue of the spiritual eye, Christ Consciousness present in all creation is revealed. To reach th e causal universe one must go through the blue region of the spiritual eye . When one can enter the tiny silvery white star of the spiritual eye, then through the brahmanadi one ascends higher than the medulla or spiritual eye, beyond the physical, astral, and causal vibratory universes. In the astral region is the reigning Holy Ghost or Aum Vibration. In the causal is God the Son, or the Christ Consciousness. And the vi- brationless infinitude beyond, reached through the star in the spiritual eye, is the boundless region where Cosmic Consciousness, God the Fa- ther, dwells. It is impossible with mere intellect to comprehend fully the intri- cacies of the astral and causal passageways to liberation and their cor- relation with the spiritual eye. They are gradually revealed to intuitive perception by the practice of Kriya Yoga. What is important is to be so absorbed in the spiritual eye and divine bliss of meditation that when the time comes to leave the body, through the blessings of God and guru the yogi knows how to take his soul through the spiritual * God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita viii:8-io. 717"},{"pageNumber":719,"pageContent":"eye and the spinal centers and break out of the jail of embodiment into the freedom of Spirit.

No soul, no saint, no Christ or Buddha has resurrected himself—at the time of death or in the highest samadhi states of med- itation—without entering this inner door to transcendent conscious- ness. As soon as one frees the soul from the physical, astral, and idea bodies, he can merge with the Formless Absolute or experience one- ness with the Great Light of the universe. That is the light of the Infi- nite Christ, the God-essence and sustenance of all creation.\"' So resurrection does not mean only resurrection of the body, but the ascension of the soul from all three bodily encasements to live im- mortally in oneness with the Spirit that is manifest- ing as the whole universe. When after death Jesus How Jesus re-created had neutralized the mechanism of the three gunas, his deceased body af- and had burnt all karmic seeds resulting from his ter ascending in Spirit incarnate cause-effect actions, he ascended from the three bodies straightway into the bosom of God. Then he had power even as God has. From that supreme state, Jesus could put on his body again or cast it off at will. A liberated master such as Jesus need not depend on the natural way of returning to earth by the slow process of rebirth and growth into maturity. When one becomes Spirit, he can materialize a body and lock himself in it, then dematerialize it any time he chooses.

But if he possesses the key, he can go up and come down as he pleases. So Jesus, having unlocked his soul from the physical, astral, and causal forms, could not only ascend into Spirit but also come down again and bring a new body with him. Even as God by special creation formed the bodies of the first Adam and Eve, so ascended masters, af- ter they rise above the limiting confines of the three bodies, can create a body that they had in any incarnation; or can remodel the bodies that they left behind in death, as Jesus' body was, and make them immortal. Thus Jesus after crucifixion could appear among his disciples for forty days, materializing and dematerializing his form before their eyes. Rationalizing minds have proposed that when Jesus was crucified he did not actually die, but remained in a temporary state of suspended animation and later revived himself (or was taken from the tomb and revived by his disciples). That is not so. In suspended animation, the soul does not exit fully from the body; life remains in the spine and the brain, sustaining the body, even though breath and heart are completely sus- pended. When the soul, with its astral and causal bodies, goes away completely from the cerebrospinal plexuses, withdrawing the guiding in- telligence and life force that empowers the specialized functions of life energy in the bodily cells, then the cells begin to disintegrate and the body begins to decay.* As long as the soul is still in the body, the body does not decay even when all outwardly observable vital functions cease. It is known that there are various kinds of bodily suspension from which \"resurrection\" is possible. Sadhu Haridas, for example, as cited earlier, was buried forty days in a deathlike trance, and was then disin- terred and revived.f But it is nonsense to suggest that Jesus was only in a state of suspended animation. Spiritually I know that after crucifixion Jesus completely left his body. His life and consciousness fled not only from the physical muscles and heart, but also from the spine and brain. He gave up the ghost; soul and life were completely out of that body. The gruesome way that his body was crucified—pierced in many places, including the heart—made it impossible for the highly organized phys- iological life to remain in that body. That is why Saint John testified: * Cosmic energy in the body works as five specialized currents, empowering the per- formance of the crystallizing ( prana ), assimilating ( samana), eliminating (apana), me- tabolizing ( udana ), and circulatory ( vyana ) activities of the body. fSee Discourse 8 for details of story of Sadhu Haridas. 719"},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"\"Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.

Though in suspended animation life is withdrawn from the heart and other bodily organs, if the medulla or the heart is some- how damaged while the body is in the trance state then life cannot be reintroduced, and death ensues. It cannot be physically proved that the soul has gone out of the body unless the body has been destroyed or its vital organs irreparably damaged, or (as mentioned above) decay has started. When decay sets in, the soul ordinarily cannot return to that body. But Jesus understood the relation between Cosmic Life and the specialized life in the body. That is why he could revive Lazarus after his disciple's body had been decaying for four days;f and why he could say of himself: \"I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.That Jesus was able to rebuild his body at will after death had claimed it was possible only when his soul was liberated from the three bodies. Hav- ing attained complete ascension in Spirit, he had the creative power of Spirit to bring specialized life back into his deceased body to regener- ate its cells and resurrect that form to live and breathe again. Now Jesus had the option to resurrect his crucified body or to de- materialize that form and create a new body composed of new atoms \"•John 19:32-35. fSee Discourse 60, explanation of how Jesus accomplished this, tjohn 10:17-18 (see Discourse 52). 720"},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":"for his reappearance after resurrection. As Spirit, he perceived his old body as Infinite Consciousness, ideationally formed of Cosmic Light, existing as a material illusion in the merest tremor of the Creator's thought. An illusion and its duplicate are equally the same. Grossness, light, consciousness, all are of the sole essence of Spirit, as real or as insubstantial as the delusion of cosmic manifestation deems them to be. To the Spirit-united Jesus, his form was only a dream image of mal- leable thought subject to the command of his divine will. He was able to infuse his life into his spiritualized flesh-and-blood form, coursing into the body through the mouth of God in the medulla, down through the ^pine, and out into the vital nerves and organs. He did it scientifically, through the creative Cosmic Vibration of Holy Ghost and oneness with the Christ Consciousness Intelligence of God in every atom and creative principle of cosmic manifestation. Medical scientists work to achieve bodily healing and reconstruc- tion from the outside; but some injuries and diseases defy cure, because the doctors do not understand the combined interaction of lifetronic currents that forms new flesh and tissues. But one who has control of Cosmic Life as well as specialized life can bring the intelligent Cosmic Energy into the physical form to reinforce and rouse the specific bodily life forces. As soon as that is done, the cells begin to throb with life and to repair or dispel damaged and dead cells. That is what Jesus did. And when the body was renewed, he lived again in his resurrected form. Man thinks of his body as compact, solid matter; but science now defines the body as waves of electromagnetic energy.

Resurrection means to bring the body back again by the power of will after it has been disintegrated, as Jesus did when his resurrected form repeatedly appeared and disappeared before many of his disciples. He had that control of the electricity of the entire cosmos, with its constituent lifetronic creative cosmic energy. Jesus said, \"If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.\" By taking his consciousness through the spiritual eye, he entered the reality of his fleshly body as divine light, the resurrec- tion of flesh into the Infinite Christ and God. In deep meditation on the inner spiritual eye, one can experience this transcendence: By con- sciously withdrawing the life energy and consciousness from the senses and muscles and nerves, one can perceive the sublimation of the body into the rays of the spiritual eye, transforming the consciousness of flesh into the consistency of light. The light of the body is resurrected into the Cosmic Christ Light, the mind into Cosmic Consciousness, the human will into Divine Will, the mortal life into Eternal Life, the joy of the soul into the Bliss of Spirit. The ocean is behind all individual waves. So is God behind the cells of our body, behind every thought, behind every breath and beat of the heart. He is the Light and the body is a flicker of that Light; its fibers, rays of radiant energy. That is what Jesus realized. He could resurrect his body because he knew its atoms and subatomic particles were nothing but radiations of that Great Light. With control of that Infinite Power and Intelligence, he condensed it into astral lifetronic rather discrete conscious, usually nonthinking entities that are responsible for the de- tailed working of the universe.'... \"Brahman, which is Reality, is pure Consciousness....This Consciousness is re- flected in maya and the products of maya.

Resurrection has been well understood by accomplished yogis of In- dia since the dawn of the highest ages. Jesus himself was a realized yogi: one who knew and had mastered the spiritual science of life and death, God-communion and God-union, one who knew the method of liberation from delu- sion into the kingdom of God. Jesus showed through- out his life and death his power of complete mastery over his body and mind and the oft-recalcitrant forces of nature. We understand resurrection in its true sense when we com- prehend the yoga science that clearly defines the underlying principles by which Jesus resurrected his crucified body into the freedom and light of God. Legendary are the God-knowing masters of India who raised their bodies after death. The revered medieval master Kabir had a devout following that included both Hindu and Muslim disciples. A story is told that at the time of his death there was a divisive quarrel regarding the funeral rites. The Hindus argued that it would be proper to consign the body to the ceremonial fires of cremation, and the Muslims insisted on their tradition of burial. Their discord was so distressing to their master that he broke the after-death paramount vow of silence. He rose up and in a voice of rebuke and of assurance of his ever-living presence he told his disciples: \"Half of my remains should be buried with Mus- lim rites. Let the other half be cremated with a Hindu sacrament.\" When the disciples lifted the shroud that had covered Kabir's form, they found that their master had dematerialized his body and left in its stead an array of flowers. Dutifully, half of the blooms were cremated by the Hindus, and the remaining half buried by the Muslims. In modern times, authoritative eyewitness accounts bore testimony that the Yogavatar Lahiri Mahasaya consciously left his body before a gathering of devotees in Banaras; and then appeared again in the flesh in three different cities the day after his discarded body had been cre- mated. * I myself was blessed to receive the visitation of my resurrected guru Sri Yukteswarji, who appeared to me in flesh and blood more than * Recorded in Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 36.

Just as in the exalted state of nirvikalpa samadhi the soul realizes perfect unity with Spirit yet does not lose its individuality, so the resur- rected Jesus—having ascended from the confinement of his physical, astral, and causal bodies into the Infinite-bodied Cosmic Consciousness—manifested his Jesus form not apart from Spirit but as the Infi- nite who has become Jesus, all individualized souls, and all manifestation. In his oneness with Spirit, he perceived through Infinite Consciousness his Jesus body, and the bodies of all others, acting their parts in the cosmic dream-drama, with the power of cosmic delusion designating form and egoity but no longer hiding the connection between God's dream and the personalized dream of individual existence. With his consciousness translated into God's consciousness, he could change the dream of his crucified body into a remodeled resurrected dream form in God's cosmic dream. Though Jesus returned to his disciples for forty days after his res- urrection, reappearing in the physical body so familiar to his followers, his divinely manifested flesh prevented them from easily recognizing him.f His resurrected body was indeed possessed of its customary so- lidity, though during those forty days he repeatedly resolved its atoms into the Cosmic Light—\"he vanished out of their sight\"—and at other times rematerialized it before his astonished disciples: \"And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them.\" \"Then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, 'Peace be unto you.'\" Rejoinin g the apostles on the evening of his resurrection day, Jesus at e with them broiled fish and honeycomb, an act of confirmation of his physical reality.

Just as a rich man can share his wealth with those he deems worthy, so great masters pos- sessing spiritual abundance can, by sheer divine grace, enlarge their faithful disciples' endowment of God-realization. Jesus had demonstrated this dur- ing his incarnation, when he imparted to his apos- tles \"power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.\"* After his resurrection, he again spiritually baptized them with the Cosmic Vibratory Power of Aum: \"He breathed on them, and saith unto them, 'Receive ye the Holy Ghost.'\" Liberated masters are unrestrained in the omnipresence of the In- finite, fully capable of bestowing their blessings even after physical death.

Followers of all spiritual paths ought to appreciate the fact that doubt, constructively applied, is what keeps true religion free of the superstition of dogma and the fanaticism of blind belief. Religion should be treated as a science; it is right that it be subjected to the test of experience. For millenniums in India, the rishis, as spiritual scientists, employed reason, observation, and systematic investigation to arrive at definite and replicable proof of divine truths. When religion is approached scientifically, belief ma- tures into realization—a direct knowing by soul intuition that bestows the blessed certitude of unshakable faith even upon \"they that have no t seen,\" independent of the physical senses. Jesus' resurrection was little understood, and much disbelieved even though he made himself visible to hundreds of people—not only to his close disciples.t In those days they compre- hended only that Jesus was dead and then he was alive, but they did not understand the science and art of ascension and resurrection, as is defined in the timeless scriptures of Yoga. No other science has detailed the descent of the individualized con- sciousness of God as the soul into man and its evolutionary and spir- itual ascent back into Spirit. In this modern age, Kriya Yoga has been brought forward after being lost in the dark ages, as a definite method to hasten the spiritual evolution of human consciousness and open the inner cerebrospinal pathway of ascension, releasing the soul through * Lahiri Mahasaya once asked Mahavatar Babaji to materialize himself to satisfy the curiosity of some friends.

The life and consciousness of an ordinary person is so tied to the sensibilities and attachments of the flesh that he cannot begin to ascend from the delusion of the body until he falls asleep or until death removes that body cage. Entering the subconscious state that underlies the outer waking consciousness, every night man partially ascends from bodily identification, but not enough. He reaches the borderland touching su- perconsciousness in deep dreamless sleep, but upon awakening goes back into the body tomb again. In death one ascends a little farther; but as in sleep, this release from the sepulcher of the body is involuntary and temporary. One must incarnate again and again until he has finished his fascination with the desires and attachments of physical existence. Why not learn to transcend body identification consciously and permanently? In the science of yoga, God-union—specifically, the technique of Kriya Yoga, the precise application of that science—India's masters have given the key to resurrection, the key to the kingdom of God. An adept of Kriya Yoga conquers death by taking the soul beyond identification with the physical body, consciously and at will; and then returning to the consciousness of the mortal form again. By this process, he experiences the body as merely the material dwelling place of the soul. He can remain therein as long as he wants; and after that body has fulfilled its usefulness, he can quit it at will without suffer- ing physical pain or mental pain due to attachment, and enter his om- nipresent home in God. Saint Paul said, \"I protest by our rejoicing which I have in Christ...I die daily.\"* Kriya Yoga, or a similar technique, was known by Saint Paul; through this science of ascension, he was able to withdraw his life force and consciousness from the body into the bliss (\"rejoicing\") of Christ Consciousness. In transcendent meditation he could experience daily the state of conscious death when the soul does away with body consciousness and its physical and mental restlessness and activity, and the breath and heartbeat slow down to almost nothing or cease alto- gether. After mastering the breathless superconscious state, the soul can ascend through the spine, make contact with the Christ Consciousness, and return again to the body—switching the life force on and off at will from external bodily senses and activity.

Everyone eventually has to ascend, to free the soul into the divine kingdom of higher consciousness after death, and thence into its origin in the Infinity of Spirit. There is only one escape and that is to commune with God. This requires not only conscientious continuity in practicing the esoteric meditation methods of transcendence, but also application of the equally essential Christlike principles of moral and spiritual behavior, which provide the substructure enhancing, supporting, and making firm the devotee's gains in meditation. The foundational steps of the yoga sci- ence enumerated as yama and niyama by Patanjali in his Yoga Sutras, and the soul qualities of the devotee advancing in God-realization set forth by Sri Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita,* merge in harmonious illumination of the way of Christ perfection taught by Jesus in his Sermon on the Moun t and other discourses. These emissaries of God speak with a united voice that the way to ascension is to love all, forgetting oneself in selfless service and upliftment of others; to disengage oneself from at- tachments to the senses, to possessions, and to the emotions that keep one body- and ego-bound (anger, fear, lust, greed); and to love God su- premely and meditate so deeply that one can at will enter the ecstasy of superconsciousness—the portal to the final states of ascension in Christ (Kutastha Chaitanya) and Cosmic Consciousness (Sat-Chit-Ananda). Practice the edicts of the great ones; do not insult their offering of the gift of liberation by merely mouthing what they have said. It is by Christlike behavior, and by constancy in deep meditation, that the as- piring devotee can go beyond the physical self, the astral self, and the shell of consciousness with which the soul is burdened, and find bliss- ful resurrection in Spirit. * \"Fearlessness, purity of heart, perseverance in acquiring wisdom and in practicing yoga, charity, subjugation of the senses, performance of holy rites, study of the scrip- tures, self-discipline, straightforwardness; noninjury, truthfulness, freedom from wrath, renunciation, peacefulness, nonslanderousness, compassion for all creatures, absence of greed, gentleness, modesty, lack of restlessness; radiance of character, forgiveness, pa- tience, cleanness, freedom from hate, absence of conceit—these qualities are the wealth of a divinely inclined person\" (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita xvi:i-3). Patanjali's yama and niyama, found in Yoga Sutras 11:30, 32, consist of noninjury, truthfulness, nonstealing, control of sex force, noncovetousness, purity of body and mind, contentment in all circumstances, self-study (contemplation), and devotion to God. 728"},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"J V  ^  /Ifter these things Jesus shewed himself again C/l to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.

On the night before his crucifixion, Jesus had prophesied that Peter, succumb- ing to karmic inner weakness and the temptation of delusion, would three times deny his association with Jesus: \"But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\" In a final confirmation of that intercessory blessing, in this poignant scene on the shore of the sea of Galilee (Tiberias), three times Jesus asked Peter to reaffirm his love for his master, and his dedication to shoulder the mission of the Good Shepherd of souls: \"Feed my sheep.\" And with his disciple's positive response, three times Jesus re- inforced Peter's faith that would sustain him when his hour of perse- cution would come.

Jesus further declares that those who observe the holy precepts of eterna l truth, as he has commanded, will be in tune with the Infinite Christ and therein find him ever with them, \"even unto the end of the world.\" In his oneness with the Christ Intelligence eternally omnipresent in cre- ation, Jesus' guidance and protection would continue to shelter those disciples who kept in tune, as long as the manifested cosmos endures. Jesus also promised that those who would have communion with Christ Consciousness through the Holy Ghost Cosmic Vibration, \"in my name,\" would have healing power to cast out devils of satanic delusion and disease from themselves and others. \"They shall take up serpents\" means that by remaining \"in my name,\" in the Christ-imbued Holy Vi- bration of Aum, they would find their own ultimate ascension by uplift- ing the subtle kundalini \"serpent force\" through the awakened astral cen- ters of the spine and brain to attain God-consciousness.

The brand of a particular faith is put on man wanted his disciples to by birth, geography, or dogma, and if one or more preach worldwide of these determines a person's religion he has very little to boast about. An imposed myopic perspective disdains as hea- thenis m the use of any different form of prayer or worship or termi- nolog y than one's own in approaching the Deity. Heathenism, rather, lies in the absence of expression of soul qualities, no matter one's faith. If man would feast his mind fully on the soul qualities, the goodness in his fellow beings, there would be no appetite left for indigestible dif- ferences. This appreciation is the foundation of tolerance, which under- lies the recognition of the brotherhood of man under the one Father- Mother-Friend Beloved God. This is Christ's teaching. This is the universal spiritual undertone of Jesus' command to his apostles, \"Go and preach my message to the whole world.\" Whether his message is rudi- mentally understood as a way to salvation based on a spiritual morality 734"},{"pageNumber":736,"pageContent":"and love for God and one another, or comprehended in its highest intent as extolling the science of soul ascension, it is inclusive of the expression of soul qualities fostered in all good customs, traditions, and faiths. All prophets who sang truth through their lives, in the different ages, were fountains of the One Divine Source. It was God who spoke through the Vedas and Upanishads, the Bible and the Koran, the Dhammapada, Talmud, and Grantha Sahib. Whenever darkness has ravaged the earth, those that groped in it sent forth muffled cries. This anguish of millions of benighted souls silently passed through the ether of human con- sciousness. Divine souls, those who have dispelled from within them- selves the darkness o^ delusion and have become transparent channels as sons of God, arise at Divine Command from the womb of time to ren- der help and redeem souls entombed in the sepulcher of ignorance. The message of some prophets addresses the needs of a particular culture and age; but those emissaries who are commissioned with a God-given world mission deliver universal truths that resonate through- out all ages in timeless relevancy. Such was the spoken and lived mes- sage of Jesus, as also the ageless yoga science immortalized in scripture in its citation by Bhagavan Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, opening the door to soul liberation since ancient times. Liberated souls such as Jesus, whose mission continues beyond their incarnation, are able to materialize their bodies at will anywhere in the —— astral heavens or in the physical world at any time— \"Lo, I am with you al- today or unto thousands of years after their ascen- way\": perceiving Jesus sion. That is why Jesus could say in truth to his dis- in form and as the in- ciples: \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end finite formless Christ of the world.\" He immortalized his body as well as his spirit. Any true devotee can see him as Jesus Christ or know him as one with the Infinite Christ. Saint Francis, born centuries after Jesus, used to see him every night in Assisi. Saint Teresa of Avila knew him both in form and as the Formless Christ. Numerous divinely attuned souls have seen him. He has come to me many, many times— whenever I so desire, he appears to me, with his wondrous eyes in which universes revolve, emanating the love of God omnipresent in the Christ Consciousness. Any devotee whose concentration is very deep and whose devotion is pure and persistent can see him by peering through the om- niscient spiritual eye at the Christ Consciousness center in the forehead. Intensity and perseverance are necessary; most devotees pray a little while, but soon get discouraged and give up. To such lukewarm effort, 735"},{"pageNumber":737,"pageContent":"Jesus will not respond. Even so, he is listening to every prayer, waiting for the devotee to become receptive and consciously welcome his presence. It is not a matter of visualizing him or attempting to produce the form of Christ through imagination. That will result in an image being projected by the subconscious mind, just as figures are created in nightly dreams—and it will not be the Christ. Rather, one must pray without ceasing, as Jesus taught. By the practice of Kriya Yoga, taking the con- sciousness into the kingdom of God within, and then praying again and again for Christ's appearance, the devotee can behold the real Christ right in front of him. At first it will be in a vision perceptible to the sense of sight. When the vision can be seen with open as well as with closed eyes, then by even higher development in the intensity of devotion and concentration, the presence of Christ will manifest as a materialized form. That is the ultimate vision, in which one can touch the body of Jesus and talk with him, just as truly as when he walked the earth. The intimately real sensation of touching the materialized form is not the same as contact with the gross matter of an incarnate form, but the re- alization of the true essence of the body as a combination of spiritually magnetic vibrations informed from the Cosmic Bliss ideations of God, imparting a wondrous elevating thrill of joy and blessing. Jesu s was born in a human body; he was crucified; and he resur- rected himself. He rebuilt his body, and his soul entered that resurrected form. But he did not re-create a body to remain confined in it. Though he appeared in physical form to his disciples many times after crucifix- ion, he dissolved that body again. To understand him only as incarnate in a body that was crucified and then resurrected is not appreciably to understand Christ as he is. Incarnate or after resurrection, Jesus was not only a physical personality, but a vessel of the infinite Christ Conscious- ness. While he resurrected himself in the body, he resurrected his spirit from the confinement of form into omnipresent Spirit. In oneness with the Infinite Christ, he is resurrected in every newborn body, and in you an d me, and in all people of the earth, and in everything that has life. He is resurrected in the winking stars, in the planets, and in the cosmic blue. H e is resurrected in all things that grow from the earth—in the grass and in the tenderest rose. He feels his resurrection in every form that exists. He is risen in every atom and cell of the capacious cosmos. * * \"Jesus said: 'I am the light that is over all things. I am all: from me all came forth, an d to me all attained. Split a piece of wood; I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there'\" (Gospel of Thomas, verse 77). 736"},{"pageNumber":738,"pageContent":"In the Bhagavad Gita (xni:i3-i7), Lord Krishna, from his own oneness with God's Universal Consciousness, lauds this immanent- transcendent Omnipresence of Spirit: He dwells in the world, enveloping all—everywhere, His hands and feet; present on all sides, His eyes and ears, His mouths and heads; Shining in all the sense faculties, yet transcending the senses; unattached to creation, yet the Mainstay of all; free from the gunas (modes of Nature), yet the Enjoyer of them. He is within and without all that exists, the animate and the inanimate; near He is, and far; imperceptible because of His subtlety. He, the Indivisible One, appears as countless beings; He main- tains and destroys those forms, then creates them anew. The Light of All Lights, beyond darkness; Knowledge itself, That which is to be known, the Goal of all learning, He is seated in the hearts of all. This is how Jesus wants his devotees to know him: not to limit him to a form, but to understand his resurrection in omnipresence, to perceive him as one with the Infinite Light of Christ Consciousness. Through the spiritual eye, the worshiper can behold not only the Christ with form, but the formless Christ felt in the vastness of inner perception, because Christ is already present at that divine center of consciousness in all human beings. To experience Christ as the Cos- mic Intelligence is far more wonderful than just seeing an image in- formed out of that Infinite Christ. That is the transcendental Christ which is the \"only begotten Son,\" the only begotten reflection of the Heavenly Father's Cosmic Consciousness in all creation. \"Behold, he cometh with clouds (he shall come out of the clouds of ignorance) and every eye (spiritual eye) shall see him\" (Revelation 1:7). It is the Spirit behind the body of Christ with which one should strive to be united—to rise from the tomb of ignorance and realize in the ascension of the soul the resurrection of the Christ within. 737"},{"pageNumber":739,"pageContent":"ADDENDA • Inspirational Readings for the True Worship of Christ Part I, Christmas Part II, Easter • About the Author • Aims and Ideals of Self-Realization Fellowship • Self-Realization Fellowship Publications and Lessons • Glossary • M[ap of Palestine in New Testament Times • Index of Gospel Verses in Commentary • Index of Other Bible Verses Cited • Ind ex of Bhagavad Gita Verses Cited • General Index"},{"pageNumber":740,"pageContent":"Inspiraflonal Readings for tike True \"Worsliip of CWisf Selections from the talks, devotional meditation services, and writings of Parama- hansa Yogananda in commemoration of Christmas and Easter A number of other inspirations from these holy seasons are to be found in his multi-volume Collected Talks and Essays published by Self-Realization Fellowship.

A few think of the beauties of Christmas mu- sic and church services. Most celebrators revel in the festivity of the Christmas tree, with its glimmering electric \"stars\" and tinsel and the gaily wrapped gifts beneath its branches. It is good to celebrate the birth of Christ with songs, dinners, and the exchange of gifts; but if material festivity becomes the only purpose of all the Christmas cele- bration, it is a pity, and nothing of spiritual value is gained. Let us learn how to make our celebration of Christmas a real commemoration of the holy life of Christ, a truly spiritual and uplift- ing experience. Once I saw a shotgun adorning a Christmas tree, and I remarked to my hostess: \"Madam, that gift for your son is an insult to the Christ who preached 'Thou shalt not kill.' A gun means death, murder, revenge, brother fighting brother. For that reason it is out of place in the celebration of the birthday of the 'Prince of Peace.'\" The lady took the gun away, and placed there instead a beautiful edition of a children's Bible. On Christmas Day we should exchange not only useful gifts, but God-reminding gifts as well. The original meaning of religious symbols and holy days is often forgotten. Thus, most people think of Christmas as an ordinary holiday festivity and forget Christ, the master of ceremonies. When used only as an occasion for festivity, the great spiritual significance of Christmas is lost sight of. As in a motion-picture show, the principal attention of the audience is on the story and not on the music, so in Christmas enter- 1529"},{"pageNumber":742,"pageContent":"tainment, the principal attention is on the material celebration, and Christ, though a most necessary part, is pushed into the background. We should rejoice that such a holy being as Christ was given to serve as an ideal of perfection for deluded mankind to follow. Indif- ferent, unconscious honor shown to him will not do us any good. Christmas should be so observed that it may materially, mentally, and spiritually give us, at the least, a new impetus to start in the Christ- path of truth with the beginning of the new year. We did this last year [1931] at the Self-Realization Fellowship Mother Center. A short description of the way we observed Christmas will give some suggestions as to how spiritual people should celebrate the coming Christmas. To begin with, we did our Christmas shopping early. Every resi- dent, and all others invited to the Christmas festivity, received a gift. However small in monetary value, it was rich with our love. Everyone in our divine family is considered close to us because of a spiritual tie, which is even stronger than a material tie of compulsion. We are gath- ered together in the name of our One Father, and have recognized our- selves as His children made in His image. We knew that getting dinner for a hundred people, adorning the Christma s tree, and making all the arrangements, would take much time, and that in the din of activity Christ might slip away unnoticed from the altar of our attention. So the day before Christmas we fasted on fruits and suspended all cooking and other preparations for Christ- mas Day. We sat around the exquisitely decorated Christmas tree and alternately chanted and meditated deeply, from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. We ate a supper of fruit and meditated again until 11 p.m. As we retired, many guests, with tears in their eyes, said: \"We have felt Christ and God today. We never knew before what the deep diving into Cosmic Consciousness meant. Most of us swam on the surface of the sea of silence, but never dived to get the beautiful pearls of God-contact.\" Christmas morning we began with a meditation, and then the fi- nal preparations were completed and the long-looked-for dinner came. After that was the opening of the mystery packages, then a closing meditation and singing until late at night. So it was that our Christ- mas began in the consciousness of Christ and ended in his Expanded Consciousness. With the coming of Christmas, do not let your consciousness sink into the well of turkey dinners, exchange of gifts, dances, festivities, 1530"},{"pageNumber":743,"pageContent":"and cocktail parties. A well of material thoughts is not a fit place in which to celebrate Christ's birthday. Instead, take your consciousness from the confines of mere material festivities and with closed eyes en- ter the secret door of meditative silence to behold the vast altar of peace spread eternally above, beneath, to the left and to the right, in front and behind, within and without. If you go deeper, you will meet Christ coming to you in his flam- ing robes of bliss, like the rising aurora, and your joy will dance in every atom of space. Then open your eyes, behold your little body, and say: \"The Christ-Bliss is descending on the altar of my thought, feel- ing, and devotion.\" Meditate upon the affirmation: \"Christ-Peace is descending into every tissue and cell of my body as health.\" Place Christ on the altar of your business and possessions. Say: \"I possess these things in Christ.\" Then meditate on the affirmation: \"My Christ-Peace has descended upon every member of my family, upon my country, and upon my world.\" Behold Christ-Peace descending upon your body, your possessions, and extending to your neighbors, to all countries, and onto the united altar of all hearts and all crea- tures. Let Christ-Bliss extend from your body to all lands, to North America, South America, Asia, Europe, Australia, every continent and island; to the solar system, to the island universes, and to all beings. Meditate upon the following: \"My Christ-Peace is descending upon every living thing, upon every living star, upon every speck of matter and space.\" Celebrate Christmas upon the altar of the vast inner silence; in the sanctuary of every desire, every living thing in the world, in all the cos- mos, celebrate the birth of Christ. Then will you know Christ as the Divine King ruling in the heart of all finite creation. 1531"},{"pageNumber":744,"pageContent":"A Christmas Message AC radle for tike Gkrust of Everywliere D uring this coming Christmas season, open a new portal of sub- lime devotion so that the Christ Omnipresence will be able to come anew within your consciousness. Every day, every hour, every golden second, Christ has been knocking at your dark gates of igno- rance. Now, in this august sacred dawn, Christ is especially coming in answer to your inner call, to awaken his Christ Consciousness Om- nipresence within you. Weave a cradle of tender perceptions with the threads of your meditation and make it commodious enough to hold the baby Infin- ity within its welcoming vastness. Christ is born in the viridescent blades; His gentleness is cradled in all fragrances. The opalescent sea- decked globe, the star-spangled savanna of the blue, the crimsoned love of the self-sacrificing martyrs and saints, have vied with each other in offering a dwelling place for the all-pervading baby Christ. This Christ of Everywhere is sleeping in the breast of Eternity; He loves to take new birth at any time, anywhere, especially in the warmth of your true affection. Though the Infinite Christ is present in every speck of space as the splendor of ever new wisdom and creative expression, you can never see Him unless He chooses to be seen in the cradle of your unceasing devotion. The cozy crib of your heart has for a very long time been small, holding self-love alone; now you must make it enormous, so that so- cial, national, international, creatural, and Cosmic Christ-love may be born there and become One Love. Christmas should be celebrated not only by appropriate festivities and the exchange of material gifts, but also by deep, continuous med- itation, making your consciousness a cosmic cathedral for Christ. You should offer therein your most precious gifts of love, goodwill, and service to uplift your inimical brothers, as well as your friendly broth- ers—physically, mentally, and spiritually.

Behold in your love the birth of an intoxicating Christ-love for your parents, friends, rel- atives, neighbors, and all races. In the sanctuary of your soul, invite your restless thoughts to assemble and still themselves in a service of deepest united love for Christ. When the Christmas packages are placed around the family tree, make every thought an altar of Christ, and saturate the gifts with your goodwill. Worship Christ as born in all creation: in the star, in the leaf, in the blossom, in the nightingale, in the nosegay, and in your velvet devotion.

While he had a little-boy brain, behind it and manifesting through it was the almighty spirit of God. The universal spirit of Christ Consciousness was with him from the beginning. That is the real reason why we should celebrate his birthday—to remind ourselves of the divine qualities of Jesus, and to awaken our- selves to a realization of the enlightening, loving Christ Presence in our own consciousness. It is a pity that so many people forget entirely the real purpose of the Christmas celebration and lose themselves in the material side only of the joyous festivities. Christ has been unknown to you because you have kept the gates of your devotion closed. Take this Christmas celebration seriously and through deep and sustained meditation invite the Christ to manifest himself to you. His beloved disciple Saint John said: \"As many as re- ceived him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.\" Then why not make yourself ready to receive him now? It is easier at this season than at any other time, for a spirit of goodwill, love, and peace radiates throughout the world. The entire cosmos celebrates this sea- son of joy for the Light that permeates all space. Remember what Jesus was in reality. But he came on earth as a human being and went through all the struggles and suffering of a hu- man being and came through victoriously. That is why he can be an example for us, an ideal toward which we may strive. If he could suc- ceed, we may also. We must live life unselfishly as he lived it and must faithfully prac- tice the method of interiorization for realizing the presence of that Almighty Grace within—the method of persistent meditation.

Give extra time to meditation for at least the week preceding Christ- mas, devoting several hours to divine communion on one of those days; and be sure to meditate on Christmas morning. Accept this great gift of the life of Jesus, which the Father meant for you. Do not let Jesus' living and his suffering be in vain. He came to bring you joy, and glory, and peace, and light.

Wliere Clirist Reigns [An inspirational talk given during one of the all-day Christmas meditations conducted by Paramahansaji at Self-Realization Fel- lowship International Headquarters — one day prior to the fes- tive social celebrations on Christmas Day.] '^jP'oday we celebrate Christ in Spirit; tomorrow we celebrate the JL coming of Christ in the body of Jesus. We shall prepare our minds and consciousness that in true understanding we may observe Christmas as the birth of Christ in the cradle of our souls and in all mental and physical expressions of our lives. Thousands around the world are celebrating Christmas; for most it is primarily a time for festivities and the exchange of presents. But Christmas is far more than a holiday celebration for the masses. For me, Christmas has a greater meaning: the consciousness of the signif- icance of Christ — an individualistic consciousness wherein I find Christ as the Universal Spirit manifesting in my own consciousness. That is what is most important—to bring the actual realization of Chris t into our observance of Christmas. When a great personality has come on earth, it is customary for a special day to be set aside to honor that figure, often in a social or material way. If this is the only manner in which one observes the birth of Christ, I think it is an insult to him, and is not a proper celebration. I have often said that Christ was crucified at the hands of ignorant people not only once, but that he is being crucified all the time by those who do not know the true meaning of the life and teachings of Christ. Ignorant people desecrate their souls by nonunderstanding and their own misguided actions. Of course, homage paid to Christ in whatever manner always does some good. Christmas festivity evokes the sentiment of the peace of this divine soul who came into the world to serve as a beacon of light to guide stray hearts. There is also the spirit of joy that abounds in tradi- tional Christmas observances. Perfect joy, joy that is connected with purity, is the joy of God. Those who celebrate even from the material standpoint will experience something of this joy. They will find, at least 1537"},{"pageNumber":752,"pageContent":"for a time, a certain sense of freedom from their cares and sorrows, and from some of the inimical and evil thoughts that have tainted the feel- ing in their hearts. And there is an essence of love in the elements of sacrifice and friendship experienced in the giving of gifts. Love, the di- vine love of God, is the most inspiring truth that Jesus demonstrated; it was the power by which he could return love and forgiveness for the hatred he received. To express hate for hate is easy and basely human, but to love in the face of enmity and unkindness is greatness. Love is the stronger weapon; it can destroy hatred. The remembrance of the exemplary divine goodness of Jesus that was manifested in all he did, the thought of the Divine Love he gave, and that in that Love he lived and died to uplift the ^orld—that is the spirit predominant at Christ- mastime. All this is what Christmas stands for. I give you this talk that you may know the purpose of this our Christmas meditation day. It is the preparation to receive the Baby Christ on the altar of our awakened spiritual consciousness. But the - Baby needs a cradle. His presence is spread over all Prepare for Christ the the stars and universes — omnipresent, in every- cradle of your thing. But he loves the cradle of hearts, the cradle consciousness of our own divine consciousness. And so, we pre- pare that cradle for him today. The divine way Christ in the form of Jesus came on earth, the way he was tested to bring mankind a new Light, a new Glory—showing that by attunement with the Invisible Light that leads to God the hu- man heart may be freed of all despair and mortal darkness—that is what we should remember today as we make ready the inner cradle of consciousness to receive and hold him. You must plunge deeper and deeper into the spirit of meditation, to where the mind crosses the entrenchments of bad habits of physi- cal and mental restlessness and arrives at the sanctuary of peace and bliss . The deeper the meditation, the easier it becomes to perceive Christ. Those who are intimidated by the effort required, and hence give up, never get beyond the obstacles of the body and mind. The greates t victory to be achieved is over our own selves; it lies in the con- quering of our mental deficiencies and wrong habits. I want you to go with me to the land beyond, where Christ reigns. It is very easy for me. Every day is a Christmas, for I revel in the glory of the Lord, and I find that the Baby Christ as Christ Consciousness is cradled always in my own consciousness. I want you to have that realization. 1538"},{"pageNumber":753,"pageContent":"What is Christ Consciousness? Christ is God's Infinite Intelligence that is present in all creation. The Infinite Christ is the \"only begotten son\" of God the Father, the only pure Reflection of Spirit in the cre- ated realm. That Universal Intelligence, the Kutastha Chaitanya or Krishna Consciousness of the Hindu scriptures, was fully manifested in the incarnation of Jesus, Krishna, and other divine ones; and it can be manifested also in your consciousness. You, too, are a child of God. That same consciousness can be yours. That is what you must always remember. I give you the testimony of Saint John, who spoke of re- ceiving that divine consciousness which was in Jesus: \"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.\" So it is true that Christ is the only begotten son of God—not the body, but the Christ Consciousness that was in Jesus. I have seen Christ Jesus as he lived on earth. But greater than the body is the consciousness of Christ, which is one with God or Cosmic Consciousness. Christ remains unknown to those who know him solely as a body. He is known truly only to those who perceive him as Spirit . The divine power of Christ realization is an internal experience; it may be received through unalloyed devotion for God and for His pure reflection as Christ. The power of church and temple will vanish. Real spirituality shall come from the temples of great souls who are day and night in the ecstasy of God. Such souls as I have seen in In- dia surpass the glory of all the temples. Remember, Christ seeks the temples of true souls. He loves the quiet shrine of devotion in your heart where you abide with him, there in the sanctuary aglow with the vigil light of your love. Those who meditate devoutly will receive Christ on the altar of calmness in their own consciousness. The star of the East that led the Three Wise Men to Christ was no physical star, but rather a spiritual star. It would be impossible for such a planetary body to suddenly appear and re- main so close to the earth without a collision. The star of the East Absence of the visible material light is dark- that leads to Christ ness. But behind material darkness is the spiritual light, which is everywhere. When you pierce the darkness of closed physical eyes, you behold the light of the spiritual eye—the intuitive, all-seeing eye of the soul. Through that spiritual eye you can enter the sphere of awakened silence. It is there, behind the clouds of darkness, that you perceive Christ.

Just imagine! If you were living in this one room all of your life, having no contact with or knowledge of what is beyond these walls, you would say that this is the whole of your world. But if someone were to take you into the world outside, you would realize how in- finitesimal your \"world\" was. So it is with the perception of Christ Consciousness. The scope of mortal consciousness by comparison is like observing only the area of a tiny mustard seed to the exclusion of the rest of the cosmos.^ Christ Consciousness is Omnipresence, the Lord spread over every pore of infinite space and permeating every atom. When in deep meditation we peer through the spiritual eye, we behold God's creation-evolving spiritual light afloat in the vast sphere of our awakening in Christ. Let us today prepare our consciousness to celebrate spiritually the birth of Christ. Let Christ, who is the only pure reflection in creation of the Consciousness of God the Father, enter into our consciousness. All those who have attained Christhood can retain the physical likenesses of their incarnations on earth, and they can manifest those —— forms to their true devotees.

As God is true, your prayer will be answered if you make the right effort. Many times I have seen Christ manifested in form. Once in Boston, during a very busy period, I suddenly felt that for three days I had forgotten God. I was wholly engaged in His work, forgoing sleep and everything. So it seemed that by lack of meditation I had left God out. This thought was so painful to me that I packed up my belong- ings and said to Him: \"I am going to walk out of all this activity. It is for You that I am doing all this; yet because of it, I have forgotten You!\" What is the use of having a spiritual organization if God is not there? It is just like preparing a banquet for an honored guest and hav- ing that person absent from the table. I sat to meditate, and prayed to God: \"I am going now!\" His voice replied: \"No.\" 1540"},{"pageNumber":755,"pageContent":"I argued: \"But what is the use of all this if it causes me to forget You?\" The voice of God answered: \"I am with you always.\" I wanted from God some demonstration of that assurance: \"All right, if You are with me always, I would like to see You as Krishna and Christ and all their disciples walking on a sea of gold.\" As I said this, that very vision unfolded before me—Krishna and Christ and thei r disciples walking toward me on a shimmering golden sea. My mind said: \"Maybe this is a hallucination. If the person who is medi- tating here with me sees the vision also, then I will believe.\" At that moment, this person saw the same manifestation that I was perceiv- ing. The room became filled with a wonderful fragrance that remained all day long and was perceptible to everyone who entered the room. Such experiences are not imagination. As you progress on this path you shall see the wonders of God. Sometime during January I shall give a demonstration of the power of mind over the body. Even as a child, I used to show that power; but I gave it up because my desire was for God's love and not His miracles. I show His power only when He has given me permission to do so. My interest is in spiritual healing, more than in any other kind of healing or phenomenal demonstration. My wish is to draw those who love God. I prefer a soul to a crowd, and I love crowds of souls. Many times it seemed that my love's labor was lost, but then I would be amazed to see the development of some sincere stu- dents. This I can say: No one who comes to me with an open mind and spiritual recipiency shall go away without some perception of God. Many lack faith in God unless they receive evidence of His pow- ers. Faith is very important, because receptivity to divine power is shut off by negative thoughts and doubts. Faith grows as — you exercise it; and when you have faith, you can Know that God is your do everything. If you can hold on to an idea long own enough, and do not give up when opposed by con- trary evidence, even if the whole world says it is impossible; if you can fight the negative thoughts of people and keep your own thoughts strong while working toward your goal, it will manifest. When we wish for God, there is nothing we have to create or ac- quire . We have Him already. He is with us, buried beneath the debris of doubts and unbelief. All you have to do is know that God is your own. With material things, you do not own anything; you have to beg for everything you get. Why degrade yourself to the status of a beggar 1541"},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"ADDENDA when you are a child of God? Do not go on desiring too many things. Just say to the Lord: \"I am having a good time participating in Your cosmic drama, and I am happy with whatever You send to me.\" That is living in the real spirit of Christ. Anything you enjoy apart from God is potentially destructive to your true happiness. If the senses are connected with God they will serve you; but if they are not settled in God, they will destroy you. To remain drunk with materiality is to be tossed about like waves in a storm; but when you are safe on the Divine Shore, then you will see all waves of life as a part of the Ocean of God—the Sea of Christ Con- sciousness. Ordinary people are buffeted about by the winds of emo- tions and desires, unable to see the Infinite Ocean as the essence of their life and being. Meditation gives you a chance to realize that we are all waves of life dancing on the Sea of Christ Consciousness in God. Do not live in ignorance; do not die in delusion. I used to pray urgently to God: \"Hours are passing, days and years will go by, but I will not give up until You come to me; I want You, my Beloved, only You.\" He came at last, and is always with me now. Noth- ing can take Him away. It does not matter to me whether the world ac- cepts or forsakes me, or whether friends support or leave me. I have God. When He is with you, He makes you fearless, secure in His love. The best time to make love to God is at night when you are free and the world is asleep. Take your heart away from everything and give it only to God in deep meditation. I practiced that. Now, no mat- ter what I am doing, working or meditating, my mind is on God. So it must be with you. When you become drunk with God you don't lose your balance even in the midst of troubles and activities. Never go to bed until you have made real contact with God. Then in the daytime you will be able to conquer all the temptations and de- structive forces that confront you. Nobody can take your peace away from you. Nothing can take away that divine love between you and God. Be determined! The Lord is waiting to see if perchance we use our God-given free- dom to seek Him, our own Beloved. When we do, that pleases Him more than anything else. If instead we use our freedom to cast Him away, then He is filled with sorrow. When freely we give our love to Him—not because He is great and all-powerful, but because He is our own, and because we are His children, expressions of His One Con- sciousness—that is what He loves. 1542"},{"pageNumber":757,"pageContent":"INSPIRAl IONAL READINGS FOR THE TRUE WORSHIP OF CHRIST If you want to see God, who is formless, He will come as Christ Consciousness in form—as was manifested in the body of Jesus, in the body of Mahavatar Babaji, or other of the great ones. — I remember one evening in my boyhood years in \"My first love — India, a friend and I sat for meditation, and I vowed: for Krishna — was re- \"We will see Krishna tonight!\" My desire to see him sponded to!\" was adamant. I made up my mind that my prayer to know Krishna would be answered. Unless you have that kind of devo- tion and determination, what is the use of praying? Your mind will re- main busy with restless thoughts. As the night wore on, my friend be- came restless because he didn't cross over the trenches that lie in the path of meditation. Finally he said, \"Let us go to bed now.\" But I was in joy of expectation of the coming of Krishna. I wasn't seeing anything; yet I felt I was on the right track. Six o'clock in the morning came, and my friend again urged, \"Come on, let's go to bed!\" But I returned, \"I shall never give up!\" Just as I said that, fulfillment came. With open eyes I saw Lord Krishna! My friend couldn't see him but he felt the divine presence. When I reached out and touched my companion, he also saw what I saw. My first love—for Krishna—was responded to! If you want to see any particular saint or avatar, you must cultivate the divine consciousness to receive that manifestation. Right here in this chapel while I was giving a sermon, Saint Francis of Assisi once came to me; and from that experience I wrote the poem, \"God! God! God!\"* And so I tell you, it is wonderful to live in that all-encompassing Christ Consciousness. You must realize Christ in Spirit first, and then you can see Him in form. Self-Realization Fellowship is awakening that divine conscious- ness in true souls. Those who will meditate and receive Christ in their consciousness, they will be the real saints. And so on this Christmas meditation day, with adamantine heart prepare your mind. In divine perception, everything will melt into the sea of Christ Consciousness. To me, everything is One—aflame with the same one consciousness of God. Today meditate so deeply and so fervently that you feel Christ, that you know he is real, and not just a scriptural idea spread by the intellectual exultation of others.

Many count the coming of Christmas as an oc- casion for family gatherings and the exchange of colorfully wrapped gifts. Young children look upon Christmas as the time when Santa Claus will give them new toys and other things they are wishing for. They hang their stockings by the fireplace, and Santa is said to slip down the sooty opening of the chimney to fill them with the longed- for articles. With what anticipation the little ones lie awake the night before, waiting for Christmas morn, till they drift off into happy dreams! The mothers and fathers delight in decorating the family Christmas tree and loading it with gaily wrapped presents. Many who have no home and family look forward to Christmas as perhaps one time in the year when they will be invited to a special home-cooked hot dinner. The worldly minded enjoy their social rounds, and drink themselves into oblivion as their way of celebrating the birth of Christ. To the practical-minded, Christmas has also a mercenary side. Churches count on the spirit of the season to bring bigger collections to support their work; and on the same basis merchants encourage spending in anticipation of higher profits. There is nothing wrong in using business methods to advance the spiritual work of Christ to es- tablish his ideals in receptive souls; but it is blasphemous to use Christ and his ideals merely as a means for increasing business. Christmas in many churches means great festivity, and is observed with music, plays, ceremonies, socials, and often extra charitable works. In special religious services the congregations fervently thank God for sending His beloved son \"to redeem the sin-laden world.\" Those who are deeply spiritual, such as the sincere monks and nuns sequestered in their monasteries and convents, celebrate Christmas even more seriously and fervently, by meditating on Christ. Superficial celebrators turn his hallowed day into little more than an expensive social occasion. They at least get out of Christmas a few gifts, the kindness and love behind those gifts, and some passing mo- ments of joy.

Most people do not know how to celebrate the coming of Christ on earth: by beholding the di- vine Christ Consciousness, which was manifest in Jesus, born anew in the cradle of their own spiritual awakening in deep meditation. The question is, which is right? to observe the birth of the Christ Jesus with worldly rejoicings expressed in bright decorations, festive dinners, and the exchange of gifts; or to worship him in spirit only? Birthday celebrations are meant to make the one who is being honored feel that his life is of value to those observing his birth an- niversary. Such observances also serve to focus the attention of oth- ers on qualified souls wl^ose lives are worthy of appreciation and em- ulation. Jesus does not need our celebrations to gratify and uplift him. But it is right and appropriate that we celebrate his birthday every Christmas, because his life is permanently useful and inspiring to all humanity in all ages. We certainly need to celebrate his coming in or- der to remind ourselves of his exemplary, abiding, uplifting life, so that perchance our deeper thought of him may encourage us to re- mold our lives, and to pattern them through all futurity after his di- vine life. Millions are planning to celebrate this coming Christmas in their usual way, as a purely social event. Who is looking forward to using this special time for spiritually remembering Christ and for exchang- ing gifts of soul and heart qualities? Will Christmas be for you just a romanticism of religious and so- cial festivity, or will you observe the real meaning of Christmas? I urge you to celebrate truly the birth of Jesus: by realizing within yourself his universal love, forgiveness, character, renunciation, and devotion, and by feeling Christ-love for all brother races and all living creatures. Unless you make the effort this coming Christmas to get truly ac- quainted with the ever-living Christ—born within you as new wis- dom, new happiness—I am afraid you will let yet another precious in- structive season pass without heed. I am not asking you to omit the social observances of Christmas. What I want to see is that you do not, like the millions who forget God, omit in your celebration the paramount spiritual factor. Add to your social festivities the bringing of Christ a second time—in your meditative consciousness.

Fill your heart with compassionate understand- ing for those who crucify you with unkind actions, words, or ingrati- tude in exchange for the good you give them. Let your prayer be: \"Father, teach me to love my error-stricken brethren, who know not what they do. Let me not by unkindness drive them deeper into evil, but rather let my love persuade them to better ways of living.\" Govern all the actions of your life with the honesty and fearless- ness of Jesus Christ. Overcome sorrow-producing temptations by self-control, even as Jesus overcame the temptations of Satan. Develop a preference for all things good. Forego the temporary pleasures that derive from misuse of the senses, and pursue the lasting, true happiness of the soul. Give to others good for evil, understanding for misunderstanding, kindness for unkindness. Within yourself, substitute peace for disqui- etude, calmness for restlessness, and lasting bliss for material pleasure. Give the spiritual gifts of your outstanding good qualities to those who need them, and receive ennobling soul qualities from the great ones, who love you for your own good.

Some make Christmas a Do not take lightly merely social affair: they engage in the festivities the celebration of with glassy smiles, and then Christmas is over and Christmas  they are glad of it. The material celebration of Christmas has some good points and some bad. To a certain extent Christ comes into your consciousness when you are happy and loving and giviijg. But the purely material way of honor- ing Christ's birth by gifts and social events defeats its purpose if Christ is absent. Do not take lightly the celebration of the birth of Jesus. These holy days should remind you of that great Christ—the divine life man- ifested by Jesus. That is the spiritual side of this holiday. In most all spiritual celebrations, including those in the Orient, there is some material rejoicing, such as in the enjoyment of a special repast with loved ones; but that should not be the foremost thing. In the exchange of gifts also, there is a sharing of love and a feeling of expansion . What you give with the sincerity of your heart Christ him- self accepts. But if you give grudgingly or with pride, Christ goes away. And do not give anything that is associated with wrongdoing. I always prepare my mind for Christmas—everything that I do is with great happiness—and Christ has come with an even greater force in my consciousness. If Christ comes, if He honors you with His pres- ence, if He accepts your hospitality, you shall never say, \"I am tired of Him\"—as you inevitably say of material pleasures.

What was Christ, then? Aeons ago in the land of Eternity, when God was alone as the ever-existing, ever-new Joy, He mused: \"I am alone, with nobody to enjoy Me.\" He breathed a wish, and the Holy Ghost (symbolized in the Virgin Mary) was born. The Holy Ghost or Mary carries within its womb the Christ Consciousness (symbolized in the Son)—the re- flection of the Cosmic Consciousness (God the Father) in and beyond all creation. Thus Christ Consciousness has actually come a second time al- ready, in the body of Jesus. It has also come in the bodies of Maha- vatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswar, and all the great ones; and that same Christ must be born again in your consciousness. That is the meaning of the \"Second Coming\" of Christ. Jesus was a model of the omnipresent Christ Consciousness. His life shows that he had broken all limitations and had found his oneness with God in everything. In his omnipresent con- —— sciousness, he knew about the death of Lazarus and Break the walls of all could say, \"Lazarus sleepeth,\" and bring him forth limitations alive from the tomb. Those who look upon life ex- ternally take it at face value. But when it is seen internally, behind its gross manifestation, then we behold the one Eternal Life everywhere. Break the walls of limitations that shut the Christ Consciousness away from you—greed, selfishness, caste, race. God wants to be the only love in all creeds and nationalities, no matter the mode of wor- ship or the color of the skin. Christ wants to come in all human hearts, but He cannot penetrate through the barriers of selfishness and prej- udice. Yes, the Infinite Christ Consciousness is present everywhere in- visibly, but if you want to experience the manifestation of God visibly, you must break these walls of ignorance. God has given you the free- dom to shut Him out or let Him in. The barrier is not in your vision, but in your consciousness. Christ is already with you; He has already come, but prejudicial limitations obscure that divine presence. If you want Christ to come in a perceptible way in your consciousness, you must break down all obstructions. They are the walls of Satan.

Though omnipotent Christ Consciousness was fully manifest in the body of Jesus, he let himself be crucified; but with that great power he had in the consciousness of Christ, by forgiveness he has held the hearts of people these many centuries. He had the power to destroy his enemies, and yet fie said, \"Father, forgive them; they know not what they do.\" That is a gift of the Christ Consciousness—love that can never be killed by any anger or hatred. Those who do wrong to you, give them that Christ-love silently; and once their hearts feel that love, the devil of hate shall pass out from them, and they will be healed. Satan has his influence everywhere. But if you can destroy evil from your heart and can make it an altar of forgiveness and divine love, then Christ shall come and reign there. Nobility of heart and a spirit of service—to be big enough to be- hav e nobly in every situation, and to serve all—these also come as gifts of Christ Consciousness. To serve all means to be conscious that you are in everybody, not just in the one little body you call your own —for we are all made of the one same omnipresent consciousness of God. Selfishness is the root cause of war and of all forms of divisive- ness; it is also the death of spirituality. When you limit your con- sciousnes s to your own body, and regard everything in terms of your- self, you shut out Christ Consciousness. You must begin to look upon others as an extension of yourself. \"It is myself that is suffering in that body; it is myself that is filled with happiness in that body.\" Service is one of the best investments for expansion of consciousness. When you do for others just as you are doing for yourself, then that is one way, the social way, to cultivate Christ Consciousness. Real Christ-love comes to open those Christmas packages that are expressions of an awakening spiritualized consciousness.

May Christ come, bringing to you infinite bliss, infinite wisdom, infi- nite joy, as He is born in the cradle of your heart.

Flowers fade never to return; but Jesus only slept to obey the sweet command of Nature, and woke again to declare his mastery over her.

From his earliest years, it was clear that his life was marked for a divine destiny. According to those closest to him, even as a child the depth of his spiritual awareness and experience was far beyond the ordinary. In his youth he sought out many of India's sages and saints, hoping to find an illumined teacher to guide him in his spiritual quest. It was in 1910, at the age of seventeen, that he met and became a disciple of the revered Swami Sri Yukteswar. In the hermitage of this great master, he spent the Better part of the next ten years, receiving Sri Yukteswar's strict but loving spiritual discipline. After he gradu- ated from Calcutta University in 1915, his Guru bestowed on him the formal vows of a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order, at which time he received the name Yogananda (signifying bliss, ananda, through divine union, yoga). In 1917, Sri Yogananda began his life's work with the founding of a \"how-to-live\" school for boys, where modern educational meth- ods were combined with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. Three years later he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals convening in Boston. His address to the Congress, on \"The Science of Religion,\" was en- thusiastically received. For the next several years, he lectured and taught on the East Coast and in 192.4 embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. To the tens of thousands of Westerners who attended his lectures during the decade that followed, his discourses on the unity of \"the original teachings of Jesus Christ and the original Yoga taught by Bhagavan Krishna\" were a revelation. The Los Angeles Times reported on Jan- uary 28, 1925: \"The Philharmonic Auditorium presents the extraor- dinary spectacle of thousands...being turned away an hour before the advertised opening of a lecture with the 3,000-seat hall filled to its ut- most capacity. Swami Yogananda is the attraction. A Hindu invading the United States to bring God in the midst of a Christian community, preaching the essence of Christian doctrine.\" Late r that year, he established in Los Angeles the international head- quarters of Self-Realization Fellowship, the society he had founded in 192 0 to disseminate his teachings and perpetuate the work he had begun. 1566"},{"pageNumber":781,"pageContent":"\"Paramahansa Yogananda brought to the West not only India's perennial promise of God-realization, but also a practical method by which spiritual aspirants from all walks of life may progress rapidly toward that goal,\" wrote Quincy Howe, Jr., Ph.D., Professor of Clas- sics at Scripps College. \"Originally appreciated in the West only on the most lofty and abstract level, the spiritual legacy of India is now ac- cessible as practice and experience to all who aspire to know God, not in the beyond, but in the here and now....Yogananda has placed within the reach of all the most exalted methods of contemplation.\" The Cincinnati Enquirer reported on December i, 1926: \"Yester- day in the Hotel Sinton, Swami Yogananda was greeted by over a thou- sand men and women, hundreds being turned away. In this enthusiastic throng, there were litterateurs, medical men, leaders of fashion, clergy- men, and indeed followers drawn from many walks of life. The Swami was continually interrupted with responsive applause, his words being listened to with profound attention.\" And according to the Washington Post, January 25, 1927: \"Approximately 5,000 persons crowded the au- ditorium to hear his initial lecture...at the Washington Auditorium, where the Swami has broken all records for sustained interest.\" After fifteen years of teaching in the West, Sri Yogananda returned to India in 1935. There he had a long-awaited reunion with his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar, who honored him with India's highest religious title, Paramahansa, bestowed on those deemed to have achieved irrev- ocable union with God. While in his native land, he traveled and lec- tured and met with many spiritual luminaries, including Mahatma Gandhi, who requested initiation in Kriya Yoga from him. Returning to America at the end of 1936, Paramahansaji began to withdraw somewhat from his nationwide public lecturing to devote himself to building an enduring foundation for his worldwide work and to the writings that would carry his message to future generations. His life story, Autobiography of a Yogi, was published in 1946 and substantially expanded by him in 1951. Recognized from the begin- ning as a landmark work, the book has been in print continuously through Self-Realization Fellowship since its publication fifty years ago, inspiring new readers decade after decade. On March 7, 1952, Paramahansa Yogananda entered mahasa- madhi, a God-illumined master's conscious exit from the body at the time of physical death.

The former religion editor of the Los Angeles Times, Dan Thrapp, stated in 1992: \"All through history you can find people who come along—Jesus, Buddha, and other people—who are in- spired, and who have a way of expressing it and have charisma with other people, so that their influence spreads. I think Yogananda was one of those people....He was inspired...one of the greats. He showed the way for people into a purer, unadulterated type of faith, a universal faith.\" The Government of India issued a commemorative stamp in honor of the renowned guru in 1977, which was accompanied by these words: \"The ideal of love for God and service to humanity found full expres- sion in the life of Paramahansa Yogananda....Though the major part of his life was spent outside India,'still he takes his place among our great saints. His work continues to grow and shine ever more brightly, draw- ing people everywhere on the path of the pilgrimage of the Spirit.\" Scholars and journalists have echoed this appraisal of Sri Yoga- nanda's continuing influence. \"Few books have had a greater impact on popular theology than Paramahansa Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi,\" notes Phyllis Tickle, former religion editor of Publishers Weekly. His teachings \"made an indelible mark on the course of American spiri- tuality,\" wrote Dr. Robert S. Ellwood, former chairman of the University of Southern California's School of Religion. \"Yogananda has become an image—a remarkable, deep, sweet, poetic, ecstatic man enraptured of cosmic life—who has changed the map of American religious life.\" Today the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Parama- hansa Yogananda is being carried on under the direction of Sri Daya Mata, one of his earliest and closest disciples and his successor as pres- ident of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India since 1955.* In addition to publishing Paramahansa Yogananda's books and his other writings, lectures, and informal talks—including his Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons, a comprehensive series for home study; and a quarterly magazine, Self-Realization —the society guides members in their practice of Sri Yogananda's teachings; over- sees temples, retreats, and meditation centers around the world, as well as the monastic communities of Self-Realization Fellowship monks and nuns; and coordinates the Worldwide Prayer Circle, which serves as an instrument to help bring healing to those in physical, men- tal, or spiritual need and greater harmony among the nations. *In India, Paramahansa Yogananda's work is known as Yogoda Satsanga Society. 1568"},{"pageNumber":783,"pageContent":"PARAMAHANSA YOGANANDA: A YOGI IN LIFE AND DEATH Paramahansa Yogananda entered mahasamadhi (a yogi's final conscious exit from the body) in Los Angeles, California, on March 7, 1952., after concluding his speech at a banquet held in honor of H.E. Binay R. Sen, Ambassador of India. The great world teacher demonstrated the value of yoga (scientific techniques for God-realization) not only in life but in death. Weeks after his departure his unchanged face shone with the divine luster of incorruptibility. Mr. Harry T.

That ancient science is embodied in the specific principles and medita- tion techniques of Kriya Yoga, often referred to in the pages of The Sec- ond Coming of Christ. In his commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, Para- mahansa Yogananda wrote: In a book available to the general public I cannot give the techniques themselves; for they are sacred, and certain ancient spiritual injunctions must first be followed to insure that they are received with reverence and confidentiality, and thereafter practiced correctly. Lost to humanity for centuries during the dark ages, Kriya Yoga was revived in modern times by a line of enlightened masters—Maha- vatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Swami Sri Yukteswar, and Parama- hansa Yogananda. To disseminate the liberating spiritual science worldwide through Self-Realization Fellowship was the mission en- trusted to Paramahansa Yogananda by his guru and paramgurus. As Paramahansa Yogananda wrote in his Introduction to The Second Coming of Christ: For uncounted millenniums, India has been the spiritual light- land of the earth. It is in India that the divine soul-science of yoga — union with God through direct personal communion with Him — has been preserved. That is why Jesus went to In- dia as a youth, and why he returned to India and conferred with Babaji for the spiritual evolution of the world. Time will testify to this truth, that they have given to the world through the Kriya Yoga teachings of Self-Realization Fellowship (Yo- goda Satsanga Society of India) the techniques of meditation by which each soul can reunite with God through inner real- ization of the universal Christ-Krishna Consciousness. During his lifetime Paramahansa Yogananda traveled extensively, giving lectures and classes throughout the United States as well as in Europe and India. Yet he knew that many more than he could teach in person would be drawn to the yoga philosophy and practices. Thus he conceived \"a series of weekly studies for the yoga seekers all over 1575"},{"pageNumber":790,"pageContent":"FLUUZNUFT the world\"—to perpetuate his teachings in their original purity, and in written form, including the Kriya Yoga science handed down to him by his lineage of gurus. The Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons present the methods of concentration, energization, and meditation taught by Paramahansa Yogananda that are an integral part of the Kriya Yoga science—in- cluding the technique of communion with Aum, the Holy Ghost. As he wrote: The promise of Jesus to send the Holy Ghost after he was gone few in the Christian world have understood. Holy Ghost is the sacred, invisible vibratory power of God that actively sustains the universe: the Word, or Aum, Cosmic Vibration, the Great Comforter, the Savior from all sorrows. Within the Holy Ghost Cosmic Vibration is the all-pervading Christ, the Son or Consciousness of God immanent in creation. The method of contacting this Cosmic Vibration, the Holy Ghost, is for the first time being spread worldwide by means of defi- nite meditation techniques of the Kriya Yoga science....Those who have spiritual ears to hear, let them hear that the prom- ise of Jesus Christ to send the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, is being fulfilled....The adept in the practice of the science of Kriya Yoga who consciously experiences the presence of the Holy Ghost Comforter and merges in the Son, or immanent Christ Consciousness, attains thereby realization of God the Father and entry into the infinite kingdom of God. This comprehensive home-study series makes available the whole range of subjects covered by Paramahansa Yogananda during the thirty years that he lived and taught in the West—offering his inspir- ing and practical guidance for attaining balanced physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. After a preliminary period of study and practice, students of the Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons may request initi- ation in the advanced Kriya Yoga meditation technique cited in this book.

The exalted disciple to whom Bhagavan Krishna imparted the im- mortal message of the Bhagavad Gita (q.v. ); one of the five Pandava princes in the great Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, in which he is a key figure. ashram. A spiritual hermitage; often a monastery. astral body. Man's subtle body of light, prana or lifetrons; the second of three sheaths that successively encase the soul: the causal body (q.v.), the astral body, and the physical body. The powers of the astral body enliven the physical body, much as electricity illumines a bulb. The astral body has nineteen elements: intelligence, ego, feeling, mind (sense consciousness); five instruments of knowledge (the sensory powers within the physical or- gans of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch); five instruments of action (the executive powers in the physical instruments of procreation, excretion, speech, locomotion, and the exercise of manual skill); and five instruments of life force that perform the functions of circulation, metabolization, as- similation, crystallization, and elimination. astral light. The subtle light emanating from lifetrons (see prana); the struc- tural essence of the astral world. Through the all-inclusive intuitive per- ception of the soul, devotees in concentrated states of meditation may per- ceiv e the astral light, particularly as the spiritual eye (q.v.). astral world. The subtle sphere of the Lord's creation, a universe of light and color composed of finer-than-atomic forces, i.e., vibrations of life energy or lifetrons (see prana). Every being, every object, every vibration on the material plane has an astral counterpart, for in the astral universe (heaven) is the blueprint of our material universe. At physical death, the soul of man, clothed in an astral body of light, ascends to one of the higher or lowe r astral planes, according to merit, to continue his spiritual evolution in the greater freedom of that subtle realm. There he remains for a karmi- cally predetermined time until physical rebirth. Aum (Om). The Sanskrit root word or seed-sound symbolizing that aspect of Godhead which creates and sustains all things; Cosmic Vibration. Aum of the Vedas became the sacred word Hum of the Tibetans; Atnin of the Moslems; and Amen of the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Jews, and Chris- 1577"},{"pageNumber":792,"pageContent":"tians. The world's great religions state that all created things originate in the cosmic vibratory energy of Aum or Amen, the Word or Holy Ghost. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....All things were made by him [the Word or Aum]; and without him was not any thing made that was made\" (John 1:1, 3). Amen in Hebrew means sure, faithful. \"These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God\" (Rev- elation 3:14). Even as sound is produced by the vibration of a running mo- tor, so the omnipresent sound of Aum faithfully testifies to the running of the \"Cosmic Motor,\" which upholds all life and every particle of creation through vibratory energy. In the Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons (q.v.), Paramahansa Yogananda teaches techniques of meditation whose practice brings direct experience of God as Aum or Holy Ghost. That blissful com- munion with the invisible divine Power (\"the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost\"—John 14:26) is the truly scientific basis of prayer, avatar. From the Sanskrit avatara, with roots ava, \"down,\" and tri, \"to pass.\" Souls who attain union with Spirit and then return to earth to help mankind are called avatars, divine incarnations, avidya. Literally, \"non-knowledge,\" ignorance; the manifestation in man of maya, the cosmic delusion (q.v.). Essentially, avidya is man's ignorance of his divine nature and of the sole reality: Spirit. Babaji. See Mahavatar Babaji. Bhagavad Gita. \"Song of the Lord.\" An ancient Indian scripture consisting of eighteen chapters from the sixth book (Bhishma Parva) of the Maha- bharata epic. Presented in the form of a dialogue between the avatar (q.v.) Lor d Krishna and his disciple Arjuna on the eve of the historic battle of Kurukshetra, the Gita is a profound treatise on the science of yoga (union with God) and a timeless prescription for happiness and success in every- day living. The Gita is allegory as well as history, a spiritual dissertation on the inner battle between man's good and bad tendencies. Depending on the context, Krishna symbolizes the guru, the soul, or God; Arjuna repre- sents the aspiring devotee. Of this universal scripture Mahatma Gandhi wrote: \"Those who will meditate on the Gita will derive fresh joy and new meanings from it every day. There is not a single spiritual tangle which the Gita cannot unravel.\" The quotations from the Bhagavad Gita in these Second Coming vol- umes are from Paramahansa Yogananda's own translation, God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita — Royal Science of God-Realization (published by Self-Realization Fellowship). Bhagavan Krishna. An avatar who lived as a king in India ages before the Chris- tia n era.

The spiritual approach to God that stresses all-surrendering love as the principal means for communion and union with God. See Yoga. Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva. Three aspects of God's immanence in creation. They rep- resent that triune function of the Christ Intelligence (Tat) that guides Cosmic Nature's activities of creation, preservation, and dissolution. See Trinity. Brahman (Brahma). Absolute Spirit. Brahman is sometimes rendered in San- skrit as Brahma (with a short a at the end); but the meaning is the same as Brahman: Spirit, or God the Father, not the circumscribed concept of the personal \"Brahma-the-Creator\" of the Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva triad (which is rendered with a long a at the end, Brahma).

To es- cape from the sorrows of transitoriness and to enter the blissful realm of Reality, the yogi learns to quiet the breath by scientific meditation.\" caste. Caste in its original conception was not a hereditary status, but a clas- sification based on man's natural capacities. In his evolution, man passes through four distinct grades, designated by ancient Hindu sages as Sudra, Vaisya, Kshatriya, and Brahmin. The Sudra is interested primarily in satis- fying his bodily needs and desires; the work that best suits his state of de- velopment is bodily labor. The Vaisya is ambitious for worldly gain as well as for satisfaction of the senses; he has more creative ability than the Su- dra and seeks occupation as a farmer, a businessman, an artist, or wher- ever his mental energy finds fulfillment. The Kshatriya, having through many lives fulfilled the desires of the Sudra and Vaisya states, begins to seek the meaning of life; he tries to overcome his bad habits, to control his senses, and to do what is right. Kshatriyas by occupation are noble rulers, statesmen, warriors. The Brahmin has overcome his lower nature, has a natural affinity for spiritual pursuits, and is God-knowing, able therefore to teach and help liberate others, causal body. Essentially, man as a soul is a causal-bodied being. His causal body is an idea-matrix for the astral and physical bodies.

Ultimately, man sheds the last soul covering—his causal body —to unite with omnipresent Spirit, beyond all vibratory realms. chakras. In Yoga, the seven occult centers of life and consciousness in the spine and brain, which enliven the physical and astral bodies of man. These centers are referred to as chakras (\"wheels\") because the concentrated en- ergy in each one is like a hub from which radiate rays of life-giving light and energy. In ascending order, |hese chakras are muladhara (the coccygeal, at the base of the spine); svadhisthana (the sacral, two inches above mul- adhara)-, mattipura (the lumbar, opposite the navel); anahata (the dorsal, opposite the heart); vishuddha (the cervical, at the base of the neck); ajna (traditionally located between the eyebrows; in actuality, directly con- nected by polarity with the medulla; see also medulla and spiritual eye); and sahasrara (in the uppermost part of the cerebrum). The seven centers are divinely planned exits or \"trapdoors\" through which the soul has descended into the body and through which it must reascend by a process of meditation. By seven successive steps, the soul es- capes into Cosmic Consciousness. In its conscious upward passage through the seven opened or \"awakened\" cerebrospinal centers, the soul travels the highwa y to the Infinite, the true path by which the soul must retrace its course to reunite with God. Yoga treatises generally consider only the six lower centers as chakras, with sahasrara referred to separately as a seventh center. All seven centers, however, are often referred to as lotuses, whose petals open, or turn up- ward, in spiritual awakening as the life and consciousness travel up the spine. chitta.

The ego-principle, ahamkara (lit., \"I do\"), is the root cause of dual- ism or the seeming separation between man and his Creator.

The Cosmic Vibration, or Aum, structures all physical creation, including man's physical bocjly, through the manifestation of five tattvas (el- ements) : earth, water, fire, air, and ether (q.v.). These are structural forces, intelligent and vibratory in nature. Without the earth element there would be no state of solid matter; without the water element, no liquid state; with- out the air element, no gaseous state; without the fire element, no heat; without the ether element, no background on which to produce the cosmic motion-picture show. In the body, prana (cosmic vibratory energy) enters the medulla and is then divided into the five elemental currents by the ac- tion of the five lower chakras (q.v.), or centers: the coccygeal (earth), sacral (water), lumbar (fire), dorsal (air), and cervical (ether). The Sanskrit termi- nology for these elements is prithivi, ap, tej, prana, and akasha. Energization Exercises. Man is surrounded by cosmic energy, much as a fish is surrounded by water.

The word gospel comes from the Old English godspel, \"good news.\" It has the same meaning as the Greek evangelion —literally a \"good mes- sage\" or \"good tidings\"—the word used for Jesus' teachings in Greek, the language in which the New Testament was originally written. In the years immediately after Jesus' ascension, historians state, sto- ries of his life circulated primarily by word of mouth; different communi- ties of the evolving Christian movement had varying collections of narra- tives and sayings. Though Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection took place in A.D. 30, the first of the four canonical gospels (which most scholars believe to be Mark's) was not written until about forty years later. (Early Chris- tians considered the Jewish scriptures to be their holy books; and, since man y expected the imminent return of Jesus to earth, they apparently felt no need for additional written teachings. Though the first epistles, or pas- toral letters, of the Apostle Paul were written around the year 50 or 51, no systematic narrative of Jesus' life and teachings was written until Mark's appeared around the year 70.) Historians generally agree that both Matthew and Luke drew from Mark; and both of them, in addition, had access to material from other sources. Scholars attribute further differences in the content and emphasis of the four gospels, which were written at different times between A.D. 70 and 90, to the particular events and concerns faced by the independent Christian communities—some of Jewish ancestry, some of Gentile—scattered in differ- ent regions of the eastern Roman Empire as the movement gradually evolved from its Jewish roots to a fully separate religion. (The Gospel of Thomas, also cited herein, is thought to have been compiled during the same period as the four canonical gospels—within a few decades after Jesus' ascension.) Regarding the authors of the four New Testament Gospels, Matthew and John, of course, are names of two of the original twelve apostles of Jesus. Mark, according to Papias, bishop of Hieropolis in Asia Minor (ca. 130), was the assistant and \"interpreter\" of Jesus' disciple Peter; and wrote down what he heard Peter relate about the sayings and deeds of Jesus. Luke is identified in early accounts as the traveling companion of Paul, who had personally known Peter, John, and Jesus' brother James. An overview of what historians know about the authorship of the Gospels may be found in Three Gospels (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1997), by Duke University professor Reynolds Price. gunas.

By following the master's teach- ings and discipline, the disciple is able to fulfill his soul's desire for the manna of God-perception.

To show the harmony and essential unity of the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Yoga precepts of Bhagavan Krishna is an integral part of the SRF dispensation. All of these Gurus, by their universal teachings and divine instrumentality, con- tribute to the fulfillment of the Self-Realization Fellowship mission of bring- ing to humanity a practical spiritual science of God-realization. The passing of a guru's spiritual mantle to a disciple designated to carry on the lineage to which that guru belongs is termed guru-parampara. Thus Paramahansa Yogananda's direct lineage of gurus is Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, and Swami Sri Yukteswar. Before his passing Paramahansaji stated that it was God's wish that he be the last in the Self-Realization Fellowship line of Gurus. No suc- ceeding disciple or leader in his society will ever assume the title of guru. \"Whe n I am gone,\" he said, \"the teachings will be the guru....Through the teachings you will be in tune with me and the great Gurus who sent me.\" When questioned about the succession of the presidency of Self- Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India, Paramahansaji stated: \"There will always be at the head of this organization men and 1584"},{"pageNumber":799,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY women of realization.

Both are translations of the same Greek and Hebrew words. Ruach in Hebrew and pneuma in Greek are used to signify a range of concepts: spirit, breath, and wind—in gen- eral, the life principle of man and the cosmos. (Similarly in Latin, in which inspiration refers to the inflow of breath as well as of divine or creative spirit; and in Sanskrit, in which prana denotes the breath as well as the sub- tle astral life energy that sustains the body, and Pranava —an alternate term for Aum —is the name for the universal Cosmic Vibratory Energy that un- derlies and upholds every particle of creation.) At the time of the King Jame s translation of the Bible, both \"spirit\" and \"ghost\" in English con- veyed the same meaning as ruach and pneuma; the everyday connotation of \"ghost\" has changed in the centuries since then.

It includes certain techniques of meditation whose devoted practice leads to re- alization of God.

Kriya Yoga is thus \"union (yoga) with the Infinite through a certain action or rite (kriya).\" Kriya Yoga is praised by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita and by Patanjali in the Yoga Su- tras.

The deathless Mahavatar (\"great avatar\") who in 1861 gave Kriya Yoga (q.v.) initiation to Lahiri Mahasaya, and thereby restored to the world the ancient technique of salvation. Perennially youthful, he has lived for centuries in the Himalayas, bestowing a constant blessing on the world. His mission has been to assist prophets in carrying out their spe- cial dispensations. Many titles signifying his exalted spiritual stature have been given to him, but the mahavatar has generally adopted the simple nam e of Babaji, from the Sanskrit baba, \"father,\" and the suffix ji, denot- ing respect. More information about his life and spiritual mission is given in Autobiography of a Yogi. See avatar. man. The word is derived from the same root as Sanskrit manas, mind—the uniquel y human capacity for rational thought. The science of yoga deals with human consciousness from the point of view of the essentially an- drogynous Self (atman). As there is no other terminology in English that would convey these psychological and spiritual truths without excessive lit- erary awkwardness, the use of man and related terms has been retained in this publication—not in the narrowly exclusive sense of the word man, de- noting only half of the human race, but in its broader original meaning.

Men of God-realization...are devoid of the ego-principle ( ahamkara ) and its upris- ings of personal desires; the actions of true masters are in effortless con- formity with rita, natural righteousness. In Emerson's words, all great ones becom e 'not virtuous, but Virtue; then is the end of the creation answered, and God is well pleased.'\" maya. The delusory power inherent in the structure of creation, by which the One appears as many. Maya is tne principle of relativity, inversion, contrast, duality, oppositional states; the \"Satan\" (lit., in Hebrew, \"the adversary\") of the Old Testament prophets; and the \"devil\" whom Christ described pic- turesquely as a \"murderer\" and a \"liar,\" because \"there is no truth in him\" (John 8:44). Paramahansa Yogananda wrote: \"The Sanskrit word maya means 'the measurer'; it is the magical power in creation by which limitations and di- visions are apparently present in the Immeasurable and Inseparable. Maya is Nature herself—the phenomenal worlds, ever in transitional flux as an- tithesis to Divine Immutability. \"In God's plan and play ( lila ), the sole function of Satan or maya is to attempt to divert man from Spirit to matter, from Reality to unreality. 'The devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil' (I John 3:8). That is, the manifestation of Christ Consciousness, within man's own be- ing, effortlessly destroys the illusions or 'works of the devil.' \"Maya is the veil of transitoriness in Nature, the ceaseless becoming of creation; the veil that each man must lift in order to see behind it the Creator, the changeless Immutable, eternal Reality.\" meditation. Generally, interiorized concentration with the objective of perceiv- ing God. True meditation, dhyatia, is conscious realization of God through intuitive perception. It is achieved only after the devotee has attained that fixed concentration whereby he disconnects his attention from the senses and is completely undisturbed by sensory impressions from the outer world. Dhyana is the seventh step of Patanjali's Eightfold Path of Yoga, the eighth step being samadhi, communion, oneness with God. See Patanjali. medulla oblongata. This structure at the base of the brain (top of the spinal cord) is the principal point of entry of life force (prana) into the body.

A spiritual title signifying a master (q.v.). It may be conferred only by a true guru on a qualified disciple. Paramahansa literally means \"supreme swan.\" In the Hindu scriptures, the hansa or swan symbolizes spiritual discrimination. Swami Sri Yukteswar bestowed the title on his beloved disciple Yogananda in 1935. Patanjali. Renowned exponent of yoga, a sage of ancient times, whose Yoga Sutras outline the principles of the yogic path, dividing it into eight steps: (1) moral proscriptions (yama), (2.) right observances (niyama), (3) medi- tation posture (asana), (4) life-force control (pranayama), (5) interioriza- tion of the mind (pratyahara), (6) concentration (dharana), (7) meditation (dhyana), (8) union with God (samadhi). Prakriti. Cosmic Nature; in general, the intelligent, creative vibratory power projected out of Spirit that both objectifies and becomes the triune mani- festation (causal, astral, and physical) of the universe and the microcosm of man. Specifically designated: Maha-Prakriti is the primal Undifferentiated Creative Intelligence of God, Creative Mother Nature or Holy Ghost, that through Cosmic Vibration of Its own Self brings into manifestation all cre- ation. Para-Prakriti (Pure Nature) and Apara-Prakriti (Impure Nature) cor- relate with the Christian terminologies of Holy Ghost and Satan —respec- tively, the creative power that expresses the immanence of God's vibratory Presence in creation, and the dark power of cosmic delusion that obscures the Divine Omnipresence. prana. Sparks of intelligent finer-than-atomic energy that constitute life, col- lectivel y referred to in Hindu scriptural treatises as prana, which Parama- hansa Yogananda has translated as \"lifetrons.\" In essence, condensed thoughts of God; substance of the astral world (q.v.) and life principle of the physical cosmos. In the physical world, there are two kinds of prana: (1) the cosmic vibratory energy that is omnipresent in the universe, struc- turing and sustaining all things; (2) the specific prana or energy that per- vades and sustains each human body through five currents or functions. Prana current performs the function of crystallization; vyana current, cir- culation; samana current, assimilation; udana current, metabolism; and apana current, elimination. pranayama. Conscious control of prana (the creative vibration or energy that activates and sustains life in the body). The yoga science of pranayama is the direct way to consciously disconnect the mind from the life functions and sensory perceptions that tie man to body consciousness. Pranayama 1589"},{"pageNumber":804,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY thus frees man's consciousness to commune with God.

The doctrine that human beings, compelled by the law of evo- lution, incarnate repeatedly in progressively higher lives—retarded by wrong actions and desires, and advanced by spiritual endeavors—until Self- realization and God-union are attained.

The specific instruction and meditation practice s prescribed by the guru for his disciples, who by faithfully fol- lowing them ultimately realize God. samadhi. The highest step on the Eightfold Path of Yoga, as outlined by the sage Patanjali (q.v.). Samadhi is attained when the meditator, the process of meditation (by which the mind is withdrawn from the senses by interior- ization), and the object of meditation (God) become One. Paramahansa Yogananda has explained that \"in the initial states of God-communion (savikalpa samadhi) the devotee's consciousness merges in the Cosmic Spirit; his life force is withdrawn from the body, which appears 'dead,' or motionless and rigid. The yogi is fully aware of his bodily condition of sus- pended animation. As he progresses to higher spiritual states (nirvikalpa samadhi ), however, he communes with God without bodily fixation; and in his ordinary waking consciousness, even in the midst of exacting worldly duties.\" Both states are characterized by oneness with the ever new bliss of Spirit, but the nirvikalpa state is experienced by only the most highly ad- vanced masters. 1590"},{"pageNumber":805,"pageContent":"Sanatana Dharma.

The Self is individualized Spirit, whose nature is ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new joy. Experience of these divine qualities of the soul's nature is achieved through meditation. Self-realization. Paramahansa Yogananda has defined Self-realization as \"the knowing—in body, mind, and soul—that we are one with the omnipres- ence of God; that we do not have to pray that it come to us, that we are not merely near it at all times, but that God's omnipresence is our om- nipresence; that we are just as much a part of Him now as we ever will be. All we have to do is improve our knowing.\" Self-Realization. An abbreviated way of referring to Self-Realization Fellow- ship, the society founded by Paramahansa Yogananda, often used by him in informal talks; e.g. \"the Self-Realization teachings\"; \"Self-Realization headquarters in Los Angeles\"; etc. Self-Realization Fellowship. The international nonsectarian religious society founded by Paramahansa Yogananda in the United States in 1920 (and as Yogoda Satsanga Society of India in 1917) to disseminate worldwide the spiritual principles and meditation techniques of Kriya Yoga, and to foster greater understanding among people of all races, cultures, and creeds of the one Truth underlying all religions. (See \"Aims and Ideals of Self-Realization Fellowship,\" page 1570.) Paramahansa Yogananda has explained that the name Self-Realization Fellowship signifies \"fellowship with God through Self-realization, and friendship with all truth-seeking souls.\" From its international headquarters in Los Angeles, the society pub- lishes Paramahansa Yogananda's writings, lectures, and informal talks— including his comprehensive series of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons 1591"},{"pageNumber":806,"pageContent":"for home study and Self-Realization, th e magazine he founded in 1925; produces audio and video recordings on his teachings; oversees its temples, retreats, meditation centers, youth programs, and the monastic communi- ties of the Self-Realization Order; conducts lecture and class series in cities around the world; and coordinates the Worldwide Prayer Circle, a network of groups and individuals dedicated to praying for those in need of physi- cal, mental, or spiritual aid and for global peace and harmony.

Self-Realization Magazine. A quarterly journal published by Self-Realization Fellowship, featuring the talks and writings of Paramahansa Yogananda; and containing other spiritual, practical, and informative articles of current interest and lasting value. Satsangas (informal spiritual talks) of Sri Daya Mata, president of Self-Realization Fellowship, are also a regular feature. Shankara, Swami. Sometimes referred to as Adi (\"the first\") Shankaracharya (Shankara + acharya, \"teacher\"); India's most illustrious philosopher. His date is uncertain; many scholars assign him to the eighth or early ninth cen- tury. He expounded God not as a negative abstraction, but as positive, eter- nal, omnipresent, ever new Bliss.

The single eye of intuition and omnipresent perception at the Christ ( Kutastha) center (ajna chakra) between the eyebrows. The deeply meditatin g devotee beholds the spiritual eye as a ring of golden light en- circling a sphere of opalescent blue, and at the center, a pentagonal white star. Microcosmically, these forms and colors epitomize, respectively, the vibratory realm of creation (Cosmic Nature, Holy Ghost); the Son or in- telligence of God in creation (Christ Consciousness); and the vibrationless Spirit beyond all creation (God the Father). The spiritual eye is the entryway into the ultimate states of divine con- sciousness. In deep meditation, as the devotee's consciousness penetrates the spiritual eye, into the three realms epitomized therein, he experiences successivel y the following states: superconsciousness or the ever new joy of soul realization, and oneness with God as Aum (q.v.) or Holy Ghost; Chris t consciousness, oneness with the universal intelligence of God in all creation; and cosmic consciousness, unity with the omnipresence of God that is beyond as well as within vibratory manifestation. See also con- sciousness, states of; superconsciousness; Christ Consciouness. Explaining a passage from Ezekiel (43:1-2), Paramahansa Yogananda has written: \"Through the divine eye in the forehead, ('the east'), the yogi sails his consciousness into omnipresence, hearing the word or Aum, the di- vine sound of 'many waters': the vibrations of light that constitute the sole reality of creation.\" In Ezekiel's words: \"Afterwards he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh towards the east; and behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east; and His voice was like the nois e of many waters; and the earth shined with His glory.\" Jesus also spoke of the spiritual eye: \"When thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light....Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness\" (Luke 11:34-35).

There are ten classificatory titles of the venerable Swami Order, as Giri, Puri, Bharati, Tirtha, Saraswati, and others. Swami Sri Yukteswar (q.v.) and Paramahansa Yogananda belonged to the Giri (\"mountain\") branch. The Sanskrit word swami means \"he who is one with the Self ( Swa).\" Trinity. When Spirit manifests creation, It becomes the Trinity: Father, Son, Holy Ghost, or Sat, Tat, Aum. The Father (Sat) is God as the Creator ex- isting beyond creation (Cosmic Consciousness). The Son (Tat) is God's om- nipresent intelligence existing in creation (Christ Consciousness or Kuta- stha Chaitanya). The Holy Ghost (Aum) is the vibratory power of God that objectifies and becomes creation. Many cycles of cosmic creation and dissolution have come and gone i n Eternity (see yuga). At the time of cosmic dissolution, the Trinity and all other relativities of creation resolve into the Absolute Spirit. Upanishads . The Upanishads or Vedanta (lit., \"end of the Vedas\"), which oc- cur in certain parts of the four Vedas, are essential summaries that form th e doctrinal basis of the Hindu religion. Vedanta. Literally, \"end of the Vedas\"; the philosophy stemming from the Upanishads, or latter portion of the Vedas. Shankara (eighth or early ninth century) was the chief exponent of Vedanta, which declares that God is the only reality and that creation is essentially an illusion. As man is the only creature capable of conceiving of God, man himself must be divine, and his duty therefore is to realize his true nature. Vedas. The four scriptural texts of the Hindus: Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda, and Atharva Veda. They are essentially a literature of chant, ritual, and recitation for vitalizing and spiritualizing all phases of man's life and activity. Among the immense texts of India, the Vedas (Sanskrit root vid, \"to know\") are the only writings to which no author is ascribed.

From Sanskrit yuj, \"union.\" The highest connotation of the word yoga in Hindu philosophy is union of the individual soul with Spirit through sci- entific methods of meditation. Within the larger spectrum of Hindu philos- ophy, Yoga is one of six orthodox systems: Vedanta, Mimamsa, Sankhya, Vaisesika, Nyaya, and Yoga. There are also various types of yoga methods: Hatha Yoga, Mantra Yoga, Laya Yoga, Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, and Raja Yoga. Raja Yoga, the \"royal\" or complete yoga, is that which is taught by Self-Realization Fellowship, and which Bhagavan Krishna ex- tols to his disciple Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita: \"The yogi is greater than body-disciplining ascetics, greater even than the followers of the path of wis- dom or of the path of action; be thou, O Arjuna, a yogi!\" (Bhagavad Gita vi:46) . The sage Patanjali, foremost exponent of Yoga, has outlined eight definite steps by which the Raja Yogi attains samadhi, or union with God. These are (i) yama, moral conduct; (2) niyama, religious observances; (3) asana, right posture; (4) pranayama, control of prana, subtle life currents; (5) pratyahara, interiorization, withdrawal of the senses from external ob- jects; (6) dharana, concentration, (7) dhyana, meditation; and (8) samadhi, superconscious experience; union with God. yogi. One who practices Yoga (q.v.). Anyone who practices a scientific tech- nique for divine realization is a yogi. He may be either married or unmar- ried, either a man of worldly responsibilities or one dedicated to formal re- ligious vows. Yogoda Satsanga Society of India. The name by which Paramahansa Yoga- nanda's society is known in India. The Society was founded in 1917 by Paramahansa Yogananda. Its headquarters, Yogoda Math, is situated on the banks of the Ganges at Dakshineswar, near Calcutta. Yogoda Satsanga So- ciety has a branch math at Ranchi, Jharkhand (formerly Bihar), and many branch centers. In addition to Yogoda meditation centers throughout India, there are twenty-two educational institutions, from primary through college level. Yogoda, a word coined by Paramahansa Yogananda, is derived from yoga, union, harmony, equilibrium; and da, that which imparts. Satsanga is composed of sat, truth, and sanga, fellowship. For the West, Sri Yogananda translated the Indian name as \"Self-Realization Fellowship.\" yuga. A cycle or subperiod of creation, outlined in ancient Hindu texts. Sri Yukteswar (q.v.) describes in The Holy Science a 24,000-year Equinoctial Cycle and mankind's present place in it.
