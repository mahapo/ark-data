The present volume fulfills a long-standing desire to restore toprint those poems of his that were published in earlier years under the titleSongs of the Soul, and to bring together under that title many ofParamahansaji's other poems from various Self-Realization publications, past andpresent.Considerable thought and research have gone into the preparation of thisedition. Original writings and transcripts were compared with variant renderingsintroduced by early editors, and by Paramahansaji himself; for he wouldsometimes pen corrections and creative variations that came to him whenrereading a poem, or interpolate a fresh inspiration while reciting a passage inthe course of a lecture or devotional service. The number of such variations ina poem is generally proportionate to the frequency of its use. In many casesthey are slight — a more precise word, a different turn of phrase, occasionallya deletion (or addition) of a thought, or of certain lines, to fit a particularcontext. The present endeavor has been to adhere to Paramahansaji's originalhandwritten or spoken version, and from the modifications he introduced, toretain those that substantially clarify his thought or otherwise add to thebeautiful imagery of his inspiration.We were happy to find and restore not only illustrative words and phrases, butalso entire lines or stanzas thathad been omitted from these poems when they were originally published. Thefollowing are a few examples:In the selection, Flower Offering, some of the phrases omitted or changed in thefirst version printed in 1923, and now restored in this new edition are(\"devotion-sweetened musk\" instead of \"devotion's perfume\")(\"With silent song in me\" — this line was omitted — \"I come to worship Thee\")An entire new stanza has been added. Written in rough draft by Paramahansaji,but never printed:(\"For naught from Thee I pray or longThat 1 bring offering and song.I just want to tellIn secret what 1 feel.\")In Thy Homecoming, \"the steady sentinels\" was misread and printed originally as\"speedy sentinels\":picture0 [images/picture0.jpg](\"The steady sentinels of sun and moon are patiently waiting for Thyhomecoming\").In A Mxyyoy New, the word \"loyal\" had been omitted:(\"Would loyal show, all true\"). The charming line,^-7^ ^Sc^rezJlM S6^^ ioll^ d^(\"Ere the sorcerer Sleep doth call\"), had also been left out.In At the Roots oj Eternity, several unused descriptive words and phrases fromthe original handwritten copy were restored, such as:(\"with singing leaves,\" instead of \"swaying trees\")(\"with bounding planet-balls,\" instead of \"whirlingplanets\")Vll/picture1 [images/picture1.jpg](\"nectar loot,\" which had not been included).In Listen to M}i Soul Song, possibly the editor could not make out thehandwritten word \"gloaming,\"f^ ^^ifi^u±i:f^(\"Beneath the gloaming of dim devotion of eyes unseeing\").It was originally printed as \"gloom of dim devotion.\" That first printing alsoomitted the phrase \"of eyes unseeing.\"Similar corrections and restorations were made in many of the other poems aswell, such as the addition in Variety of two previously unpublished stanzas atthe end, and the picturesque phrase(\"Thy debut, O Eternity\").With this scanning of original manuscripts and transcriptions, we feel we haveaccomplished the review of these poems that Paramahansaji had started, but didnot have time to finish. Since in many cases there was more than one \"original\"or \"approved\" version, we have chosen for this edition the rendering most oftenrecited by Paramahansaji himself. Where such evidence was lacking, we selectedthose words or phrases deemed most characteristic of his unique mode ofexpression — as cited in the foregoing examples.VlllSongs of the Soul is an outpouring of Paramahansa Yogananda's direct perceptionsof God — God in nature, in man, in everyday experiences, and in the spirituallyawakened state of samadhi meditation. Most of the poems were written during the1920s and 1930s. This was a period when Paramahansaji was traveling extensivelythroughout the United States to lecture in her principal cities. He wrote aboutwhat he saw, and about the inner experiences evoked by those perceptions. Hiswritings are not the considered renderings of a poet's fancies, but a revelationof the interior experiences of a soul ever awake in God, responding to thewonders of nature; to the memories of a beloved motherland; to the deepimpressions made by new friends and acquaintances; above all, to the divinerealizations born of that soul's intimate communion with God.SELF-REALIZATION FELLOWSHIPLos Angeles, California July 1983AIMS AND IDEALSofSelf-Realization FellowshipAs set forth by Paramahansa Yogananda, FounderSri Daya Mata, PresidentTo disseminate among the nations a knowledge of definite scientific techniquesfor attaining direct personal experience of God.To teach that the purpose of life is the evolution, through self-effort, ofman's limited mortal consciousness into God Consciousness; and to this end toestablish Self-Realization Fellowship temples for God-communion throughout theworld, and to encourage the establishment of individual temples of God in thehomes and in the hearts of men.To reveal the complete harmony and basic oneness of original Christianity astaught by Jesus Christ and original Yoga as taught by Bhagavan Krishna; and toshow that these principles of truth are the common scientific foundation of alltrue religions.To point out the one divine highway to which all paths of true religious beliefseventually lead: the highway of daily, scientific, devotional meditation on God.To liberate man from his threefold suffering: physical disease, mentalinharmonies, and spiritual ignorance.To encourage \"plain living and high thinking\"; and to spread a spirit ofbrotherhood among all peoples by teaching the eternal basis of their unity:kinship with God.To demonstrate the superiority of mind over body, of soul over mind.To overcome evil by good, sorrow by joy, cruelty by kindness, ignorance bywisdom.To unite science and religion through realization of the unity of theirunderlying principles.To advocate cultural and spiritual understanding between East and West, and theexchange of their finest distinctive features.To serve mankind as one's larger Self."},{"pageContent":"leaf 15 [images/leaf-image0015.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Grand Canyon of the Colorado, The 143Great Lightland, The 107Hart of Heaven, The 139Harvest, The 144Human Mind, The 29I Am He 89I Am Here 159I Am Lonely No More 163In Me 99In Stillness Dark 17In the Land of Dreams 151Invisible Mother 66I Was Made for Thee 48Leave Thy Vow of Silence 145Life's Dream 134Listen to My Soul Song 132Little Eternity, The 78Luther Burbank 80Make Us Thyself 41Methought I Heard a Voice 158Milk-White Sail, A 77Mirror New, A 156Mohawk Trail 130My Cosmic Mother's Face 69My India 168My Kinsmen 87My Mother's Eyes 102My Native Land 167My Prisoner 162My Soul Is Marching On 5Mystery 146Nature's Nature 121Noble New, The .' 19Oceanic Presence 148xiiOn Coming to the New-Old Land — America 62One Friend 67One That's Everywhere 13Paupack's Peak 31Pikes Peak 114Protecting Thorns 38Royal Way, The 120Samadhi 95Scenes Within 56Screen of Life, The 10Shadows 12Silence 18Some Treasure of My Own 164Spell, The 155Splinters of Thy Love, The 74Tattered Dress, The 79Tattered Garment 49They Are Thine 165Thou and I Are One 46Thou In Me 106Thy Call 34Thy Cruel Silence 137Thy Divine Gypsy 44Thy Homecoming 108Thy Secret Throne 136'Tis All Unknown 37Toiler's Lay, The 128Too Near 100To the Aurora Borealis 91Two Black Eyes 68Undying Beauty 40Vanishing Bubbles 9Variety 59Wake, Wake, My Sleeping Hunger, Wake! 20xiiiWhat Use? 50When I Am Only a Dream 176When 1 Cast All Dreams Away 172When I Take the Vow of Silence 184When Will He Come? 6Wherel Am 15Whispers 131Yogoda Dream Hermitage — A Dream Dropped From Heaven 63Photographs Associated With the Life of Paramahansa YoganandaParamahansa Yogananda, 1923 24Paramahansa Yogananda, New York, 1926 45Self-Realization Fellowship Hermitage, Encini-tas, California 64Paramahansa Yogananda with Luther Burbank,Santa Rosa, California, 1924 80Gyana Prabha Ghosh, Paramahansa Yogananda'smother 102Paramahansa Yogananda with Amelita Galli-Curci and Homer Samuels, at \"Sul Monte,\"New York, 1926 126International headquarters of SRF/YSS, atopMount Washington, Los Angeles 134Paramahansa Yogananda, LakeChapala, Mexico,1929 174\"The Last Smile\": Paramahansa Yogananda, anhour before he consciously left his body, March7, 1952, Los Angeles 185XIVDedicatedto my earthly father,who has helped me in all my spiritualwork in India and AmericaCONSECRATIONAt Thy feet I come to showerAll my full heart's rhyming flower:Of Thy breath bom,By Thy love grown,Through my lonely seeking found,By hands Thou gavest plucked and bound.For Thee, the sheaves Within these leaves: The choicest flowers Of my life'sseason, With petals soulful spread.

Justremember that no matter what happens to you, still your soul is marching on. Nomatter where you go, your warviering footsteps will lead you back to God. Thereis rw other way to go.The shining stars are sunk in darkness deep, The weary sun is dead at night, Themoon's soft smile doth fade anon; But still my soul is marching on!The grinding wheel of time hath crushed Full many a life of moon and star. Andmany a brightly smiling mom; But still my soul is marching on!The flowers bloomed, then hid in gloom. The bounty of the trees did cease;Colossal men have come and gone. But still my soul is marching on!The aeons one by one are flying. My arrows one by one are gone; Dimly, slowly,life is fading. But still my soul is marching on!Darkness, death, and failures vied; To block my path they fiercely tried. Myfight with jealous Nature's strong, But still my soul is marching on!WHEN WILL HE COME?When every heart's desire palesBefore the brilliancy of the ever-leaping flamesof God-love, Then He will come.When, in expectation of His coming.You are ever readyTo fearlessly, grieflessly, joyouslyBum the faggots of all desiresIn the fireplace of life,That you may protect Him from your freezinginner indifference. Then He will come.When no inclinations or unfulfilled cravings Can be sure of your stabilitytoward them; When He shall be certain you will never leavethe guru. Then He will come.No matter how you feel — helpless, forsaken, Tortured by temptation, karma, ortests — If you ever keep hoping He will come, He will come.When your mind says piercingly,\"You can't have Him, you don't deservehaving Him\"; Still, if your soul, disregarding all this, Shall ever keepchanting within, \"He will come,\" He will come.When He shall be sure nothing else can claim you, Then He will come.Even if you are the sinner of sinners, Still, if you never stop calling Himdeeply In the temple of unceasing love, Then He will come.picture2 [images/picture2.jpg]picture3 [images/picture3.jpg]^^'..t^iVANISHING BUBBLESMany unknown bubbles float and flow, Many ripples dance by me And melt away intothe sea; I yearn to know, ah, whence they come and whither go.The rain drops and dies, My thoughts play wild and vanish quick, The red cloudsmelt into the skies; I stake my purse, I'll slave all life, their motive stillto seek.Some friends — though not their love — Some dearest thoughts I ne'er would lose,I said; And last night's surest stars, seen just above, All, all are fled.Crowds of lilies, warbling linnets. Perfumed blossoms, honey-mad bees Once metat yonder bowered trees; But now the lonesome field alone is left.The bubbles, lilies, friends, dramatic thoughts. Their parts did play, andentertain; And now behind the cosmic screen, Their displayed coats to change.They quiet, concealed, remain.THE SCREEN OF LIFEWhen dawn breaks the spell of darkness,And roses bloom;When little pleasures all dance round you,And fickle festivity singsOf babes newborn (in future sure to die);When fortune laughsAnd praise weaves garlandsAnd glory makes the crown;When on all sides men shout your praisesAnd thousands follow —You see His hands showering blessings.Yet in the limbs of the rosebush, leafless o'erthe snow, There is a silent budding joy in every twig. There is a joy in waitingFor the streak of dawn in the dark; Through vapors of sorrow dim, joy is seenwithwelcome.Persecution sweetens oft-tasted praise;A bare head expectant of the crownHas joy denied the head long diademed.In the uncertain darkness, each little flame of joybums brighter; The mine of monotony holds the caged airof bursting gaiety.JOOld age thrills with the thought of youth; Behind the veil of death hides thepromise of new birth.The shifting scenes of life screen the true Life:Behind the unreal motion pictures of things seenUnfolds the real dramaOf stable Cosmic Life unseen.Shadows are lined with light,Sorrows bulge with joy,Failures are potent with determination for success,Cruelties urge the instinct to be kind.Passing mirth, fame, wealth,Proud possessions (giv'n only to be taken away).And the straw fires of passions, pleasures,and intoxicating friendships Oft do hide His presence; But when all are gone,you look for Him. In that solitude, by friends and foes avoided, There's Oneunseen, who ne'er forsakes. Though He may fly when all are shaking handswith you. When none stand by.

Of brooks and rills, of shining ether ore — Are laid with wondrous OneNectar, Stolen from nature's nooks by lares. Do thou thy sullen sleep forsake:Wake, wake, my sleeping Hunger, wake!Through diverse paths of aeons thou hast criedFor a morsel of manna; thou hast begged and tried.But now thou sleepest, dazed and tired;On cheeks undried lie dropsOf fresh-wept tearsWhile Nectar touches thy lips — partake!Wake, wake, my sleeping Hunger, wake!This unquenched Hunger old of mineDid eat all fare, and yet did pine —Was starved with surfeit, and it soughtHow might its yeamed-for food be got.The food for which thou wept'st awaits — partake!Wake, wake, my sleeping Hunger, wake!Friends, wealth, and fancy's rarest treat. Posthumous wishes sprung fromdeathless roots so sweet.And burned with thousand flaming waves, Did fail to quell thy heart's truecrave. The Nectar sought for seeks thee now — partake! Wake, wake, my sleepingHunger, wake!My Hunger, thou hast burned and wept to drink Life's mysteries by life's barebrink — Ambrosial founts that sleep beneath Sequestered caves in soil of truth.Oh, weep more drops, nay, streams — oceansof tears. Thy duty is for peace to weep; thine only care To seek thy work; andall thy food Be what doth feed thy mood. Thy work is done; thy Nectar's here —Quench, quench th' eternal ache! Wake, wake, my sleeping Hunger, wake!FREEDOMBrave cords, bind me hand and foot;Yet lo, I am free, ever free.Disease, ply your tortures;Still I am free, ever free.Health, try your lures;But see, I am free, ever free.Death, destroy if you willMy body-prison; caged or uncaged,I am free, ever free.Forged in the furnace of incarnations. Long chains of earthly desires Have triedto bind me; But I escaped from life to life, And at last I am free, ever free.Through the portal of the rainbow I entered heaven's free skies; Now I am free,ever free.Naught can bind meIf 1 bind not myself.None can free meIf I know not 1 am free.Knowing that naught exists to bind me,I know I am free, ever free.UAFTER THISAfter the prison-petals of earth-life fade, And the soul-scent slips Into themighty cosmic wind of Spirit, No more would I love a flower-cage life — Unlessto mingle the dewdrop tears of otherprisoned souls with mine, And show them the way that I my freedom won.Oh, I would not mind dwellingIn roses and daffodils, for a time,If it is of my own free will;But forever to stay behind bars of beautyOf violet-sun-gold rays, I care not.No more will I be compelled to liveEven in a golden heavenly cage.From flower to flower will I fly.I will wear the blackness of the night.Shimmering with busy stars—I will be the twinkle of their lights.I will be the waking of the dawn.And burst forth with the warming raysof friendship.

Let thy smilesPulverize to atoms the rocks of sorrow. Let thy smiles meander Throughdesert-souls and oasis-hearts alike. Let the deluge of thy fearless smiles Sweepthrough all minds and every place, Drowning, washing away All barriers for milesand miles.When God laughs through the soul.And the soul beams through the heart.And the heart smiles through the eyes.Then the Prince of SmilesIs enthroned beneath the canopyOf thy celestial brow.Protect thy Prince of Smiles in the castle ofsincerity. Let no rebel hypocrisy lurk to destroy it.nSpread the gospel of \"Smile!\"Purify all homes with thy healthy smiles.Let loose the wildfire o{ thy smiles, And blaze the thickets of melancholia.Open the long-bottled-up musk of smiles, Releasing its perfume to waft in alldirections. Intoxicate all with the wine of thy smiles. Take the rich gifts ofsmiles from everyjoyous soul. And from the Mine of all true mirth. Then north, south, east, west,where'er thou goest. Thou smile millionaire. Scatter thy golden smiles Freely,freely, everywhere.THE HUMAN MINDI love to roam alone, unseen,In cities of the human mind.I prize the streets untrod by crooked thoughts —Vile-bom, unkind.Incognito I wish to wander—To living lanes my thoughts surrender—With simple wish to know and learnEach straight and righteous path and danger-turn.1 wish to roam in mazy lanes Of dark and brighter thoughts; With love to all andharm to none, With better message fraught.I'd like to broaden narrow lanesOf selfish, twisted thoughtWith my love's true-building brain —Soul's wisdom — that I've within me got.I long to soar so high.That I at once may spyThe narrow alleys and broader roadsOf thoughtful human moods.k ., ■.,picture5 [images/picture5.jpg]>^J*'■^'i^'S^.^ ^/^^m.'{^•^^^i^^^m■•.-*■ \\,<vf?:^H.\"\"**®^r-%^.•n^- ^*^^_PAUPACK'S PEAK0 Paupack's Peak,'Mid rustic scenes and trees1 found thee; and did seek In thee the Hidden Beauty.Thy palace I approached by woodsy road; Where on both sides there stood Thycolumned trees, with leafy swords outstretched To render bowered welcome.Unconscious hopes did thrill To know thy mysteries royal; And tempted was I Thysecrets to pry.I stole through secret hilly ways — and all at onceStood face to faceWith beauteous sceneWhere liquid silver spray did graceThe breast of caves; and down did run,Sparkling through rays of sunTo ornament crude stones and logs beneathWith eddying necklacesAnd pearly bubbled wreaths.I tore through veil of trees — all sudden spied Thy peaceful Paupack, and inwonder criedTo find on cloudy breast of proud high hillsA lake,Of myriad tears close-gathered — mirror still —Full ready to be kind and slakeThe thirst of my parched mindThe Unseen Strength to find.Cool breezes wooed the warm lake waters,Half-hidden in a snow-white mistThat did not resistInvasion of two leaflike canoe vessels —Gliding like peaceful swansAt farewell hour of the sun.In mind's swift-passing fantasy.Like mystic barks they seemed.Laden with silhouetted singing angelsSailing across the sky.I entered once a covered path.Inlaid with velvet mossAnd sunshine-checkered leafy cushion.Their silken forms the leaves did give forall to tread And dance in comfort on their wavy bed.

If thoudost love her beauty alone, Why would'st thou rush To bleed from prickly thorn?BLOOD OF THE ROSEI tore the rose,I bled its slender stem;Its petals quiveredAnd I shivered;Yet dared to rob it of its smell!My heart did break, and tell,\"Thy hands are soiled\" — and mute I stood,Thus self-condemned and stained with rose's blood.But I know now,I love the roseMore than its wealth, and vowNe'er its love to desecrate or lose.UNDYING BEAUTYThey did their bestAnd they are blest —The sap, the shoots,The little leaves and roots;The benign breath,The touch of light —All worked in amityTo grow the rose's beauty.Watch its splendor,Its undying grandeur.The Infinite FaceThat peeps through its little case.Watch not in griefIts falling petals or its briefSojourn here;For its careerDone, its duty ends;Toward the Immortal's home it tends.The sap dried,The summer petals fled.Its body pines;Yet its death's divine;Through the death it spurnsIts deathless glory's won;The rose is dead —Its beauty lives instead.MAKE US THYSELFThat forced silence on my last day will be a mystery sleep; my beautiful andnightmare dreams of earthly being will bid farewell — for a time, at least.On the downy bed of blissful oblivion, a short rest; then I shall awake, on anew star, perchance, or in a new earthly setting — another dream of anotherlife.Maybe I shall be deluded still, thinking I am awake while yet I dream.Will this sleeping and deluded waking in dreamscontinue until I know I can really awaken only inThee? Why hast Thou monopolized in Thyself the onlywakefulness? Why hast Thou kept hidden in Thy hands the onlykey to the mystery chamber of life and thehereafter?If Thou art awake, why dost Thou want us to dreamthis cosmos? Or art Thou also sleeping, dreaming that we areplaying on the glittering, planet-studded stage oftime? Then in truth we are waking and dreaming withinThy dream.Is it when Thou dost awake, dreaming no more, that we too shall cease to dreamlife and death, and stop our playing? Will all trees, all bodies, all bodilesssouls then become Thyself?In dreaming, we divide our minds into thoughts of many things — minds,mountains, souls, sky, stars—creating each \"reality\" out of the tissue of fancy.So hast Thou transformed Thy dreaming mind into the star-chequered savanna ofthe blue, with its indwelling planetary families, our earth — and us, sorrowing,laughing, coming, dying.Thou canst be forgiven all the horrors of this cosmic drama only if it is adream.Even so, that which is dream-play to Thee is to us an awesome dream-struggle anddeath.Since we and all things created are made of Thy dreaming mind, why dost Thou notwake up and dissolve us into Thy fearless, blessed Being?Melt our dreaming minds into Thy mind, our temporary joys into Thine everlastingJoy.Unite our fading life with Thine imperishable Life.Blend our flickering, stale happiness into Thine enduring ever-new Blessedness.Make us fearless, by letting us know that we are waking and dreaming in Thee;that we are Thine all-protected, ever-blissful Self.#••Vpicture7 [images/picture7.jpg]/0^4picture8 [images/picture8.jpg]picture9 [images/picture9.jpg]^kI'aK,THY DIVINE GYPSYI will be a gypsy—Roam, roam, and roam.I will sing a song that none has sung!I will sing to the sky,I will sing to the winds,I'll sing to my red clouds!I'll roam, roam, and roam —King of the lands through which I roam.By day, the shady trees will be my tent.At night, the stars will beMy candles, twinkling in the firmament;And I will call the moon to be my lampAnd light my silver, skyey camp.I will be a gypsy —Roam, roam, and roam.I will eat the food that chance may bring;I will drink from crystal sparkling spring;I will doff my cap and off will go.Like a wayward brook of long ago,I will roll o'er the greenAnd scatter the joy of all my heartTo birds, leaves, winds, hills — then departTo stranger and stranger lands, from East to West.Oh!

I was made for dropping flowers of devotion gently atThy feet on the altar of the morning.My hands were made to serve Thee willingly; to remain folded in adoration,waiting for Thy coming; and when Thou comest, to bathe Thy feet with my tears.My voice was made to sing Thy glory.My feet were made to seek Thy temples everywhere.My eyes were made a chalice to hold Thy burning love and the wisdom falling fromThy nature's hands.My ears were made to catch the music of Thy footsteps echoing through the hallsof space, and to hear Thy divine melodies flowing through all heart-tracts ofdevotion.My lips were made to breathe forth Thy praises and Thine intoxicatinginspirations.My love was made to throw incandescent searchlight flames to find Thee,hidden in the forest of my desires.My heart was made to respond to Thy call alone.My soul was made to be the channel through which Thy love might flowuninterruptedly into all thirsty souls.TATTERED GARMENTSing thou no plaintive layWhen my earthly raiment dies,Nor let ashes tell thy tears where it lies.Oh, blow my tattered garment's dust away!Of dust clean-washed.The hidden Gold beneath will showItself anew, all brightly brushed,And shine somewhere with wisdoms glow.It waits with luring lusterFor the wandering Home-lorn soul —To show the path, with lightning glimmer,From darkness to the Goal.WHAT USE?Why did You give me eyes If I cannot see You everywhere? What use my hands Ifthey do not touch Your feet Treading silently in the heart of all cosmicmotions? What use my feetIf they exert not to seek Your temple in every place? What use my earsIf they do not with ecstatic attention Hear the echo of Your voice in thesoundless sermons of the scriptures?What use my reasonIf it does not lead me out of this cosmic conundrumTo the final home within You?What use my willIf it wins everything but the freedom You bestow?What use my feelingIf it thrills not to Your Presence in the lotus flowersof floating universes, And in the electronic forget-me-nots Glistening in thegarden of time and space? What use my loveIf it feels not Your love secreted in all hearts — Those that slumber inignorance And those prophetic ones that are awake in Thee?FLOWER OFFERINGA goblet of my folly-bloodIs humbly set beneath Thy petaled feet,O Lotus Sweet! I've stood with brimming cup of tears, Seeking Thine angry thirstto quench. With sandal sweet, and motley costumed flowers, Withdevotion-sweetened musk from my heartof hearts. With myrrh of age-old constancy my soul imparts, With silent song inme, I come to worship Thee.Unheard, my mournful lay; For naught, I cry and pray. But still, with sleeplesscare, I'll lay my flowers there.Alternate closing stanza penned by the author:For naught from Thee I pray or longThat I bring offerings and song.I just want to tellIn secret what I feel.And with watchful sleepless careTo lay my flowers here.THE EVER NEWNewer joys adorn the day;Brighter bum, through livelong night,The stars with purer light;Wiser thoughts do brace my voice.Unused words await my choice —With heart of the new I'll sing my lay.My winged thoughts do ceaseless beat The sky of time, and race to meet ThyPresence sweet, on distant throne, Somewhere beyond the manifest, alone.Each vernal dayMen chant their songs —Not with thoughts the same, but changing throngsOf newer ones that make Thy greater lay.The bubbling joyOf a little boy,Each brew o{ friendship's stillI steal; and with them fillMine ageless cup of heart —With ceaseless thrills 'twill start.Morrow each, and each todayWith unmatched love I'll sing my lay.The voices same do choir their praiseIn temple, church, and fane;But I ne'er deign to hearThe strains all stained with age-old tear;My fountain springs afresh today —With tears ne'er shed before will flow my lay.And in the same old churchI'll newly sing, and searchThe same old sermonFor deeper truths and clearer reason;And from the same old organ will I seekFresh notes of hope for the newborn week.Every day, oh, every day The bell will ring a new Sunday, And bathed in Thybeaming ray. With newer thoughts I'll sing my lay.picture10 [images/picture10.jpg]^'^'0'picture11 [images/picture11.jpg].^m^:CITY DRUM'Tis mom. I hear In rolling wheels the song Of a marching world So strong.I love to be roused From silent sleep By the early hum Of the active-city drum.The drum doth beatTo loudly greetAll heroes trueThat would die or do;That meet the morning's foeOf worry or of woeWith a dauntless smile,And thus success beguileUnto the happy campWhere peace e'er bums its lamp.With noisy hum The city drum Announces true and strong: \"The world is marchingon.\"SCENES WITHINMany a wondrous scenic face Denver's horizon grand doth grace. Yet when I thinkof the rarer beauties That lie in human souls, Rapture calls.Eagerly I look;Delving deep in valleys of human minds —In all their sacred nooks.Colossal mounts of nobilityI find, adorned with every goodly quality.Marigolds, roses, pure white flowersOf budding thoughts, their perfume wafting.Attract me to their bowers.The blue expanse of amityRipples with thrills of endless beauty.From compassions mountain-bosom,Perpetual soul freshness, constant kind looks.Flow down like brooks.Founts of matchless loveBubble forth in the heartOf this soul-garden, and startEndless sparkling fancies.Yet in the land of souls Blow various breezes;One warms me, and another freezes.Pure souls, vital souls,Breathe living air in me —To them my doors are open wide and free.I open my eyes on passing mountain scenes,*Then close my lidsAnd race in mental aerial planeTo view again the unseen world of souls:Cities loom, with passions all;Liquid mazes of desires.Deceiving mires;Ego's dark, titanic chasms.Where faith has never shone.What lands pass I?Whose kingdom see?There, in the land of minds,And there alone, I findThe real America, the living India;The beauties and the barren tractsOf nations all, of souls all.Yet diverse though this kingdom be.There lives here but One Reality.Three thousand miles of land 1 traveled not.*Paramahansaji wrote these verses while riding in a car through the countrysidenear Denver, Colorado.But through three thousand miles of mindswas brought. I find writ And well knit In outer scenes — Fields, gardens,cities, shops — The thought vibrations of those myriad minds. How oft men pass,unheeding, all the beauties Of familiar paths, and sheltering trees; Inblindness they roam In the garden of hearts. In them I long to start A visionnew: Of Beauty, eternal and true.VARIETYI sought for twins, But could not find. I search my mind; No twins I've seen.They seem alike —Man and man, beast and brute —Yet no faces two are like;Ne'er the same song sang the lute.Thy debut, O Eternity,Was limitless in its diversity —To that Deity of the New in thingsMy spirit homage sings.Since ne'er two hearts are same, I bow to each new form and name. Varietycomplete. Through patterns infinite.I wish that I were you and he.And all at once this changing meWould be whate'er I'd be.Like donning robes of newer kinds —If I could wear at will all terrene minds.Then would I flash forth varied smiles,Or languorous walk in sorrow robed,Or charm with sparkling wilesTo time beguile;Or march with martial songs,To right all worldly wrongs;Or wield a powerful prophet mindAnd into dust earth's sorrows grind.Or with a youthful hermit's heartI'd scatter love and strength impart.I'd wear each heartAnd don each will and smile, and spend my pelfTo try all noble minds and thoughts.And take what suits myself.With brain-bom nixes.With will'o'-the-wisp hopesAnd mental-marsh marauding pixies.With every elfin thoughtThat timid treads on mindI'd friendship find.My spirit clingsTo the new in things—I would not taste the same nectar.Though twice I drink from the immortals' jar.Thy presence, O Eternity, Show Thou in endless variety;Yet change not me —Though various my costumes be.Keep me the humble same, Whatever be my name; And let me watch myself Inchangeless mirror of my Self.Thou and I, our dress will change Yet Thou and I will never change.ON COMING TO THE NEW-OLD LAND-AMERICASleeping memories,Of friends once more to be,Did greet me — sailing o'er the sea—Sensing my coming.The Pilgrim Land to adore.The distant sleeping shore Lay in the twinkling night, Dim through the vanishedlight. The breeze wafted strong;Strange thoughtsMy brain did throng,Hopes sweet and richly wrought.A raven-winged gloom did perch On portals of my mind, to search My soul, mystrength to awe;But then with joy what crowds I saw.Of phantom friendsNow come to lendTheir cheer.And end my fear!YOGODA DREAM HERMITAGE-A DREAM DROPPED FROM HEAVENA vision of yore — of incarnations before —Of a dream-bud retreatGrew in the garden of my soul.For ages 'twas caressed,By sun-warm breeze of His blessings blessed,Until in this life,Away from all strife.Beyond noises' reach.On Encinitas' mountain-beachThat dream-bud blossomed true.A dream of silent restDropped down from Heaven's breast.Through magic touch of one, most blessed of mine!Beloved Saint Lynn* divine.The muted mystery fragrance of this flower-home Long midst evolving cosmicdreams did roam. At last it came wafting — enchanting, entrancing— Down thearches of the ancient years; And then a glimpse, through vaporous joyous tears,Leading me to search the golden California coast, here and there —* Mr. James J.

An exalted disciple of Paramahansaji, he later receivedfrom his guru the monastic title and name, Rajarsi Janakananda.North, east, west, south — everywhere.Divine Mother's whispered callThen summoned me to sea-cliff bold — a motionlessmountain-liner tall— With decks of rocks and caves, and many a lacy tree —Jutting out to sea. Anchored forever By sands of silver.Seated on sandy mound.Surf-tapestried opal ocean 'round —Ecstatic, heaven-bound —Like a diamond-flash, this retreat I foundGlistening on the screenOf my forehead's Spirit-Eye unseen.picture12 [images/picture12.jpg].^-:*fh^Divine Mother asked me to look and seeIf I could find Her close by the hills of Elsinore.*But now 1 shall seek Her no moreIn any other sea-fenced mountain core;For Dame Divinity I found reigningWithin, without, everywhere — bliss-showersraining — By enrapturing Encinitas' elysian shore.* Prompted by the inner vision that he would someday have an ashram near thesea, Paramahansaji had in earlier years searched near Lake Elsinore for theright place to build a hermitage. However, the Encinitas bluff overlooking thesea had remained his favorite place of meditation, and it was for this reasonthat Rajarsi chose this spot for construction of Paramahansajis \"dreamhermitage.\"INVISIBLE MOTHER0 Thou Mother of all,Be Thou consciously receptive to my prayers. All that I know, I know throughThee; And Thou knowest all I know. So Thou knowest my prayers. Knowing Thee,feeling Thee constantly,1 know Thou art I, I am Thou.The little wavelet of me has vanished in Thee.Thou alone didst existBefore Thy maya waves appeared;And Thou alone dost exist now, and ever shall-Naught is, that is not Thee.Formless, impersonal Thou art;The Unseen, omnipresent.But I want to know Thee also, and forever,As personal.In the gaze of my devotion I behold Thee:Sometimes as Krishna,Sometimes as Christ,Personal, visible — imprisonedIn the little formHidden within the temple of my love.O Mother Invisible, as Thou didst freeze Thine unseen InfinitudeInto the sea of cosmic finitude,Do Thou appear to meIn visible, living form,That I may adore and serve Thee.I want to see Thee, the Ocean of Life,With and without Thy ripples o{ finite creation.O Creator of all things, I want to worship TheeAs both personal and impersonal.ONE FRIENDMany clouds do race to hide Thee — Of friends and wealth and fame — And yetthrough mist of tears I see Appear Thy Golden Name. Each time my father, mother,friends Do loudly claim they did me tend, I wake from sleep to sweetly hear ThatThou alone didst help me here.TWO BLACK EYESWhen my brother or my teacherStormed at me,In the haven of my mothers two black eyesI found my retreat.She died —And I cried —And I sought those lost two eyes everywhere.I searched in the stars,Until, bedimmed by my tears,They twinkled black eyes everywhere.But they were not those that I lost!There were many black eyesThat sought to mother me.But they were not those that I loved!Looking, searching for her everywhere,I found my Divine Mother;And in Her loveI found my mothers love;And in Her omnipresent eyes,I found those lost two black eyes.MY COSMIC MOTHER'S FACEFairy dream faces, like fresh flowers,May bloom in the vase of my gaze for my soulto see; But the Face that vanished behind space Cannot be replaced by any ofthese.There are faces of transcendent beauty. Faces of exquisite charm, faces tenderand true; There are faces of sweetness and wisdom, But there's none like theface of You.There are faces tainted by fires of lust. Faces the wise cannot fathom, faces achildcannot trust. There are faces o{ beauty, steeped in glorythrough and through; But, O Cosmic Mother, they are dim beside You.There's the violet, the lily, the lotus, the rose; Fragrant flower-facesblooming under the snows; There are faces of stars, and the moonand the sun, But for me there's One Face evermore, only one.After my search through aeons unnumbered. The never-ceasing streamlets of mydreams Have melted in Thy silver ocean-face,Where smiling love forever softly gleams.Countless silver rays of living beauties Have melted into one transcendent grace— The beauties of a million, million ages — To make, at last. Thine omnipresentface.Without Thy face, there is no light for me In all the unplumbed depths of landor sea; Thy beauty-rays are rainbowed over all Eternity, while planets rise andfall.On the lips of laughter, on roses in the dawn.

In the deep crystal pool that is my heart,I see Thine omnipresence trapped for me — Of my own self forevermore a part.As 1, awakening, pass through gates of light.

It is the thirst of the rose to drink the sunrays Andblush red with life. 'Tis the promptings of the mother earth To feed her milk tothe tender, thirsty roots. And to nurse all life. It is the urge of the sun Tokeep all things alive.Love is the unseen craving of the Mother DivineThat took the protecting father-form,And that feeds helpless mouthsWith milk of mothers tenderness.It is the babies' sweetness,Coaxing the rain of parental sympathyTo shower upon them.It is the lover's unenslaved surrender to the belovedTo serve and solace.It is the elixir of friendship,Reviving broken and bruised souls.It is the martyr's zeal to shed his bloodFor the well-beloved fatherland.It is the ineffable, silent call of the heart to anotherheart. It is the God-drunk poet's heartaches For every creature's groans.Love is to enjoy the family rose of petal-beings,And thence to move to spacious fields —Passing by portals of social, national, internationalsympathy. On to the limitless Cosmic Home — To gaze with looks of wonderment,And to serve all that lives, still or moving. This is to know what love is. Heknows who lives it.Love is evolution's ameliorative callTo the far-strayed sonsTo return to Perfection's home.It is the call of the beauty-robed onesTo worship the great Beauty.It is the call of GodThrough silent intelligencesAnd starbursts of feelings.Love is the HeavenToward which the flowers, rivers, nations, atoms, creatures — you and IAre rushing by the straight path of action right, Or winding laboriously onerrors path, All to reach haven there at last.A MILK-WHITE SAILA milk-white, tiny sailSkims fast across my sea; I wail.The threatening storm to see.But swift my bark glides free, toward the lee;So near the Shore,'Tis safe from tempest's angry roar.picture14 [images/picture14.jpg]picture15 [images/picture15.jpg]picture16 [images/picture16.jpg]LUTHER BURBANKBeatific Burbank!The great reformer Luther, thou art,Of living plants and flowers of every mood—The tender ones, the stubborn-growing ones.Or cactus rude.Thy peaceful waysThe cruel cactus took:Its armor of thorns forsook,And learned to sacrifice its meat For all to eat.Eight-score years it took the hard-shelledstubborn walnut tree to fully grow; Thy care did soft:en its shell and taught itseven-score years to throw.The flowerlike smile upon thy faceTells thou wert nurtured at Natures breast,Bedecked with petals' lace.I saw theeAs a God-grown mental lotus-flower, Opening tenderly To cast the beauty raysOf thy plant knowledge — its supreme ways — On thy fellow man;And also turning gently to the mighty Invisible Sun That lights little plants,distant stars, the bursting bubble, thee and me and man.Thou didst not ask, \"Who art thou?\" But understood my speaking heart. Our soulstouched, and we saw We had one goal, one task, one law: By knowledge to breakThe walls of dogma dark.On the Ocean s surface is diversity;Beneath lie all the waves in Unity.We both dived deep:Thou, through living waves of plants,And I through waves of human minds.We found we met beneath.As all deep divers may,In the vast expanse of Unity;In the great Truth-sea.Thou dost dread isms and dogmas And I all man-made false enigmas. We \"outcasts\"know but one bright Truth-made path of light.Men go not in;That's why they say,\"He's far away, oh, far away.\"He dost not hide from us,But we from Him.Let's rush.Within let's go —Lo!

Is it the spouting of love founts together To strengthen the rush oflove on droughty souls? Is it the one rose grown 'twixt twin mind-branchlets Ofone compassionate stem? Is it the one thinking in two bodies?Or is friendship like two strong stallions, Disparate in color and mien, Pullingthe chariot of life together To the one Goal, with one mind-sight?Is friendship founded on equalities or inequalities?Is it built on diverse stones of differences?Is friendship unthinking agreement—The hand-in-hand blind walking of two souls,Foolishly rejoicing in their united folly.Falling at last into pits of disillusionment?Friendship is noble, fruitful, holy — When two separate souls march indifference Yet in harmony; agreeing and disagreeing. Glowingly improvingdiversely,With a common longing to find solace in true pleasure.When ne'er the lover seeksSelf-comfort at cost of the one beloved,Then, in that garden of selflessness.Fragrant friendship perfectly flowers.For friendship is a hybrid, bom of two souls —The blended fragrance of two unlike flowersBlown together in love's caressing breeze.Friendship is bom from the very core Of secret inexplicable likings. Friendshipis the fountain of true feelings. It grows in both likeness and difference.Friendship sleeps or dies in familiarity, And decays in lusts of narrow-eyedselves. Friendship grows tall and sturdy In the soil of oneness in body, mind,and soul.Demands, deceptions, sordid sense of possession, Courtesy's lack, narrowself-love, suspicion. Thoughtless, sharp-pointed, piercing words — Cankers,these, which eat at the heart of friendship.Ah, friendship — flowering, heaven-bom plant! Nurtured art thou in the soil ofmeasureless love, In the seeking of soul progress togetherBy two who would smooth the way, each forthe other. Watered art thou by attentions of affection And the tender dews ofinner and outer sweetness Of the selfless heart's inmost devotion.Ah, friendship! where thy soul-bom flowers fall, There, on that sacred shrine offragrance, The Friend of all friends craves to come, and to remain.MY KINSMENIn spacious hall of trance,Aglow with million dazzling lights,Tapestried with snowy cloud,I spied my kinsmen all — the lowly, proud.The banquet great with music swelled, The drum of Aum* in measure fell.

Thecountless mute or noisy guests Observed Dame Nature's feast with zest.The tiny-eyed and shiny sands.

S7The green-attired friends I know, With rose and lily buds aglow; I once adorneda kingly breast — Lost life; returned to mother dust.I know the ruby's red breast dear, My blood in it once flowed so clear; I smiledin diamonds, gleaming bright, I danced in roentgen rays of light.A ray of friendship from my heart. In diamond and ruby joy did start; The brightone smiled, the ruby wept, To meet their long-lost friend at last.The soul of gold in yellow gown, The soul of silver in white robe shone,Bestowed on me maternal smiles That told they knew me long erewhile.The leafy fingers, arms outspread. Caressed me when a tiny bird. And fed me withambrosial fruit That drew its life from immortal root.The lark, the cuckoo, the pheasant sweet, The deer, the lamb, the lion great,The shark and monsters of the sea, In love and peace all greeted me.When first the atoms and Stardust sprang, When Vedas, Bible, Koran sang, Ijoined each choir; their long-past thrilling songs Still echo in my soul inaccents strong.1AM HE Based on Swami Shankara's chantNo birth, no death, no caste have 1;Father, mother, have I none:I am He, 1 am He — blessed Spirit, I am He!Mind, nor intellect, nor ego, feeling;Sky, nor earth, nor metals am I:I am He, I am He — blessed Spirit, I am He!Not prana, or its vital currents five,Nor the quintuple sheaths of wisdom traits andbody-stuff,* Nor flesh, or senses that enthrall, Nor ether, fire, or air withal— am I.

In this poetic rendering, he makes a comparisonbetween his external perception of the beauty of the aurora and the glory andexpansion of his internal state of samadhi, or God-consciousness.And spread, tremblingly, lighting The dark vapors of mind. Thou matchless loneimitator of all these — O Aurora!Spreader of light and joy o'er cloudy hearts, Reminder, thou, of bursting,glowing light within my forehead!From the left and right extreme, invisible lamps Threw sudden iridescent red orblue sky-kissingsearchlights, Spouting ethereal mystic flames, Which joyfully bounded andvanished in theEternal Ray. Ever-burning radium, thou, Aurora!My inner fountain of strange colors Flooded my mental sky, Illumining the opaquedarkness Behind which the Light of all lights hides. A vision it was, ofever-changing, rolling,molten light, Coaxing the stars, trees, water, earth, andmatter, all To melt their grossness And become the Cosmic Light.Aurora, there is hope.For I shall liquefy in my samadhi's fireAll grossness of my mortal being,And all creation's dust.Matter shall change to light;Darkness will burst into atoms of leaping fire.My little soul will breathe with the EternalBreath — With the birth of each breath, new solarsystems will be bom; And as each breath of eternity escapes from me, Many auniverse will cease to breathe. The feeling bounded by the body will fly free Tofeel the universe. No more shall I clasp but a little clod; In my bosom I shallbear the burden Of the twinkling atomic vapors of nebulae, Shining stars,planets, and all living things. For 1 am the Life, And my body is the universe.Smaller am I than all little things made — I can hide behind a speck of electron— And bigger am I than the sphere in which thecosmos breathes. I am the Life that shattered its confines of littleness Tobecome the infinite bigness of all things.I am the most subtle — the subtlest of forcesis gross enough to hide me — Yet everything speaks of me. I wake with the dawn,I exercise my vital muscular rays in the sun;I sleep in the night,Or oft peep through the twinkling lights in thedarkness. I smile in the moon, I heave in the ocean. I paint and wipe away Thepictures on the canvas of the sky. I make the dewdrop, and conjure the flowerswith my invisible wand. I whistle in the canaries and sing in thenightingales. I melt and sigh in human breasts. I whisper through conscience. Iroar in the thunder. I work in the noisy wheels of factories. And I play hideand seek with the sky, stars,clouds, and waters, As the mystic light of the aurora.SAMADHI*Vanished are the veils of light and shade,Lifted the vapors of sorrow,Sailed away the dawn of fleeting joy,Gone the mirage of the senses.Love, hate, health, disease, life and death—Departed, these false shadows on the screenof duality. Waves of laughter, scyllas of sarcasm, whirlpoolsof melancholy. Melting in the vast sea of bliss. Bestilled is the storm of maya* Samadhi, literally, \"to direct together,\" is the state of oneness of humanconsciousness with Cosmic Consciousness in meditation. Being subject torelativity, human consciousness experiences the duality of separateness fromGod. Thus we have the consciousness of the meditator, the act of meditation, andGod (as the object of meditation). The end result of deep, continuous, rightlyperformed meditation is samadhi, the blissful state in which these three factorsbecome one. Just as the wave becomes one with the sea, so the human soulexperiences its identity with Spirit.During the lifetime of Paramahansa Yogananda, this poem was in circulation inmore than one version. All were quite similar, reflecting only minor variationsintroduced by Para-mahansaji. The most familiar rendering has been in print formany years in his Atuobiography of a Yogi. Publication of this volume of Songsof the Soul has provided an appropriate vehicle in which to keep in printanother representative rendering. (Publisher's Note)By the magic wand of intuition deep. The universe, a forgotten dream, lurkssubconsciously, Ready to invade my newly wakened memory divine. I exist withoutthe cosmic shadow. But it could not live bereft of me; As the sea exists withoutthe waves, But they breathe not without the sea. Dreams, wakings, states of deepturiya* sleep, Present, past, future, no more for me. But the ever-present,all-flowing I, I, everywhere. Consciously enjoyable. Beyond the imagination ofall expectancy, Is this, my samadhi state. Planets, stars, Stardust, earth,Volcanic bursts of doomsday cataclysms. Creation's molding furnace. Glaciers ofsilent X-rays, Burning floods of electrons. Thoughts of all men, past, present,future, Every blade of grass, myself and all. Each particle of creation's dust.Anger, greed, good, bad, salvation, lust.* Superconsciousness; the fourth state, beyond waking, dreaming, and deep sleep.Here turiya is used poetically to refer to the glimpse of superconscious peacein the state of deep dreamless sleep.I swallowed up — transmuted themInto one vast ocean of blood of my own one Being!Smoldering joy, oft-puffed by unceasing meditation,Which blinded my tearful eyes,Burst into eten^al flames of bliss,And consumed my tears, my peace, my frame,my all. Thou art I, I am Thou, Knowing, Knower, Known, as One! One tranquilled,unbroken thrill of eternal, living,ever-new peace!Not an unconscious stateOr mental chloroform without wilful return,Samadhi but extends my realm of consciousnessBeyond the limits of my mortal frameTo the boundaries of eternity,Where 1, the Cosmic Sea,Watch the little ego floating in Me.Not a sparrow, nor a grain of sand, fallswithout my sight. All space floats like an iceberg in my mental sea. I am theColossal Container of all things made! By deeper, longer, continuous, thirsty,guru-given meditation. This celestial samadhi is attained. All the mobilemurmurs of atoms are heard; The dark earth, mountains, seas are molten liquid!This flowing sea changes into vapors of nebulae!Aum blows o'er the vapors; they open their veils,Revealing a sea of shining electrons,Till, at the last sound of the cosmic drum.Grosser light vanishes into eternal raysOf all-pervading Cosmic Joy.From Joy we come.For Joy we live.In the sacred Joy we melt.I, the ocean of mind, drink all creation's waves.The four veils of solid, liquid, vapor, light,Lift aright.Myself, in everything,Enters the Great Myself.Gone forever,The fitful, flickering shadows of a mortal memory.Spotless is my mental sky.Below, ahead, and high above.Eternity and I, one united ray.I, a tiny bubble of laughter.Have become the Sea of Mirth Itself.Hello, yonder tree!Thou dost breathe in me, in me.O fast-footed river!Thy shining, meandering quiverDeclares itselfThrough myself;Thou dost shine through me, in me.O huge HimalayaWith snowy sovereign white regalia! In my mind doth rest thy throne — Thy homein me, in me.O ocean endless to the eye!In boundless stretches thou dost lie;But thou to me art small —A tiny drop upon a ball —Thou art in me, in me.O infinite sky!So vast to mortal eye,In some brighter age or dayWhen I'll cast my cares away.My better boat —free, shining, gay-On thee will sailUnto thy shoreTo find, I'm sure.99Thy borderland — in me.O distant heavens! O secret One and angels seven! In my sphere You all I see, Inme, in me, in me!TOO NEARI stood in silence to worship TheeIn Thy temple grand —With blue etheric dome,Lighted by the spangling stars.Shining with the lustrous moon.Tapestried with golden clouds —Where reigns no dogma loud.I prayed and waitedFor Thee to come. I cried—Thou didst not come.I'll wait no more.Nor send my feeble prayer.Footsteps Thine to hear.They are not heard without: In me Thou art — too near.DIVINE LOVE SORROWSThe music of Fritz Kreisler's \"Liebesleid\" inspired Paramahansaji to write thesewords for it.I have been roaming, forsaken by Thee,Who hast seen me groping.Hardly ever answering.I shall be roaming, roaming.Bursting all boundaries of heart,Evermore moving toward Thee,To Thy vast unthrobbing heart.Come Thou to me, O Lord! Oh, come at last to me! Centuries and centuries I havewaited now for Thee. Through endless incarnations I called out for Thy name.Searching by the streamlets Of all my silvery dreams.I knew that Thou must come at lastlb steal the flowers of my heart.In sorrow-thrills I piped my love,I sadly sang my song to Thee.And yet I knew my love would reach Thee,Though many lives I had to wait.On mountain crags of high devotionI sadly sang my song, my song, my song.lOlpicture19 [images/picture19.jpg]MY MOTHER'S EYESWhence came the black-eyed light,Flickering in my life a moment?Whither did it flit away?The twilight of many incarnationsHad glowed in those eyes;Many lights of love dreamsHad met in the bower of those two eyes.And then, only the soulless altar—The lifeless eyes —Remained before me.Thou Secret Queen,From what unknown regionDidst Thou in silence comeTo bewitch the fortress of those eyes?Many a time,By bitter speech and sadness driven,The boat of my life found safetyIn the harbor of those two eyes.And now the cruel death-quake has forever marredThose dream-harboring eyes.Losing the harbor of those eyes,In search I sailed my boatIn the sea of the sky.Threefold sorrow storm-driven,This life-boat of mineHad become motherless!My boat sailed on directionless.In the uncharted regions of the vast sky-seaSeeking those two lost eyesAmong the star-eyed lights.All starry eyesTwinkled black eyesBut they were not thoseI had lost.Merely affection-saturated,Many black eyes called to me,Offering to nurse my motherless sorrow —This orphan life of mine.But none matched the love-call glanceOf the lost two dark eyes.The love of those two black eyesForever had setFrom the region of all black eyesThat I beheld.Seeking the lost two eyesIn birth and death,In life and dreams,And in all the lands of the unknown,At last I foundThe all-pervading Divine MothersCountless black eyes—In space and heart.In earth-cores, in stars.Within and without.Hungrily staring at meFrom everywhere.Seeking and seeking my dead mother,I found the Deathless Mother.The lost love of my earthly motherI found in my Cosmic Mother.Seeking and searching.In Her countless black eyesI found those lost two black eyes.I asked my Mother Divine:\"With ruthless heart,Why didst Thou tear awayThe dazzling diamond of my mothers love From the ring of my heart?\"The cloud voice of Mother DivineBurst through the firmament within:\"Many times have I fed theeThe life-blood of My milkFrom the breasts of many mothers.Your black-eyed mother,Whom you lost awhile,Was none else but Me, only Me.When 1 saw that thy wisdom and cosmic loveHad lost their wayIn the dark jungle of those two eyes,I set afire that alluring darkness.*I stole away those imprisoning two black eyesThat thou might'st be freeTo find those eyesIn My eyes,And in the eyes of all black-eyed mothers;And that thou might'st behold.In all black eyes,Shadows only of My eyes.I broke the finite, dream-made'Thy mother' form of MineThat thou might'st behold Me,Thy Divine Mother,In the form of every soulful womanAnd in My Infinite Cosmic Form.\"* Reference to the custom in India of cremation of the dead.THOU IN MEWhen I smile,Thou dost smile through me;When I cry,In me Thou dost weep.When I wake. Thou greetest me; When I walk. Thou art with me.Thou dost smile and weep.Thou dost wake and walk, like me-My likeness, Thou.But when I dream. Thou art awake; When I stumble. Thou art sure; When I die.Thou art my life.THE GREAT LIGHTLANDI have been roaming in Endlessness In the fire-mist of the great Lightland. Inthat Luminosity I read the meaning of all mysteries Scribbled on the scrolls oftime. I am half-awakenedly Enjoying the dream of earth-life; And while I amdreaming I sip the joysFrom the cup of delicious meditations. O Blessedness,Walk with me in my kingdom Of royal happiness,And keep me from the dream-nightmare of trialsome life.THY HOMECOMINGThis vision I had during an ecstatic state of God-realization. I saw myselfsitting on a little patch of the Milky Way, beholding the vast universe aroundme. As God became manifest, all things that had before seemed inanimate wereconsciously celebrating His homecoming within my con-sciousness — in the mansionof light.God has been banished from your conscioiAsness by igno-ranee. That is why youthink you are circumscribed by a little mortal body; that is why you cannotbehold the universe as it really is, ablaze with the life and joy of Spirit.When I celebrated God's homecoming within my own consciousness, I saw that thewhole cosmos was a part of that realization.Thy mansion of the heavens is lit by perennialauroral displays of mystic lights. Stellar systems arch across the tracklesshighways ofeternity that lead to Thy secret home. Comet-peacocks spread their plumes ofrays anddance in wild delight in Thy garden of manymoons. The planetary dance glides in stately rhythm,awaiting Thy homecoming. I sit on a little patch of the Milky Way and beholdthe glory of Thy kingdom spread round me —endlessly, everywhere. The festivities of the heavens are dazzling withfireworks of shooting stars — hurled across theblue vaults by unseen bands of Thine obedient,devoted forces.Meteorites skip, glow, swoon, and fall to earth — mad with Thy joy.Everybody, everything, every atom, rejoices in proclaiming Thee the uncrownedKing of the Universes.Each day the trees drop flowers in Thine honor, and the skyey vase sends wispsof fire-mist incense to Thee.Candlesticks of heavenly powers hold incandescent stars to light Thy temple.Because Thou didst hide Thyself away — banished by Thy subjects' ignorance — Thymansion of matter has been dark.Now darkness is being dispelled, and all the gloom-drenched chambers in Thydomain of eternity are becoming radiant at the news of Thy return.Heavenly lights have opened their gates. Bonfires of nebulous mists areheralding Thine approach.The steady sentinels o{ sun and moon are patiently waiting for Thy homecoming.And I — I am running wild, dancing in my little body on my little earth, orskimming over the Milky Way, coaxing everything, every atom, every speck ofconsciousness, to open its gates and let Thy light shine through completely,driving darkness forevermore from Thy cosmic kingdom, which without Thee was alonesome wilderness of matter.THE CUP OF ETERNITYThe traveler of the endless track, All weary, thirsty, sore doth seek To quenchthe quenchless mortal thirst, The wordless worry of his heart.He spies a cup — a little orb— And hies to drink with joyful sob. TTien standsaback, the cup sets down; On contents scant his heart doth frown.Yet up he lifts the cup again. But fears his baneful thirst to flame. When,hark! a voice of counsel deep Forbids him this to soil with lip.The cup so small to mundane eye, (Whose depth the wise alone can spy) Dries up,alas, if mortals drink; (Perennial fount, the soulful think.)Now, in the little cup he'll seeTh' unsounded deep of eternity;For ageless hours and endless daysThe ambrosial drink he'll taste and praise.The deathly thirst so fleshly bom Shall parch his soul, oh, ne'er again!The cup he'll drink, but not the bane, To quench his thirst and bliss attain.*And vain would mighty north winds tryCompassions gathered tears to dry.For other thirsting souls he'll weep,And beg them, \"From the cup, drink deep!\"* At first the cup of true bliss seems to possess \"contents scant\" (the quietudeof meditation seems a barren substitute for material interests). But by theexercise of true discrimination and right choice of pleasures, man begins toexperience the illimitable nature of divine joy and to discover the infinitetreasures within the \"little orb\" of his spiritual eye (the \"single eye\"referred to by Christ), the true \"cup of eternity.\"AT THE FOUNTAIN OF SONGDig, dig, yet deeper digThe stony earth for fount of song;Dig, dig, yet deeper dig.The soil of muse's heart along.Some sparkle is seen. Some bubble is heard; 'Tis then unseen — The bubble isdead.The watery sheenAgain doth show;Dig, dig, still deeper e'en.Till the bubble-song again doth grow.I hear the song,I see its bubble-body bright;Yet cannot touch. Oh, how I longTo seize it now,And drink its liquid light!Bleed, O my soul, do amply bleedTo dig yet deeper — dig!To fountain's mystic songMy soul is drawn;In violin tones it playsIn endless lays.Oft I thought, What strains are left to sing?Yet newer songs it dared to bring.I touch the holy fount, rejoice —I drink its bubble voice.My throat's ablaze;I want to drink and drink always.The sphere's aflame — With flaming thirst I came; \"Dig, dig, yet deeper dig,\"I said, \"Though it seems Thou canst not dig.\"I thought, with heart aglow.All, all, I'd drunk this day;But still, I idly looked for more — deep,deep, below. And lo! undrunk, untouched. There the fountain lay.** This poem hints at the indescribable experiences of a yogi as he follows theinner fountain of song: the melodic variations of the sound of the Cosmic Aum —the Word, or great Amen — manifesting in the chakras, or spiritual centers ofconsciousness, within man's spine. The \"stony earth,\" the \"watery sheen,\" andthe \"sphere aflame\" refer respectively to the earth, water, and fire chakras.Once the yogi has transcended these three lower centers, his inward \"digging,\"or deeper meditation, quickly carries him upward through the remaining threechakras — of air, ether, and etheric bliss — to cosmic consciousness.The opening of each chakra reveals ever-new and undreamed-of beauties;overwhelming bliss descends on the persevering devotee. Entering the infinitekingdom of God, he is enthralled by its inexhaustible glories.picture20 [images/picture20.jpg]PIKES PEAKNe'er did I expect to roamOn wheels fourWhere thousand clouds do soar—The dangerous, darksome pathWith tricky winding \"W\" curves that climbedAnd glided secretlyFull fourteen thousand feet above the sea —The home of dark-hued clouds, so gamesome free.That watched with heavy binding vapor-shroudTo cast 'round strangers steps That dared to tread in stealth Their realm ofscenic wealth.And I did swoonTo spy, by light of miser moon,The deep, deep hollow hall of space below —Dimly adorned with weirdsome light, aglowOn pictures of twinkling, sleeping cities;Shadowy trees, leaves inert in resting breeze;And tall soldier-stones, and valleys,Bright in \"illiouette.The moonlight dimDid slowly, strangely change to light of dawn.There stood the temple-observatory,Vacant and solitary.Alas, O Royal Phoebus!Where were thy swarming lovers,As blushing red thou didst bumIn earliest hour of dawn?The test of biting chillDrove all the votaries away.And all was still;I alone was leftWith thee upon the hill.Thou wert aflame.Yet calmer art thou now,With silvery brow,Spreading o'er all sleeping thingsThy wakening glow.They did awake:The trees breathed deep;The streamlets opened twinkling, crystal eyes —All creation rose from sleep.0 Sun, redeemer of darkness! Now I know: All things, all wakened creaturesAre looking in wonderNot at thee, but at the Unseen WonderThat through thy glowMutely thou wantst to show.Where went the cold?Rebuked, it fled, that troublesome chill of old.1 loved the breathless subtle air. So pure and clear.That chokes the grossAnd bums the drossOf those that loveTo worship Thee in breathless state,* oh, far aboveThe roar and din of tipsy senses.* A yogi attains the superconscious state by silencing at will the naturaltumults: thought, heartbeat, and breath. Manifesting his essential being asSpirit, he thus removes all barriers and communes freely with Nature in any ofher myriad forms.There on Pikes PeakI met all minds;I asked the winds,Pursued the rainbow,Begged the pure white clouds(Which sailed unknown so proud)To tell me if they sawHim whom I'd just spied —Whose One Face to see I'd triedMidst bewitching, bewildering, diverse crowdsOf scenic faces.And in joy I cried aloud,\"See Him hideBeneath the beauty tide!\"Another rendition of this poem appears in \"Whispers from Eternity,\" FirstVersion edition. A mriation was set to music, and appears in \"Cosmic Chants. \"Whence, oh, this soundless roar doth come, When drowseth matter's dreary drum?The booming Om* on bliss' shore breaks; All heaven, all earth, all body shakes.Cords bound to flesh are broken all. Vibrations vile do fly and fall; Thehustling heart, the boasting breath No more disturb the yogi's health.The house is lulled in darkness soft, Dim, shiny light is seen aloft,Subconscious dreams have gone to bed; 'Tis then that one doth hear Om's tread.The bumblebee doth hum along. Baby Om, hark! sings his song. Krishna's flute issounding sweet, 'Tis time the watery God to meet.* An alternate transliteration of Aum, the threefold energy of creation,preservation, and destruction.

Resounding everywhere!t Vibration of life energy. The five lower centers in the cerebrospinal axiscontrol the elements in man of earth, water, fire, air, and ether. The vibratoryactivities of each center produce a characteristic sound. In meditation the yogifirst hears the hum, as of a bumblebee, emitted by the earth chakra at the baseof the spine. The water center has a flutelike sound, fire a harplike sound, aira bell-like sound, and ether a sound like the roar of a distant sea. t Thespinal cord, containing the astral centers of life and consciousness thatoutwardly enliven the physical body and inwardly bestow divine awakening.§ A poetic description of the harmonious blending of all the distinctive soundsof the spinal centers with the universal, all-pervading cosmic sound of Om,heard when the mind of the meditating devotee is fixed in the medullary chakraand at the Christ-consciousness (\"Christmas\") center between the eyebrows.THE ROYAL WAYThis ever-trodden path — Where travelers all of earth Do walk in joyous haste Orslothful sorrow's state — I walk and wonder In truth or blunder.The path is cleftTo right and left,In front, behind.Such diverse ways I find.Conundrum enclosed, bewildered am IAs baffling mazes do they lie.Still, they say. There is a royal way For all — the right, the error-wed. Asubway path of ruby red, Which far beneath lies hid. For keen ones' eager eyesto spy; It leads straight on their feet Where all paths do meet.** The \"royal way\" refers to the subtle cerebrospinal axis of man with its sevencenters of spiritual force. On this path \"all paths do meet,\" for theconsciousness of all seekers ultimately follows this way of ascension to attaindivine illumination. The \"subway path of ruby red\" is the muladhara \"lotus,\" orbasic root center whose \"petals\" or rays of light are red-colored. By rightmeditation on God, the devotee opens the muladhara and his consciousness thenrises through the various plexuses until it reaches the highest of all, thesahasrara in the brain. There the devotee attains God-realization.NATURE'S NATUREAway, ye muses, all away!Away with songs of finch and fay.Away the jaundiced sightThat magnifies the firefly's lightTo bonfire bright;That sets ablaze at onceMy musing's dimly burning lamps;That ornaments with rhymesThe penury-stricken looks betimes;That over-clothes the logic-lordWith fancy-swollen words.Away, the partial loveThat 'boldens Nature to sit aboveHer Maker!This day I fasten eyelid doors, With absence wax my ears. With languorous peacecongeal My tongue, my touch, my tears,* That I within may pore Upon the thingsbehind, ahead. In the darkness round me spread. I lock Dame Nature out With allher fickle rout.*Reference to the interiorization of the mind during deep yoga meditation, inwhich the attention is disconnected from sensory distractions and focused on theSpirit within.Somewhere here, In the darkness drear, I myself with cheer My course will steerIn the path E'er sought by all: Its magnet call I hear.Not here, not here,Apollo would his burning chariot steer;Nor Diana dare to peepInto the sacred silence deep.Not here, not here.Nor far or nearCan mounts or rebel wavesE'er make me full of fear;Nor evermoreTheir dreadful grandeur to adore.Not here, not here,The soft capricious wiles of flowers;Nor swarming storm clouds' sweeping terror.Dishevelling the treesAnd light-haired skies;Nor doomsday's thunderous roar.Dismantling earth and stars—The cosmic beauties all to mar—Not Nature's murderous mutiny, Nor man's exploding destiny Can touch me here.Not here, not here: Through mind's strong iron bars, Not gods or goblins, men ornature, Without my pass dare enter.I look behind, ahead—On naught but darkness tread.In wrath I strike, and set the dark ablazeWith the immortal spark of thought,By friction-process broughtOf concentrationAnd distraction.The darkness bumsWith a million tongues;And now I spyAll past, all distant things, as nigh.I smile sereneAs I expose to gaze.In wisdom's brilliant blaze.All charms of the Hidden Home Unseen:The Home of Nature's birth,The planets' moulding hearth.The factory whence all forms or fairies start.The bards, colossal minds, and hearts.The gods and all, And all, and all!Away, awayWith all the lightsome lays! Oh, now will I portray In humble way,And try to lisp, if only in half-truths. Of wordless charms of Thee Unseen, Towhom Dame Nature owes her nature and her sheen.AT \"SUL MONTE\"Paramahansaji dedicated this poem to Amelita Galli-Curci and her husband, HomerSamuels, after a visit to \"Sul Monte,\" their home in the Catskills.They say that He's remote, unseen,Austere, beyond our vision keen;Yet, passing through the tunnel of leavesAnd seeing the hilltop green —A grassy orchid-vase.Adorned with little doll-sized temple,Artistic, grand, yet simple;Hanging, it seemed, from the big skyey roofHigh amidst the clouds; aloofFrom din and uproars loud0{ aimless rushing crowd —I asked myself:Who made this? Who made that?And found my answersFrom His servitors,Oh, everywhere, oh, everywhere!The painted screens of varying light and shadeDid drop, go up, or fade;The changing, charming scenic playersDid speak of Him, did entertain, and disappear.Rows of motley costumed leaves did standAnd dance in tune with playing breezeOr fitful thunder-band.picture21 [images/picture21.jpg]Turbaned soldier-trees —Serious, majestic, grim —Emerging from colossal mountain-castlesStood in the distance dimTo bold declare:\"Hark, He's very close!

And softly humming motor-noise we rode The Mohawk Trail where Adam lies.*Unlike some other joyful ridesWhen mind, with sameness dulled, did oft abideThe time and common scenes in passive mood.My mind was full and bright and good.A strange unknown, unthought, new thrill.Did o'er me steal in soothing sweep so still.I raced the wind, and scattered smilesThat played with sunshine, spread for miles.My secret-hoarded joy in vault of soul Extravagantly did 1 spend withal. Topurchase Nature's e're new gaudy scenes Shown by hasty, racing peddlerwindshield screen. My spirit, too long hemmed in city's narrow walls, Once morewas free; all nature sent a joyous call — The waving leaves of trees, thebabbling rill. Impatient wind, the smiling sky, and patient hill.* North Adams (Massachusetts), a town at the end of the Mohawk Trail. In a playon this name, Paramahansaji alludes indirectly to the beautiful countryside,like the Eden enjoyed by the primal Adam.WHISPERSThe leaves do sigh;They cannot speakOf the One on high.The birds do sing;They cannot sayWhat in their bosoms springs.The beasts do howlWith muffled soul;They never can say nighWhat in their feelings lies.Since I can sing or say or cry,Mightily will I tryTo pour out whispers Thine — all and each-That to hearts do softly reach.The stanza next to the last was set to music by Paramahansaji for his \"CosmicChants.\"Come! Listen to my soul-song!The darkness burst,And Thy descending shafts of lightPierced the heart of gloomTo listen to my soul song.Though hidden Thou art Behind the screen of my eyes, Thou dost remain, unseen,To listen to my soul song.Burst the veils! Burst the blue! Burst all lights! And come to me as Thou art,To listen to my soul song.Burst my senses and my mind! Burst my heart and feeling! Burst my silence and mysoul To listen to my soul song.In the breeze I feel Thy touch;In the sun.

Washington: at his Guru'shermitage in Seram-pore, and later, on a trip with Sri Yukteswar, in Kashmir.THY SECRET THRONEBehind the screenOf all things seen,How dost Thou hide —Elude the tideOf marching human eyes,That 'round Thee rushing hies?'Twill not be longEre will be knownThy hiding place,By children with Thine eyes and grace.Sage science splitsEach atom knitBy Thee, to find apaceThy hiding place.Is heart of atom, electron,Thy secret throne?Deep we boreTo find Thine art and loreOf doings all sublime.Hidden betimes.Yet Thine abodeSeems far, remote;'Tis still to findWith deeper mind.THY CRUEL SILENCEI prayed to Thee,But Thou wert mute.At Thy door I knocked;Thou answered not.I gave my tearsTo soft'n Thy heart;In cruel silenceDidst Thou watch.But now I've learnedThe way to earnAttention Thine:I'll weep and prayUnceasingly —In cruel silence, if need be-Till time is old,And earth grows cold;Till life doth fail.Till body fall.Then if Thou speakest,And dost wish me peace,Still will I pray and weep —In cruel silence deep.ETERNITYOh, will that day arriveWhen I shall ceaselessly ask — yea, driveEternal questions into Thine ear,0 Eternity! and have solutionHow weak weeds grow and stand unbent,Unshaken 'neath the trampling current.How the storm wrecks titanic things;Uproots the trees.And quick disturbs the mighty seas.How the first spark blinked; how the first tree.The first goldfish, the first bluebird so free,And the first crooning baby,Into this wonder-house to visit,Made their grand entry.They come, I see;Their growth alone I watch.Thy cosmic moulding Hand, That secret works on land and sea,1 wish to seize, O Eternity!THE HART OF HEAVEN Inspired by Francis Thompsons \"The Houryi of Heaven\"Like a wild, cruel hunter,Sure of my prey,I chased the Heavenly HartThrough forests of dark desires,Mazes of passing pleasures.Down corridors of ignoranceI raced for Him — the Hart of Heaven.Farther, farther He fled.Driven by fear of meEquipped with spears of selfishness.And earth echoed, as He fled: \"I am more fleet. Swifter than thy feet. Thy fierypassion's greed That vainly rushes at Me. None capture Me Who Me affright Andthus make wise.\"Pursuing the Deer,I flew the heavenly plane of prayer;But crashed to earth—By restlessness felled.The Deer yet fled,And Its echoing voice said:\"Fleeter am IThan the noisy plane of prayer.Thy loud-tongued hollow wordsBut startled meIn the earliest hour of the chase.Beyond thy sight I race!\"My spears, my hunting dogs, my plane I left;Stealthily I crept,Holding firm my dart of concentration —All sudden, lo!I spied the Hart of Heaven grazing peacefully.Fearless before me.I swift took aim and shot.But my hand with unsteadiness shook.The Deer bounded;And earth resounded:\"Without devotion.Thou art a poor, poor marksman!\"Again and yet again I shotAt the Heavenly Hart,But easily It fled, with echoing cry:\"Beyond the range of mental dart —O far beyond — am I!\"In despair, I gave up the chase:Then, led by intuition strange, and curiouswondering, I found a secret lair of love in me, And strolled deep within. Therecame my Hart of Heaven — lo! Willingly entering in.Eager, devoted, steadily I shot again, again, With concentration-dart; Afraidthe Deer might flee anew. Ofttimes I missed; yet It stirred not, Moved not, flednot. Finally, my Heavenly Hart, Now wounded by devotion's dart. Lay gasping,dying, in me.Its vanishing breath—Singing throughout the silent earth —Echoed within me:\"None can seize MeSave with help of Mine,Save only Mine!I am thine! Receive Me!\"HIu^^-'-'^'l^picture22 [images/picture22.jpg]\\%m--THE GRAND CANYON OF THE COLORADOWho reigns in this canyon,Deep and grand with measureless space —The sun or moon?They jealously vieTo drive away with swiftnessThe demon of darkness,And try to wake the sleeping motley splendorThat decorates in gloryThe crowded temple-peaks, both young and hoary.These shrines, though different, yet in unisonDo welcome all to see the One;E'en as the temples of Shiva and RamaIn silence worship the one Brahma.*Who reigns here?The One — with different shapes and namesTo inspire 'All eyes, all minds, all sects, all creeds,As suits their wide aesthetic needs;And cause them to bow in awe and reverenceTo the Spirit of VastnessThat here reigns.* Three towering peaks (about 8,000 ft.), so named in 1882 by Clarence Dutton ofthe U.S. Geological Survey because of their resemblance to Hindu temples.THE HARVESTDrawn by joy sublime,I watch each harvest time,When furrowed sky glows red with ripe sunbeams;But never have I found Thy ploughing teams.The oriole's glowing painted breast is shown.And yet Thy brush, O Painter, ne'er is known!The North Star timely leaps.Nocturnal watch unfailing keeps;Thy house the sun and seasons supervise.Yet Thou, O Master, seemest not to rise!LEAVE THY VOW OF SILENCEBlossoms come and seasons change;They all speak of Thee.The moon slightly shows Thy smile;The sun holds Thy lamp of life.In the arteries of leavesI see Thy blood flowing.In every thought of mineThy heart is beating loud.Throw off Thy shroud of nature —Wake from Thy sleep, O Lord.I have been swimming for Thee In the sea of my tears. When wilt Thou talk to me,Leaving Thy vow of silence? Wake! Wake! from Thy sleep — Speak to me now, OLord.MYSTERYBurst, inky cloud, do burst; Fling open thy fathomless gloom! In thy darkchamber must A million mysteries loom.Heartless, staring sky!Make quick replyTo aching query of my straining eye;Show what thou hidest, and why.The ceaseless surging thoughts Go mocking, dancing by, I long to know their lot.Someone did throw me free To battle all alone in this rough sea. Rudderless Idrift; stranded on shoals, My boat I could not shift.I'll burst the clouds, I'll clear the shoals;I'll rip the sky in twain,I'll break my heart.With questions crush my brain.I'll ask and pray,Will beg or steal.To find the friends long stolen away —To know their woe or weal.This wondrous day,Stage set for playBy Unseen Hand;The players dropFrom no-mans land,Then vanish all away.With changing scenes of birth and death, The drama's on. The actors play anon.Yet know not why they playThis glorious day.OCEANIC PRESENCEAs I sailed away from You on the river of desire, Suddenly I found myselflaunched on Youroceanic presence. Though I ran away from You through the fogof incarnations, I arrived at the threshold of Your all-pervadingtemple. In the sphere of thought I flew — North, south, east, west;But the net of Your omnipresence surrounded me. Riding the wings of swiftestelectrons, 1 dived below, into the bowels of eternity. Only to find You there.Above, into eternity's heart 1 zoomed; But no matter how far I went. You stoodalways ahead of me. In desperation, unable to flee from You, I plunged to theeast, to the west, in eternity'schasms. And there I fell in Your lap. At last, with the dynamite of my will, Iexploded the airship of my self, my thoughts,my love, Into countless dust specks of fading life. Floating everywhere, intoall things — And found that I slept in Your bosom.Because I kept my own eyes closed,I thought I was hiding from You;But before Your watchful eyes, ever-present am 1.Open my eyes that 1 may behold You,Looking at me from all sides, everywhere.For though 1 may try to hide from You,and think I do; Wherever 1 am, there are You.FLIGHT! An experience in samadhiI closed my eyes and saw the skiesOf dim opalescent infinity spread round me.The grey sky-chariot of the dawn of awakening,Displaying searchlight eyes,Came and took me away.I zoomed through space.Boring through the ether of mystery.I passed through age-hidden spiral nebulae.Willy-nilly I went on and on,Left, right, north, south, above and below.I found no landing.I went through many tailspins of distractions,But I spun through limitlessness.I whirled through an eternal furnace of lights.At last, bit by bit, my plane meltedIn that transmuting flame;And then, bit by bit, my body meltedIn that purifying fire.Bit by bit my thoughts melted —My feelings became pure liquid light.IN THE LAND OF DREAMSEach night, as my spirit roamsIn spheres of slumber vast,I become a hermit and renounceMy title, body-form, possessions, creeds —Breaking the self-erected prison wallsOi flesh and earthly limitations.I am an all-pervading Son of God,No longer caged in brittle, dingy clod;Nor tied by tangible cords of birth.Or man-made smallness, social standing.And duty-shadows of earth.There in sleepland's ether eternal,I have no country, no homeland dear;Nor am I Hindu or Christian seer;Nor Occidental nor Oriental,Race-bound behind the bars of inheritance.In dreamland's limitless acres.My spirit revels in freedom—Its only religion freedom —Gypsying gaily there.Pilfering joy from everywhere.No lordling god o'ershadows me —None but Myself to rule myself.Behold, the slave-man hath become the god!The sleeping mortal, the awakened deathless Lord!picture23 [images/picture23.jpg]An unseen, unheard god am I, Drinking, breathing gladness; Gliding in wingedglory Through the endless land! Free from haunting fears. Or possible crash andshattered skull: No solids there to give me hurt. No liquids to drown me deep;No vile, dank vapors to choke me, No fire my unseen form to bum. Free from thememory, e'en, 0( a fragile body-dream,O'er infinite space am I spread.All things am 11How, then, could aughtDare injure me?The heart of the big MyselfWould breakIf it should strikeThe little myself.Unknown to others, but known to Myself,I wake and walk and dream.Eat and drink and glide in Joy.I Myself am the Joy I sought —The Joy that all do seek.So little, ah, so finite, I,When I dreamt in my sleepy wakefulness.Boundless big am I, awakeIn my sleepless wakefulness!AT THE ROOTS OF ETERNITYWith sailing clouds and plunging breeze, With singing leaves and youthfulstorms,capricious seas, With bounding planet-balls — all these — Absorbed, I wildlyplay. Forgetful of Thee; but not alway. At close of day My eager hands I lay AtThy hidden roots,O Eternity, To seize the nectar-loot That when tapped flows free.THE SPELLAh, this old, old nectar of night,Brewed below by sun-god bright —Let every little fleshly cellThat's tired and thirsty drink it well;By soothing spell of sleep ejectAll aches that heart and brain infect.That spell, quick marching on. Falls o'er me now, so warm, And robs my mind Oflinked thoughts, to bind Me prisoner in its charm.A MIRROR NEWI bring to youA mirror new —A glass of introspection clear,That illusion shows, and sooty fearThat spots thy mind.Thou wilt also find This mirror newWould loyal show, all true.The \"Inner You\" That's veiled in flesh And never doth appear.Each night consult afresh thy mirror-friend; And ere the sorcerer Sleep dothcall, Make use to see thyself withal — And clear away Dust of that day.EVASIONWhene'er I almost see Thee,Thou dost vanish suddenly.When Thou art nearly trapped in me,I look, and find Thee gone.E'en when I think I've seized Thee,Thou dost e'er escape.How long this hide-and-seek and play?I'm weary with the toil of day.Still, I may brook this game — evasion Thine —If 'tis for but a tiny flash of time;That in the end I clear may seeThy face! with doubled joy and mind that's free.METHOUGHT I HEARD A VOICEWhile singing by the rill My voice did softly thrill With echoes of my thoughtBy fancies brought.I wandered in my playOn faerie field away;And stopped to muse, rejoice —Methought I heard a Voice!The flowers of that field, Of wondrous hues, perfumed With essence of the heart,did yield Delicious joys undreamed.Behind the thin bright veiling Of blossom-scented feelings, I saw a fitful flash— Some Glistening Presence rush!I tiptoe stood. Listening, watching; I poured my heart, Listening, watching.I AM HEREAlone I roamed by the oceans shore, And watchedThe wrestling waves in brawling roar— Alive with Thine own restless life, Thineangry mood in ripply quiver— Until Thy wrathful vastness made me shiver And turnaway from nature's heated strife. And thenA kindly, spreading sentinel tree Waved friendly arms to comfort me — Consolingme with gentler look sublime. Its swaying leaves in tender lullaby-rhyme.Singing a message that I knew was Thine. AboveI saw the gaugeless, mystic sky; And, childlike, in the valley dim I sought topry At Thee, and to play with Thee. But in vain I sought Thy body, hiding there.Cloud-robed, foam-sprayed, leaf-garlanded— Too rare for mortal eyes to see, orears to hear. And yet,I knew that Thou wert always near. As if to play at hide-and-seek with me.Receding when I almost touched Thee, Groping to find Thee through the maddeningfold Of ignorance dark — old as time is old. At last,picture24 [images/picture24.jpg]i^^.,-if^^^KS-J■^n^^-\"^I ceased my search in dim despair, My search for Thee! O Thou Royal Sly Eluder!... everywhere, Yet seeming nowhere... lost in unplumbed space. Where none mayclasp Thee or behold Thy face! In haste,I ceased my fruitless seach and hied away fromThee! Still, still no answer from the wrathful sea, And only whispers from thefriendly tree; Just silence from the limitless blue sky — Silence from valleylow and mountain high! Like a hurt child, within the depths of me I hid andsulked — no longer seeking Thee. When lo!Unheralded, some Unseen Hand Suddenly snatched away the all-black band That hadso blinded me with fold on fold. No longer weary, filled with strength untold, Istood, and watched again A laughing sea, instead of wrathful roars, A gay, gladworld, with mystically opened doors. With only mists of dreams between. Someonebeside me stood unseen — And whispered to me, cool and clear:\"Hello, playmate! I am here!\"MY PRISONERLong didst Thou hideBeneath the static of my restless thoughts;Long didst Thou fleeIn the chambers of eerie ether.At last I hunted Thee down In quiet desert-dunes Of my desirelessness.Fastened with strong cords of devotion, Thou art my Prisoner.I'll lock TheeIn the cell of silence,Secure behind bars of my closed eyes.Within the temple of my dreams.Beloved Captive,I'll hide TheeIn a bower of caresses.Precious Prisoner, I'll enshrine Thee On the altar of my secret songs.Infinite Personage, I'll cloister TheeBehind strong walls of my undying love.I AM LONELY NO MOREI am not lonely in the chamber of solitude,For Thou art always there.I am lonely amidst an uproarious crowd,In which Thy silence slips awayLike a startled, fast-footed, large-eyed deer.When 1 had found Thee not,I was lonely in a crowd of thoughtsAnd solitary in the chamber of myself, thinking:\"Alone I came from the unknownAnd alone 1 must depart into the unknown.\"Finding Thee, I have learnedTo make mine own Thee alone.On the lonely wayside of lifeOr on its crowded thoroughfare.For now I behold the unseen linksIn front of and behind this life,Hidden in post-mortem and prenatal chambers.From my Known-One I came.In my Known-One I live.In my Known-One finally I'll dive.Away from Myself I was lonely —But since my little self met the big Self,I am lonely no more.SOME TREASURE OF MY OWNWhatever I sought to give YouI found was Yours.So I took away the flowers from the altar,And snuffed out the candles in the temple,For I would offer You some treasure of my own.Searching on the tract of my heart, lo!Rare perennial plants I found,0{ innate craving for You.You are mine — what joy!And 'tis my free choice to love You as mine.Though love came from You, And was Your gift to me, That love is Yours nolonger, Because You gave it to me. With this love You have given, Belonging nowto me alone, I want to love You.Your gift of love, I know,Is unconditioned by command to love You only-I could have used Your love foreverTo worship just Your gifts.Or to become saturated with the desiresOf a material life.But I will only pick flowers of love From those undying plants of mysoul-craving— Blooming amidst the garden of incarnations — And lay them in thetemple of Your heart; For these alone are mine.Of my own accord I love You;Through my own desire, I prefer You to Your gifts;And I use my free choiceTo offer all my love to You alone — naught else.You must receive what's mine: the love I freely give,Sole treasure of my own.THEY ARE THINEI have nothing to offer Thee,For all things are Thine.I grieve not that I cannot give;For nothing is mine, for nothing is mine.Here I lay at Thy feetMy life, my limbs, my thoughts and speech;For they are Thine, for they are Thine.WHEN I CAST ALL DREAMS AWAYI sipped the sap of each sane pleasure;I exulted in the crushed beauty of sextillion stars;I made a bonfire of all sorrows and basked in theglory blaze; I quaffed the questing love oi all hearts; I mingled paternal,maternal, and fraternal lovetogether, And drank the solacing draught; I squeezed the scriptures for drops ofpeace; I wrung poems from the winepress of Nature; I lifted gems from the mineof thoughts; I stole the sweetness from the honeycombof innocent joys; I read, I smiled, I worked, I planned, I throbbed, Iaspired;But naught was sufficient. Only nightmares of incompleteness. Ever recedingwill-o'-the-wisps of promisedhappiness, Haunted and hastened my heart.But when I cast all dreams away,I found the deep sanctuary of peace.And my soul sang: \"God alone! God alone!\"MY NATIVE LANDThe friendly sky, Inviting shade of banyan tree, The holy Ganges flowing by —How can I forget thee!1 love the waving comOf India's fields so bright,Oh, better than those heav'nly grownBy deathless gods of might!My soul's broad love, by God's command. Was first bom here below. In my ownnative land — On India's sunny soil aglow.I love thy breeze,I love thy moon,I love thy hills and seas;In thee I wish my life to cease.Thou taught'st me first to love The sky, the stars, the God above; So my firsthomage — as 'tis meet — I lay, O India, at thy feet!From thee I now have leamed to see, To love all lands alike as thee. 1 bow tothee, my native land, Thou mother of my love so grand.MY INDIANot where the musk of happiness blows, Nor where darkness and fears never tread;Not in the homes of perpetual smiles, Nor in the heaven of a land of prosperityWould I be bom. If I must put on mortal garb once more.Dread famine may prowl and tear my flesh.Yet would I love to be againIn my Hindustan.A million thieves of diseaseMay try to steal the body's fleeting health;And clouds of fateMay shower scalding drops of searing sorrow-Yet would I there, in India,Love to reappear!Is this love of mine blind sentiment That sees not the pathways of reason? Ah,no! I love India, For there I learned first to love Godand all things beautiful. Some teach to seize the fickle dewdrop, life. Slidingdown the lotus leaf of time; Stubborn hopes are built Around the gilded, brittlebody-bubble. But India taught me to loveThe soul of deathless beauty in the dewdropand the bubble — Not their fragile frames. Her sages taught me to find my Self,Buried beneath the ash heaps 0{ incarnations of ignorance.Through many a land of power, plenty, and science My soul, garbed sometimes asan Oriental, Sometimes as an Occidental, Traveled far and wide. Seeking Itself;At last, in India, to find Itself.Though mortal fires raze all her homesand golden paddy fields. Yet to sleep on her ashes and dream immortality, OIndia, I will be there! The guns of science and matter Have boomed on hershores. Yet she is unconquered. Her soul is free evermore! Her soldier saintsare away, lb rout with realization's ray The bandits of hate, prejudice, andpatriotic selfishness; And to bum the walls of separation dark Between childrenof the One, One Father. The Western brothers by matter's mighthave conquered my land;*^-4'«J:,K.\"picture25 [images/picture25.jpg]Blow, blow aloud, her conch shells all! India now invades with love, To conquertheir souls.Better than Heaven or ArcadiaI love Thee, O my India!And thy love I shall giveTo every brother nation that lives.God made the earth;Man made confining countriesAnd their fancy-frozen boundaries.But with newfound boundless loveI behold the borderland of my IndiaExpanding into the world.Hail, mother of religions, lotus, scenic beauty,and sages! Thy wide doors are open, Welcoming God's true sons through all ages.Where Ganges, woods, Himalayan caves, andmen dream God — I am hallowed; my body touched that sod.GOD! GOD! GOD!From the depths of slumber,As I ascend the spiral stairway of wakefulness,1 whisper:God! God! God!Thou art the food, and when 1 break my fast Of nightly separation from Thee, Itaste Thee, and mentally say: God! God! God!No matter where I go, the spotlight of my mindEver keeps turning on Thee;And in the battle din of activity my silent war-cryis ever: God! God! God!When boisterous storms o( trials shriek And worries howl at me, I drown theirnoises, loudly chanting: God! God! God!When my mind weaves dreams With threads of memories. On that magic cloth I doemboss: God! God! God!Every night, in time of deepest sleep, My peace dreams and calls: Joy! Joy! Joy!And my joy comes singing evermore: God! God! God!In waking, eating, working, dreaming, sleeping, Serving, meditating, chanting,divinely loving. My soul constantly hums, unheard by any: God! God! God!\\7ipicture26 [images/picture26.jpg]GOD'S BOATMANI want to ply my boat, many times, Across the gulf-after-death, And return toearth's shores From my home in heaven.I want to load my boatWith those waiting, thirsty onesWho are left behind,And carry them by the opal poolOf iridescent joyWhere my Father distributesHis all-desire-quenching liquid peace.Oh, I will come again and again!Crossing a million crags of suffering,With bleeding feet, I will come —If need be, a trillion times —So long as I knowOne stray brother is left behind.I want Thee, O God,That I may give Thee to all.I want salvation,That I may give it to all.Free me, then, O God,From the bondage of the body,That I may show othersHow they can free themselves.I want Thine everlasting blissOnly that I may share it with others;That I may show all my brothersThe way to happinessForever and forever, in Thee.WHEN I AM ONLY A DREAMI come to tell you all of Him, And the way to encase Him in your bosom, And ofthe discipline that brings His grace. Those of you who have asked me To guideyou to my Beloved's presence — I warn you through my silently talking mind, Orspeak to you through a gentle significant glance, Or whisper to you through mylove, Or loudly dissuade you when you stray away from Him.But when I shall become only a memory, or a mental image, or silently speakingvoice,When no earthly call will ever revealMy whereabouts in unplumbed space,When no shallow entreaty or stem stentorian command will bring from me ananswer—I will smile in your mind when you are right,And when you are wrong I will weep through my eyes.Dimly peering at you in the dark.And weep through your eyes, perchance;And I will whisper to you through your conscience,And I will reason with you through your reason,And 1 will love all through your love.When you are able no longer to talk with me.Read my Whispers from Eternity;Eternally through it I will talk to you. Unknown I will walk by your side Andguard you with invisible arms. And as soon as you know my Beloved And hear Hisvoice in silence, You will know me again more tangiblythan you knew me on this earth plane. And yet when I am only a dream to you, Iwill come to remind you that you too are naught But a dream of my HeavenlyBeloved; And when you know you are a dream,as I know now. We will be ever awake in Him.THE DYING YOUTH'S DIVINE REPLYParamahansaji here describes a vision in which \"God showed me the right attitudeman should have toward death. \"In his laughter he had often heardThe echo of God's merriment.This laughing youth of many charmsLay dying in a hamlet,Yet the blast of illness was unable to witherhis smiles. The doleful doctors came and said, \"But a day. But a day we give youto live.\" The dear ones of his family cried aloud: \"Leave us not, poor youth ofour hearts! Our souls are bursting with pity for thee, for thyplight.\"The smiles of the youth grew brighter.And he joyously spoke, in a voice that sang:\"Ah, just a day; yea, but a dayBetween me and my long-lost Beloved.Oh, the hours of the day are slow to die!But when they have all expired,My Beloved will open the prison gates of my lifeAnd embrace me in Her infinite arms.** In India, God is worshiped as the Divine Father, Mother, Friend, Beloved; forGod is Love, the one Source of all noble forms of human love.The balloon of life will break,Releasing the imprisoned breath.I'll flee the mortal shoreAnd reach my immaculate kingdom of daintydreams, Where no nightmares of illness will dare To cross the threshold of mypeace.\"I am a billow of the sea; in the sea 1 will be free. I am a dust of light; Iwill swim in the stars. 1 am a drop of ambrosia; 1 will be a sea oi nectar. I amthe river of moonlight; I will melt iniridescence. My nightmares of desires have ceased. My dreams of grief are brokenBy the awakening light of laughter. The lamp of many lives, flickering over myearthliness, Is extinguished forever. My light has plunged into His Light And isplaying over the splendors of eternity. The shadows of fanciful fears haveslipped away And His Light has spread over the dark nooksof my soul.\"I am making preparations with laughter and songs. I have clothed all mythoughts with new robes. I have asked my reverent feelings to sing a celestialchorus.And I have roused all the folk living in the villa ofinspiration To observe this gala day for me — The day of my entry into theInfinite Kingdom As a son of the King of Peace. I have asked the sentries of mywill anddetermination To banish all sad inhabitants from my kingdom, And to kill atsight the Satan of fear, pain, sorrow,and attachment. My celebration of entering the Bliss Kingdom Must be attendedonly by laughter and songs; No timidity or dark sorrow will be allowed To joinmy festivity. All the subjects of my mortal kingdom Are roused todayTo continuous, unleashed, watchful merriment: They are waiting to welcome thedivine messenger, Delightful Death,When he comes to open the latch of finitude And let them in — Into the freekingdom of Infinity.\"All the inmates of my consciousness Are rejoicing to leave this mortal prison,Where they have been lashed with worries. Thrown into the dungeon of uncertain,unsafeliving. And pounded constantly by accidents, failures,disease, and unhappiness. They are glad to dump the broken cageof brittle bones, To throw the prison-flesh into the fire of Infinity, And setfree the Bird of Paradise To soar the skies of Blissful Omnipresence. Theinmates of my life are aquiver. Waiting joyously for the slow hours to pass by.In order to welcome savior Death when he shallcome. Of his own sweet accord, And at his sovereign command Bid them enter intohis kingdom.\"Oh, dear ones, rejoice in my joyOn the eve of my freedom from the mortal prison.Long before you.For me, no breaking of bones, no accidents,No fear of failure or financial lossWill ever exist;No cares of unpaid bills will ever keep sawingthrough my mind, No greed for possessions will ever be gnawingat my soul. No discourtesies, naggings, quarrels. No pain or disease Will dareintrude their noise When the doors of all my senses are closed; For 1 will bebeyond their reach,Out roaming with my BelovedOn the tracts of cosmic freedom.Pray do not wish me back in your prisonJust to join helplessly in your chorus of wails;But if needed,I will gladly come a million times,Wearing the robes of immortality,To take you out of your mortal prisonTo my Home of blessed freedom.\"I am free! Soon I will be out.But I'll indeed be sad to look at youThrough your prison bars of mortal life,Locked up in your misery-making mundane cell.Don't cry for me,Ye who are left on this desolate shore.Still to mourn and deplore;It is I who pity you.'Tis now less than a day.As the doctors say.Till I will be on my infinite way.No music is sweeter than this songI am singing every moment:'Now less than a day! less than a day,For today my Beloved comes in the dazzling chariotof death To take me away — to take me away To the Kingdom of Deathlessness, Tothe Palace of Bliss-Dreams,Far, far away.'\"You weep for me dark tears,Crying for your loss in me;But I weep for you joyous tears,Because I am going before you, for your welfare'ssake, To light candles of wisdom all the way; And 1 shall wait to welcome youthere Where I shall be. With my only Beloved and yours.\"WHEN I TAKE THE VOW OF SILENCEWhen I take the vow of silenceTo remain enlocked with my BelovedIn the arms of His everywhereness,I shall be busy listening to His symphonyOf creation's bliss songs, and beholding hiddenwondrous visions. Yet I shall not be oblivious of you all. I shall mutely watchyou Walking o'er me in the fresh grass-blades And seeing me in my living leafypresences. I shall behold you with mothering tenderness Through every crimsonblossom That wears a blush of love to bring you delight. I shall caress you withthe enfolding breeze To relieve your worries and fears; And enwrap you in sunwarmth When the chill of delusive loneliness straysinto your heart. When you gaze at the ocean You will be looking right at me,United with my Beloved on the altar of the horizon, Sky-canopied with silverrays o'er the azurewavy hazy sanctuary. I shall not speak except through your reason. Nor scoldexcept through your conscience. I shall persuade only through your love And yourheart's longing to seek the Beloved only. I shall tempt you — but with the soletemptation To enjoy the Beloved's love alone. Forget me if you will, but not myBeloved! Remembering Him, you cannot forget me.#v'r.ir. ipicture27 [images/picture27.jpg]picture28 [images/picture28.jpg]\\%^'/BOOKS BY PARAMAHANSA YOGANANDAAvailable at or through your local bookstore;or directly fromSelf-Realization Fellowship3880 San Rafael AvenueLos Angeles, California 90065Please request current catalog before orderingAutobiography of a YogiMan's Eternal QuestThe Science of ReligionWhispers From EternitySayings of Paramahansa YoganandaScientific Healing AffirmationsHow You Can Talk With GodMetaphysical MeditationsThe Law of SuccessCosmic ChantsOther PublicationsThe Holy Science B)!
