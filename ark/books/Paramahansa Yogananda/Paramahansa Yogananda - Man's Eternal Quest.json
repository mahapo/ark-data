Many of the religious and philosophical concepts and methods he introduced decades ago are now finding expression in education, psychology, business, medicine, and other spheres of endeavour— contributing in far-reaching ways to a more integrated, humane, and spiritual vision of human life. The fact that Paramahansa Yoganandaji's teachings are being interpreted and creatively applied in many different fields, as well as by exponents of diverse philosophical and metaphysical movements, points not only to the great practical utility of what he taught. It also makes clear the need for some means of ensur- ing that the spiritual legacy he left not be diluted, fragmented, or distorted with the passing of time. With the increasing variety of sources of information about Paramahansa Yogananda, readers sometimes inquire how they can be certain that a publication accurately presents his life and teach- ings. In response to these inquiries, we would like to explain that Paramahansaji founded Yogoda Satsanga Society of India/Self- Realization Fellowship to disseminate his teachings and to pre- serve their purity and integrity for future generations. He personally chose and trained those close disciples who head the Yogoda Satsanga Society/Self-Realization Fellowship Publications Council, and gave them specific guidelines for the preparation and publishing of his lectures, writings, and Yogoda Satsanga Lessons. The members of the YSS/SRF Publications Council honour these guidelines as a sacred trust, in order that the universal message of this beloved world teacher may live on in its original power and authenticity. The Yogoda Satsanga Society of India /Self-Realization Fellowship name and the YSS/SRF emblem (shown above) were originated by Paramahansaji to identify the organization he founded to carry on his worldwide spiritual and humanitarian work. These appear on all YSS/SRF books, audio and video record- ings, films, and other publications, assuring the reader that a work originates with the organization founded by Sri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda and faithfully conveys his teachings as he himself intended they be given.

The year was 1931. As I stood at the back of the crowded auditorium, I became transfixed, unaware of anything around me except the speaker and his words. My whole being was ab- sorbed in the wisdom and divine love that were pouring into my soul and flooding my heart and mind. I could only think, \"This man loves God as I have always longed to love Him. He knows God. Him I shall follow.\" And from that moment, I did. As I felt the transfiguring power of his words on my own life during those early days with Paramahansaji, there arose within me a feeling of the urgent need to preserve his words for all the world, for all time. It became my sacred and joyous privilege, during the many years I was with Paramahansa Yogananda, to record his lectures and classes, and also many informal talks and words of personal counsel—truly a vast treasure-house of wondrous wisdom and God-love. As Gurudeva spoke, the rush of his inspiration was often reflected in the swiftness of his speech; he might speak without pause for minutes at a time, and continue for an hour. While his hearers sat enthralled, my pen was flying! As I took down his words in shorthand, it was as though a special grace had descended, instantly translating the Guru's voice into the shorthand characters on the page. Their transcription has been a blessed task that continues to this day. Even after such a long time—some of my notes are more than forty years old—when I start to transcribe them, they are miraculously fresh in my mind, as though they had been recoreded yesterday. I can even hear inwardly the inflec- tions of Gurudeva's voice in each particular phrase. [xi] i"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"[ . xii] MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST The Master seldom made even the slightest preparation for his lectures,- if he prepared anything at all, it might consist of a factual note or two, hastily jotted down. Very often, while rid- ing in the car on the way to the temple, he would casually ask one of us: \"What is my subject today?\" He would put his mind on it, and then give the lecture extemporaneously from an inner reservoir of divine inspiration. The subjects for Gurudeva's sermons at the temples were set and announced in advance. But sometimes his mind was working in an entirely different vein when he began to speak. Regardless of the \"subject for today,\" the Master would voice the truths engrossing his consciousness at that moment, pour- ing forth priceless wisdom in a steady stream from the abun- dance of his own spiritual experience and intuitive perception. Nearly always, at the close of such a service, a number of peo- ple would come forward to thank him for having enlightened them on a problem that had been troubling them, or perhaps for having explained some philosophical concept in which they were parcticularly interested. Sometimes, while he was lecturing, the Guru's conscious- ness would be so uplifted that he would momentarily forget the audience and converse directly with God; his whole being would be overflowing with divine joy and intoxicating love. In these high states of consciousness, his mind completely at one with the Divine Consciousness, he inwardly perceived Truth, and de- scribed what he saw. On occasion, God appeared to him as the Divine Mother, or in some other aspect; or one of our great Gu- rus, or other saints, would manifest in vision before him. At such times, even the audience would feel deeply the special blessing bestowed on all present. During such a visitation of Saint Francis of Assisi, whom Gurudeva deeply loved, the Mas- ter was inspired to compose the beautiful poem, \"God! God! God!\" The Bhagavad Gita describes an enlightened master in these words: \"The Self shines forth like a sun in those who have ban- ished ignorance by wisdom\" (V:16). One might have been over- awed by Paramahansa Yogananda's spiritual radiance, were it not for his warmth and naturalness, and a quiet humility, which put everyone instantly at ease. Each person in the audience felt"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"PREFACE [xiii] that Gurudeva's talk was addressed to him personally. Not the least of the Master's endearing qualities was his understanding sense of humour. By some choice phrase, gesture, or facial ex- pression he would bring forth an appreciative response of hearty laughter at just the right moment to drive home a point, or to relax his listeners after long and intense concentatation on a par- ticularly deep subject. One cannot convey in the pages of a book the uniqueness and universality of Paramahansa Yogananda's vivid, loving personal- ity. But it is my humble hope, in giving this brief background, to afford a personal glimpse that will enrich the reader's enjoy- ment and appreciation of the talks presented in this volume. To have seen my Gurudeva in divine communion; to have heard the profound truths and devotional outpourings of his soul; to have recorded them for the ages,- and now to share them with all—what joy is mine! May the Master's sublime words open wider the doors to unshakable faith in God, to deeper love for that One who is our beloved Father, Mother, and Eternal Friend.

For those individual souls who have sought and found God, the search is over: He is that something Else. —Sri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda This volume of talks by Sri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda is for all who have ever known disappointment, dissatisfaction, dis- couragement, sorrow, or an unfulfilled spiritual longing. It is for those who have sought to understand the enigmas of life; for those who have held within their hearts an uncertain hope about the reality of God and the possibility that He could be known; and for seekers who have already turned toward God in their quest. May it be, for each reader, a ray of divine light on the path, bringing new life and inspiritation and a sense of direction. God is all things to all people. Man's Eternal Quest is a book about God: about God's place in man's life; in his hopes, will, aspirations, accomplishments. Life, man, achievement—all are but manifestations of the one omnipresent Creator, as inseparably dependent on Him as the wave is dependent on the ocean. Paramahansaji explains why and how man was created by God, and how he is immutably a part of God, and what this means to each one personally. Real- ization of the oneness of man and his Creator is the whole essence of Yoga. An understanding of man's inescapable need for God, in every aspect of living, removes the otherworldliness from religion and makes knowing God the basis of a scientific and practical approach to life. As man of God, and as an authority on the ancient divine science of Yoga, Paramahansa Yogananda has received the highest credentials from his spiritual contemporaries, and from readers of his works in all parts of the world—the literary and general pub- lic as well as his followers. That he has also received the ultimate [xiv]"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION M commendation from the Supreme Authority is amply attested to by the manifest blessings of God on his exemplary life, and by the infinitely beautiful, uniquely edifying responses he received from God in vision and divine communion. This comment in Review of Religions, published by Columbia University Press, is typical of the acclaim received by Paramahansa Yogananda's earlier work, Autobiography of a Yogi: \"There has been nothing before, written in English or in any other European language, like this presenta- tion of Yoga.\" The San Francisco Chronicle wrote: \"Yogananda presents a convincing case for yoga, and those who 'came to scoff' may remain to pray.\" From Schleswig-Holsteinische Tagespost, Germany: \"We must credit this book with the power to bring about a spiritual revolution.\" Of Paramahansa Yogananda himself, Swami Sivananda, founder of the Divine Life Society, Rishikesh, said: \"A rare gem of inestimable value, the like of whom the world is yet to witness, Paramahansa Yogananda has been an ideal rep- resentative of the ancient sages and seers, the glory of India.\" His Holiness the Shankaracharya of Kanchipuram, revered spiritual leader of millions in South India, wrote of Paramahansaji: \"As a bright light shining in the midst of darkness, so was Yogananda's presence in this world. Such a great soul comes on earth only rarely, when there is a real need among men. We are grateful to Yogananda for spreading Hindu philosophy in such a wonderful way in America and the West.\" Sri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda was born in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, on January 5, 1893. He had a remarkable childhood that clearly indicated his life was marked for a divine destiny. His mother recognized this and encouraged his noble ideals and spiri- tual aspirations. When he was only eleven, the loss of his mother, whom he loved above all else in this world, made firm his inher- ent resolve to find God and to receive from the Creator Himself the answers yearned for in every human heart. He became a dis- ciple of the great fnanavatar (incarnation of wisdom) Sri Sri Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri. Sri Yukteswarji was one of a line of ex- alted gurus, with whom Yoganandaji had been linked from birth: Sri Yogananda's parents were disciples of Sri Sri Lahiri Mahasaya, guru of Sri Yukteswarji. When Yoganandaji was an infant in his mother's arms, Lahiri Mahasaya had blessed him and foretold: \"Little mother, thy son will be a yogi. As a spiritual engine, he"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"[ . xvi] MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST will carry many souls to God's kingdom.\" Lahiri Mahasaya was a disciple of Sri Sri Mahavatar Babaji, the deathless master who revived in this age the ancient science of Kiiya Yoga. Praised by Bhagavan Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, and by Patanjali in the Yoga Sutras, Kriya Yoga is both a transcendent technique of med- itation and an art of living that leads to union of the soul with God. Mahavatar Babaji revealed the sacred Kriya to Lahiri Ma- hasaya, who handed it down to Sri Yukteswarji, who taught it to Paramahansa Yogananda. When in 1920 Paramahansa Yogananda was deemed ready to begin his world mission of disseminating the soul-liberating science of Yoga, Mahavatar Babaji told him of the divine respon- sibility that was to be his: \"You are the one I have chosen to spread the message of Kriya Yoga in the West. Long ago I met your guru Yukteswar at a Kumbha Mela-, I told him then I would send you to him for training. Kriya Yoga, the scientific technique of God-realization, will ultimately spread in all lands, and aid in harmonizing the nations through man's personal, transcendental perception of the Infinite Father.\" Paramahansa Yogananda began his mission in America as a delegate to the International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston in 1920. For more than a decade he travelled the length and breadth of America, speaking almost daily to capacity audiences in all the major cities. On January 28, 1925, the Los Angeles Times reported: \"The Philharmonic Auditorium presents the extraordi- nary spectacle of thousands... being turned away an hour before the advertised opening of a lecture with the 3000-seat hall filled to its utmost capacity. Swami Yogananda is the attraction. A Hindu invading the United States to bring God.... It came as no small revelation to the West that Yoga—so eloquently expounded and clearly interpreted by Sri Yogananda—is a universal science, and that as such it is the essence of all true religions. In Los Angeles in 1925, Paramahansa Yogananda founded the international headquarters for Self-Realization Fellowship, the society he had started in India in 1917 as Yogoda Satsanga Society of India. In the late 1930s Paramahansaji began to withdraw gradually from nationwide public lecturing. \"I am not interested in crowds,\""},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION [xvii] he said, \"but in souls who are in earnest to know God.\" There- after, he concentrated his efforts on classes for serious students, and spoke mostly at his own Self-Realization Fellowship temples and the international headquarters. The selections in this volume are talks given primarily during this period. Paramahansa Yogananda had often voiced this prediction: \"I will not die in bed, but with my boots on, speaking of God and India.\" On March 7, 1952, the prophecy was fulfilled. At a banquet in honour of the Ambassador of India, B. R. Sen, Paramahansaji was a guest speaker. He delivered a soul-stirring address, conclud- ing with these words from a poem he had written, \"My India\": \"Where Ganges, woods, Himalayan caves and men dream God— I am hallowed; my body touched that sod!\" He then lifted his eyes upward and entered mahasamadhi, an advanced yogi's conscious earth-exit. He died as he had lived, exhorting man to know God. The Guru's talks in the earliest years of his ministry were recorded only spasmodically. But when Sri Sri Daya Mata became a disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda in 1931, she undertook the sacred task, faithfully recording, for the generations to come, all of her Guru's talks and classes. This volume is but a sampling: un- der the direction of Paramahansa Yogananda, many transcriptions —particularly those containing private instruction and meditation techniques and principles given to Yogoda Satsanga/Self-Realiza- tion class students—were compiled along with some of his writ- ings into a series of Yogoda Satsanga Lessons; other talks appear as a regular feature in Yogoda Satsanga annual-series booklets. Second and third anthologies, The Divine Romance and Journey to Self-Realization, are companion volumes to Man's Eternal Quest. As most of the talks set forth in this book were presented before audiences familiar with Yogoda Satsanga/Self-Realization teachings, some clarification of terminology and philosophical concepts may be helpful to the general reader. To this end,, many footnotes have been included; also a glossary explaining certain Sanskrit words, and other philosophical terms, and giving infor- mation about events, persons, and places associated with the life and work of Paramahansa Yogananda. It may be noted here that unless otherwise indicated the quotations from the Bhagavad Gita"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"[. XVIII] MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST in this volume are from Paramahansa Yogananda's own transla- tions, which he rendered from the Sanskrit sometimes literally and sometimes in paraphrase, depending on the context of his talk. For most Gita quotations in this edition of Man's Eternal Quest, we have used the definitive version given by Paramahansaji for his comprehensive translation and commentary: God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita—Royal Science of God-Realization (published by Yogoda Satsanga Society of India in 2002). In talks where he was rendering a Gita passage more freely in order to emphasize a specific point, the paraphrase has been retained and noted as such in the footnote citation. Sri Sri Parmahansa Yogananda could have said, with Jesus, \"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill\" (Matthew 5:17). Parama- hansaji honoured all religions ajjd their founders, and held in respect all sincere seekers of God. Part of his world mission is \"to reveal the complete harmony and basic oneness of original Yoga as taught by Bhagawan Krishna and original Christianity as taught by Jesus Christ.'^(See Aims and Ideals, Page 465.) Far from intro- ducing a divisive dogma to the world, Paramahansaji showed that the practice of yoga establishes an inner attunement with God that constitutes the universal basis of all religions. Abstractions of theoretical religion pale before actual experience of God. Truth cannot be wholly proved to any seeker by anyone else; but by the practice of yoga, the aspirant can prove truth for himself through his own experience. God is; and each man who will seek Him sincerely will know Him. Man can have no life or power to act, think, or feel without borrowing that power from God. Therefore, Paramahansaji pointed out, knowing God is not only a privilege and a divine duty, but a practical necessity. Why should man grovel in self-insufficiency when he can tap the Source of all power and fulfillment? The wisdom in this volume is not the studied learning of a scholar,- it is the empirical testimony of a dynamic spiritual person- age whose life was filled with inner joy and outer accomplishment, a world teacher who lived what he taught, a Premavatar whose sole desire was to share God's wisdom and love with all.

He suffered physically and therefore sought a method to heal himself. But how did man happen to try to find out about God? The question gives scope for profound reflection. In the Vedas* of India we find the earliest true concept of God- In her scriptures India has given the world immortal truths that have stood the test of time. Every material inventor is actuated by material need— \"necessity is the mother of invention.\" Similarly motivated by necessity, the early rishist of India became ardent spiritual seekers. They had found that without inner satisfaction, no amount of external good fortune can bring lasting happiness. How then can one make himself really happy? That is the problem the wise men of India undertook to solve. Three Aspects of Nature Worship of God in prehistoric times began through man's fear of the various forces of nature. When it rained excessively, floods killed many people. Awed, man thought of the rain and wind and other natural forces as gods. Later on, human beings realized that nature operates in three ways: creative, preservative, and dissolutive. A wave * From the Sanskrit vid, \"to know.\" The Vedas comprise a voluminous scrip- ture of 100,000 couplets. The origin of the Vedas is lost in antiquity. They were passed down orally for millenniums. According to tradition, the illu- mined sage Vyasa, who lived at the time of Bhagavan Krishna (see glossary), was the compiler and arranger of the Vedas in their present form: Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda, and Atharva Veda. t Literally \"seers.\" The rishis were the inspired personages to whom the Vedas were revealed in an indeterminable antiquity. 3"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"4 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST rising out of the ocean exemplifies the creative state; staying for a moment on the sea-breast, it is in the preservative state; and sinking back into the deep, it passes through the dissolu- tive state. Just as Jesus beheld the universal force of evil personified in Satan, so the great rishis beheld the universal forces of cre- ation, preservation, and dissolution personified in definite forms. ($he sages of old named them Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Shiva the Destroyed These primal powers were created as projections of the unmanifested Spirit to unfold His infinite drama of creation, while He, as God be- yond creation, remains ever hidden behind their consciousness. In times of cosmic dissolution, all creation and its vast activat- ing forces dissolve back into Spirit. There they rest until called upon again by the Great Director to reenact their roles. * /r/ c&o A Story About Brahma. Vishnu. And Shiva In India there is a popular story about Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. They were boasting among themselves about their tremendous might. Suddenly a little boy came up and said to Brahma, \"What do you create?\" \"Everything,\" Brahma replied grandly. The boy asked the other two gods what their work was. \"We preserve and destroy everything,\" they answered. The young visitor was holding in his hand a single piece of straw about the size of a toothpick. Placing it in front of Brahma, he asked, \"Can you create a piece of straw like this?\" After prodigious effort, Brahma found to his astonishment that he cound not. The lad then turned to Vishnu and asked him to save the straw, which was slowly starting to dissolve under the boy's steady gaze. Vishnu's efforts to hold it together were fruitless. Finally, the little stranger produced the piece of straw again and asked Shiva to destroy it. But try as Shiva would to annihilate it, the tiny straw remained intact. The little boy turned again to Brahma: \"Did you create * \"They are true knowers.. .who understand the Day of Brahma, which endures for a thousand cycles ( yugas), and the Night of Brahma, which also endures for a thousand cycles. At the dawn of Brahma's Day all creation, reborn, emerges from .the state of non-manifestation; at the dusk of Brahma's Night all creation sinks into the sleep of non-manifestation\" (Bhagavad Gita VIII: 17-18)."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"HOW SEEKERS FIRST FOUND GOD 5 me?\" he asked. Brahma thought and thought; he could not remember ever having created this amazing child. Suddenly the boy vanished. The three gods awoke from their delusion and remembered that behind their power is a Greater Power. God, the Supreme Cause In the Western world the idea of God developed through observation of the law of cause and effect. Man can material- ize objects by taking materials from the earth and shaping them in accordance with a preconceived idea; therefore it seemed reasonable to conclude that this whole universe must have been created out of ideas. This led to the concept that everything must have existed first as an idea. Someone had to create that first idea or cosmic plan. Thus through the analogy of the law of cause and effect, intelligent men reasoned that there must be a Supreme Cause. Science has learned that all matter is made of invisible building blocks—electrons and protons—just as a house is built of bricks. But nobody can tell why some electrons and protons become wood, and others become human bone, and so on. What Intelligence guides them? This line of questioning gives room for God in even the material scientist's theories about the nature of the phenomenal worlds. The sages of India say that everything proceeds from and goes back into its source: God. Evidence of Order and Harmony Is Everywhere Perceiving that every human being is a compound of mat- ter and mind, the earliest Western thinkers believed that two independent forces existed: nature and mind. Later they began asking themselves, \"Why is everything in nature arranged in a particular way? Why isn't one of man's arms longer than the other? Why don't stars and planets collide? Everywhere we see evidence of order and harmony in the universe.\" They con- cluded that mind and matter could not be both separate and sovereign; a single Intelligence must govern all. This conclu- sion naturally led to the idea that there is just one God, who is both the Cause of matter and the Intelligence within and be- hind it. One who attains the ultimate wisdom realizes that everything is Spirit—in essence, though hidden in manifesta-"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"6 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST tion. If you had the perception, you would see God in every- thing. Then the question is, how did seekers first find Him? As the beginning step, they closed their eyes to shut out immediate contact with the world and matter, so they could concentrate more fully on discovering the Intelligence behind it. They reasoned that they could not behold God's presence in nature through the ordinary perceptions of the five senses. So they began to try to feel Him within themselves by deeper and deeper concentration. They eventually discovered how to shut off all five senses, thus temporarily doing away entirely with the consciousness of matter. The inner world of the Spirit began to open up* To those great ones of ancient India who un- deviatingly persisted in these inner investigations, God finally revealed Himself. Devotion and Right Activity Attract God 's Attention Thus the saints gradually began to convert their concep- tions of God into perceptions of Him. That is what you must do also, if you would know Him. You don't stay long enough at your prayers. First you must have a right concept of God— a definite idea through which you can form a relationship with Him—and then you must meditatet and pray until that men- tal conception becomes changed into actual perception. Then you will know Him. If you persist, the Lord will come. The Searcher of Hearts wants only your sincere love. He is like a little child: someone may offer Him his whole wealth and He doesn't want it; and another cries to Him, \"O Lord, I love You!\" and into that devotee's heart He comes running. Don't seek God with any ulterior motive, but pray to Him with devotion—unconditional, one-pointed, steady devotion. When your love for Him is as great as your attachment to your mortal body, He will come to you. In seeking the Lord, activity comes after devotion in importance.

But there is wrong as well as right activity even in doing good. A zealous churchman who brings more and more people into his congregation solely to satisfy his own ego is not going to please God through that activity. To realize the presence of the Divine Indweller should be the first desire in every heart. It is when you persistently, selflessly perform every action with love-inspired thoughts of God that He will come to you. Then you realize that you are the Ocean of Life, which has become the tiny wave of each life. That is the way of know- ing the Lord through activity. When in every action you think of Him before you act, while you are performing the action, and after you have finished it, He will reveal Himself to you. You must work, but let God work through you,- this is the best part of devotion. If you are constantly thinking that He is walking through your feet, working through your hands, ac- complishing through your will, you will know Him. You should also develop discrimination, so that you prefer spiritu- ally constructive, God-conscious activity to work performed without any thought of Him. Meditation Is the Highest Form of Activity But greater than activity, devotion, or reason, is meditation. To meditate truly is to concentrate solely on Spirit. This is es- oteric meditation. It is the highest form of activity that man can perform, and it is the most balanced way to find God. If you work afy the time you may become mechanical and lose Him in preoccupation with your duties,- and if you seek Him only through discriminative thought you may lose Him in the labyrinths of endless reasoning; and if you cultivate only devo- tion for God, your development may become merely emotional. But meditation combines and balances all these approaches. Work, eat, walk, laugh, cry, meditate—only for Him. That is the best way to live. In so doing you will be truly happy serv- ing Him, loving Him, and communing with Him. So long as you let the desires and weaknesses of the physical body con- trol your thoughts and actions, you will not find Him. Always be master of your body.

The esoteric activity of meditation is necessary if you really want to be aware of His presence. You might think that after two hours of meditation I would be bored to death. No, I couldn't find anything in the world as intoxicating as this God of mine. When I drink that aged wine of my soul, a skyful of happiness throbs in my heart. Divine joy is in everyone. Sunlight shines equally on the char- coal and the diamond, but the diamond reflects the light. Such are the transparent minds that know and reflect Spirit. Thus in the esoteric activity of meditation you have the solution to the mystery of knowing God. I do not blame you for what you do, but for what you do not do. You think you have no time for God. Suppose the Lord were too busy to look after you? What then? Wrest your mind from the mirage of the senses and habit. Why be deluded like that? I am pointing out to you a land more beautiful than anything here can ever be. I am telling you of a happiness that will intoxicate you night and day—you won't need sense temptations to enthral you. Discipline your body and your mind. Control your senses. Find God! I often say that this body is a switchboard and the five senses are its telephone instruments. Through them I am in touch with the world; but when I don't wish to communicate, I shut off my five senses and live in the inexpressible joy of God. The Heavenly Father doesn't want you, His children, to suffer anymore. The sensory delusion in which you live must be overcome. You should conceive of God as the highest necessity of life. Break the shackles of limitation, of dark habits and mechanical daily routine. I condemn no man—only man's unbelief and oblivion of God. He can be known by using the technique of meditation. Then He shall throb as wisdom in your mind, and as joy in your heart, and you will be more active and more successful than you have ever been before. Dear ones, I was once like you.

By the transcendental way you / realize all the things you are not, and discover That which you are: \"I am not the breath; I am not the body, neither bones nor flesh. I am not the mind or feeling. I am That which is behind the breath, body, mind, and feeling.\" When you go beyond the consciousness of this world, knowing that you are not the body or the mind, and yet aware as never before that you exist—that divine consciousness is what you are.

We have come down from God, and we must reascend to Him. We have seemingly become separated from our Father, and we must consciously reunite with Him. Yoga teaches us how to rise above the delusion of separation and realize our oneness with God. The poet Milton wrote of the soul of man and how it might regain paradise. That is the purpose and goal of Yoga—to regain the lost paradise of soul consciousness by which man knows that he is, and ever has been, one with Spirit. The world's various religions are based more or less on the beliefs of man. But the true basis of religion should be a science that all devotees may apply in order to reach our one Father-God. Yoga is that science. The practice of a science of religion is imperative. Different dogmatic \"isms\" have kept mankind divided, although Jesus pointed out: \"If a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.\"* Unity among various religions may be brought about only when the individuals who practise those religions become actually aware of God within. Then we shall have a true brotherhood of man under the Fatherhood of God. The great religions of the world all preach the necessity of finding God, of brotherhood among men; and all have a moral code, such as the Ten Commandments. What, then, creates the differences among them? It is the bigotry in men's minds. Not by concentrating on dogma may we reach God, but by actual soul knowledge.

To me there is neither Jew, nor Christian, nor Hindu; all are my brothers. I worship in all temples, for each of them has been erected to honour my Father.

Such temples, dedicated to the one God that all religions worship, should be built everywhere. I predict that this will come about. East and West should destroy forever nar- row divisions in the houses of God. Attaining Self-Realization through Yoga, men will come to know that they are all chil- dren of the one Father. The Blind Cannot Lead the Blind That unity of spirit is demonstrated in great men, those with God-realization. The blind cannot lead the blind; only a master, * one who knows God, may rightly teach others about Him. To regain one's divinity one must have such a master or guru.t He who faithfully follows a true guru becomes like him, for the guru helps to elevate the disciple to his own level of re- alization. When I found my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, $ I made up my mind to follow his example: to place God alone on the altar of my heart, and to share Him with others. The Hindu masters taught that to gain the deepest knowl- edge one should focus his gaze through the omniscient spiri- tual eye. When concentrating hard, even the non-yogi wrinkles his forehead at the point between the eyebrows—the centre of concentration and of the spherical spiritual eye, the seat of soul intuition. That is the real \"crystal ball,\" into which the yogi * One who is master of himself—of the mind, emotions, senses, passions.

The Guru Gita (17-19) aptly describes the guru as \"dis- peller of darkness\" (from gu, \"darkness\" and ru, \"that which dispels\").

Those who go deep enough in their concentration will penetrate that \"third\" eye and see God. Seekers of truth therefore should develop the abil- ity to project their perception through the spiritual eye. The practice of Yoga helps the aspirant to open the single eye of in- tuitive consciousness. * Intuition or direct knowledge does not depend on any data from the senses. That is why the intuitive faculty is often called the \"sixth sense.\" Everyone has this sixth sense, but most people do not develop it. However, almost everyone has had some intuitional experience, perhaps a \"feeling\" that a par- ticular thing is going to happen, when there is no sensory evi- dence to indicate it. It is important to develop intuition, or direct soul knowl- edge, for he who is God-conscious is sure of himself. He knows, and he knows that he knows. We must be sure of God's presence, as sure as we are that we know the taste of an orange. It was only after my guru had shown me how to commune with God and after I had felt His presence every day that I as- sumed the spiritual duty of telling others about Him. The West has emphasized large temples of worship, but there are few in which the worshippers are shown how God may be found. In the East, the emphasis has been on the de- velopment of men of God-realization; but they are in many cases inaccessible to spiritual seekers, remaining in seclusion in remote and solitary abodes. Spiritual centres in which peo- ple may commune with God, and teachers who can show peo- ple how to do so, are both necessary. How may one receive knowledge of God from a teacher who himself does not know God? My guru impressed upon me the necessity of knowing the Heavenly Father before trying to tell others about Him. How grateful I am to have received his training! He himself truly communed with God. * During deep meditation, the single or spiritual eye becomes visible as a bright star surrounded by a sphere of blue light that, in turn, is encircled by a brilliant halo of golden light. This omniscient eye is variously referred to in scriptures as the third eye, the star of the East, the inner eye, the dove descending from heaven, the eye of Shiva, and the eye of intuition. \"If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light\" ( Matthew 6:22, Bible)."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"16 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST The Lord must first be perceived in one's own bodily tem- ple.

The Ten Commandments are preached, in various words, in every religion. But the two greatest commandments are those em- phasized by Jesus: \"Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind,\" and \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\"* Loving God \"with all thy mind\" means withdrawing one's attention from the senses and giving it to God; giving to Him one's whole concentration in meditation. Every seeker of God must learn to concentrate. A prayer that one utters while at the same time thinking of other things in the background of the mind is not a true prayer and is unheeded by God. Yoga teaches that in order to find the Father it is first necessary to seek Him with all one's mind, with concentration that is one-pointed. Some people say that the Hindus are more adapted to the practice of Yoga, that Yoga is not suited to Westerners. This is not true. Many Westerners are at present in a better position to practise Yoga than many Hindus are, because scientific advancements have given Westerners much free time. India should more and more utilize the progressive material meth- ods of the West to make life easier and freer; and the West should take from India the practical metaphysical methods of Yoga whereby every man may find his way to God. Yoga is not a sect but a universally applicable science by which we can find our Father. Yoga is for everybody, for the people of the West as well as for those of the East. One would not say that the telephone is * Matthew 22:37, 39. Krishna's teachings in the Bhagavad Gita similarly stress these two commandments: \"On Me [the Lord] fix thy mind, be thou My devo- tee, with ceaseless worship bow reverently before Me.

Sim- ilarly, the methods of Yoga, although developed in the East, are not exclusively for the East but are useful to all mankind. Whether a man is born in India or in America, he someday has to die. Why not learn how to \"die daily\" in God, like St. Paul? * Yoga teaches the method. Man lives in the body as a pris- oner; when his term is over, he suffers the indignity of being thrown out. Love of the body is therefore nothing more than love of jail. Long accustomed to living in the body, we have for- gotten what real freedom means. Being a Westerner is no excuse for not seeking freedom. It is vital to every man that he discover his soul and know his immortal nature. Yoga shows the way. The Soul Must Reascend to God Before creation existed there was Cosmic Consciousness: Spirit or God, the Absolute, ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever- new Bliss beyond form and manifestation. When creation came into being, Cosmic Consciousness \"descended\" into the physi- cal universe where it manifests as Christ Consciousness:t the omnipresent pure reflection of God's intelligence and con- sciousness inherent and hidden within all creation. When the Christ Consciousness descends into the physical body of man it becomes soul, or superconsciousness: the ever-existing, ever- conscious, ever-new bliss of God individualized by encasement in the body. When the soul becomes identified with the body, it manifests as ego, mortal consciousness. Yoga teaches that the soul must climb back up the ladder of consciousness to Spirit.* * I Corinthians 15:31 (Bible). t The Hindu scriptures refer to Christ Consciousness as Kutastha Chaitanya, universal consciousness or omnipresent intelligence. * Yoga teaches that the abode of the soul—of man's life and divine con- sciousness—is in the subtle spiritual centres in the brain: Sahasrara, the thou- sand-petaled lotus at the top of the cerebrum, seat of cosmic consciousness,- Kutastha, at the point between the eyebrows, seat of Christ consciousness,- and the medullary centre (connected by polarity to the Kutastha), seat of su- perconsciousness. Descending into the body (and body-consciousness) from these centres of highest spiritual perception, life and consciousness flow down the spine, passing through five astral spinal centres (see chakras in glossary) and branching outward into the physical organs of life, sensory perception, and action."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"18 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST Secret of Happiness Is Consciousness of God's Presence It is all right to enjoy life; the secret of happiness is not to become attached to anything.

Worldly habits will hold us fast wherever we may be until we free ourselves from them. The yogi learns to find God in the cave of his heart. Wherever he goes, he carries with him the blissful consciousness of God's presence. Man has not only descended into mortal sense conscious- ness but has become bound by abnormalities of that sense con- sciousness, such as greed, anger, and jealousy. Man must ban- ish these abnormalities in order to find God. Both Easterners and Westerners should be free from sense slavery. An ordinary man may become angry because his morning coffee hasn't been brought to him and he is sure the deprivation will give him a headache. He is a slave of his habits. The developed yogi is free. Everyone can be a yogi, right where he is now. But we are prone to think strange and difficult anything that is beyond the horizon of our own habits of life. We do not consider how our habits may appear to others! The practice of Yoga leads to freedom. Some yogis carry this idea of non-attachment to extremes. They teach that one should be able to lie on a bed of nails without discomfort, and other forms of tapasya, physical discipline. It is true that one who can sit on a bed of nails and think of God shows great strength of mind. But such feats are not necessary. One may just as well sit in a comfortable chair and meditate on God. Paranjali* teaches that any posture that keeps the spine To regain the blissful realization of its oneness with God, the soul of man must retrace its downward course, ascending by the sacred spinal route to its home in the higher cerebral centres of divine awareness. This is accomplished by the practice of guru-given scientific techniques of yogic meditation, such as may be learned from the Yogoda Satsanga Lessons. (See glossary.) * Foremost exponent of Yoga.

It is not necessary to go through physical contortions or to practice exercises requiring extraordinary physical endurance and sup- pleness, as is advocated in Hatha Yoga.

The Bhagavad Gita says: \"He who with devotion absorbs him- self in Me, with his soul immersed in Me, him I regard, among all classes of yogis, as the most equillibrated.\"* Hindu yogis have been known to demonstrate oblivious- ness to extremes of heat and cold, and to mosquitoes and other annoying insects. Such a demonstration is not a requisite of be- ing a yogi, but it is a natural achievement of the adept. Try to eliminate disturbing elements; or to endure them, if necessary, without being disturbed inwardly by them. If one can remain clean, it is pointless to be dirty. One may become attached to living in a hut as well as to living in a palace. The greatest factor in achieving spiritual success is will- ingness. Jesus said, \"The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few.\"+ People of the world seek the gifts of God, but he who is wise seeks the Giver Himself. To be a yogi is to meditate. The yogi doesn't think first of food for his body upon waking each morning; he feeds his soul with the ambrosia of God-communion. Filled with the inspi- ration found by his deeply diving meditative mind, he is able to perform happily all the duties of the day. God made this earth as it is on purpose; in His plan it is man's part to make the world better. The Westerner tends to go to extremes in keeping constantly busy getting new and improved material comforts. The Easterner tends to go to ex- tremes in being satisfied with what he has. There is something appealing about both the go-ahead spirit of the West and the easy, calm spirit of the East. We should take the balanced road between.

The question \"Who made God?\" arises only because mind cannot comprehend That which has neither beginning nor end. When you are looking at the sun millions of miles away in the sky, that huge luminary seems smaller by far than our earth. Yet the diameter of earth is roughly 7,900 miles,- and the sun is more than a hundred times that wide. If you could place our planet next to the sun, earth would appear by comparison a tiny dot. Let us suppose the giant solar orb is expanding, growing more and more huge, until the vast blue expanse of the sky is entirely swallowed up by its mass. The space thus filled is nevertheless but a particle, a mere speck, of the space that spreads through countless universes and into infinity. Were the sun to go on endlessly enlarging in space, still it would not be able to take the measure of infinity. The cosmic delusion of finitude prevents the mind from conceiving such vastness. Where are its boundaries? Whence came this endless void? The Originless Immeasurable is God. Omnipresent in the farthest reaches of space, He is in the distant stars, and in you and me; and He is conscious every moment of every place He is. God is not mind—He created it and He is beyond it.

God showed me in a vision that those who are dying in the fighting in Spain are only dreaming a terrible dream of death. As soon as their consciousness is lifted from the body, they awake as from a nightmare, and are glad to be free of it. Our life experiences are all part of a dream. Man himself has cre- ated the nightmare of war. But after its victims have been thrown from their bodies, they realize it was only a horrible dream from which they have awakened. They know they are not dead. This is a great metaphysical truth. If you know you are dreaming, you don't suffer from your bad experiences in the dream. But if you are identified with the dream, and in it someone strikes your head and kills you, that dream death seems a true and terrible experience until you wake up and understand it was not real. It is the same after death. Once you are out of this body, you realize you are not dead; you are free of a nightmare. So death is not the end; it is a freeing of the consciousness from imprisonment in the phys- ical dream-body. That release brings a sense of great freedom. We should never seek death.

Having then transcended the Lord's delusion, the soul is forever freed. \"Their thoughts immersed in That (Spirit), their souls one with Spirit, their sole allegiance and devotion given to Spirit, their beings purified from poisonous delusion by the antidote of wisdom—such men reach the state of nonreturn\" (Bhagavad Gita V: 17). In the Bible it is similarly writ- ten: \"Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out\" ( Revelation 3:12).

We hear about a Creator, read about Him, but know not any way to con- tact Him. We only know that the entire universe depicts His intelligence. Just as the intricate works of a tiny watch arouse our admiration for the watchmaker, and the huge complicated machines in a factory cause us to marvel at their inventor, so when we see nature's wonders we feel awed by the hidden intelligence behind them. We ask ourselves: Who made the flower a living form, reaching out to the sun? Whence came its fragrance and beauty? How were its petals formed so perfectly, and tinged with lovely colours? At night the stars and the moon, shedding silvery light around us, move us to reflection on the intelligence guiding these celestial bodies through the sky. The moon's soft light is insufficient for the activities of the day; thus a benign intelli- gence suggests to us that we rest at night. Then the sun comes up, and its bright light makes us look clearly and squarely at the world around us, and at our responsibility to satisfy the needs that beset us. There are two ways in which our needs can be taken care of. One is the material. For example, when we have ill health we can go to a doctor for medical treatment. But a time comes when no human aid can help. Then we look to the other way, to the Spiritual Power, the Maker of our body, mind, and soul. Material power is limited, and when it fails, we turn to the unlimited Divine Power. Likewise with our financial needs; when we have done our best, and still it is inadequate, we turn to that other Power. 32"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"ANSWERED PRAYERS 33 Everyone thinks that his problems are the worst. Some feel more oppressed than others because their resistance is weaker. Because of differences in their mental power, people put forth varying amounts of energy. If one has a very great difficulty and his mind is weak, he will not succeed in overcoming the problem. A man whose mind is powerful could break down the barriers of that difficulty. Even so, the mightiest men have sometimes met failure. When overwhelming material, mental, or spiritual troubles beset us, we realize how limited are the powers of life in this physical world. Our endeavour must be not only to acquire financial secu- rity and good health, but to seek out the meaning of life. What is it all about? When we are hit with difficulties we react upon our environment first, making whatever material adjustments we believe may help. But when we come to the point of saying, \"Everything I have tried so far has failed; what to do next?\" we start to think hard about a solution. When we think deeply enough, we find an answer within. This is one form of answered prayer. Prayer Is a Demand of the Soul Prayer is a demand of the soul. God did not make us beg- gars; He created us in His image. The Bible and Hindu scrip- tures declare it. A beggar who goes to a rich home and asks for alms receives a beggar's share,- but the son can have anything he asks from his wealthy father. Therefore we should not behave like beggars. Divine ones such as Krishna, Christ, and Buddha did not lie when they said we are made in the image of God. Yet we see that some people have everything, seemingly born with a silver spoon in their mouth, whereas others seem to attract failure and troubles. Where is the image of God in them? The power of Spirit lies within each one of us ; the ques- tion is how to develop it. If you will follow the lesson in my experiences with God, you are bound to find the result you are seeking.

Anxious, nervous actions do not draw the power I of God; but continuous, calm, powerful use of the will shakes the forces of creation and brings a response from the Infinite. The germ of success in whatever you want to accomplish is in your will power. Will that has been badly battered by diffi- culties becomes temporarily paralyzed. The resolute man who says, \"My body may be broken, but my head of will power remains unbowed,\" demonstrates the greatest expression of will. Will power is what makes you divine. When you give up using that will, you become a mortal man. Many people say we should not exercise our will to change conditions, lest we interfere with God's plan. But why would God give us will if we are not to use it? I once met a fanatical man who said he did not believe in using will power because it developed the ego. \"You are using a lot of will now to resist me!\" I replied. \"You are using it to talk, and you are obliged to use your will to stand, or walk, or eat, or go to the movies, or even to go to sleep. You will everything you do.

Therefore right prayer, when it is persistent, is will. You must believe in the possibility of what you are pray- ing for.

A home will not be dropped down to you from heaven,- you have to pour forth will power continuously through constructive actions. When you persist, refusing to ac- cept failure, the object of will must materialize. When you con- tinuously work that will through your thoughts and activities, what you are wishing for has to come about. Even though there is nothing in the world to conform to your wish, when your will persists, the desired result will somehow manifest. In that kind of will lies God's answer; because will comes from God, and continuous will is divine will. Cauterize the \"Can'ts\" in Your Brain A weak will is a mortal will. As soon as trials and failure cut it off, it loses is connection with the dynamo of the Infi- nite. But behind human will is the divine will that can never fail. Even death has no power to deter divine will. The Lord will definitely answer that prayer behind which the will force is continuous. Most people are mentally or physically lazy, or both. When they want to pray, they think instead of sleep, and when the head nods they dive into bed and that is the end of prayer. The will is buried. Mortal man's brain is full of \"can'ts.\" Being born in a family with certain characteristics and habits, he is influenced by these to think he can't do cer- tain things,- he can't walk much, he can't eat this, he can't stand that. Those \"can'ts\" have to be cauterized. You have within you the power to accomplish everything you want; that power lies in the will. Whoever would develop will power must have good com- pany. If your desire is to become a great mathematician, and your customary associates all dislike mathematics, you will certainly be discouraged.

Your mind may be satisfied that you are very religious, but unless your consciousness is satisfied with direct answers to your prayers, no amount of formal religion can save you. Of what benefit is praying to God if He does not answer? Difficult though it is to obtain His response, it can be done. To assure your ultimate arrival in heaven, you must test the power of your prayers until you have made them effective. When I was just a little child I made up my mind that when I prayed, my prayer had to be answered. That kind of determination is the way.

Most of them are like sponges; they draw everything out of you, and you seldom receive anything in return. It is worthwhile to be with others only if they are sincere and strong, and if each one is conscious of the other's sincerity and strength, so that you exchange noble soul qualities. Do not while away your time in idleness. A great many people occupy themselves with inconsequential activities. Ask them what they have been doing and they will usually say, \"Oh, I have been busy every minute!\" But they can scarcely ' remember what they were so busy about! Too many diversions, also, weaken your mental powers. If you go every day to the movies, they will lose their attraction, and you will become bored. Movies are all basically the same—lovers, heroes, and villains. We may enjoy a beautiful motion picture story, but life is seldom like that; if on the other hand it is too realistic, who wants to see more of life as it is, when he goes to be entertained? Life is very tricky and we must deal with it as it is. If we do not first master it ourselves we cannot help anyone else. In the seclusion of concentrated thought lies hidden the factory of all accomplishment. Remember that. In this factory continu- ously weave your will pattern for attaining success over oppos- ing difficulties. Exercise your will continuously. During the day and at night you have many opportunities to work in this factory, if you do not waste your time. At night I withdraw from the world's demands and am by myself, an absolute stranger to the world; it is a blank. Alone with my will power, I turn my thoughts in the desired direction until I have determined in my mind exactly what I wish to do and how to do it. Then I harness my will to the right activities and it creates success. In this way I have effectively used my will power many times. But it won't work unless the application of will power is continuous. It is a wonderful feeling to be able to say, and know, \"My will power, surcharged by the Divine Will, shall accomplish my aim.\" If you lazily leave everything to the Divine Power and neglect to use your God-given will, results will not be forth-coming.

But you do have to use your will to demand as His child, and to behave as His child. You must banish the thought that the Lord with His wonderful power is far away in heaven, and that you are a helpless little worm buried in difficulties down here on earth. Remember that behind your will is the great Divine Will; but that oceanic Power cannot come to your aid unless you are receptive. / Surcharge Your Will Power Through Concentration The way to become receptive is to sit quietly and concen- trate your thoughts on a worthy wish until your mind and thought become completely dissolved in that idea. Then will power becomes divine—omniscient and omnipotent—and can be successfully applied toward realizing your goal. You can't just sit there and wait for success to fall into your lap; once your course is set and your will is firm, you have to make a practical effort. Then you will see that whatever you require for success starts coming to you. Everything will push you in the right direction. In your divinely surcharged will power is the answer to prayer. When you use that will, you open the way through which your prayers can be answered. This is my experience. I used to attempt certain things just to test my will power,- but I don't do that anymore. I know it works. Once, long ago, I saw that one of my students was going wrong. Foreseeing the impending tragic results, I brought out every possible reason that might dissuade him from the course his life was taking; but I saw that no amount of my will power helped him, because he had made up his mind to follow the way of evil. \"All right,\" I told myself finally, \"it is 'good-bye'; let him go.\" But soon my great love and concern for him came to the fore again. I sat under a banyan tree and began to visualize him. Fervently and repeatedly I broadcast to him a mental message: \"God has told me to command you to return.\" By evening my body and mind were athrill with the intuition that he was coming.* At last, there he was at the gate; the \"prodigal son\" * Great masters enjoy a divine awareness that permeates the entire body. For example, their intuitive perception of the wrong thoughts of a disciple may be felt physically, like sharp pinpricks, similarly, harmonious, happy intuitions are sometimes accompanied by a pleasant tingling sensation.

There was no selfish motive in my desire; but I had made up my mind I wouldn't stir from this place until you came.\" That kind of determination can change the world. A marvellous power! So, deep prayer does work. The best time to pray is at night, when there are fewer distractions. If necessary, sleep a little in the evening so that you are wide awake when you have your prayers at night, and have it out with God. At first it will seem hard, but as you keep on trying it will become easier. You will be surprised at the results. As soon as your will becomes powerful, God begins to answer. And when the Infinite conde- scends to break His vow of silence, you will not be able to con- tain your joy. But if you have an egotistic desire to demonstrate to others the power of your prayers, or if you commercialize it, you will lose that power. God will respond to you no more; you will have frightened Him away. He comes only when you are sincere and when you love Him for His own sake. When you are impressed with yourself and want to show off, He sees that you seek, not Him, but fame and glorification of your ego, and He will not come. Who Will Persist Until God Answers? God is not a mute unfeeling Being. He is love itself. If you know how to meditate to make contact with Him, He will respond to your loving demands. You do not have to plead; you can demand as His child. But which of you will spend the nec- essary time? Which of you will persist until you become so concentrated that you receive an answer from Him? Suppose you have a mortgage on your home and you can- not meet it. Or there is a certain job you want. In the silence that comes after meditating deeply, concentrate with unswerv- ing will on the thought of your need. Do not keep looking for the result. If you sow a seed in the ground and then take it out every once in a while to see if it is growing, it will never sprout. Similarly, if every time you pray you look for a sign that the"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"ANSWERED PRAYERS 41 Lord is granting your wish, nothing will happen. Never try to test God. Just go on praying unceasingly. Your duty is to bring your need to God's attention, and to do your part in helping God to bring that desire to fruition. For example, in chronic diseases, do your best to help promote healing, but know in your mind that ultimately God alone can help. Take that thought with you into meditation every night, and with all your determination pray,- suddenly one day you will find the disease gone. First, the mind receives the suggestion. Then the Divine impregnates the mind with His power. Finally the brain releases the life energy to heal. You do not realize the power of God that is in your mind. It controls all the bodily functions. You can promote any condition in the body if you exercise that power of your mind. It is necessary first to learn the right method of meditation; then you can apply its divinely em- powered concentration to heal the body, or to help you in any other difficulty. Every day undertake something that is difficult for you, and try to do it. Though you fail five times, keep on, and as soon as you have succeeded in that direction, apply your con- centrated will on something else. You will thus be able to accomplish increasingly greater things. Will is the instrument of the image of God within you. In will lies His limitless power, the power that controls all the forces of nature. As you are made in His image, that power is yours to bring about whatever you desire: You can create prosperity,- you can change hatred into love.

Determine honestly whether or not your prayer is legiti- mate. Do not ask God for things that are quite impossible in the natural order of life. Ask only for true necessities. And know the difference between \"necessary necessities\" and \"unneces- sary necessities.\" The best way to cure yourself of desires for \"unnecessary necessities\" is to reason them away.

Now, as soon as I ask God about some undertaking, I know whether I should do it or not, and I know what steps I should and should not take. Be practical and earnest about prayer. Concentrate deeply on what you are praying. Before you seek a job, or sign a con- tract, or do anything important, think of that Power. Think of it continuously. Take time out of sleep.

In India we are taught the practical use of religion. We don't say, \"Well, I shall find out all about God in the hereafter.\" We want to know God now. Science and religion should go hand in hand. All the re- sults of scientific investigation are definite and are connected by reason, whereas religion is often dogmatic. When Jesus urged his disciples to have faith, he didn't mean blind belief. It breaks my heart when I see blind dogmatism, for it is one rea- son why the majority of people have no real interest in God. Although there are nevertheless many who are interested in God, real seekers are few, because hardly anyone tries to un- derstand his way out of this dream drama. Few of His children appreciate the gifts of the Heavenly Father, and of those who do, fewer still try deeply or scientifically enough to know Him. Those who want to seek Him earnestly should learn how to do so scientifically. By Yoga, Religion Can Be Made Scientific Yoga is definite and scientific.

And once they have said \"Amen\" after the sermon, they forget all about church until the next Sunday. Isn't that foolish? If you do not commune with God there, why should you go? The saints say that if you coax God earnestly enough, you can see Him. But you have to do it all yourself. It is good to meditate with a few others, but make the supreme effort alone at night, not just in church on Sundays. Get away from every- one. It is good for your health, your nerves, and your longevity not to mix too much with people. Most of them are thinking only of what you can give them.

His spiritual anguish became so intense that he felt life was no longer worth living. At this moment his eyes fell on a sword that was kept in the temple, and like a madman he seized it, with the intention of ending his life. In that moment the Mother revealed Herself in Her cosmic form. Her devotee was engulfed in an oceanic Bliss. In the very place where the saint had this experience, that same stone statue of the Divine Mother assumed a living from and spoke to me.t If I hadn't spent hours seeking God in meditation I would not have known that religion is a science. Intensity, secrecy, devotion, and constancy are necessary. You don't know when death will come. Every minute keep your mind on God. Every- thing you want and need is right within you; seek long and seek deeply. I meditate for hours; I see no one until I am fin- ished. You must make up your mind that you are not going to be bothered by anyone or anything. Then you won't know time.

People generally identify themselves with the body, which is supported by food; but they fail to realize that the basic source of bodily existence is prana (life energy).* No food or other outer aid can revive a man from whom the cosmic cur- rent has withdrawn. The link between man's material body and his immaterial mind is prana. The ancient Hindu sages discovered the exis- tence of prana and formulated the science of pranayama,i life- energy control. Lord Jesus fasted in the wilderness for forty days. He said: \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that pro- ceedeth out of the mouth of God.\"* The \"word\" is cosmic vibration,- the \"mouth of God\" is the medulla oblongata in the posterior part of the brain, taper- ing off into the spinal cord. This, the most vital spot in the hu- man body, is the divine entrance (\"mouth of God\") for the * \"Lifetrons,\" the finer-than-atomic energies that sustain life in all things in the universe. There are two kinds of prana: cosmic energy, the omnipresent source of life and vitality permeating and surrounding all living things; and the specific prana or energy pervading each human body. t Through pranayama the adept is able to control the life energy in the sen- sory and motor nerves, and thus free his mind from body-consciousness dur- ing meditation. He is able also to use this life energy to heal or vitalize his body at will. * Matthew 4:4. 55"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"56 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST \"word\" or Aum, * the cosmic vibratory energy by which man is sustained. People who never fast do not know from experience that man can live, as Christ did for forty days, solely by the \"word\" of God. In the early stages of a week's fasting, hunger is present; but as the days go by, less hunger and a sense of freedom are distinctly felt. Why? Because denial of gross food to the body compels it to depend on immaterial food: the life current. Man's will power is the great generator of energy. Through will power and willingness one is able to draw quickly on the infinite store of inner strength. A person who is unwilling to perform his daily tasks experiences a lack of energy. A man who works hard but with willingness is borne up physically and mentally by the cosmic current. One who learns and practises the metaphysical methods of living by will power and by consciously tapping the inex- haustible source of life energy is freed from many limitations of the body. The Hindu sages and yogis say that matter is materialized mind-stuff; and some of them, like Jesus, have proved this truth by demonstrating the power to materialize and demate- rialize their bodies and other physical objects. The Chemical Elements of Matter Are Electronic Vibrations Modern science shows that matter is composed of vibra- tory forces. The chemical elements, the structural factors re- sponsible for all forms in the universe—from stones and stars to man—are nothing more than different forms of electronic vibrations. For example, in ice we find coldness, weight, form; it is visible. Melt the ice; it becomes water. Pass electricity throught it; it becomes invisible hydrogen and oxygen, which analysed further, are forms of electronic vibrations. One may therefore say scientifically that ice does not exist, even though * Gross matter emanates from and is sustained by the intelligent cosmic vibration of God, the subtle building material of the universe. The primal prop- erties of this vibration are light and sound. Aum is the sound of God's creative vibration, referred to in Christian scriptures as the Amen, the Holy Ghost, and the Word.

In reality its essence is invisible electrons or forms of energy. In other words, that which can be dissolved into invisi- bility cannot be said to have valid existence. In this sense, matter can be considered as not existing; but matter does have relative existence. Matter exists in relation to our mind and as an expression of invisible electronic forces that do exist, being unchangeable and immortal. Both water and ice are manifestations of invisible gases and have only formal, transitory existence. Similarly, both mortal mind and matter are fleeting manifestations of Divine Consciousness, and possess merely formal existence; in reality only Cosmic Mind exists. Just as a child is born through the instrumentality of par- ents, so matter is dependent on mind for its existence. Matter is born from Divine Mind and is perceptible to mortal mind; in itself and of itself, matter has no reality, no intrinsic existence. The blind or nonintellectual electronic forces of creation are nevertheless creative teleological agents because they con- tain within themselves the vibrations of the universal, con- scious-of-itself life force or prana, which in turn issued from the fiat of Divinity. \"God said, Let there be light: and there was light,\"* that is, the projection of Divine Thought and Will became light or vibratory energy, the flowing forth of life current and electrons, which further vibrated more strongly and became the diverse subtle or unseen forces of nature, which in turn externalized themselves as the ninety-two principal elements of matter that constitute the universe. To human consciousness, matter is both perceptible and real. But man has discovered through theoretical investigation, through logic, and through certain laboratory experiments (such as converting a visible piece of ice into invisible forces) that a permanent and unalterable creative power must under- lie all the transitory and illusive forms of the phenomenal world. This truth may be grasped just as we grasp the fact that the * Genesis 1:3 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"58 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST ocean exists though its waves have no permanent existence, being just passing, formal manifestations of one great sub- stance.

To such enlightened ones, matter per se does not exist, because they see that beneath the slight rippling waves of creation is the changless Ocean of Spirit. The Universe Is God's Dream In the Vedantai and Yoga philosophies the universe is spo- ken of as God's dream. Matter and mind—the cosmos with its stars and planets; the gross surface waves and the subtle under- currents of the material creation; the human powers of feeling, will, and consciousness; and the states of life and death, day and night, health and disease, success and failure—are realities according to the law of relativity governing this dream of God's. All the dualities perceived by the law of relativity are real to the dreamer, the mortal man who plays his little part in the great cosmic dream. To escape from maya, illusion, the law of relativity, one must awaken from the dream into eternal God- wakefulness. We cannot change the lawful dream by imagina- tion or by denying its existence, or by accepting \"life\" but re- jecting \"death,\" or by recognizing health but ignoring sickness. One state is as much a part of its opposite state as are the two sides of a fabric. The dualities are inherently and essentially one.

Although some lives are without much interest and excitement, others are full of extraordinary experiences. I heard of a man who tried thirty- two times to commit suicide, and something happened every time to prevent him. Imagine what it would be like to know all about the lives of all the people who are now on earth, and those who are gone, and those who are yet to come! Such is God's power. Jesus said, \"Are not two sparrows sold for a far- thing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without [the knowledge of] your Father.\"* The lifetimes of experiences of all men are in God's memory. It is difficult indeed to con- ceive of a consciousness that is aware of everything that has ever happened. Yet to fathom the nature of Spirit is the great- est adventure in this universe. I will give you a picture of it as it is coming at this moment before my spiritual eye.t Truths are more than imagination; they are real. Yet their origin is a thought in the mind of God. All of the different forms of atomic matter, for example, are but materialized thoughts of God—they can be reconverted into thoughts, and the thoughts can again be materialized into objects. Man also has the power to conceive ideas, but his imagination is not very strong. If his imagination became powerful enough, man could create material objects on earth, t He has latent within * Matthew 10:29. t The telescopic gaze of intuition. During deep meditation the single or spiri- tual eye becomes visible within the central part of the forehead.

But it has become next to impossible for man to materialize his thoughts because he has not utilized the free power, the divine power of thought, bestowed on him by God. When we try to imagine the consciousness of God we wonder how He can remember all things, because we judge everything by the standard of our own mental capacity. We un- derstand according to our own experience. A person whose memory is not strong tends to assume that everyone else's memory is the same way. Yet there are persons of exceptional memory who can recall a whole book, perhaps, just as easily as you can remember a few lines. Those who are forgetful find it difficult to realize that others can have an unfailing power of recollection. A jeweller remembers his jewels, a bookkeeper the figures in his books,- so God is able to remember everything that He has created in this universe. Being gifted with almighty power, He has instant recall of everything that has ever happened. God does not need a limited physical brain to remember what has passed. His limitless consciousness is all-knowing. The Origin and Power of Memory Memory is a wondrous power. All human memory comes from God's tremendous memory. For example, you cannot tell me about all the motion pictures you have seen since birth, but if I were to show you one of those films again, you would instantly recall it. The divine underlying memory is right there within you, ever recognizing experiences that have passed. As soon as you see the opening scene again, the whole story comes back to you. \"Oh, I saw this picture before,\" you say. \"I remember how it ended.\" How is it that we can recognize a picture—every detail of it—that we have seen years ago? Because all happenings are recorded in the brain. As soon as you put the needle of atten- tion on a certain record of experience, your memory begins to play back that experience. If I ask where you were sitting when me— I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also,- and greater works than these shall he do...\" (John 14:11-12)."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"62 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST we were here together last Thursday, you recall it and begin to remember other things as well. If I ask, \"What did I say?\" my words start coming back to you. The inner power of memory comes from God and is per- fect. It never forgets. The ordinary man's memory cannot hold the consciousness of all experiences at one time, but the un- derlying divine memory retains everything simultaneously and permanently. Therefore good or poor memory is a matter of conviction. You have convinced yourself that you have a weak memory and so you have a weak memory. However, it is not easy to jump from this belief to the opposite. Much effort is re- quired to convince yourself that yotir memory is in actuality a manifestation of the all-recalling divine memory of God. The greatest human memory is naught but a borrowing from the unlimited consciousness of God, in which are recorded all the adventures of all human beings and other life- forms. Creation—Dual Adventure of God and Man The story of God's creation is marvellous—how He pro- jected into existence all beings on this earth, and how He is working behind the scenes to bring us back to our real exis- tence in Him. It is almost impossible to describe in human lan- guage the cosmic adventure of God's creation and its subtle in- tertwining with the individual life-adventures of countless human beings. We find that human beings live on the average sixty years, the crocodile from sixty to a hundred. The redwood tree lives for two thousand years, the dog only about fourteen, and the horse at most about thirty-six years. It is evident that Someone has fixed these various life-spans.

It is possible to imagine that under favourable conditions (and if there is no waste of vital essence,t and there is proper food and right thinking) the human body could go on indefi- nitely. But the pressures on the body are terrific. When a mouse is caught in a trap, its heart beats many times faster than it does normally, and when you are unable to pay your bills, your heart does the same! Thus worry takes its toll. And there are other kinds of stress. I am told that the Police Commissioner of Chicago has demonstrated with instruments the possibility that if noise were taken away from the cities, their residents would live ten years longer. We are living in a wonderful world nevertheless. Those who exist only to \"eat, drink, and be merry/' and to sleep, have no idea of the wonders fo human life. The adventure begins with the struggle the soul goes through to enter a womb at the time of conception. In the as- tral world* there are millions of souls struggling to return to earth, to enter the mated sperm and ovum cells at the time of conception.

He weighed three hundred pounds, although he rarely ate. Often he would meditate for days, seated on top of the Ganges waters; or remain some- times hidden for long periods under its waves. He was often seen at the Manikarnika Ghat, sitting motionless in the sun on the blistering stone slabs. His habitual disregard of nature's laws was a constant reminder to those who saw him that oneness with God is the highest law. t The vital essence, or sexual fluid, contains a high concentration of prana. If not dissipated, the power therein can be used to enhance physical health, men- tal vitality and creativity, and spiritual development. * \"In my Father's house are many mansions...\" ( John 14:2 Bible). The high and low astral spheres, composed of subtle light and energies of lifetrons, are the heaven (or hell) to which souls go after death of the physical body.

At the time of conception there is a flash in the ether and one soul enters as the sperm and ovum cells unite. You had to fight to get into the womb. Not only you but many souls rushed to enter, and the ones that won are you, and you, and I. It was not an easy victory. Prenatal Consciousness After you have entered the womb you ask, \"What have I done? I have been free from the confining mortal body for so long, gliding along in a weightless body of light, and now I am caught again in a physical form.\" Nevertheless, you become accustomed to these new conditions during the nine months in the womb. That is the punishment. It is nine months of living in a dungeon in which you have to breathe through someone else, eat through someone else, receive your blood, and the power for its circulation, through someone else. You are de- pendent. Your soul cries to the Lord, \"Let me out of this prison! I can't see, I can't hear, I am bound.\" If there is a hades or purgatory it is those nine months in the mother's body—helpless, in darkness, bound to one spot like a tree, with only occasional memories of the past coming in, and then lapses into sleep. It is when memories of the past life come that you struggle in the mother's body. I have trans- ported my consciousness into these prenatal states and I know what I am saying.* The baby's sleep and wakefulness in the mother's body do not depend on her sleeping and waking. The child's will to move is a memory coming from the soul's past. So he stirs restlessly in the mother's body until he tires and goes to sleep. Then he wakes up fo a while and moves again. He feels hunger, and, through the nourishment in the mother's blood, the satisfaction of his hunger. The infant slightly hears the vibrations of the mother's heartbeat and circulation; by these sounds he is made con- scious of his body and he wants to be free. Thus the soul's first adventure is the fight between two ideas: the wish to return to earth in a human form, and the desire to feel the freedom of having no form. * It is possible for the advanced yogi, through his interior union with om- nipresent God, to perceive sympathetically the experiences of all beings."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"MAN'S GREATEST ADVENTURE 65 The soul's human encasement starts out as a fishlike form with a tiny tail. That form grows into an animal form, curled up in the womb. There comes an occasional memory of the past life, and the embryo stirs. The struggle becomes greater as the embryo begins to grow into a human form in the mother's body. The soul cries, \"Let me out!\" When the will becomes very strong, the baby is born. Premature babies are souls who are very stubborn-willed. They don't want to remain nine months in the mother's body, and so they come early. The Breath of Life The infant arrives in this world crying; because, the saints say, the soul remembers its previous incarnations and does not like the thought of coming back to earth again to go through the struggle of life here. Related also to this memory is the at- titude of supplication in which a baby usually holds its hands before it comes into the world. It is praying to God, \"Please don't give me physical birth again.\" The physiological explanation of the baby's crying is that the lungs must be opened up in order to start the breathing process, and the baby's first cry is an effort to activate the lungs and start the breath of life. When the baby is born, the breath goes in, and the soul that was semi-dormant becomes a living being with an independent life. \"God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\"* Many per- sons mistakenly believe that the soul enters the body at birth, but if the soul were not already there, the body would not have developed from the original tiny cells. Should the soul leave the embryo before birth, the infant will be born dead. Man's body is made of sixteen basic material elements supported and activated by nineteen elementst of subtle en- ergy. These can be condensed into pure consciousness. \"Man became a living soul\" refers to the fact that the ordinary man's physical body, which is made of chemicals (\"the dust of the * Genesis 2:7 (Bible). t The essence of the astral body that dwells within man's physical form, activating and enlivening it.

He sees that con- ditions seem to be normal—he has a physical body again. His prenatal resistance to birth ends with his first breath, when maya (the cosmic delusion that \"existence\" depends on body and breath) comes over him. He feels once more attracted to the physical world. As time goes on the baby struggles for control over his body. How often you see him repeatedly thrusting his hands and feet up in the air in an attempt at coordination! All these actions are directed by the subconscious mind through the soul's memory of the past. That memory is always there. You instinctively fear death because you remember the many times you have been through that experience. You are also afraid of pain because you have suffered many times before. When the baby grows into a little child he is surrounded by the influences of the mother's and father's guiding will, and the wills of other relatives as well. Each one wants him to be something different, and his naughty friends want him to be still something else! The child has a great many struggles with these conflict- ing pressures. This is a miserable life, so it is good to give your children a little freedom. Young ones who are given too much freedom, however, may later lament, \"I wish I had been told long ago not to do this,- then I would not be what I am today.\" Think of all the struggles, physiological and mental, one has to go through until he becomes a youth. At that time of life the senses become more active and the youth has a great inner bat- tle with himself. The struggle with the senses is a tremendous contest. To conquer in this adventure of youth, to go victori- ously through this thrill of living, is a great experience.

But in so many of life's expe- riences there seems to be a leak in our lifeboat, no matter what precautions we have taken. In a jungle infested with animals you can take reasonable care against them, but subtle dangers are more difficult to overcome. How to protect oneself against a barrage of germs?

If your blood is weak, the soldiers will not be able to help you. In the lungs of many unsuspecting persons lurk fierce tuberculosis bacilli, ready to destroy their host. Nature forms a restraining wall of cells around them, but it is effective only so long as the body can keep up its resistance. This struggle of life goes on constantly in the unseen jungle of life within! If you could examine your food under a micro- scope you would not eat it.

God has given us one tremendous instrument of protec- tion—more powerful than machine guns, electricity, poison gas, or any medicine—the mind. It is the mind that must be strengthened. As for the body, I will do only the will of God. If He tells me to go to a doctor, it is all right, and if He tells me to suffer, it is all right. Whatever is His will is my will.

If you have cut your finger, put iodine on it, but inwardly pary: \"Lord, help me not to be dependent on medi- cine, but to rely on mind power alone.\" You have not been taught how to attain that mental state.

I now see that they are not really agents for my destruction; You have put me on earth to test my power. I am going through these tests only to prove myself. I am game to fight the evils that surround me; I will vanquish them by the almightiness of Your presence. And when I shall have passed through the adventure of this life I will say: 'Lord, it was hard to be brave and fight; but the greater my terror, the greater was the strength within me, given by You, by which I conquered and realized that I am made in Your image. You are the King of this universe and I am Your child, a prince of the universe. What have I to fear?'\" As soon as you realize you have been born a human being you have everything to fear. There seems to be no escape. No matter what precautions you take, there is always a misstep somewhere. Your only security is in God. Whether you are in the African jungle or at war or racked by disease and poverty, just say to the Lord, and believe: \"I am in the armoured car of Your presence, moving across the battlefield of life. I am protected.\" There is no other way to be safe. Use common sense and trust fully in God. I am not suggesting something eccentric,-1 am urging you to affirm and believe, no matter what happens, in this truth: \"Lord, it is You alone who can help me.\"* So many have fallen into ruts of disease and wrong habits and have not pulled themselves out. Never say you cannot escape. Your misfortune is only for a time. The failure of one life is not the measure of whether or not you are a success. The attitude of the conquering man is unafraid: \"I am a child of God. I have nothing to fear.\" So fear nothing. Life and death are only different processes of your consciousness. * \"To men who meditate on Me as their Very Own, ever united to Me by in- cessant worship, I supply their deficiencies and make permanent their gains\" (Bhagavad Gita EX:22)."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"MAN'S GREATEST ADVENTURE 71 Everything the Lord has created is to try us, to bring out the buried soul immortality within us.

When disease comes and the body stops working, the soul thinks, \"I am dead!\" But the Lord shakes the soul and says: \"What is the matter with you? You are not dead. Are you not still thinking?\" A soldier is walking along and a bomb shatters his body. His soul cries, \"Oh, I am killed, Lord!\" And God says, \"Of course not! Are you not talking to Me?

As time is marching on, so must your souls march on to a greater expansion of your life in Spirit. The initiative to undertake your most important duty in life is often buried beneath the accumulated debris of human habits. You must free yourselves from their stultifying influ- ence and start to sow the seeds of the success that you desire. Life is worthwhile when you are accomplishing the most es- sential work, which is to find out the meaning and true values of your existence. Man should be instructed by this cosmic motion picture of life. It is not being shown without a reason. Each day we be- hold different scenes, and each day has a lesson to teach. You are meant to learn the lesson by concentrating on the supreme purpose of human existence: to know Who is behind your life. Without Self-Analysis, Man Leads Robotlike Life Millions of people never analyse themselves. Mentally they are mechanical products of the factory of their environ- ment, preoccupied with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, working and sleeping, and going here and there to be entertained. They don't know what or why they are seeking, nor why they never realize complete happiness and lasting satisfaction. By evading self-analysis, people go on being robots, conditioned by their environment. True self-analysis is the greatest art of progress. Everyone should learn to analyse himself dispassionately.

Most people don't change because they don't see their own faults. Everyone is the product of his heredity and environment. If you were born in America you reflect distinctive American characteristics. If you were born in China or England, you are likely to reflect the interests of those nationalities. Your envi- ronment is the result of your true heredity—the traits and de- sires acquired by you in past lives. This heredity of past incar- nations has led to your being born in the particular family and environment in which you now find yourself. When we read about the families of important people, we often note that sons of great men are not necessarily of the same mental calibre as their fathers. This failure of biological heredity in man raises a great doubt in our minds: why don't we find the same results in human life that we observe in the plant and animal kingdoms, where good pedigree usually pro- duces good offspring? We must probe the inner life of man for an answer. Traits from Past Lives Influence Us Now In a literary family it is not unusual to find a boy who doesn't like literature at all. He has been brought up with literature-loving companions, yet has no affinity for it. Why? Environment or heredity in the ordinary sense does not explain it. But beyond these factors is reincarnation. We are born into a particular family because of certain characteristics that are similar. But every person in a family is an individual soul who brings his own distinctive traits from his past lives. Hence there are always some biological hereditary resemblances in families, yet each person is different in character. A man takes birth in a certain family, a particular social and national environment, owing to specific causes—his own past actions. Therefore man is the architect of his own destiny. One can almost predict what he will be in his next life by analysing his dominant interests and habits in this one.

But if you analyse yourself and see that you are becoming morose from constant reading of this type of literature, you will wish to form a new habit of perusing inspiring spiritual books. By doing so you will change the course of your life. We can alter ourselves very quickly with strong determination; but without it, one does not change effortlessly or in a minute the habit patterns of years. To eradicate a habit of long standing you must ap- ply the full strength of your determination in counteractiv- ity until the bad habit is worn out. Most persons don't have the necessary patience. But everyone should feel encouraged by this truth: whatever you have created or done, you can undo. When you analyse what you are, have a firm desire to banish your weaknesses and to make yourself what you ought to be. Don't allow yourself to be overwhelmed with discour- agement at the revelation of your shortcomings that honest self-analysis usually brings. Thought Produces Everything in the Universe A theory has been advanced that thought is a product of the endocrine glands. Such a conception is unfounded. Flesh cannot produce thought. Mind is the architect of the micro- cosm and the macrocosm. As water by cooling and condensa- tion becomes ice, so thought by condensation assumes physi- cal form. Everything in the universe is thought in material form. The endocrine organ is just a physical structurization of a microcosmic thought-blueprint. The physical and mental aspects of man are closely inter- related; it is commonly observed that a person whose liver is out of order becomes cranky. When you are bilious, you don't feel like smiling and saying \"Peace\" to everyone! You feel un- amiable. Your thoughts and emotions are affected by your physical state. A weakening of the organs has a corresponding weakening effect on mental power. Those who eat a great deal of meat are often surly and full of vexation.

He said he was seventy years old, and that he never feels cold. He didn't even wear socks! He had accustomed his body to chilly weather. Mind influences body more than vice versa, but the bodily chemicals do exercise a constant influence on the mind.t Body and mind are interdependent. Dreams Reveal the Omnipotence of Mind For example, suppose I am dreaming that I am awake and in the kitchen, and very hungry. I eat something and drink a glass of milk. My hunger and thirst are gone, and I feel satis- fied. What was the cause of my satisfaction? Was it the food? Remember, I am dreaming. Is it not simply a change of thought that made me feel satisfied? Since I am dreaming, it is my mind that thought it had taken food. The hunger and the food and the milk were only ideas in my dream. All were made of the same mind-stuff. When I wake up I realize that my experiences were nothing but a series of ideas. A mere change of thought removed the unpleasant sensation of hunger and substituted the pleasant sensation of eating food and drinking milk. So you see, thought by itself can do anything. Once I was travelling by train when the weather was ex- tremely hot; the air felt as if it were coming from a furnace. * Overeating and improper eating create in the body excessive toxins that have a definite negative effect on the mind, making it both sluggish and irritable. Occasional fasting on grape or orange juice has a cleansing effect on the system, which in turn vitalizes the brain. Such fasts, undertaken one day a week, or occasionally for three days at a time, have been found effective in helping to keep the body properly cleansed of impurities. Fasting for longer than three days at a time should be under the supervision of someone well trained in the science of fasting. t Serious research on the effect of diet and nutrition on mental health was begun many years after Paramahansa Yogananda had made this observation. Persons from poverty areas who were denied proper nourishments showed decidedly slower mental development and responses. In addition, science has shown that some forms of insanity (heretofore considered incurable) im- proved remarkably with the simple administration of vitamins, and the causes of certain forms of depression, anxiety, and other emotions can be traced to chemical imbalances in the system.

I had said to myself: \"Lord, the same electricity that makes heat in a furnace makes ice in a refrigerator. Therefore why shouldn't I be able to redirect that electricity of Yours to produce cold right now?\" In that instant I felt as if a sheet of ice had enveloped me. Change Your Mental Attitude We should bear in mind, however, that it is not wise to dis- regard the body wholly. One should eat proper foods in prefer- ence to wrong foods. And if you must live with people who make you nervous, then once in a while you should change your surroundings. But it is better still if you can change your mental environment, so that you won't be disturbed by others' actions. Change yourself, and you can then live anywhere in peace and happiness. Most of the world is like a mental hospital. Some people are sick with jealousy, others with anger, hatred, passion. They are victims of their habits and emotions. But you can make your home a place of peace. Analyse yourself. All emotions are reflected in the body and mind. Envy and fear cause the face to pale, and love makes it glow. Learn to be calm and you will always be happy. So remember, whatever type of ego you have, whatever personality you are trying to express, you should make an ef- fort to analyse your true nature and to develop its best quali- ties. One may have a moral ego or a patriotic ego or an artistic ego or a businessman's ego, and so on. If morality is your ideal, live uprightly and express your goodwill to all. That is real morality. It is pride that makes self-righteous persons so ready to judge those about them who are weak. True morality in- cludes compassion for others in their ignorant wrongdoings. Those who are products of the material ego suffer much and needlessly. Such persons should learn self-control; other- wise they are just like pieces of matter in action—they have to smoke so many times a day, they must eat certain foods, they always get a headache if they miss their lunch, they can sleep only in a particular kind of bed. It is all right to utilize creature"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"78 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST comforts, but never be enslaved by them. If you are a cross between an intellectual and a materialis- tic ego, that is better. But unless you develop and maintain a balanced nature—intellectually, materially, and spiritually— you are not going to be happy. Your spiritual intuition tells you how to control your life, so that you are not mastered by it. It is unwise to let the materialistic ego govern your judgment; your conscience and intuition should decide. The Conditions of Happiness: Plain Living, High Thinking Plain living and high thinking should be your goal. Learn to carry all the conditions of happiness within yourself by med- itating and attuning your consciousness to the ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Joy, which is God. Your happiness should never be subject to any outside influence. Whatever your environment is, don't allow your inner peace to be touched by it. Analyse yourself; make yourself what you should be and what you want to be. People seldom learn true self-control; they do things that are detrimental to their high- est welfare and think they are making themselves happy; but they are not. To be able to do things when and because you ought to do them, and to refrain from doing what you know is injurious—these are keys to real success and happiness. Don't keep your mind engaged in too many activities. Analyse what you get from them, and see if they are really im- portant. Don't waste your time. To read a good book improves you much more than seeing movies. I often say, \"If you read for one hour, write in your spiritual diary for two hours; and if you write for two hours, think for three hours; and if you think for three hours, meditate all the time.\" No matter where I go, I keep my mind continuously on my soul peace. You too should always point the needle of your attention toward the North Pole of spiritual joy. Then no one can ever disturb your equilibrium. Remember, if each day does not find you a better person than you were the day before, you are going backward—in health, in mental peace, and in soul joy. Why? Because you don't exercise enough control over your actions. You yourself made your habits, and you can change them.

A change of company can make a great difference to you. When you come here, even for these few hours, your mentality changes; you feel a refreshing peace. When you go to a dance or a party your mind is often restless, nervous, and excited. Afterward, if you enter a differ- ent, calmer atmosphere, you feel more peaceful again. The greatest influence in your life, stronger even than your will power, is your environment. Change that, if necessary. Until you are mentally strong, you can never be what you want to be without a good environment to help you. When you are having difficulty in trying to change for the better, spiritual company and other uplifting influences are essential. Self-analysis is also essential to help you better yourself. If you can analyse yourself fearlessly, you will be able to stand the critical analysis of others without flinching. Those who like to dwell on the faults of others are human vultures. There is already too much evil in the world. Don't talk of evil, don't think of evil, and don't do evil. Be like a rose, wafting to all the sweet fragrance of soul goodness. Make everyone feel that you are a friend; that you are a helper, not a destroyer. If you want to be good, analyse yourself and develop the virtues in you. Banish the thought that evil has any part in your nature, and it will drop off. Make everyone else feel that you are an image of God, not by your words but by your behaviour. Emphasize the light, and darkness will be no more. Study, meditate, and do good to others. Seclusion Is the Price of Greatness Seclusion is the price of greatness. Be alone within.

Physical sickness is due to different forms of toxic con- ditions, infectious disease, and accidents. Mental sickness is caused by fear, worry, anger and other emotional inharmonies. Soul sickness is due to man's ignorance of his true relationship with God. Ignorance is the supreme disease. When one banishes ignorance he also banishes the causes of all physical, mental, and spiritual disease. My guru, Sri Yukteswarji, often said, \"Wisdom is the greatest cleanser.\" Trying to overcome various kinds of suffering by the lim- ited power of material curative methods is often disappointing. Only in the unlimited power of spiritual methods may man find a permanent cure for the \"dis-ease\" of body, mind, and soul. That boundless power of healing is to be sought in God. If you have suffered mentally over the loss of loved ones, you can find them again in God. All things are possible with His help. Unless one really knows God, he is not justified in saying that only mind exists, and that one does not need to obey health laws or to use any physical aids for healing. Until actual realization is attained, one should use his common sense in all he does. At the same time one should never doubt God, but should constantly affirm his faith in God's omnipresent divine power.

However, not every disease responds to medicine and 81"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"82 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST surgery, and therein lies the essential limitation of these methods. Chemicals and medicines affect only the outer physical composition of the bodily cells and do not alter the inner atomic structure or life principle of the cells. In many cases no cure of disease is possible until the healing power of God has corrected, from within, the imbalance of \"lifetrons\" or intelli- gent life energy in the body. The two basic causes of disease are underactivity and overactivity of the life energy, prana, that structures and sustains the body. The improper functioning of any one (or more) of the five governing pranic currents— vyana, circulation,- udana, metabolism; samana, assimilation,- prana, crystallization; and apana, elimination—adversely affects bod- ily health. When the natural harmonious balance of these sub- tle energies is restored by God's divine power, the atomic bal- ance of the physical cells they nourish is restored; the healing is perfect, and often instantaneous. So long as balanced vital- ity is maintained by right living, proper diet, and pranayama meditation (life-energy control techniques), the body's own life energy \"electrocutes\" disease before it can develop. Balanced Development Is Essential Injury and disease are more often the cause of death than is old age. Most people die before true old age has set in. In some cases, and they are exceptional, all parts of the body grow weak at once; such persons die, without pain, like ripe fruit that falls in due time from the tree. But the majority are plucked from the tree of life before they are really ripe for death. In most cases of death, one bodily part had ceased func- tioning before the rest. It may also happen that if one part is stronger or more developed than another, the resulting imbal- ance of the life force in the body may cause suffering and even death. For example, someone with a weak heart in a strong- muscled body may injure his heart by overuse of his muscular strength.

Overexercise that leads to unbalanced devel- opment may thus have harmful consequences. The Self-Realization Fellowship [Yogoda Satsanga] Ener- gization Exercises* place the least strain on the heart and pro- vide for a uniform development of the body. Simple outdoor exercise, such as walking; balanced diet and moderation in eating; and quiet meditation are all conducive to health. Obey Nature's Laws and Have More Faith in God A master may ignore, without ill effect, dietary and other rules for health. The ordinary individual, however, should be careful to maintain physical well-being by right observance of the laws of nature. One's diet should be wisely chosen. The body requires for health certain amounts of starch, protein, and fat, but in excess they can be harmful. Very little starch is necessary,- bread is no longer held to be the \"staff of life.\" Too much starch in the diet, especially from white flour, causes an over-accumulation of mucus in the body. (A certain amount of mucus is necessary, of course, to prevent the entry of harmful microbes into the mucous membranes.) Eat abundantly of foods that contain a high proportion of mineral salts, such as fruits and vegetables. This type of diet prevents constipation, which, when present, predisposes the body to many diseases. Nature tries by reflex action to remove causes of physical distress. When dust gets into the eye, we involuntarily try to wink the dust away. When dirt or dust enters the nose, we sneeze. If we eat something unwholesome, we get rid of it by regurgitation. When disease attacks any internal organ of the body, nature provides many means by which the organ may protect, defend, and renew itself. However, owing to various habits of living that alienate most men from nature, their in- nate powers of recuperation and rejuvenation become impaired and are prematurely lost.

But an un- limited source of protection for man lies in his strong thought that, as a child of God, he cannot be affected by disease. Mind has much greater power than medicine. But to deny any power to medicine is unreasonable, because if drugs have no power, a man could take poison and not die. While one should not deny the potency of medicines and drugs, one should understand that continuous dependence on them will prove their limitations; a time will come when they will lose their former efficacy in restoring the body to health. The only infinite power of healing lies in man's mind and soul. The body cannot be healed by spiritual means if the mental power and faith are weak. Permanent healing comes through the bound- less power of the mind and through God's grace. Fruits, Vegetables, and Nuts Superior to Meat According to one school of thought, some diseases may be cured by eating the organs of animals. A savage devours the heart of a lion in the belief that his own heart will thus be invigorated. The tissues of chicken hearts are known to have a strengthening effect on the heart of man; and the liver helps those who are anemic. However, many health authorities state that iron- and vitamin-rich foods such as eggs, cashew nuts, soybeans, molasses, dried apricots, dried lima beans, dried peas, parsnips, spinach, and parsley may successfully be substituted for liver in overcoming anemia. Pepsin taken from animal organs is useful in cases of stomach ulcers,- but papain, a substance very similar to pepsin, is also present in the fruit of the papaya, which is a valuable healing aid to those who suffer from any form of impaired digestion. When man is sick he may feel justified in eating anything that has healing value, but animal flesh is not actually neces- sary for this purpose; indeed, it may increase the bodily burden by contributing toxins to the bloodstream. Thus, while flesh foods may aid in healing one illness, they sometimes create a condition whereby another disease may develop elsewhere in the body. That is why the safest diet for man is fresh fruits, vegetables, finely ground nuts, and vegetable and diary pro- teins. In certain cases the system may not tolerate raw fruits"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"HEALING BY GOD'S UNLIMITED POWER 85 and vegetables, but the average person will benefit by includ- ing them daily in his diet. In vegetables and fruits God has infused medicinal power to help in overcoming disease. Even these, however, have but a limited potency. The organs of the body are essentially sus- tained by the energy of God, and the person who employs var- ious methods to increase this energy will have at his command a greater power for healing than is afforded by any medicine or diet. Purify the Body of Harmful Toxins Three-fourths of the body consists of water; hence the bod- ily demand for water is much greater than that for food. (Death by thirst is a suffering more acute than death by starvation.) It is important to give the body plenty of water. Drinking unsweetened fruit juices also is good. In localities where water has a calcium content high enough to dispose toward harden- ing of the arteries in man, he should take, instead, fruit juices and watermelons, cantaloupes, and similar juicy fruits. Some health researchers say, however, that persons who have sinus trouble should not take citrus juices. Make it a point to drink plenty of liquids (and I do not mean soda-water beverages!) to wash away toxins in the body. But avoid drinking liquids with meals, as this can be injurious to digestion. One tends to wash down the food without chew- ing it properly. If starches are not partially digested in the mouth, they often do not digest fully in the stomach. To chew food well is important—the stomach has no teeth. Hasty eat- ing is harmful; particularly if large amounts of liquid are taken with the meal, thus diluting the gastric juices. Also, drinking liquids with meals gives a tendency to obesity. It is important to keep the bloodstream healthy. Beef and pork may release into the bloodstream toxic poisons and mi- crobes. The white corpuscles try to destroy the microbes, but if the latter are strong and if the white corpuscles are insuffi- cient to resist them, toxic reactions set in. For meat eaters, fish, chicken, and lamb are preferable to beef and pork, which are highly acid-producing. The most important principle in connection with eating is"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"86 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST to avoid any form of overindulgence. As one learns to restrain himself he becomes healthier. It may often happen that one's desire for a certain food is so great that he thinks he cannot re- sist it. His senses dictate to him, saying that he must eat that food, even when he knows it may be harmful to him. If he re- fuses to perpetuate his bad habits, he will find that he comes to dislike what is injurious and to like what is beneficial. Greedy people fill themselves and still they are looking for more food. By overeating, they dare to strain a heart-pump that has been overworked for perhaps forty years! Many persons thoughtlessly eat late at night. Usually sleep soon follows, during which man's internal machinery slows down. The food may lie in the stomach without being properly digested. Eating shortly before the nightly rest is therefore unwise. There is nothing worse for body and mind, however, than drinking intoxicating liquors. Under their influence a man may do things that in his right mind he would be ashamed to do. Vi- olence, greed, lust for money and sex, even murder, may result from drunkenness. The belief that wine, sex experiences, and money will bring happiness is said by the sages to be the chief delusion that man must overcome in order to realize his true nature. Liquor increases man's desires for money and sex, and it is therefore the worst evil of the three. It is an unnecessary and extremely dangerous indulgence, because it stifles reason. A drunken man is no longer a true man. It is wisdom to strive to maintain only normal appetites. Increase Your Natural Resistance to Disease Fasting is a natural method of healing. When animals or savages are sick, they fast. The bodily machinery thus has an opportunity to cleanse itself and to obtain a much-needed rest. Most diseases can be cured by judicious fasting.* Unless one has a weak heart, regular short fasts have been recommended * In Armenia, Dr. Grant Sarkisyan has successfully used fasting to treat pa- tients for a variety of disorders, including bronchial asthma, skin diseases, the initial state of arteriosclerosis, hypertension, stenocardia, and digestive tract diseases. A selective diet is to be followed after discharge from the hospital,"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"HEALING BY GOD'S UNLIMITED POWER 87 by the yogis as an excellent health measure. Another good method of physical healing is through suitable herbs or herb extracts. In using medicines, one often finds that they are not pow- erful enough to bring about a healing, or that they are so pow- erful that they irritate the bodily tissues instead of healing them. Similarly, exposure to certain types of \"healing rays\" will burn the tissues. There are so many limitations in physi- cal methods of healing! Better than medicines are the rays of the sun. In them is a wonderful healing power. One should take a ten-minute sun- bath every day. Ten minutes a day is better than only occa- sional exposure for longer periods*. A short sunbath daily, re- inforced by good health habits, will keep the body supplied with sufficient life energy to destroy all harmful microbes. Healthy persons possess a natural resistance to disease, and particularly to infections. Illness comes when the resisting power of the blood has been diminished by wrong eating or by overeating, or when overindulgence in sex has depleted the vital energy. To conserve the physical creative energy is to supply all the cells with vibrant life energy,- the body then the perference being for vegetable and fruit dishes, which Dr. Sarkisyan feels are important for longevity. In the Soviet Union, Dr. Uri Nicholayev has given fasting therapy during the past twenty-three years. He states that sixty-four percent of his patients have been helped. Their illness is mental: schizophrenia. At George Air force Base, Victorville, California, twenty-five patients un- derwent fasting treatment for up to eighty-four days for obesity. Sixteen com- pleted the program, with weight losses of forty to one hundred pounds. Dr. Robert M. Karns, who conducted the experiment, also reported that a fortyeight-years-old diabetic patient, who was receiving twenty-five units of insulin daily before the fast, was able to discontinue the insulin treatment af- ter the fast. A sixty-year-old patient reported improvement of an arthritic and heart condition. In experiments with mice, which are often the testing ground for treat- ment of man's disorders, it was demonstrated that the life-span could be in- creased by fifty percent. The treatment? Fasting.

Many doctors agree that it is easily possible to increase one's life span by careful living. Mahavatar Babaji and a number of other great masters have lived for several hundred years. Life may be prolonged indefinitely—not by food, medicine, exercise, sunbathing, and other limited means, but by contact with the immeasurable power of God.

The key to all power lies in the mind. If one fails to cultivate that power, when serious disease comes he may die without making any resistance, regardless of his age.

The happy man is less sub- ject to disease, for happiness actually attracts into the body a greater supply of the universal life energy. There are many things to talk about on this subject of healing. The main idea is that we should depend more on mind power, which is illimitable. The rules for guarding against dis- ease should be: self-control, exercise, proper eating, drinking plenty of fruit juices, occasional fasting, and smiling all the time—from within. Those smiles come from meditation. You will find then the eternal power of God. When you are in ec- stasy with Him you consciously bring His healing presence into your body. Permanent Healing Comes from God Mind power carries with it the unfailing energy of God; that is the power you want in your body. And there is a way to bring in that power. The way is communion with God by med- itation. When your communion with Him is perfect, the heal- ing is permanent. When the causative power of God comes, the healing effect is instantaneous,- no time is required for cause to ripen into effect. Many people in distress try to evoke that power, but when they are not healed at once they lose faith in the Lord instead of continuing to try to enlist His aid. The man who clings to the Divine is bound to be healed; because God knows that the devotee is praying, and He cannot but respond. But when you give up, the Father says, \"All right.

You should eat rightly and do whatever else is necessary for the body, but continuously pray to Him: \"Lord, Thou canst heal me because Thou dost control the life atoms and subtle conditions of the body that doctors cannot reach with medicines.\" The external factors of medicines and fasting have a certain beneficial effect on the physical body, but they do not affect the inner force that sustains the cells.

What is the difference between ice cream and hot coffee in a dream experience? When you awaken, you realize that in the dreamland ice cream was one thought and hot coffee another; they were merely two different ideas. Thought has omniscient power. The kind of thought I am speaking of is the thought of God. As He is omnipresent through thought, so are we. Are we not already connecting the thought of America and the thought of India by radio? There is no space there. Often when you are trying to tune in a radio station, sta- tic comes in and disturbs the program you are trying to hear. Likewise, when you are trying to accomplish some personal transformation in your heart, \"static\" may interrupt your progress. That static is your bad habits. Fear Cannot Enter a Quiet Heart Fear is another form of static that affects your mind-radio. Like good and bad habits, fear can be both constructive and destructive. For example, when a wife says, \"My husband will be displeased if I go out this evening; therefore I won't go,\" she is motivated by loving fear, which is constructive. Loving fear and slavish fear are different. I am speaking of loving fear, which makes one cautious lest he hurt someone unnecessar- ily. Slavish fear paralyses the will. Family members should en- tertain only loving fear, and never be afraid to speak truth to one another. To perform dutiful actions or sacrifice your own wishes out of love for another person is much better than to do so out of fear. And when you refrain from breaking divine laws, it should be out of love for God, not from fear of punishment. Fear comes from the heart. If ever you feel overcome by dread of some illness or accident, you should inhale and exhale deeply slowly, and rhythmically several times, relaxing with each exhalation. This helps the circulation to become normal. If your heart is truly quiet you cannot feel fear at all.

When you dwell on such an apprehension your will is paralysed, and your nerves also, and you may indeed fall again and break your leg. Furthermore, when your heart becomes paralysed by fear, your vitality is low and disease germs get a chance to invade your body. Be Cautious But Not Fearful There is hardly anyone who does not fear disease. Fear was given to man as a cautionary device to spare him pain; it is not meant to be cultivated and abused. Overindulgence in fear only cripples our efforts to ward off difficulties. Cautious fear is wise, as when, knowing the principles of right diet, you reason, \"I won't eat that cake, because it is not good for me.\" But unrea- soning apprehension is a cause of disease,- it is the real germ of all sickness. Dread of disease precipitates disease. Through the very thought of sickness you bring it on yourself. If you are con- stantly afraid of catching a cold, you will be more susceptible to it, no matter what you do to prevent it. Do not paralyse your will and nerves with fear. When anxiety persists in spite of your will, you are helping to create the very experience you are dreading. Also, it is unwise to associate more than is necessary and considerate with people who constantly discuss their own and others' ailments and infirmities,- this dwelling on the sub- ject may sow seeds of apprehension in your mind. Those who are worried they are going to succumb to tuberculosis, cancer, heart trouble, should cast out this fear, lest it bring about the unwelcome condition. Those who are already sick and infirm need as pleasant an environment as possible, among people who have a strong and positive nature, to encourage them in positive thoughts and feelings. Thought has great power. Those who serve in hospitals seldom fall ill, because of their confident attitude. They are vitalized by their energy and strong thoughts. For this reason, as you get older, it is best not to tell others your age. As soon as you do, they see that age in you and asso- ciate it with diminishing health and vitality. The thought of advancing age creates anxiety, and thus you devitalize yourself."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"ELIMINATING THE STATIC OF FEAR FROM THE MIND RADIO 95 So keep your age private. Say to God: \"I am immortal. I am blessed with the privilege of good health, and I thank Thee.\" Therefore be cautious, but not fearful. Take the precaution of going on a purifying diet now and then, so that any condi- tions of illness that may be present in the body will be elimi- nated. Do your best to remove the causes of illness and then be absolutely unafraid. There are so many germs everywhere that if you began to fear them you would not be able to enjoy life at all. Even with all your sanitary precautions, if you could look at your home through a microscope you would lose all desire to eat! Techniques of Tuning Out Fear Whatever it is that you fear, take your mind away from it and leave it to God. Have faith in Him. Much suffering is due simply to worry. Why suffer now when the malady has not yet come? Since most of our ills come through fear, if you give up fear you will be free at once. The healing will be instant. Every night, before you sleep, affirm: \"The Heavenly Father is with me ; I am protected.\" Mentally surround yourself with Spirit and His cosmic energy and think: \"Any germ that attacks me will be electrocuted.\" Chant \"Aum\" three times, or the word \"God.\" This will shield you. You will feel His wonderful pro- tection. Be fearless. It is the only way to be healthy. If you com- mune with God His truth will flow to you. You will know that you are the imperishable soul. Whenever you feel afraid, put your hand over your heart, next to the skin; rub from left to right, and say, \"Father, I am free. Tune out this fear from my heart-radio.\" Just as you tune out static on an ordinary radio, so if you continuously rub the heart from left to right, and continuously concentrate on the thought that you want to tune out fear from your heart, it will go; and the joy of God will be perceived.

You should be original, and whatever you do, do well. All na- ture consciously communes with you when you are in tune with God. We often consider ourselves first, but we should always in- clude others in our happiness. When we do that from the good- ness of our hearts, we spread abroad a spirit of mutual consid- eration. If everyone in a community of one thousand persons behaved this way, each one would have nine hundred and ninety-nine friends. But if everyone in that community be- haved like an enemy to the other, each one would have nine hundred and ninety-nine enemies. Conquering the hearts of others by the power of love is the greatest victory you can win in life. Always try to consider oth- ers first and you will find the whole world at your feet.

The disturbance of mental equilib- rium, which results in nervous disorders, is caused by contin- uous states of excitement or excessive stimulation of the senses. Indulgence in constant thoughts of fear, anger, melan- choly, remorse, envy, sorrow, hatred, discontent, or worry,- and lack of the necessities for normal and happy living, such as right food, proper exercise, fresh air, sunshine, agreeable work and a purpose in life, all are causes of nervous disease. Any violent or persistent mental, emotional, or physical excitement greatly disturbs and unbalances the flow of life force throughout the sensory-motor mechanism and the lamps of the senses. If we connect a 120-volt bulb with a 2,000-volt source, it would burn out the bulb. Similarly, the nervous sys- tem was not made to withstand the destructive force of intense emotion or persistent negative thoughts and feelings. Far-Reaching Effects of Nervousness Nervousness is no simple problem; it is a deadly enemy with far-reaching effects. Physically, it is difficult to heal any disease so long as it is aggravated by nervousness. Spiritually, an imbalance of life force in the body makes it extremely hard for the devotee to concentrate or meditate deeply enough to ac- quire peace and wisdom. But nervousness can be cured. The sufferer must be willing to analyse his condition and remove the disintegrating emotions and negative thoughts that are lit- tle by little destroying him. Objective analysis of one's prob- lems, and maintaining calmness in all situations of life will heal the most persistent case of nervousness. 98"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"NERVOUSNESS—CAUSE AND CURE 99 Realization that all power to think, speak, feel, and act comes from God, and that He is ever with us, inspiring and guiding us, brings an instant freedom from nervousness. Flashes of divine joy will come with this realization; some- times a deep illumination will pervade one's being, banishing the very concept of fear. Like an ocean, the power of God sweeps in, surging through the heart in a cleansing flood, re- moving all obstructions of delusive doubt, nervousness, and fear. The delusion of matter, the consciousness of being only a mortal body, is overcome by contacting the sweet serenity of Spirit, attainable by daily meditation. Then you know that the body is a little bubble of energy in His cosmic sea. The victim of nervousness must understand his case, and must reflect on those continual mistakes of thinking which are responsible for his maladjustment to life. When the nervous man once admits to himself that his disease is not mysterious in its cause, but the logical outcome of his own habits, he is al- ready half cured. The Nervous System The nervous system is the telephonic outlet and inlet of the body, providing man with his response to outer and inner stimuli. Excitement upsets the nervous balance, sending too much energy to some parts and depriving others of their nor- mal share. This lack of proper distribution of nerve force is the sole cause of nervousness. The calm man—he who avoids excitement because he is not overly attached to his ego and is aware that God, and not he, is running this universe—is al- ways able to meet any situation in life because his nerve force is equilibrated. Lord Krishna said: \"The knower of Spirit, abid- ing in the Supreme Being, with unswerving discrimination, free from delusion, is thus neither jubilant at pleasant experi- ences nor downcast by unpleasant experiences.\"* This is the goal we must strive for and attain. The nervous system supplies life current to the brain, heart, and other parts of the body. It distributes energy to the five senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. Nerves are our medium of contact with the outer world and the * Bhagavad Gita V:20."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"100 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST source of all our sensory reactions. How important it is, there- fore, to keep the nerves in a state of perfect balance, not shocking one part of the body with too much energy and con- sequently limiting the supply to other regions. Not by rest- lessness or emotional reactions, but by calmness, by deep trust in God, we reach the yogic state of an equilibrated being. The yogis have special techniques by which one can revive tissues burned out by nervousness, by sending life energy into nerves partially destroyed by mistreatment. Each cell and tis- sue in the nervous system is a living, intelligent structure. Life energy can always renew it. Overcome Nervousness by Good Company Nervousness is of two kinds—psychological and mechan- ical, or superficial and organic. The psychological or most com- mon variety is due to mind excitement. This condition, long continued in, and accompanied by association with uninspir- ing people and wrong diet and health habits, causes the chronic or organic manifestations of nervous diseases. The diet should be simple, balanced, and not too plentiful. Exercise should be regular. Too much sleep drugs the nerves, and too little sleep is hurtful to them. But all-important is the choice of company. Tell me what kind of friends a man has and I will tell you what he is. Flatterers do not help us. We should seek the society of superior men—those who tell us the truth and help us to improve ourselves. He is our best friend who humbly suggests how we may benefit our life by worthwhile changes. Strong criticism, delivered in a mean or heartless way, is like hitting a man on the head with a hammer. The power of love is infinitely more effective. Kind suggestions, given with love and understanding, can accomplish wonders,- mere fault- finding accomplishes nothing. One is fit to judge others only after he has perfected his own nature. Till then, judging oneself is the only profitable analysis. Association with calm, wise people is one of the quickest ways to banish nervousness and realize our innate divinity. Nervous people should stay away from those suffering from similar troubles."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"NERVOUSNESS—CAUSE AND CURE 101 Calmness Is the Best Cure The best cure for nervousness is the cultivation of calm- ness. One who is naturally calm does not lose his sense of rea- son, justice, or humour under any circumstances. He can al- ways separate sentiment or wishful thinking from fact. He is not led astray by the honeyed tongues of dishonest men with improbable schemes for acquiring unearned wealth. He does not poison his bodily tissues with anger or fear, which ad- versely affect circulation. It is a well-proven fact that the milk of an angry mother can have a harmful effect on her child. What more striking proof can we ask for, that violent emotions will finally reduce the body to an ignominious wreck? Poise is a beautiful quality. We should pattern our life by a triangular guide: calmness and sweetness are the two sides; the base is happiness. Every day, one should remind himself: \"I am a prince of peace, sitting on the throne of poise, directing my kingdom of activity.\" Whether one acts quickly or slowly, in solitude or in the busy marts of men, his centre should be peaceful, poised. Christ is an example of that ideal. Everywhere, he demonstrated peace. He passed through every conceivable test without losing his poise. God is everywhere, controlling planets, galaxies; yet He is not disturbed. Though He is in this world, yet He is above this world. We must reflect His image and likeness. We must med- itate often and hold on to the peaceful aftereffects. We must send out thoughts of love, goodwill, harmony.

The spirit within becomes disassociated from the demands of the body as the body itself is freed from gross habits. I have just passed my thirtieth day of dieting and fast- ing, and it seems as natural as if I had never eaten. All of you who are able should go on a three-day fast; if possible, a longer one.* You would begin to discover that you can live without food. Pains or aches in the body indicate that something is go- ing wrong with its machinery; repairs are needed. Think how conscientiously you keep your auto clean and in good repair. Much more complex than any car is the human body,- and the Lord wants you to keep it clean and in good running order, also, while at the same time depending more on Him. The secret of good health does not lie only in chemicals; one should rely even more on God's energy within. This life force within our bodies is, in fact, the source of life. It is a conscious power: the creator of the organs, and the supplier of their vitality as well. Ordinarily, life force is con- tinually reinforced by mind power and food. But if it has been too much misused, it gives up and refuses to work anymore. Its power may grow dim in the eyes, for example, and then you cannot see well. No food gives strength, no change of air in- vigorates, nothing can restore energy to the body when its life force begins to diminish. * Persons in good health should experience no difficulty in fasting for three days; longer fasts should be undertaken only under experienced supervision. Anyone suffering from a chronic ailment or an organic defect should fast only upon the advice of a physician experienced in fasting procedures. 102"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"THE PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL REWARDS OF FASTING 103 Fasting gives rest to the overworked organs, the bodily en- gines; and also to the life force itself, relieving it of extra work. When you cease to make the life force feel it has to depend for its existence on external sources—food, water, oxygen, sun- shine—it becomes self-supporting, independent. It is overeating for three hundered and sixty-five days of the year that creates many kinds of disease. Undeviating regu- larity in eating, whether the system actually needs food or not, is also a curse to the body. The more you concentrate on the palate, the more disease you will have. To enjoy food is all right, but to be a slave to it is the bane of life. Why should you let nature hurt you? Nature cannot punish you if you are not attached to the body or bound by food. You must recognize that life force is the sustainer of the body. Without being fanatic, place the greatest emphasis on the mind, with the object of making its power more and more de- pendable. If you insist on making your mind a slave to your body, the mind will take revenge. It will relinquish its power, so that you will have to depend on someone or something else to help you,- and no doctor or medicine can help any patient if the patient's mind has become so weakened that the disease has become chronic. Three-fourths of the cure lies in the mind. In India, we teach how to conquer the body so that one can rely to a greater degree on the mind. Those who constantly look to physical means for health and healing will be depen- dent on them always. But mental power is superior. One should learn gradually to make greater use of the mind. By doing so, you will realize that the mind is a superb instrument. Whatever you command, it will do. This I have seen in my own life. One day when I was giving a lecture in Milwaukee, it was terribly hot; my face was streaming perspiration, but I could- n't find my handkerchief. For a moment I didn't know what to do. Then I put my consciousness at the Christ [ Kutastha ] cen- tre and inwardly said, \"Lord, my body is cool.\" At once all per- spiration disappeared, and my body felt cool as could be! So it is good to try to depend more on mind.

Fasting is one of the great ways of approaching God: it releases the life force from enslavement to food, showing you that it is God who really sustains the life in your body. But the temptation of Satan is that as soon as the mind thinks \"food,\" you want to eat. Once, as a little boy in India, I had a cold and I wanted to eat some tamarind, which is con- sidered very bad for colds. My sister strongly disapproved, but because of my insistence she grudgingly brought me some of the fruit. I took one piece, chewed it, and spit it out. Without my swallowing the tamarind, the desire for its taste was satis- fied. Since man all too often acquires the habit of greed, it is unfortunate for him that God didn't create the body in such a way that he could enjoy the sense of taste and let damaging excess or unhealthful food bypass the organs of digestion and assimilation! Self-Control—the Sanest Way to Health and Happiness But in truth the only way to health and happiness, and the sanest way, is self-control.

And every time you load your digestive system with too much food, the life force burns out. When you refrain from overeating, and when you fast, the life force takes rest and becomes recharged. If your auto is not working properly, you send it to a garage. It runs better for a while, and then something else goes wrong and you send it back for further repairs. The same must be done for the body. The physical effects of fasting are re- markable. A fast of three days on orange juice will repair the body temporarily, but a long fast will completely overhaul it. * Your body will feel as strong as steel. But if you want a per- manent overhaul, then you must also watch at all times what, * See footnote on page 86."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"THE PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL REWARDS OF FASTING 105 and how much, food you take into your body. Know the Right Way to Fast In fasting you must know what to do. That is why proper supervision is necessary for a fast longer than three days. I don't advise anyone to make his first fast a long one, for he will become weak. A one-day fast on fruit each week, or a three-day fast on orange juice each month, are good ways to accustom oneself to fasting. The faster must be mentally prepared for those who will immediately begin to sympathize and tell him that he will become sick and die if he doesn't eat. It is true that on a longer fast you may feel weak during the first few days, because the life force has been accustomed to dependence on food. But gradually, as the days pass, you no longer feel any weakness. Your life force and spirit become detached from food. You see that the body is sustained by life force alone. I know the secret by which one can fast and still not lose weight. The life force, when under one's conscious control, may be utilized to take off flesh or to keep the body at normal weight. Either way, it is effective. When this principle is ap- plied, the normal temperature of the body does not go down, no matter how long one fasts. Drawing energy from the medulla, the \"mouth of God,\"* the life force begins to rely more and more on its innate regenerative power instead of depending on outside sources. Human beings in a perfect state of suspended animation can be buried for five thousand years or unto eternity and re- main alive. Life is eternal. It depends not on breath, nor on food, water, or sunshine. Remember always that you are the Imperishable Spirit. This is the way to live. Our consciousness survives after death, but the ordinary man loses that feeling of continuity and so thinks he is dead. * Matthew 4:4 (Bible): \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word [prana, life energy) that proceedeth out of the mouth of God (that flows forth from the medulla into the body).\" It is through the centre of superconscious- ness in the medulla that God breathes His \"word\"—cosmic intelligent vibration, or energy—into man. A reservoir of this energy accumulates in the brain. Thence it flows down from the medulla into the five spiritual centres (chakras ) in the spine, which act as distributors, feeding this life energy to all Parts of the body."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"106 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST Every one of us is going to die someday, so there is no use in being afraid of death. You don't feel miserable at the prospect of losing consciousness of your body in sleep,- you accept sleep as a state of freedom to look forward to. So is death; it is a state of rest, a pension from this life. There is nothing to fear. When death comes, laugh at it. Death is only an experience through which you are meant to learn a great lesson: you cannot die. Why wait for death when you can realize this now? The first lesson you have to learn is that life is not dependent on food. By fasting you can prove it to yourself. Function Well Under All Circumstances Everyone should develop his mental power, so that he is able to function well under all circumstances—sleep or no sleep, food or no food, vacation or no vacation. Regularity is ad- mirable and necessary; we must acquire the habit of regularity in order to obey the laws of God. But to be unable to deviate from that habit without ill effect is wrong. All the fundamental habits of a child are formed between the ages of three and seven. Good environment will help to guide his development, but to change (if desirable) the salient tendencies of a child, special training is required. In my school in Ranchi, India, I gave the boys rigid training of the body. They fasted often, and slept on a blanket on the floor, never using pil- lows. Sometimes they meditated for hours. To help children by rigid discipline to be free from the tyranny of the body is to confer on them a lifelong blessing. One of the schoolboys sat for twelve hours in meditation without winking his eyes. If you had such poise, how much happier you would be! How much more peace you would have! The greatest training lies in scientific, balanced discipline of the body, mind, and spirit. And in that lies the heart of fasting. The Metaphysical Science Behind Fasting There is a great metaphysical science behind fasting. Jesus reminded us of this truth when he said: \"Man shall not live by bread alone ....\" Two things keep you bound to earth: breath and \"bread.\" In sleep, however, you are peacefully unaware of any need for either breath or food; your spirit is detached from body-consciousness. Fasting uplifts the mind in the same way."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"THE PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL REWARDS OF FASTING 107 Through fasting, let your mind depend on its own power. When that power manifests, the life force in the body becomes increasingly reinforced with the eternal energy continually flowing into the brain and spine from the cosmic energy around the body, entering through the medulla. Becoming de- tached from dependence on outer physical sources of bodily sustenance, the life force sees that it is being supported from within, and wonders how this is so. The mind then says: \"The solids on which the body used to depend are nothing more than gross condensations of energy. You are pure energy. And you are pure consciousness.\" Then, whatever command the mind impinges on the consciousness of the life force, it will manifest accordingly. Anything can be done by mind power. So you see how un- just it is to the mind and to the all-powerful life force within you, to say you can't live without food. Make your life and body impervious to suffering. Conquer yourself. By long fast- ing you realize that everything is mind. Every force and object in this universe is a product of the Divine Mind, in the same way that all the things you per- ceive in a dream are creations of your own mind. On the con- scious plane also, if your mind creates the thought that the body will be weak from fasting, it will be weak; or if you have been fasting, and momentarily think it is making you weak, the body will actually feel weak. But if you make up your mind that the body is strong, it will not feel any weak- ness; rather, it will feel great power. Most people do not know this because they have never tried it. The mind will not show its miracles unless you make it work. And it will not work so long as you continue to depend more and more on material things. That is why its marvels remain hidden from ordinary vision. But when, through fasting, you learn how to depend on mind, it will work in everything, whether conquering disease, or creating prosperity, or realizing the supreme goal of life—finding God. \"The self-governed yogi— he whose mind is fully under control—thus engaging his soul in ceaseless meditative union with Spirit, attains the peace of My being: the final Nirvana (deliverance).\"* * Bhagavad Gita VI: 15."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Self-realization: Criterion of Religion Self-Realization Fellowship Temple, Los Angeles, California, August 22, 1933 First Self-Realization Fellowship Temple, Encinitas, California, August 27, 1939 (Compilation) The temple God loves most is the temple of His devotee's inner silence and peace.

When you are helpless to help yourself, when your family cannot do anything for you, when no one else can give you aid, what then is the state of your mind? Why allow yourself to be put in such a po- sition? Find God, and anchor yourself in Him. Before anyone else was with you, who was with you? God. And when you leave this earth, who will be with you? Only God. But you won't be able to know Him then unless you make friends with Him now. If you deeply seek God, you will find Him. Everything in creation is a temptation to lure you from God. But He is more tempting than any earthly temptation. If you attain even a glimpse of Him you will realize this; and you can find Him by inner prayer and meditation and by strong de- termination. Your resolutions with God must be firm,- He will not come so long as your mind is roaming elsewhere. He wants to come to you but you don't let Him,- you would rather seek a little sense pleasure or spend your time on books or cocktail parties. So God says, \"All right, My child, play on.\" If God is seeking anything, it is our love. He knocks at every heart and asks us to come unto Him, but most persons don't want to go. Yet when they get into trouble or become sick, they are quick to call for Him. He who makes friends with the Lord while he is prosperous and happy will always find God near when he needs Him. But he who procrastinates in forming that relationship will have to fight his tests alone until, through wisdom and unconditional surrender, he finds the Eternal Friend. Out of this great mass of humanity only a few are deeply seeking God. Where are they who thought this earth was theirs two hundred years ago? All are gone—and from among them perhaps only a few understood the truth about life and became Self-realized devotees of the Lord. Nevertheless, each succeed- ing generation thinks this life is real! For the little while you are here you make much of this show. Don't become too in- volved in it. Find God! He is trying to draw us with His love.

Open your eyes of devotion, for by continuous ardour plus ap- plication of spiritual law you will find Him. Spiritual Development Must Balance Material Advancement Different nations have specialized in different arts and sci- ences; India mastered the scientific art of God-realization. I have come to teach you India's spiritual science. Unless a bal- ance is created by developing spiritual realization along with advancement of the physical sciences, individuals and nations will be lost in misery and destruction. If today's world leaders were illumined by Self-realization, and worked together, they could within a few years banish war and poverty from the earth. Only spiritual consciousness—realization of God's pres- ence in oneself and in every other living being—can save the world. I see no chance for peace without it. Begin with your- self. There is no time to waste. It is your duty to do your part to bring God's kingdom on earth. Many persons hesitate to seek God, imagining that life will then have to be gloomy. Not so! The unalloyed happiness I find in communing with the Lord no words can describe. Night and day I am in a state of joy. That joy is God. To know Him is to perform the funeral rites for all your sorrows. He does not require you to be stoic and morose. This is not the right concept of God, nor the way to please Him. Without being happy you will not even be able to find Him. The more peaceful you are, the more you will be able to feel His pres- ence. The happier you are, the greater will be your attunement with Him. Those who know Him are always happy, because God is joy itself. People try to find happiness in drink, sex, and money, but the pages of history are filled with tales of their disillusion- ment.

Wait no longer! Whoever hears this message, know that I am speaking truth. It is His voice, His power, His authority. If I were to display all the powers that God has given to me, throngs would come. But I do not seek that kind of following. Not powers, but the love of God must attract you,- for only then will you change and make an effort to know Him. That is my aim. I could not preach about God in this way if I did not know Him. In the same way you can know Him.

If I had a thousand mouths, I would speak through them all to convince you. My Only Wish Is to Give You a Glimpse of God You don't realize how much you miss God, because you have never known Him. Once you do contact Him, no power on earth will be able to turn you away from Him. My only wish is to give you a glimpse of God, because having Him, no other gain is greater. Satan tempted Jesus with dominion over the whole world; but he said, \"Get thee behind me, Satan.\"* Jesus had that Something which is infinitely greater. Knowing God is more satisfying than the fulfillment of any earthly de- sire. Every lesser wish of your heart will be taken care of when you have Him who is your greatest Treasure. This is my own true testimony. He fulfilled my every desire. I do not seek things now; they seek me. When God gives Himself to you, He will fulfill your slightest wish. It is not necessary to ask. That is the state you want. But first you have to prove that you de- sire the Lord Himself more than His gifts. Out of the abundance God has given me I have kept noth- mg for myself.

It Is Necessary to Understand the Meaning of Religion To most persons religion is a matter of family tradition or social benefit or moral habit. They have no conception of the importance of religion. When I asked one man what religion he followed, he replied: \"Nothing in particular. I change churches according to convenience.\" Those who are not seeking God as the paramount neces- sity of life do not understand the meaning of religion. Why do all people seek money? Because they are conditioned to the thought that money is essential to supply the things they need for their well-being. They don't have to be told this; they sim- ply know it. Why then do most people not understand the necessity of knowing God? Because they lack imagination and discrimination. Very early in life I saw that theological and even scriptural answers to certain questions could never fully satisfy the soul, unless their truth were experienced through realization and God-communion. For example, when my mother died and when other loved ones began to be taken away from me, I rebelled inwardly against it; but no one could give me an explanation that satisfied me. I decided I had to find the"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"SELF-REALIZATION: CRITERION OF RELIGION 113 answer myself, through my own effort. \"I am not going to ac- cept this blindly,\" I vowed. \"I am going to find the answer from Him who is the Maker of this universe.\" I sought directly from God the understanding of life's mysteries that I could not find in the teachings in the churches and temples. If religion could not satisfy me as to why some persons are born poor and some rich, some blind and some healthy, how could it convince me of the justice of God? The masters of India, by attaining God communion, found the answers to life's riddles through inner realization, and showed us how we can do likewise. There are many kinds of religionists in the world, and each religion has its own cross-section of this diversity. There are those whose approach to religion is wholly emotional. When their feelings are played upon too much they become hysteri- cal with religion. But in an extreme display of emotion one loses touch with God. Emotionally excitable types want \"pep\" in religion; when you lecture from the intellectual plane they fall asleep. It is too dull, they say. But playing upon others' emotions is simply juggling with their minds,- it is not giving them Truth, or God. The intellectual religionist delights in hearing about vari- ous theological or philosophical concepts, flattering himself that he is on a higher rung of divine understanding than the emotional religionist. But intellectual stimulation, also, is only another kind of \"drug,\" a different form of mental juggling that does not give the seeker what he really needs, any more than does over-stirring of the emotions. Religionists who cling blindly to dogma will often parrot what they do not really understand or have not realized. When you ask them questions, they quote scriptures and tenets like spiritual victrolas. It is useless to reason with them because they are so sure they know it all. True Religion Satisfies the Demands of Your Soul Dogmatic religionists are convinced that if you do not be- lieve in a certain way you are doomed. Science does not teach you in that way; it proves its points. And true religion satis- fies the demands of your soul, not by words but by proof. I wanted never to be so dogmatic that I would stop using my"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"114 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST reason and common sense. When I met my guru, Sri Yuk- teswar, he said: \"Many teachers will tell you to believe; then they put out your eyes of reason and instruct you to follow only their logic. But I want you to keep your eyes of reason open; in addition, I will open in you another eye, the eye of wisdom.\"* Sri Yukteswarji gave me a teaching whose truth I could realize for myself. That is why I followed this path. No one can shake me from it. The liberalist is the other extreme of the dogmatist. He follows everything! In the belief that he is being broadminded he says, \"All spiritual paths are good; therefore I will not bind myself to any one of them.\" While respecting all, it is better to adhere to one path than to be a religious butterfly, flitting everywhere. Avoid both false liberality and blind dogmatism. Cling dogmatically only to wisdom, and you will find God. Every effort one makes for God will be noticed by Him. However, if one doesn't follow a proven scientific way to God, his progress is comparable to riding in an old bullock cart. Sin- cere seekers will receive some realization, no matter what path they follow,- but with only blind belief and mechanical prayers it could take them incarnations to reach the Lord. Whatever Religion You Choose, Give It a Good Test Seek until you find the path most suited to the spiritual inclination of your heart and mind, and then be steadfast. Whatever you take up, give it a good test. In the same way give the Self-Realization [Yogoda Satsanga] teachings a chance. Jewelers can tell a good gem from a fake, and the gen- uine spiritual teacher can differentiate between sincere and idle seekers. There are some who take the Self-Realization Fellowship [Yogoda Satsanga] Lessons but do not study or practice them.

Seekers should be taught to find God first. To concentrate on money or health as primary objectives in following a reli- gion is to become sidetracked. True, it is through God that one receives everything else; but he who seeks other things first will feel the bonds of limitations. A qualified spiritual teacher knows and loves the Lord; his supreme interest is in God. One teacher tried to persuade me to accept his spiritual guidance with the promise that I would have a great many followers. His offer did not attract me, because I wanted God alone. Great teachers will always seek to interest you in knowing the Lord. They will not take you up a blind alley. Without God-communion, the lifeblood of religion is miss- ing. Church is not the place for dances, movies, and frequent social gatherings. These divert people from God. One can find sufficient worldly entertainment in town. Go to church for one reason: communion with God. Divine communion is the crite- rion of religion. That is what my guru taught me, and that is why I have followed him unconditionally and wholeheartedly. As a result of his teaching I am enjoying that sacred commu- nion with the Lord every moment of my existence. That is what religion must be. If I tell you of a wonderful fruit I have found, and describe it to you in detail every day for a year without ever giving you a taste of it, you won't be satisfied. Hearing about truth cannot relieve the soul's hunger,- if you are content to hear truth with- out making any effort to know God, it has falsely satisfied you. You must hunger so deeply for God that you will seek Him out in earnest. The purpose of religious lectures and sermons is to awaken in you that irresistible soul-longing for Him. Realizing God Requires Self-Disciplinary Effort Once in a while I meet someone in whom I see a little bit of real devotion for the Lord. But God-realization is so much greater than that! The God-knowing devotee sometimes sees the whole world filled with His light—a wonderful experience. But it can't come to you in one minute. Realizing God requires"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"116 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST long perseverance in the practice of those methods that lead to Self-realization. The desire for happiness is the strongest desire of all. True and lasting happiness is found in God. When you discover Him, a great joy will come over you, a joy you will find nowhere else. Sri Yukteswarji said to me: \"When your joy in meditation and communion becomes greater than any other joy, you have found God.* If the whole world were given to you, you would not know what to do with it; you would only feel burdened, worrying about everything. Study the lives of princes and men of the world; see how they were vexed.\" We are like puppets in the hands of destiny,- but the man who is one with the Light of the world, who has nothing and yet has everything, is a happy man. He who is one with God is not afraid of anything, even annihilation of the body. Jesus said: \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.\"+ The church has become a beggar. Ironically, money is needed in the development of all good works, including those performed by the church. The dollar itself has no brains; it can serve both good and evil schemes. To seek money to spread God's work is righteous action. Money thus used is doing good. And the more one sacrifices for God's work, the greater will be his reward. All Churches Should Be Hives of God-Communion Every church does good, and for that I love them all. They will truly fulfill their high calling when they become places of God-communion. They should be like hives, filled with the honey of God-realization. Unless this truth becomes more manifest in religion, you will see that the church as such will gradually disappear. Religion will be practised in secluded spots out-of-doors, where God can come to those few devoted souls who really want to know Him. This has happened in In- dia. Some of her temples have become not so much places of * \"Only that yogi who possesses the inner Bliss, who rests on the inner Founda- tion, who is one with the inner Light, becomes one with Spirit.

Real seekers in India gather under the trees to meditate on God. More and more this will happen in churches everywhere.

Scientific Methods Needed to Follow the First Commandment \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind-, and thy neighbour as thyself.\"* These two command- ments sum up the whole purpose of religion. If you sincerely love God you will do only what is based upon truth. Your love will not allow you to err against Him. Bring in the light, and darkness will vanish as though it had never been. Bring in love of God and the darkness of ignorance flies away. The science of yoga explains the truth behind the first commandment, and gives definite scientific techniques that enable the devotee to attain the divine communion necessary in order to love God so completely. Behind each part of these commandments is a deep metaphysical truth: \"Love the Lord...with all thy heart\": It is God who has given you the power to love your family and friends. Why should you not use that power to love Him as you love your dearest ones on earth? You should be able to say: \"My Lord, I love You as the father loves the child, as the lover loves the beloved, as the friend loves the friend, as the master loves the servant. I love You with the strength of all human loves, for Thou art my Father, my Mother, my Friend, my Master, my Beloved.\" When you truly love God with all your heart, you feel that love for Him day and night. As I was leaving home to seek God I was inwardly torn by the conflict of loyalties. My father had done everything for me, and the whole family was crying over my imminent departure; but the love of God was stronger, and I was able to overcome the limitations of familial love. Many human beings say \"I love you\" one day and reject * Luke 10:27 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"118 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST you the next. That is not love. One whose heart is filled with the love of God cannot willfully hurt anyone. When you love God without reservation, He fills your heart with His uncon- ditional love for all. That love no human tongue can describe. \"...and with all thy soul\": You cannot fulfill this part of the commandement unless you know your soul. You know it in an unconscious way each night, for in deep sleep you are aware only of existing; you have no consciousness of being ei- ther man or woman. You are soul. You can consciously know your soul—your true self—by meditation. And when you know yourself as soul you will have discovered the presence of God within you. The moon's reflection cannot be seen clearly in ruffled water, but when the water's surface is calm a perfect reflection of the moon appears. So with the mind: when it is calm you see clearly reflected the mooned face of the soul. As souls we are reflections of God. When by meditation tech- niques we withdraw restless thoughts from the lake of the mind, we behold our soul, a perfect reflection of Spirit, and re- alize that the soul and God are One. \"...and with all thy strength\": This aspect of the com- mandment is highly scientific. It means withdrawing all your strength—all your energies and consciousness—into their source, which is God. Yoga teaches you how to control your life energies and transmute them from body-consciousness into God-consciousness. \"...and with all thy mind\": When you are praying to God, your attention and concentration should be wholly on Him. You should not be thinking about your Sunday dinner or your work or any other worries and desires. The Lord knows your thoughts. Krishna said: \"Whenever the fickle and restless mind wanders away—for whatever reason—let the yogi withdraw it from those distractions and return it to the sole control of the Self.\"* When I pray to God, my mind stays riveted on Him.

To me there is no difference between one person and an- other,- I behold all as soul-reflections of the one God.* I can't think of anyone as a stranger, for I know that we are all part of the One Spirit. When you experience the true meaning of reli- gion, which is to know God, you will realize that He is your Self, and that He exists equally and impartially in all beings. Then you will be able to love others as your own Self. Self-realization Converts Conviction into Experience Truth alone should be the binding force of religion. Truth I have brought to you through Self-Realization Fellowship [Yo- goda Satsanga Society of India]. This work is spreading because of the wisdom and blessings of the God-realized masters behind it. All over the country I have seen wonderful students who are held to this spiritual path for one reason: Self-realization. My only plan to hold people is by their own Self-realization. That is the only way I wish to hold them. If there are hundreds in my classes, all right; if there are empty seats, it is all right. I never wish for anything. I would rather have a few real souls than hundreds without sincerity. The great purpose behind this movement is to give people their own Self-realization. When people will realize that it is their duty and privilege to know God, then a new era will come on earth. Scriptures, sermons, and lectures eventually cease to satisfy the seeker who truly longs to feel the presence of God; but when he realizes truth, he knows life as it should be.

He is real, and He can be found in this life. In men's hearts there are many prayers—for money, fame, health—prayers for all manner of things. But the prayer that should be first in every heart is the prayer for God's pres- ence. Silently and surely, as you walk on the path of life, you must come to the realization that God is the only object, the only goal that will satisfy you,- for in God lies the answer to every desire of the heart. When you have found it impossible to fulfill some urgent wish by your own effort, you turn to God in prayer. Thus every prayer that you utter represents a desire. But when you find God, all desires vanish, and there is no need for prayer. I don't pray. That may seem a strange thing to say, but when the Object of your prayer is with you all the time, you no longer have need to pray. In fulfillment of the wish or prayer for Him lies joy eternal. Material desires come through certain mistaken concep- tions about the purpose of life. This earth is not our home. The scriptures have told us we are children of God, made in His im- age, and that it is the will of the Divine that we return to our Source. What man does not realize is that unless and until he goes back to the Source, back to God, he will have to struggle to fulfill endless desires. Reflect on that. Man cannot help hav- ing desires, and it is not a sin to have them; but most human longings hamper fulfillment of the supreme desire to return to God, hence they are detrimental to man's happiness. Until he wants and has God, man will continue to long for whatever else he believes will make him happy.

There are two classes of desires: those that help us to find God, and those that obstruct our finding Him. For example, if someone hits you, you want to retaliate; but if you overcome that desire by using the superior power of love, you have applied the action that will help you to find God. All desires should be satisfied in the divine way. When you try to satisfy them in the worldly way, you only multiply your difficulties. If you learn to give every desire to God, He will see to it that your good desires are fulfilled and the harmful ones are over- come. There is no protection greater than your conscience, and the divine quality of your good desires. If you but looked at your soul, the all-perfect reflection of God within you, you would find all your desires satisfied! In that divine conscious- ness, having which, no other gain is greater, you would be unmoved even if the whole world were given to you; neither would praise elate you, nor blame hurt. You would feel only the great joy of God within. God 's Children Should Not Beg Always seek the guidance of the Divine in trying to fulfill your legitimate desires, because that is the supreme way to receive the answers to all your prayers. But one thing you must remember: cut out begging from your prayer! Change your old attitude of supplication. You should pray to God intimately, as His child, which you are. God does not object when you pray from your ego,* as a stranger and a beggar, but you will find that your efforts are limited by that consciousness. God does not want you to give up your own will power, which is your divine birthright as His child. Naturally, one should distinguish between reasonable and unreasonable prayers or desires. And bear in mind that, once you have made this discrimination, whatever good or bad de- sires you hold on to are bound to be fulfilled. If you cling to any evil desires, they will be granted; and you will find out what harm and unhappiness they cause. As time goes on, you will realize that even though your wish was fulfilled, your * The ego consciousness; identification with the mortal body, which creates a feeling of separateness from Cod, and hence a feeling of limitation."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"THE DESIRE THAT SATISFIES ALL DESIRES 123 heart is still not satisfied; you will feel something within you rebelling. For example, suppose you have weak digestion, yet you want to eat fried foods. Not surprisingly, you suffer every time you do. Although you feel delight while fulfilling that de- sire, the aftereffect is pain; thus you are made aware that you have done wrong. It is wiser to use discrimination to separate your evil desires from your good ones and, having done so, to avoid the fulfillment of those wrong desires. Learn to be guided by your conscience, the divine discriminative power within you. The Danger of Unfulfilled Desires Unfulfilled desires remain in the heart. And what is the harm in harbouring them? It is this: Every desire consists of specific forces, either good or evil, or a mixture of both. And when you die, though your body is gone, those forces do not die. As mental tabloids they follow your soul wherever it goes, and when you are reborn, these tabloids manifest as behav- ioural tendencies. Thus, a person who has died an alcoholic brings with him the tendency to alcoholism when he is re- bron ; and it remains with him until he overcomes desire for alcohol. The behaviour of even the smallest child reveals certain characteristics of past lives. Some children have terrible tem- per tantrums,- others are moody. God did not make them that way. Unfulfilled desires of past lives fashioned those psycho- logical tendencies,- and, because of them, the soul, even though made in the image of God, appears as something different. If the image of God within you is distorted in this life by anger or fear, and you do not conquer such uncharacteristic qualities now, you will be reborn with them; and you will have the bur- den of these misery-creating tendencies until you overcome them in some future incarnation. It is better, therefore, to work out or overcome all your de- sires now. They would be finished immediately and for all time in the supreme joy of God's presence; but until you know Him, your unconquered desires will remain to hound you. There are two ways of finishing your desires—by realiz- ing, through reason and discrimination, or wisdom, that only"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"124 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST God can give permanent unalloyed happiness; and by fulfill- ment. In many cases desires lie hidden within the subconscious. You think they are finished, but they are not. Life is indeed a great mystery,- but the mystery clears away when you dissect life with the scalpel of reason. If every day you sit quietly for a little while and analyse yourself, you will discover that you have many unsatisfied desires. They are like dangerous germs that you carry through life, and wherever you go, in this life or the next, they will go with you. The best course is to do away with all dangerous desires in this life, by discrimination, and to concentrate on fulfilling your good desires. If you feel drawn to commit suicide, or to do something evil, get rid of such desires now. Convince your- self, by reason and by good actions, that you are a child of God, made in His image, and rise above your moods and bodily habits. Be more detached. In this way you will conquer. If you suffer from a chronic ailment, try mentally to separate your- self from the consciousness of the body. By discrimination you can conquer the senses. Discrimination is the fire that burns up desire. It is a general practice to store in the attic all of one's un- wanted, unnecessary \"junk,\" and once in a while to have a good housecleaning. Similarly, hidden away in the attic of your subconscious mind are many potentially harmful desires that one day may give you great trouble. It is important, therefore, to analyse yourself. Perhaps you are a hateful or moody or an- gry type of person. If so, these stored traits are the result of your own past behaviour. In order to clean out your mental at- tic of such unwanted furnishings, you must vigorously employ constructive, positive, loving action. Love Thine Enemies Suppose that even though an old enemy dies, you con- tinue to feel hatred toward him. In time that bitterness will produce ill effects in your own body and mind. It is better to concentrate on trying to behold God in your enemy,- for by doing so you release yourself from evil vengeful desires that destroy your peace of mind. By heaping hatred upon hatred, or giving hate in return for hate, you not only increase your"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"THE DESIRE THAT SATISFIES ALL DESIRES 125 enemy's hostility toward you; you poison your system, physically as well as emotionally, with your own venom. Conscience Will Tell You What You Are Sometimes one feels a desire to \"take it easy.\" This is not wrong; to get away from everything now and then gives a per- son a chance to think what life is all about. Most people are floating along on the current of custom and fashion. They have never actually lived their own life; they have lived the life of the world, and where has it gotten them? So it is wise now and then to remove yourself from everyday considerations,- to calm your mind and try to understand what kind of person you are and what kind of person you want to be. And remember, the truest testimony you can find is the testimony of your own conscience, the discriminative voice of the soul. Whatever your conscience says, that is what you are. Think of the power of the conscience of Jesus. His accusers spat upon him and cru- cified him and yet he said, \"Father, forgive them.\" That kind of discrimination is the only power that will bring light on your path. Whenever there is an overwhelming desire in your heart to pray for a certain thing, use your discrimination. Ask yourself, \"Is it a good desire or a bad desire for which I seek ful- fillment?\" Man's Lost Treasure Is God There are many influences that nourish desires in you. When you see a new model car, you want one. When you see a new model house, you want one. Some new style of apparel comes out and immediately you yearn to wear that fashion. Whence do these desires come? I used to sit for hours ponder- ing this. Can you classify all your desires? I sorted mine, and kept only the good ones; and when I had the contact of God, I found all those good desires at once fulfilled. Today you wish for one thing and tomorrow you hanker after something else. Your mind, having descended from almighty God, is not satis- fied with the offerings of this world; and it will never be satis- fied, because you have lost your soul's richest treasure, which alone can satisfy all your desires, and that is God. It is true there are some good and necessary desires, and"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"126 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST you should strive to fulfill them. But never forget, while pursuing your little desires, to satisfy first your supreme de- sire—for God. Belief in the necessity of fulfilling lesser desires and duties first is man's greatest delusion. I well remember that during my training as a young disciple of my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, I kept promising myself daily, \"I will meditate longer tomorrow.\" A whole year slipped by before I realized that I was still putting it off. At once I made a resolution that first thing in the morning I would clean my body and then meditate long. But even then, as soon as I stirred about I be- came caught up in my daily duties and activities. Thereupon I resolved to have my meditation first. Thus I learned a great les- son: First comes my duty to God, and then I take care of all lesser duties. Why not? God says, \"Why should I open the doors of eternity to you, when you put other duties before Me?\" If you are not soaring to the heights of Spirit, of what account are you? You have nothing to offer God or man. So seek Him first. To give more importance to your earthly duties is false reasoning, because at any moment the angel Gabriel may call you—at any moment you may be taken away from here. Why then give so much importance to life? for life is very peculiar. You think you are quite secure. Suddenly a loved one dies, or you lose your health, and all security van- ishes.

Each person has a different kind of face, a different kind of mind and desires. We would become bored if we had ex- actly the same experiences every day,- we would soon tire of life. Were heaven itself the same every day, we wouldn't want it. We enjoy variety. The stereotyped conception of heaven is all wrong. If it were boring, all the saints would pray to come back to earth for a little change! Heaven is something infinitely different, ever pleasantly new, whereas earth is often unpleas- antly new! Yet, no matter how trying life is, most people become ac- customed to it and assume there is no other way to live. Not being able to compare this life with the spiritual life, they do not realize how painful and boring earthly living is. Actually, life is not real; it is only an entertainment. And just as old movies are shown over and over, so basically the same old incidents occur and recur in life. And although life will go on eternally, the same themes depicted in past films will be portrayed again and again. It is true that history repeats itself. We are all museum pieces! Whatever comes in life, just take it joyfully, impersonally, as you would a motion picture. Life is entertaining when we do not take it too seriously. A good laugh is an excellent remedy for human i!is. One of the best characteristics of the American people is their ability to laugh. To be able to laugh at life is marvellous. This my master [Swami Sri Yukteswar] taught me. In the beginning of my training in his hermitage, I went about with a solemn face, never smiling. One day Master pointedly remarked, \"What is this? Are you attending a funeral cere- mony? Don't you know that finding God is the funeral of all sorrows? Then why so glum? Don't take this life too seri- ously.\" He taught me that one must be mentally above every crucifixion of earthly experience in order to find complete hap- piness in God. Krishna taught: \"Even-minded during happiness and sor- row, profit and loss, triumph and failure—so encounter the battle of life!

This I learned from the example of my great master—even to the last, changeless. Christ also demonstrated that spirit. Even though Jesus was tortured, God's love was not taken away; he did not lose his divine con- sciousness. God's protection of our joy and peace is the great- est fortress possible. Throughout all trials and suffereings, re- member the good things that God has given you. Your soul is a divine temple of God. The darkness of mortal ignorance and limitations must be driven out of that temple. It is wonderful to be in the consciousness of the soul—fortified, strong! Be afraid of nothing. Hating none, giving love to all, feel- ing the love of God, seeing His presence in everyone, and hav- ing but one desire—for His constant presence in the temple of your consciousness—that is the way to live in this world.

This illustrates the importance of having communion with God now, for the comparison with inferior earthly joys,- then your desires will be of a much higher and more advanced na- ture.

Perhaps you feel that you have no desires. Well, I have of- ten noticed what happens when people go shopping.

Then, after having it for a while, their happiness in it grows stale, and they want some- thing else. We meet people who say, \"If only I could have a thousand dollars (or a car, or a swimming pool),\" and when that wish is satisfied, they yearn for something different. Human desires are not perfect, hence their fulfillment does not lead to perfect happiness. The world environment will try to prevent you from re- membering that the only worthwhile desire is to have God. But every day you should remind yourself of this. And when you have made up your mind not to smoke, or eat unwisely, or lie or cheat, be firm in these good desires; don't weaken. Wrong environment saps your will and invites wrong desires. Live with thieves and you think that is the only life. But live with divine persons, and after having divine communion, no other desires can tempt you. All become stale. Therefore even a few moments of deep meditation, or the company of a saint, will be a raft of inspiration to carry you across this ocean of delu- sion to the shores of God. Be Safe in the Castle of God's Presence Joy lies in continually thinking of God. The longing for Him should be constant. A time comes when your mind never wanders away, when not even the greatest affliction of body, mind, and soul can take your consciousness from the living presence of God.

The greatest disillusionment came to me when I vis- ited my old home in Ichapur, where I used to play and watch the birds. I was shocked. Only one remembered tree was left. That is the way life is; one by one, things familiar and dear van- ish from our sight. I would have given anything then to have seen our home as it was in my childhood.

Some are never liked. Others are neither liked nor disliked; they are just ignored. Why? Impartial God is not responsible for the uneven distribution of attractive qualities. The differences in each man's character are of his own cultivation. He himself has created those pleasant or un- pleasant qualities, in this or in past lives. It would be a great injustice if God were responsible for starting off some children with the advantage of likable good qualities and others with a handicap of obnoxious bad qualities. But it is not He who has established bad tendencies in some children and good in oth- ers,- therefore we cannot hold God accountable. God creates all men equal, made in His image. In order to see the justification of man's seeming inequalities, we must understand the law of reincarnation. Knowledge of this law was buried and forgotten during the Dark Ages. Jesus spake of reincarnation when he said: \"Elias is come already, and they knew him not.... Then the disciples understood that he spoke unto them of John the Baptist.\"* The soul appearing in one in- carnation as Elias (Elijah) had returned in another incarnation as John the Baptist. There would be no meaning to life if it did not afford us sufficient opportunities to develop our potentials and satisfy our desires. Without reincarnation, how does the divine jus- tice operate for those souls who have no chance to express themselves because they are encased in the body of a baby that is born dead, or of one that perhaps lives only to the age of six? Those souls could hardly be condemned to Hades, because * Matthew 17:12-13. 139"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"140 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST they have done nothing to deserve punishment; nor could they go to heaven, having had no opportunity to earn it. The an- swer is that this earth is a vast schoolhouse, and the law of reincarnation is the justice that brings each man here again and again until he has learned all of life's lessons. Lord Krishna referred to this truth: \"By diligently following his path, the yogi, perfected by the efforts of many births, is purged of sin (karmic taint) and finally enters the Supreme Beatitude.\"* Man himself has cultivated his bright and dark qualities. Somewhere, sometime, in this or other lives, the seeds were planted by his own actions. If he permits the seeds of harmful acts to grow, they will crowd out the seeds of good that he has sown. The wise cast out the seeds of evil from the garden of life. Attractiveness Comes from Within One should learn to analyse himself and others to deter- mine why some persons are liked by all and others are not. Even among children we find some whom everyone regards af- fectionately and others whom everyone avoids. One of the first conclusions from such analysis is that if a person is to become likable, he must make himself more attractive from within. Sometimes even the most physically attractive person may be repellent because of the inner ugliness reflected in his speech and actions. At one time the secret of popularity was supposed to be \"it,\" a kind of physical appeal and magnetism. But having \"it\" does not necessarily make one likable. Our good or bad traits determine whether, and by whom, we are liked or disliked. Evil attracts evil; good attracts good. \"It\" is not what we should want, but the kind of magnetism that will draw good to us, that will bring sincere friends and merited admiration. Can externals such as clothes and a pretty or handsome face give us this kind of attractiveness? No. It has to be created within. Avoid moodiness.

Your thoughts and emotions, like waves, ebb and flow in the facial muscles, continuously altering your ap- pearance. Everyone you meet sees and reacts to these facial ex- pressions of what you are inwardly thinking and feeling. You can fairly well control your eyes and your smile, and thus con- ceal your feelings from some,- but not from all. Lincoln rightly said, \"It is true that you may fool all the people some of the time,- you can even fool some of the people all the time,- but you can't fool all of the people all the time.\" In our eyes is the entire history of our life. It cannot be concealed from those who know how to read it. There are spiritual eyes, half-spiritual eyes, dishonest eyes, sensual eyes. What one does is written there. If I were to analyse what I see in a person's eyes, he would be astonished at my accuracy. Never do anything that taints your mind. Wrong actions cause negative or evil mental vibrations that are reflected in your whole appearance and personality. Engage in those actions and thoughts that nurture the good qualities you want to have. If you conduct yourself in accord with the truths I am telling you, you will find your life beautifully different. You Are Judged Largely by the Way You Conduct Yourself One is judged somewhat by his dress, but largely by the way he conducts himself. Always be clean and trim in appear- ance. Avoid overdressing: fussy clothes and accessories make one look like a museum piece! Clothe yourself simply and neatly, and as befits your personality. But first of all learn good behaviour. Once you have developed your mind and cultivated appealing inner virtues, dress becomes less important. Mahatma Gandhi has proved that clothes alone do not \"make the man.\" He wears* only a loincloth, by way of iden- tifying himself with the simple masses of India. There he once arrived thus clad for a party that was being given by an English governor. The servants would not let him in. He returned home and sent a package by messenger to the governor. It con- tained a suit. The governor called him at his home and asked the meaning of the package. The great man replied: \"I was * Gandhi was still living when Paramahansaji gave this talk.

Even in London Gandhi went to call on the King and Queen of England clad only in his loin- cloth. He had transcended the clothes personality. Now I am not recommending this mode of dress! Gandhi has a mission to fulfill, and this is a part of his role. If one becomes as great as Gandhi, he also may do as he sees fit. The point is, one should not think all the time about the body; nor should he be careless of it. To give the body too lit- tle or too much attention makes one become unbalanced, fa- natical. Look after the body in a reasonable way, and remem- ber always what is most important—your mentality, your behaviour. Give more attention to the mind, the springboard of your behaviour, for that is what most persons respond to. When with Others, Be Sincere and Thoughtful Be interested in others. When you are by yourself you have a right to think and do what you want to; but when you are with others, you should not be absentminded or uninterested. The company of a corpse would be preferable to that of an ab- sentminded person; the indifference of a corpse bears no insult. When you are in the company of others, be with them whole- heartedly; but when your interest in being with them lags, make a polite excuse and withdraw. You have no right to re- main while your mind is absent. Be genuinely amiable when you are with others. Never be a \"sourpuss.\" You don't have to laugh boisterously, like a hyena, but don't wear a long face either. Just be smiling, con- genial, and kind. Smiling on the outside when you are angry or resentful inside, however, is hypocrisy. If you want to be lik- able, be sincere. Sincerity is a soul quality that God has given to every human being, but not all express it. Above all, be humble. Though you may have admirable inner strength, don't overwhelm others with your strong nature. Be calm and con- siderate of them. This is the way to develop likable magnetism.

You should be like that. What is life unless you have the right kind of friends around you? There is a magnet in your heart that will attract true friends. That magnet is unselfishness, thinking of others first. Very few persons are free from self-centeredness. Yet one can develop the quality of unselfishness very easily if he prac- tises thinking of others first. A mother usually has this qual- ity. Her life is service. She gives to her husband and children first. Because she always thinks of others before herself, others think of her. That is the tradition in the homes in India. We are taught the same spirit in the ashrams of real spiritual teachers. Consideration for others is a most wonderful quality. It is the greatest attractiveness you can have. Practise it! If some- one is thirsty, a thoughtful person anticipates his need and of- fers him a drink. Consideration means awareness of and atten- tiveness to others. A considerate person, when in the company of others, will have an intuitive awareness of their needs. Live for Others and They Will Live for You There are those who would say, \"I am a devout man.\" Yet if someone else sat in their church pew they would be ready to take off the intruder's head! Once in a while I see this sort of incident in my classes. If another person wants your seat, give it, even though you must stand. By your exemplary behaviour you will have someone else thinking considerately of you every day. When you learn to live for others, they will live for you. When you live for yourself, no one is interested in you. You can best attract others by your good actions. If you look around, when you attend a party, you will al- most always notice some guests who are openly envious of what others have. No one wants to be with thoughtless, self- ish people. But everyone is glad to be with a tactful, consider- ate person. Practise consideration in your speech as well as in your ac- tions; and when you feel tempted to speak harshly, control that impulse and talk calmly instead. Let no one hear harsh words from you.

Remember also, it may be truth to speak of the blind man as a blind man, or the sick man as a sick man, but it is better to avoid such bluntness. By the kindness and consideration of your speech you help to uplift others and make them better. It isn't always your words that others listen to, however, but the strength and sincerity behind them. When a sincere man speaks, the world moves. When he says something, oth- ers listen. Some persons talk on and on, hoping to convince the hearer by the steady barrage of words. But the captive listener is only thinking, \"Please let me go!\" When you talk, don't talk too much about yourself. Try to speak on a subject that inter- ests the other person. And listen. That is the way to be attrac- tive. You will see how your presence is in demand. My mother was considerate in that way. Fathers and moth- ers should never talk against one another to the children. They should keep their troubles completely to themselves. My par- ents had that self-control; they were really like gods. Only once did I see trouble between my father and mother. All that we children knew was that a carriage was at the door and our mother was going away. Uncle came in and asked Father, \"What is the matter?\" Father said, \"I have no objection to her spending money for her charities,-1 only ask that she not spend beyond my income.\" Uncle whispered something in Father's ear. After a few conciliatory words from Father, Mother sent the carriage away. She never said a word against Father. She was always thinking of others. It is a joy to live for others. When I am alone I have hardly any impulse to eat, but when I am with others I like to fix ap- petizing dishes for them. I saw that same characteristic in my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswarji. During my first visits to his ashram, I gained the impression that he always had savoury food to eat. But once I went there when he didn't expect me, and I saw he was having the plainest meal imaginable. I ques- tioned him about it. \"I don't have special dishes except when you come,\" he replied. \"I like to prepare them for you.\" Once a fellow college student accompanied me to the mar- ket to buy some pineapples. There were only two,- one was larger than the other. I bought both of them and handed the"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"HOW TO BE MORE LIKABLE 145 large one to my friend. He was so surprised! He thought I had intended to keep that one for myself. A wonderful feeling arises within a person when he is considerate of others, thinking first of them. As soon as you are concerned for someone else, not only does he think of you, but God thinks of you too. If you are thoughtful, doing for others all the time, then even if you part with your last penny to help them, God will return even more blessings to you. Another thing to remember: Each one of you has some spe- cial quality, a uniqueness, that others have not. Also, each one is richer or poorer in some way than others are. If you are un- selfish, good-tempered, understanding, you are richer than those who are selfish and angry and jealous. Perfect Balance Is the Altar of God Mankind is like a large zoo—so many people behaving so differently, most of them having no real control over them- selves. But before one can realize the true Goal of life, he has to have that self-control. He must seek balance. Perfect bal- ance is the altar of God. Strive for this,- and once you have at- tained it, never lose it. Christ did not lose it when he was be- ing nailed to the cross. He said, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\" The ordinary person cannot bear his tests. When I started on the spiritual path I supposed that only good would happen to me; but I found that many difficult ex- periences also came. Then I reasoned: \"Because I love God so deeply, I have expected too much from Him. From now on I will say, 'Lord, let Thy will be done.'\"Severe trials came But I held to the thought, \"Let Thy will be done.\" I wanted to accept whatever He sent my way. And He always showed me how to be victorious in every test. Even death is nothing to the spiritually strong. I once dreamed I was dying. Nevertheless I was praying to Him: \"Lord it is all right; whatever is Thy will.\" Then He touched me and I realized the truth: \"How can I die? The wave cannot die,- it sinks back into the ocean and comes forth again. The wave never dies; and I can never die.\" When you go to a clothing store, you try to find a garment"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"146 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST that is suited to you, that brings out the best in you. You should do the same for your soul. The soul has no particular apparel; it can don any style it wants to.

If you think deeply about any person, study his history, and consciously imitate his personality, you will begin to be like him,- you will establish your identity with that personal- ity. I have practised this, and I can take on any personality I wish. When I put on the personality of wisdom I can talk of nothing but wisdom. When I adopt the personality of Sri Chai- tanya, * a great devoted of God, I can speak of nothing but de- votion. And when I attune myself to the personality of Jesus, I cannot speak of God as Mother—only as the Father, as he did.

The Father gave Jesus that universal consciousness by which he knows all things. Even as I am talking, he knows what I am saying. Though you don't see him, I see him.

We are like waves in the ocean of that light—the light of Christ Consciousness [Kutastha Chaitanya ], the light of God. When you see His light and His presence, then you know that this life is nothing more than a test that everyone must go through to reach God. If Satan's tests are conquered, then even Satan be- comes the tool of God. Every trial is a blessing if it brings us nearer to God. This is what you should remember. And what- ever you do on earth, do it for God. Each human being is unique; no two can be exactly the same. Think of yourself in this way: \"My personality is the gift of God. What I am, no one else is. I shall be very proud of my divine individuality. I shall improve myself and don a person- ality of goodness.\" If you play your part well, you are just as good as the soul who plays the part of a king or a queen. And so long as you play your role well, you will be attractive and loved by all. Your part well played is your passport to God. Abraham Lincoln was an accomplished actor on this stage of life. He was not afraid to play his difficult role. He was work- ing for God and for what he believed to be right: the equality of man. That is why he is remembered and loved today. If you strive to serve God, you have served everyone. Seek to please Him, not man. What you expect others to be, you be first. Practise these suggestions. Take one quality at a time and work at develop- ing it. From today, for instance, practise peace. Then take- cheerfulness,• try to smile even when you are unhappy.

The real nature of personality is rarely analysed. What, essentially, is personality? It is the ego conscious- ness,- not ego in the sense of inflated pride, but as the con- sciousness of existence. Each one of us knows: \"I exist.\" Further, we are conscious of existing in a certain way, as a man or a woman, and with certain characteristic qualities. We think about ourselves in terms of our individual background, experiences, and environment. A housekeeper thinks of herself as a housekeeper, a lecturer thinks of himself as a lecturer, a scientist thinks of himself as a scientist. Yet when they are asleep they forget their daytime activities. In sleep the con- sciousness of existence remains, though the egoistic concept of the wakeful personality may fade away entirely. But as soon as one awakens he remembers and becomes reassociated with his environmental identity. Therefore the personality a man dis- plays in his wakeful hours is merely a cultivated and partial in- dividuality. The consciousness of existence is fundamentally a univer- sal, unlimited state; but it becomes more or less bound by the personality traits that we hold to from day to day. Eventually we forget that our individual qualities can be expanded or con- tracted, according to our behaviour. Whence does our true personality derive? It comes from God. He is Absolute Consciousness, Absolute Existence, and Absolute Bliss. The Creator knows that He exists; He also 149"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"150 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST knows that His existence is eternal, and that His nature is evernew Bliss. With the human mind we cannot know the Infinite Mind or perceive what ineffable Spirit is,- but through the supercon- sciousness of the soul we can taste the Divine Presence as Bliss. The joy we receive from any experience flows from God, even though it may have been roused by some outward cir- cumstance. By concentrating within, you can directly feel the divine bliss of your soul within and also without. If you can stabilize yourself in that consciousness, your outer personality will de- velop and become attractive to all beings. The soul is made in God's image, and when we become established in soul aware- ness, our personality begins to reflect His goodness and beauty. That is your real personality. Any other characteristics you dis- play are more or less a graft—they are not the real \"you.\" The divine man, living in the cosmic consciousness of God, can as- sume any kind of outer personality he wishes. When I am conscious of my human personality I have lim- itations, but as soon as I change my consciousness to the soul sphere I see everything just as if it were a motion picture. A person concentrating on the beam by which images are shown on a movie screen can see that all those figures are scintillat- ing by the current of light emanating from the projector. In the same way, I see the world and all its creatures solely as pro- jected thoughts of God. Concentrate on matter and you see everything in terms of matter. But as soon as you lift up your consciousness to the state of divine awareness, you see the oceanic current of God's light flowing behind all matter. You see everything in terms of Spirit. Though the unity of God is reflected in everything, it appears diversified in cosmic nature. His creative life flows throughout the earth; put a seed in the ground and it begins to grow. Metals express a certain power and beauty of God. In the vegetable kingdom He changes His personality again; the active expression of life is more visible in plants.

But all these different personalities have been borrowed from God; He is the only Life. \"O Arjuna! I am the Self in the heart of all creatures: I am their Origin, Existence, and Finality.\" Thus the Lord describes Himself in the Gita.* And in the Bible we read this declaration: \"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.\"! Intuition Develops One's True Personality Our soul intuition is a faculty of God. He has no mouth, yet He tastes everything. He has no hands or feet, yet He feels the whole universe. How? By intuition, by His omnipresence. Man ordinarily relies upon his senses to supply him with information about himself and the world in which he lives. His mind doesn't know anything except what his five senses tell him. But the superman relies upon intuition, his \"sixth sense,\" for knowledge. Intuition doesn't depend on the senses or the power of inference for its data. For example, you feel certain that something is going to happen, and it does happen, exactly as you foresaw it. Each one of you has probably had some such experience. How did you know without any inferential or sense data? That direct knowing is the soul's power of intuition. The ancient Indian sage Patanjali tells us that scriptural authority is not in itself proof of truth. How then can you know that the Bible and the Gita are true? The data relayed by the senses and the power of inference cannot give final proof. Truth is ultimately understood or \"proved\" solely by intuition, soul realization. Your true personality begins to develop when you are able, by deep intuition, to feel that you are not this solid body but are the divine eternal current of Life and Consciousness within the body. That is how Jesus could walk on the water. He realized that everything is composed of the consciousness of God. Human personality can be changed to divine personality.

When you close your eyes and feel the vastness of the soul within you, and when you can make that conscious- ness enduring, then you will have the personality that God in- tended you should have. The experience of the wakeful state has become predominant in your consciousness.

You may go after success or money or fame, and achieve it; but always some flaw—lack of health or insufficient love or some- thing else—will hurt you. The best course is to pray: \"Lord, make me happy with awareness of Thee. Give me freedom from all earthly desires, and above all give me Thy joy that out- lasts all the happy and sad experiences of life.\" Never Forget Your True Nature! Remember that as a child of God you are endowed with greater strength than you will ever need to overcome all the tri- als that God may send you. Often we continue to suffer without making an effort to change; that is why we don't find lasting peace and content- ment. If we would persevere we would certainly be able to con- quer all difficulties. We must make the effort, that we may go from misery to happiness, from despondency to courage. It is necessary first to feel the importance of changing our condition. This attitude stimulates our will to action. Let us resolve that we will always make an effort to improve our Self- knowledge and thus continuously better our existence. India's spiritual scientists explored the kingdom of the soul. They have given to mankind for its benefit certain uni- versal laws of meditation by which real seekers—those who wish to find a good life by changing themselves—may scien- tifically control their minds and attain Self-realization. When you develop your divine nature you become com- pletely detached about the body; you no longer feel identified with it. You look after it as you would attend to a little child. As you realize your true Self more and more, by meditation, you become freed from mental and physical pains. You cast off your lifelong limitations. That is the best way to live out your days on earth."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"154 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST Awaken your Divine Personality Remember that it is not harmful to own things, but it is harmful to be owned by them. It is difficult to have the right balance. Struggling too hard for money, you may neglect your health. You will find that everything will betray you if you be- tray your loyalty to God. So let not one drop of oil fall from the lamp of your attention in the sanctuary of inner silence as you meditate each day, and as you carefully perform your duties in the world.* That is the personality you want to develop—du- tiful in carrying out your obligations in life, but aware that your real Home lies within. What is the use of developing a personality based on worldly values, which are ever changeful and fleeting?

Perform your worldly tasks faithfully, without forgetting for a moment your highest duty, to God. * A story oft-related in India tells of the spiritual test given by the great saint, King Janaka, to his would-be disciple, Sukadeva. To test the young devotee before accepting him for spiritual training, Janaka required Sukadeva to tour the royal palace while carrying in the palm of his hand an oil lamp filled to the brim. The condition of passing the test was that sukadeva was to observe minutely (and subsequently report to the king) every item and detail in each palatial room, without spilling one drop of oil from the brimful lamp. The meaning of the test is that the spiritual aspirant must learn to keep his attention centered in Cod, not allowing his thoughts to wander from Him for a moment, lest the oil of divine communion be spilled, while at the same time he performs accurately to the last detail his duties in the world, t Bhagavad Gita 11:55."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"The Divine Art of Making Friends First Self-Realization Fellowship Temple at Encinitas, California, January 22, 1939 Friendship is the noblest human expression of God's desire to show His love to man. God showers affection on the baby through the father and mother; their feeling for the infant is in- born, because our Creator has ordained that our parents can't help but love us. But friendship comes to us a free, impartial expression of His love.* Two strangers meet, and by an instantaneous choice of their hearts they wish to help each other. Have you ever analysed how this happens? The spontaneous mutual desire to be friends comes directly from God's divine law of attraction- cumulative mutual acts of friendship between two souls in past lives gradually create a karmic bond that irresistibly at- tracts them to each other in this life. So long as it is uncontaminated by selfishness or attraction to the opposite sex, this impulse is pure. But often it is tainted. Friendship grows on the tree of our innermost feelings; it is desecrated by unwholesome desires and selfish actions. If you put the wrong kind of fertilizer on the roots of a tree, the fruit that develops will be poor; and when you feed the tree of hu- man feeling with the emotion of selfishness, your unworthy motives will blemish the fruit of friendship. To feel interested in someone just because he is rich or influential and can do something for you is not friendship. And to be attracted to someone primarily because that person has a beautiful face is not friendship. When that face loses its youthful attractiveness, the \"friendship\" will evaporate. * \"He finds peace who knows Me.. .as the Infinite Lord of Creation, and as the Good Friend of all creatures\" (Bhagavad Gita V:29). 155"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"156 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST Develop Friendships from the Past It is true that you cannot find friendship everywhere. Some persons you see every day and never know, and others you feel you have known always. You should learn to recognize that in- ner cue. Wherever you are, always keep your eyes open, and if you feel divinely attracted to someone, you should develop friendship with that person because he has been your friend in some life before. There are many friends whom we have known in past lives, but those friendships have not yet been perfected. It is better to start building on a foundation that has already been laid than to dig for a foundatin on the sands of temporary acquaintances. It is easy for one to think he has many friends, until they do something hurtful to him, and then he feels deeply disillusioned. Many people make mistakes in choosing friends because they are deluded by outer appearances. The only way to recog- nize real friends is to meditate more. You should try to find friends the divine way, and that is to purge your consciousness of all thought of facial or other appearances as factors in deter- mining your feelings about others. If you do this, one day you will be able to discover true friends all around you. You will feel God's friendship through those humble human channels that do not resist Him. Through the pure of heart the divine light of friendship will flow to you. To Attract Friends, Improve Your Character You cannot attract true friends without removing from your own character the stains of selfishness and other unlovely qualities. The greatest art of making friends is to behave di- vinely yourself—to be spiritual, to be pure, to be unselfish— and to start friendship where the foundation of friendship has already been laid in a past life. Friendship should exist in all human relations: between parents and children, between husbands and wives, between men and men, between women and women, and between men and women. It is unconditional.

To be like them you must perfect your love for others. When you can convince others of your friendship; when you are sure, through the tests of time and many shared expe- riences, that a person really feels for you from the soul, and you feel for that person in the same way—not for any gain, but solely because of the divine impulse of friendship—you will behold in that relationship the reflection of God. Give Friendship to All, As God Does Do not allow your friendship to remain locked up in one person, but gradually establish this divine relationship with others of noble ideals. If you try to build friendship with a wrong-minded person you will be disillusioned. Be friends first with the truly good, then go on being a friend to others until you can feel friendship toward everyone, until you can say: \"I am a friend to all, even my enemies.\" Even toward those who were crucifying him, Jesus felt only friendship, exemplifying in his final ordeal that which he had always taught: \".. .Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and perse- cute you.\"* True friendship is divine love, for it is unconditional and it is real and lasting.

Sacred bliss is never- ending, but the pleasures that come from alcohol and drugs are short-lasting and ultimately bring misery. Every night in sleep you have a taste of peace and joy. While you are in deep slumber, God makes you live in the tran- quil superconsciousness, in which all the fears and worries of this existence are forgotten. By meditation you can experience that holy state of mind when you are awake, and be constantly immersed in healing peace. When the divine joy comes, immediately my breath is still and I am lifted into the Spirit. I feel the bliss of a thousand sleeps rolled into one, and yet I don't lose my ordinary aware- ness. This is universally the experience of those who go deep in the superconscious state. When the profound ecstasy of God falls over you, the body becomes absolutely still, the breath ceases to flow, and the thoughts are quiet—banished, every one, by the magic command of the soul. Then you drink of God's bliss and experience an intoxication of joy that not a thousand draughts of wine could give you. As the ordinary person drowses on the borderline of sleep, he feels a little happiness, but he quickly loses that awareness and is fast asleep. Sleep is not total unconsciousness, for when you awaken, you always know whether you slept well or not. There are various kinds of sleep—some light and some deep. But more intoxicating than even the most blissful slum- ber are those spiritual experiences one may have consciously with God. Beyond the mysteries of the sleepland lie all these divine joys.

In the superconscious state you can see that your body and mind are sleeping and yet have total awareness of all happenings. This is possible only when you have developed the ability to enter at will the superconsciousness, and return at will to the ordinary state of mind. You need never worry that by meditation (or by imagina- tion or by the practise of inner silence) you may go out of the body and fail to return. That idea is entirely false.

There is a lot of difference between the poten- tial realization of God and the actual realization of God. You can never know Him except through humbleness, wisdom, and devotion. The humble man is the one who will know God. Those who go deep in the superconsciousness automati- cally develop unusual spiritual powers, and control over nat- ural forces.

Washington. It was about four o'clock. Suddenly my breath disappeared. My limbs became rigid. I found myself watching the process of death. Breath and movement had left my body, yet I was conscious. This experience of death was wonderful. I saw my body and all nature as a cosmic motion picture, cre- ated from God's light. Joyously I cried, \"There is no death, Lord!

Death shall not frighten him, be- cause he beholds it as a portal to the divine kingdom. The First Path to Cosmic Consciousness Of the three ways to expand human consciousness into cosmic consciousness, the first is the social way, wherein you shut out \"self\" and live for all. Be loyal to your friends, and feel love for everyone. God gave you a family that you might ex- pand your consciousness by caring and doing for others. In fam- ily life we learn love and self-sacrifice for our loved ones, and thus attain some expansion of consciousness. But this is not enough. Love that becomes personal is exclusive, confined; when love becomes impersonal, it expands. Develop imper- sonal love,- be able to give everyone the same love that you be- stow on your family, and to do for others exactly as you would for yourself. The social way to cosmic consciousness is to be- have toward everyone in this way. God loves all His children alike—they are all His divine family, and His love is impersonal. His children should give that same kind of love to one another. This is the divine plan. To for- get it is to suffer. The whole world-attitude should change. You are everyone, because your true nature is omnipresence. I enjoy giving things to others; I feel the greatest happi- ness in seeing their joy. When we feel for and love others, we find that all of creation responds to us. Jesus, who gave up his"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"170 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST body \"as a ransom for many/'* showed us the social way of at- taining cosmic consciousness. Christlike, you too should serve all men as your Self. The man of cosmic consciousness is a happy man. He doesn't limit his love to a few, excluding everyone else. So should you make the whole world your own family. Will you remember? This consciousness is with me every moment. I have no caste, no country—I feel that all are mine. Love all men as your brothers, love all women as your sisters, and all older people as your parents. Love all human beings as your friends. The Second Path The second way to cosmic consciousness is the way of self-discipline. Do not be a victim of immoderation. Enjoy things, but don't be attached to them. Be free. Be pleasant and self-controlled. Avoid becoming a slave to wrong habits, and act only according to your righteous convictions. To attain cos- mic consciousness it is necessary to possess self-control and to rise above dualities—heat and cold, pleasure and sorrow, health and sickness.

If while meditating you are still conscious of the breath, you are tied to body awareness. To enter cosmic consciousness one must free himself from the bonds of the body through guru- given meditation methods.

As you increase the length and depth of your meditations you will find more and more peace, and an ever-new joy. Whatever else you may try, it will not produce the divine consciousness that comes from meditation. The Lord is all around, but you don't feel Him. And you cannot feel Him, within or without, until you remove the lid of ignorance and merge your consciousness with His, to dis- cover Him within yourself. If you sink in material desire you will suffocate. If you sink in the ocean of God you will live forevermore. Once you have found God, you experience real and lasting satisfaction.

That is the smile on Lahiri Mahasaya's* face. He is seeing the world par- tially, but seeing God fully. My smile comes from a joy deep within my being, a joy that you also may attain. Like a fra- grance it oozes out from the core of the blossoming soul. This joy calls others to bathe in its waters of divine bliss. The average man is familiar with four states of mind. When a desire is fulfilled, he is happy. When a desire is denied, he is unhappy. When he is neither glad nor sorrowful, he is bored. When these three emotions, these three states of mind—pleasure, pain, and boredom—are sloughed off, he has peace. Beyond Peace Is Bliss Peace is the absence of the alternations of sorrow and plea- sure, and the absence of boredom. It is a very desirable state. After a tumultuous ride on the crests of pain and pleasure, with frequent dips into the troughs of boredom, you enjoy floating on the calm sea of peace. But greater than peace is bliss—bliss of the soul. It is an ever-new joy that never disappears, but re- mains with your soul through eternity. That joy can be at- tained only by perceiving God. If you place a pot of water under the rays of the moon and then agitate the water, you create a distorted reflection of the moon. When you still the waves in the pot, the reflection be- * A reference to the photograph of Lahiri Mahasaya, the guru of Paramahansa Yogananda's guru.

The time when the water in the pot is quiet and clearly reflecting the moon, is comparable to the meditative state of peace, and the still deeper state of calmness. In the peace of meditation all waves of sensations and thoughts are absent from the mind. In the deeper state of calmness, one perceives in that stillness the mooned reflection of God's presence. Peace is a negative state, being merely the absence of the waves of pleasure, pain, and indifference,- and so after a little while the meditator is attracted once more by the de- sire to experience the waves of motion. But as meditative peace deepens into calmness and the ultimate positive state of bliss, the meditator experiences a joy that is ever new and all-satisfying. When you sleep, you still thoughts and sensations pas- sively. When by meditation you still thoughts and sensations consciously, you experience first the state of peace; and the muscles of your face will form a smile that reflects the peace of your heart. But you must look beyond peace in order to be- hold, undistorted by sensory stimuli and motor reflexes from sense-associated thoughts, the purity of your soul. The state you feel then is ever-new bliss. Saints always have this joy in their hearts. Secure in the divine inner assurance, they are un- shaken by anger or fear. Using the scalpel of reason or intu- ition, they can dissect their own or others' thoughts on the op- erating table of the mind and remain unmoved. \"In soul bliss all grief is annihilated. Indeed, the discrimination of the bliss- ful man soon becomes firmly established (in the Self).\"* Smile with the Love of God Most smiles are born of good emotions arising out of doing good, or out of feeling sympathy, love, kindness, or mercy. But the most wonderful way to smile is to fill your heart with the love of God. Then you will be able to love everybody; you will be able to smile all the time. All other forms of smiles are evanescent because emotions flicker and pass away, no matter how good they are. The only thing that can last is the joy of God. When you have that, you can smile all the time.

A man I knew made a great show of his distress when his wife died. I saw through his emotionalism. \"You will marry within a month,\" I told him. He was so angry at me he would not see me after that, but he did remarry within a month. He thought his love for the first wife was so great, but you see how quickly he forgot her. I shall never forget how much my guru, Sri Yukteswarji, taught me when he told me this little story about his life: \"When I was a little boy I took a notion that I wanted an ugly little dog belonging to a neighbour. I kept my household in tur- moil for weeks to get that dog. My ears were deaf to offers of pets with more prepossessing appearance. I wanted only that dog.\" The same sort of fixation seizes people in so-called ro- mance. Lovers become hypnotized by a face,- they can't forget it. But the real beauty we should seek in others is not outward, but inward. When your soul is filled with joy you are attractive. I like only divine smiles, because without them, human beings are like puppets—today they are saying they will love you forever,- tomorrow they are in the grave. Where is their great love then? Where is the promise, \"I'll love you forever\"? But if you can make God say even once to you, \"I love you,\" it is for eternity. Why do you waste your time for a little human love, and money, and this and that, when in God you can find everything—all the love that is in the whole world, all the power in creation? But don't seek Him for power; seek Him for love. Then you will dis- cover the chink in His armour. When you give Him your un- conditional love, He can no longer refuse you Himself. To Find Bliss, Meditate Meditate more. You do not know how wonderful it is. It is much greater to meditate than to spend hours seeking money or human love or anything else that you can think of.

I am always there now, in that bliss-consciousness of God. Nothing affects me; whether I am alone or with people, that joy of the Lord is always there. I have retained my smile— but to win it permanently was hard work! The same smiles are there within you,- the same joy and bliss of the soul is there. You don't have to acquire them, but rather regain them. You have merely lost them temporarily by identifying yourself with the senses. If you think that objects of sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch will give you supreme joy, you are mightily mistaken. They will only take it away. If you put conditions around your joy—\"without the sight of that face I cannot be happy\"—you will never find unalloyed bliss. Because no sense-produced pleasure is permanent. Time relentlessly works its havoc on physical beauty; everything in the material world is subject to change. Therefore if you could see all the beautiful faces in the world; if you were to hear all the music and touch everything that you desire to, you would still not have found real happi- ness. You may imagine you are happy, however. Sometimes, af- ter you have dug and dug to get at some object of desire, you find no happiness in the object itself, yet you derive a certain satisfaction from the labour you have put into getting it, and you therefore think you are happy. But such satisfactions are short-lived. So so not seek your happiness in the senses. Find joy within and express it in your face. When you do that, wherever you go a little smile will surcharge everyone with your divine magnetism. Everybody will be happy! But remember it is the Lord alone who changes each heart; we must not at all ascribe to ourselves the power to do good. The only one who does good is God. It is His world. If you feel Him as the Indweller of this body—that it is he who works in everything; and if you give everything—both good and bad ac- tions—to Him, you will be surprised to see how all your ac- tions gradually will be changed to good. You will not be able to do anything wrong when the consciousness of God is with you. Give your life to Him. In all you do, say, \"It's You, Lord, not I! Not I, Lord!\" Destroy ego; it is a great obstruction to this lib- erating realization.

If I concentrated on the picture, I saw the pic- ture. If I concentrated on the beam, the world vanished. You cannot see anything without your consciousness. So if you have full mastery over your mind, and you look within at your soul, even though your eyes are open you will see only that great light of God, and feel His great joy. Only as you look out- ward through the eyes will your consciousness perceive the outer world. It is all God's motion picture. I could see, that day in Encinitas, on one side the sensations and thoughts that were dreams of my consciousness which came from God, and on the other side, as I retired within, no sensations at all—just pure joy. And though I was sitting in that extreme cold, clad only in swim trunks, I could feel the cold and the scenery disappear and joy alone come; later I felt the slight impressions of sensa- tions together with that great joy. Practise this—practise the presence of God. Don't be sat- isfied with a little prayer, or seeing a little light, and then go- ing to bed. Sleep is a drug.

When I was watching the motion picture, Song of Bernadette, I was so deeply touched by some of the events in the saint's life that I cried. At last I said: \"What's the matter with me?\" I looked at the picture again and saw only shadows and light; I lost the consciousness of drama. I couldn't cry any- more; a great joyous state came over me. The Motion Picture of Creation In a second, God can duplicate the form of any person who has gone out of the world; He wants you to know that. He wants you to understand that this creation is a show. If you take the show seriously, you are going to get hurt, and you won't like it; you won't be able to stand life, with its sorrow and disease and pain. Whenever anything hurts the body, I put my mind at the seat of spiritual awareness at the point between the eyebrows; then I feel no pain at all. But when I concentrate on the hurt, I feel the delusion of pain. If you can keep your mind centred in the spiritual consciousness of your soul you will not suffer when the delusive shadows of sorrow appear on your mental screen. Pray to God unceasingly to reveal Himself as the sole joyous Reality. You have already lost so much time—death may take you away at any moment, and then you won't have time to know Him. You must realize Him before you go out of the body cage. Tell Him, \"I want to feel Your presence.\" But He won't let you out of this hospital of delusion permanently until you cure yourself of the disease of desires. Do everything for God. Work- ing for Him is just as important to your spiritual progress as meditation. Meditate on the Lord at night until you are uplifted in Him and feel locked in His joy; and when you come down to per- form activities during the day, bring and keep with you the re- membrance of that state.

Yet St. Francis suffered from diseases and at the same time he was healing the sick and raising the dead. His divine joy could not be taken away. So by all means get to God.

You will reap only doubt. You will not be able to understand His laws until you become one with Him. So why waste time trying to understand them by an intellectual approach?

The Bible says: \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?\"* Always remember: your Father loves you unconditionally. But because He has given you freedom to go away from Him or to approach Him, He is waiting for you to express your desire for His love before He comes to you. Once when I was meditating I heard His voice, whispering: \"Thou dost say I am away, but thou didst not come in. That is why thou dost say I am away. I am always in. Come in and thou wilt see Me. I am always here, ready to greet thee.\" Deep sincerity is necessary in the spiritual path. In guile- lessness comes the birth of Spirit. Jesus said: \"Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.\"t Before God our human wisdom is nothing. The only way we can coax Him to surrender Himself to us is by of- fering to Him the same unconditional love that He gives to us.

The Divine has loved me as mother, as father, and as friends. I searched for that one Friend behind all friends, that one Lover whom I now see glimmering in all your faces. And that Friend never fails me.

At birth a wave rises from the surface, and at death it sinks into sleep in the bosom of God. I have realized this. I know I can never die; for whether I am sleeping in the ocean of Spirit or awake in a physical body, I am ever with Him.

You carry this invisible prison with you wherever you go. But you can be free! Determine now to break out of the jail of habits and race for freedom. How frightful life is, that from the age of three we are limited by habit. As soon as I realized I was caged in by habit I broke through all the bars. I would not permit myself to be bound by habits that made me say, \"I can't do that,\" or, \"I have to do this,\" or, \"Don't do that to me, it makes me nervous,\" or, \"I can't stand the cold,\" and so on. Why are these habits so strong from early childhood? Be- cause they have been carried over from previous-life experi- ences. Our moods are inkmarks traced on the graph of life by the karma of the past. Wrong habits and moods are more of- fensive than the odour of the skunk. Why behave like a human polecat, making everyone else uncomfortable and punishing yourself as well? At one time or another we all have done so, because we all have carried with us obnoxious peculiarities. Reclaim Your Lost Divinity But we can overcome undesirable traits. The human mind is elastic. If you pull it gradually, it will yield to your tugs. Yet you don't even try. God has given us more than enough power to overcome all the trials and shortcomings of our lives.

But everyone can be rich in Spirit, for God has given everyone equal power to become like Him. When you claim your divinity, everything belongs to you. A Henry Ford might lose his wealth or his health, but a Jesus Christ can create health or wealth or anything else he wants, at will. So don't long to be as rich or as healthy as someone else,- have only one desire: to be like God. Jesus never claimed that he was the only son of God. The Fa- ther loves you, His child, just as much as He loves Jesus. And God won't deny you anything if, like Jesus, you establish your true status with Him. Meditation is the way to reclaim your lost divinity. Habits are grafts on our real nature, which is ever-free Spirit. In my childhood I used to get very angry, but when I made up my mind not to, I never again gave in to anger.

Learn to discriminate in this New Year: examine every im- pulse that comes, to see if it is the right thing for you to act on. And when your reason tells you to do a certain thing, let nei- ther the fates nor the gods stand in your way. But if you find out that you are wrong, be able to change your mind. Some people are so stubborn, they do not want to admit they are wrong. But one should be guided by reason, not by blind will. If, after calmly reasoning, you make up your mind that what you have set out to do is right, then nobody should be able to stop you. If I had no job I would shake up the whole world un- til people would say, \"Give him a job to keep him quiet!\" (I do not say these things out of personal pride, but that you may learn from my experiences.) Work of any kind, if done in the right spirit, gives you vic- tory over yourself. You may clean bathrooms, but if you do it with the thought of serving and helping people, you are show- ing the right spirit of a man of God. The attitude with which you work is what counts. Mental laziness and working un- willingly spoil one. People often ask me, \"How do you do so * Swami Ram Tirtha."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"188 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST many things?\" It is because I do everything with the greatest pleasure and spirit of service. Inwardly I am all the time with God. And though I sleep very little I always feel fresh, because I perform my duties with the right attitude: that it is a privi- lege to serve. You must realize that you are a child of God. Make up your mind that you are not going to be run by that old habit- bound self. The temporary limitations and imperfections of the body and brain cannot hold you back; as soon as you give the verdict and strongly will to be a new person, you will change. You have been a prisoner of your habits and it has not been good for you. It is because of wrong habits of thinking and act- ing in this and in other lives that your bodily kingdom yields now to invasions of disease, troubles, moods, and ignorance. From now on you must say: \"I am not the slave of the body. I am the dictator of my own kingdom. My thoughts are going to be exactly as I wish them to be.\" Once you have changed your habits, you will say to yourself, \"How simple it was to do it! How unkind I have been to myself by not exchanging my soul- stultifying habits for those that bring happiness.\" Are You a Psychological Antique? Habit-bound people can best be described as psychological antiques. They are the same, year in and year out. They say the same old things, do the same old things. Converse with them just a little while and you can anticipate exactly what their next remark will be. Take a look in the mirror of introspection and see if you are a psyclological antique. Most people are. But why should you be one? Change your habits. Cast out moods. Try to be better every day. Let people be able to say, \"What a wonderful change has come over him!\" The man of Self-realization has achieved mastery over the old habit-dulled self. Recognizing such mastery in Jesus, the of- ficers who had been sent by the Pharisees to arrest him came away marvelling instead at his assurance, saying, \"Never man spake like this man.\"* A master's nature is infinite,- it cannot be contained in the narrow confines of human conceptions.

You will never be happy so long as you remain habit-mired in ignorance of your eternal soul-nature. It does not matter who you are; the only way you can find lasting joy is to go back to God. You do not have to leave earth's shores and put on wings; you must learn rather to be happy here and now, under all conditions; and to include others' happiness in your own joy. Go out of your way to make others happy. You cannot please everybody, but to those souls who cross your path, give kindness and love. There is no more liberating action than sincerely to give people kindness in return for unkind- ness. Why not be like a flower that gives fragrance even when crushed in the hand? The Gita teaches: \"He who is free from hatred toward all creatures, is friendly and kind to all... is dear to Me.\"* If people criticize you, do not ignore them. See if you have the fault they ascribe to you, and if you do, silently correct your error. But it is seldom necessary to confess your faults to others; often it is unwise. Should they become angry with you, they might unkindly hold your confession over your head as a threat. To a God-realized spiritual teacher or guru you can tell your faults, but not to someone who cannot help you, and who might instead hurt you by broadcasting your flaws to others.

That is how he obstructs God. The Lord could easily destroy Satan, but prefers to overcome him by love. Whenever we choose the divine offerings of eternal joy instead of the passing pleasures of the senses, the Adversary is robbed of his dark power. So it is up to us to cooperate with our Heav- enly Father, that the Devil may be vanquished. Whenever you are slothful and careless, you help Satan to pull you toward his side. Jesus prayed: \"Lead us not into temp- tation, but deliver us from evil.\"* Temptation is not our own creation; it belongs to the world of maya, and all men are sub- ject to it. But to enable us to free ourselves, God gave us rea- son, conscience, and will power. To give our approval to sinful activities is to find ourselves in trouble. When by our wrong thoughts we fall into the pit of error, we should pray: \"Father, leave us not here, but pull us out through the force of our reason and will. And when we are out, if it is Thy will to test us further, first make Thyself known to us—that we may realize that Thou art more tempt- ing than temptation.\" So long as you feel unwilling to deny yourself some par- ticular pleasure that is detrimental to your welfare, you are in the region of Satan; the evil results of succumbing to harmful sense lures will at one time or another overtake you. But if you are convinced that temptation is dangerous to you because it promises happiness and in the end gives sorrow, you can out- wit the Devil. * Matthew 6:13. 192"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"HOW TO OUTWIT TEMPTATION 193 Why Sense Experiences Are Alluring Temptations are alluring; there is no doubt about that. Our sensory powers are all directed to the outer world. There is a current of life energy flowing from the brain through the nerves into the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin. The sensations we experience through these instruments are the result of this out- ward-flowing current, and we tend to like the feeling. That is the appeal of the senses. Overindulging them is dangerous; un- til a man is established in wisdom, the outgoing energy leads him into sense bondage. By the five-rayed searchlight of the senses, we perceive and explore the world of matter. Through the senses we learn to like things that are pleasing to see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. The desire for a particular sensation becomes a habit. The trouble is, most people have not had any experience of the Spirit, which is hidden behind matter; hence they have no stan- dard of comparison between the exciting, pleasurable percep- tions of the senses and the unknown ineffable bliss of the soul. And there is no chance to compare until one has renounced or become mentally insusceptible to all sense enticements. The only way to avoid the trap is to realize by reason or experience that there are higher joys. Habit Is a Pitiless Dictator Commandments to refrain from harmful experiences are generally futile. Whenever you order a person not to do some- thing, he immediately wants to do it. The taste of forbidden fruits is sweet in the beginning, but in the end, bitter. Yet no matter how much suffering people experience, they go on do- ing the same self-harming things. Once you have established a liking for a certain sensory experience, the habit sits like a dic- tator in the brain and commands you to indulge yourself, even though it is against your best interests. You don't want to re- peat an act, and yet you do it. Try never to let yourself reach a point where you become such a victim of wrong habits. You must be the master of yourself; do not let any habit control you. Whenever the desire for a particular sensory experience becomes habitual, it is time to stop that practice.

Some students arranged to have this beverage on hand for me wherever I went. One day I found my supply was all gone, and I missed it. \"Mr. Ginger Ale,\" I said, \"you have gone too far, and I hadn't even realized it! Goodbye.\" The next day I purposely drank a little ginger ale as a test, and it tasted terrible. My thought of the previous day had been so strong that the desire was banished immediately. I never miss anything that is taken away from me or that I voluntarily give up. No physical comfort can bind me. I have tried it out. You must be able to pass through all experiences of life without attachment. Lord Krishna said: \"The man of self-control, roaming among material objects with subjugated senses, and devoid of attraction and repulsion, attains an un- shakable inner calmness.\"* Any time you have to have some- thing—a soft bed, a pillow, or whatever—remember that you are putting yourself into slavery; and when your will and dis- crimination are held captive by binding sense attachments, you will lose the infinite kingdom of God. Jesus is still enjoying the transcendental ecstasy that he experienced when he resur- rected himself in the Lord. But those who exist in ignorance, subject to the pressures of desires, will continue that way life after life until they resist worldly seductions. You should be careful not to let anything hurt your true happiness. Corroding emotions of anger, greed, and jealousy, and overstimulation by sex, alcohol, or drugs are extremely detrimental to you, for they prevent the realization of soul joy. Never abuse the sensory powers by overindulgence, if you would be really happy. \"Ever fed, never satisfied; never fed, ever satisfied\" is a true axiom about unwholesome sense ex- periences. Wisdom Is Man's Best Protection Protect yourself within the fortress of wisdom. There is no greater safety. Complete understanding will bring you to a point where nothing can hurt you.

The very things that our hearts cry for—love, fame, wisdom, everything else—we find in communion with that Complete One. Even if you are the most famous man in the world, death will be the end of your awareness of fame,- you will not know then that people adore you. But Jesus, is aware that his devotees love him; because his consciousness is one with the consciousness of God manifesting throughout cre- ation, the Christ Intelligence [Kutastha Chaitanya ], om- nipresent, omniscient, ever living.

If he makes no effort to curb his indulgence in liquors, he may become an alcoholic and helplessly suffer from an over- whelming desire to drink without any limit, without rhyme or reason. Such unfortunate people often spend all their money on drink; they eat very little and seem to get some nourishment from the liquor itself. The normal sense of responsibility to- ward maintaining good health and an honourable standing in the family, society, and the world is lost. They may eventually lose all sense of pride and be picked up dead drunk anywhere— in a ditch, or in the middle of the street—exposed meanwhile to the dangers of being robbed or run over. The foregoing description of liquor alcoholics serves to illustrate what I mean by \"mental alcoholics.\" The latter may be individually classified according to their particular psycho- logical extreme, which might be chronic anger, fear, sex, sadism, gambling, stealing, jealousy, hate, greed, moods, crafti- ness, or stupidity.

A False Conception The angry man, the sexual man, the greedy man forgets his own position, and his relations with society, and commits great blunders that ruin his life and the lives of others. Many of these mental alcoholics think that if they give expression to their psychological habits, they will feel somewhat re- lieved. But the self-indulgent habit of giving in to harmful impulses is extremely pernicious, for it is by repetition of such evil expressions that a person becomes a chronic mental alcoholic, making a fool of himself anytime and anywhere. If children are exposed to an evil environment while their minds are in a plastic state, they will develop wrong habits that, unchecked, may lead to chronic mental alcoholism. Par- ents who notice a sudden change in a child—perhaps a calm- natured boy suddenly turns into a repeatedly angry boy— should immediately take care of this. The causes of his frustrations should be determined and removed, and new av- enues for constructive use of his energies sought. Those who habitually display any of the foregoing traits are mental alcoholics. They recklessly ride down the Niagara Falls of continuous bad habits, smashing their happiness to pieces as they helplessly but willingly indulge in uncontrolled expression of their worst traits. It is not good to remonstrate with mental alcoholics who frequently display violent moods of disgust and boredom with the world.

The most effective cure is to move him immediately to an environment that will be a specific antidote to his toxic mental condition. If possible, the angry mental alcoholic should be placed with one or more individuals who do not become angry, even under irritating circumstances. The sexual person ought to be surrounded by self-controlled people; the habitual thief needs the society of honest people. The chronically timid can be helped by association with the brave, and by reading stories of men who were heroes. Moody or scornful or \"sourpuss\" types should have the companionship of habitually cheerful people. A mental alcoholic should remember that poor elimina- tion, and eating meat (beef and pork especially), will aggravate his psychological malady, fixing it even more firmly in his brain. An abundance of fruits and vegetables in the daily diet, and each week a one-day fast on fruit juices—with a longer fast occasionally—will greatly help to change the cerebral grooves that entrench the pernicious habits. Sexual excess impairs the nervous system and the brain cells, which in turn aggravates anger in a mental alcoholic. Overindulgence in sex destroys will power, also. Hence all mental alcoholics should learn control over the sex impulse, that they may practice moderation in marital relations, as na- ture intended. Petty Dictators Often we find that the breadwinners in a family—father or son or, sometimes, mother or daughter—display a tendency toward mental alcoholism because of the consciousness that they are in a position to dictate. Such little dictators in families should not freely unload their moods on innocent, harmless dependents, and thus lose the inner respect of those around them. When a family dictator thinks he can get away with doing what he pleases at home, he gradually begins to do what he pleases in expressing unpleasant moods or evil traits outside the family.

You and those around you would no doubt try to evict the skunk, and in so doing be drenched with its malodorous chemicals. Both the family and the skunk would suffer.

It is better even to hide mental alcoholism than to give in to its influence in public. Continued shameless indulgence is the soil in which prenatal or postnatal tendencies thrive.

Each type of mood has a specific cause, and it lies within your own mind. To remove a mood you must remove its cause. One should introspect each day in order to understand the na- ture of his mood, and how to correct it, if it is a harmful one. Perhaps you find yourself in an indifferent state of mind. No matter what is suggested, you are not interested. It is necessary then to make a conscious effort to create some positive inter- est. Beware of indifference, which ossifies your progress in life by paralysing your will power. Perhaps your mood is discouragement over sickness; a feel- ing that you will never regain health. You must try to apply the laws of right living that lead to a healthy, active, and moral life, and pray for greater faith in the healing power of God. Or suppose your mood is a conviction that you are a fail- ure, and can never succeed at anything. Analyse the problem and see if you have really made all the effort you could have. Consider the hard work of the president of the United States. He has to try to please all the forty-eight states,* and other nations as well. We have to marvel that it is possible for a man to understand so much and undertake so much. And as there is such a difference between the working capacity of the ordinary man and that of the president, how much greater the difference between that of the president and God, who is infi- nitely busier! God is managing the whole universe, down to the most minute detail— and we are made in His image. Therefore we cannot make excuses for failure to succeed. Don't be afraid of hard work; it has never hurt anyone. However, one should learn to work—and to think—calmly. When you are * Alaska and Hawaii were not yet states at the time Paramahansaji made this observation.

In addition to not working hard enough for success, most people are not mentally active enough. They spend too much time not thinking. It is considered to be relaxation. However, in true relaxation one is calmly active mentally,- he may reflect about God, or about a beautiful peaceful scene, or about some pleasant experience. Calm, positive mental activity is revivi- fying. Yet many people wrongly associate creative effort with strain, and go about it with a tense, nervous attitude. Moods Get Their Grip on a Vacant Mind Creative thinking is the best antidote for moods. Moods get their grip on your consciousness when you are in a negative or passive state of mind. The time when your mind is vacant is just the time it can become moody; and when you are moody, the devil comes and wields his influence on you. Therefore, develop creative thinking. Whenever you are not active physically, do something creative in your mind. Keep it so busy that you have no time to indulge in moodiness. Creative thinking is marvellous—like living in another world. Everyone should develop this power. I think hardly a word of my lecture before I come here,- but I get into the con- sciousness of my subject, and my soul begins to tell me won- derful things. When you are thinking creatively, you don't feel the body or moods; you become attuned with Spirit. Our hu- man intelligence is made in the image of His creative intelli- gence, through which all things are possible; and if we don't live in that consciousness, we become a bundle of moods. By thinking creatively we destroy those moods,- and by thinking creatively we will find all the answers to our problems, and to the problems of others. Moods are like cancer—they eat into the peace of the soul. That is why the moody man cannot rid himself of his troubles. Remember: no matter how wrong everything has gone for you, you have no right to be moody. In your mind you can be a con- queror. When bested, the moody man admits defeat. But the man whose mind remains unconquered, though the world be in cinders at his feet, is yet the victor."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"206 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST Do you want to be a prisoner or a conqueror? By binding yourself so tightly in moods, you render yourself incapable of going on with the battle of life. As soon as you allow a mood to enwrap your mind, your will becomes paralysed. Moods befog the brain, and hence impair judgment, so that your efforts are wasted. Moods Are the Brakes on Your Wheels of Progress You can conquer your moods, no matter how terrible they seem. Make up your mind that you are not going to be moody anymore; and if a mood comes in spite of your resolve, analyse the cause that brought it on, and do something constructive about it. Don't go on doing things in a state of indifference, if that is your attitude, for indifference is the worst of all moods. At such times, remind yourself that you are not your own creator,- God created you, and He is running this universe for you. Whatever your work, do it enthusiastically, for Him. Busy yourself in creative activities, for He has given you infinite power. How dare you make yourself a mental failure by indul- gence in the intoxicant of moodiness! Free yourself from these devastating mental states. They are the real brakes on the wheels of your progress. Until you release them, you cannot move on. Every morning, remind yourself that you are God's child, and that no matter what the difficulties, you have the power to overcome them. Heir to the cosmic power of Spirit, you are more dangerous than danger! An intelligent boy does not care to work on simple problems; he enjoys the challenge of difficult ones. But many people are afraid of life's problems. I have never feared them, for I have always prayed: \"Lord, may Thy power increase in me. Keep me in the positive consciousness that with Thy help I can always overcome my difficulties.\" Think constructively about a problem till you cannot think anymore. When I am solving a problem, I go to the nth degree to cover all possible steps toward its solution, until I can honestly say: \"I have done my best, and that is all I can do.\" Then I forget it.

If you are unable to think, compare your particular trouble with others' similar troubles, and from their experiences learn which ways lead to failure and which ways lead to success. Choose those steps that seem logical and practical, and then get busy implementing them. The whole library of the universe is hidden within you. All the things you want to know are within yourself. To bring them out, think creatively. Magical Effect of Sincere Love Moods blunt one's feelings and understanding, making it impossible to get along with others. Domestic life should be a temple of heaven, but moods can make it a hades. A husband comes home and finds his wife in a sullen mood, and he can't reason with her. Or he returns from work in a nasty mood, and she can't reason with him. So much trouble comes to people because of moods! When someone else in your family is seething with anger, or is wholly indifferent, you are affected immediately by his mood. Or perhaps you go to someone in great joy, but he is moody and quarrelsome, and finally he gives you a slap. Im- mediately your joy vanishes, and you want to retaliate. Do not put on the mood of another. The Bible tells us that if anyone smites us on the left cheek, we should turn the right cheek. How many do that? More often, the person slapped wants to give his assailant twelve slaps in reprisal—and perhaps a kick, or even a bullet! It is easy to strike back, but to give love is the highest way to try to disarm your persecutor. Even if it doesn't work at the time, he will never be able to forget that when he gave you a slap, you gave love in return. That love must be sincere,- when it comes from the heart, love is magical. You should not look for the effects; even if your love is spurned, pay no attention. Give love and forget. Don't expect anything; then you will see the magical result. Do you realize that within you, in your soul, is a superb garden? a wondrous garden of thoughts, fragrant with love, goodness, understanding, and peace, and more beautiful than any earthly flowers that grow.

Isn't the aroma of that love and understanding more lasting than that of any rose?

If you cultivate the heavenly scented blooms of peace and love, the bee of Christ Con- sciousness [Kutastha Chaitanya]* will steal into your garden. As the bee seeks out only those flowers that are sweet with honey, so God comes only when your life is sweet with hon- eyed thoughts.

If you can't be busy outwardly, be con- structively busy inwardly. Live in a World of Wonder I often say: If you read for one hour, write for two hours; and if you write for two hours, think for three hours; and if you think for three hours, meditate all the time. God is the repos- itory of all happiness; and you can contact Him in everyday life. Yet man mostly occupies himself in pursuits that lead to unhappiness. Meditation is the best way to destroy moods and live in a world of wonder—a world such as Narada, a great rishi, knew when he said: \"Lord, I was singing Thy praises, and became lost in Thee. When I came back to this consciousness, I saw that I had slipped from my old body, and You had given me a new one!\" * God's omnipresent intelligence, and the attractive force of His love, mani- fested in creation, t Bhagavad Gita XII: 18-19."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"OVERCOMING MALIGNANT MOODS 209 A similar story is told in India about another saint. A young man had just died. His body had been carried to the cremation grounds and the mourners were preparing to light the fire, when suddenly an old man came running, crying out, \"Stop! Don't do it, I will use that body.\" As soon as he said this, the man's aged body dropped lifeless to the ground, and the youg man got up from the pyre and ran off toward the for- est. The old man was a great saint; he had simply not wished to interrupt his devotions by taking rebirth in an infant's help- less body. Fear Enters When God Is Shut Out of Life There are so many wondrous things to know about life and death, and meditation is the way. Learn to live in this world as a son of God. Death holds terror for man because he has left God out of his life. All painful things frighten us, because we love the world without understanding its mystery and purpose. But when we behold everything as God, we have nothing to fear. We are constantly \"born\" in life as well as death. The word \"death\" is a great misnomer, for there is no death; when you are tired of life, you simply take off the overcoat of flesh and go back to the astral world. * Death means an end. A car whose parts are worn out is dead; it has come to an end. And so at death the physical body comes to an end. But the immortal soul cannot be dead. Every night, in sleep, the soul lives without any consciousness of the physical body,- but it is not dead. Death is only a greater sleep, wherein the soul lives in the astral body without the con- sciousness of the physical body. If loss of physical-body con- sciousness signified death for man, then the soul would die when we go to sleep. But we are not dead when we are asleep; nor are we completely unconscious, because when we awaken, we remember whether we slept well or not. So, in the afterstate of death we do not die. * The Hindu scriptures state that the soul of man is encased successively in three bodies: the idea or causal body, a subtle astral body, and a gross physical body. The astral world is the subtle realm of finer forces to which the soul, still encased in its causal and astral bodies, retires at physical death to continue its spiritual education and evolution until it incarnates again on earth.

This means you must strive daily to improve yourself in some way. Above all, pray for wisdom, because with wisdom everything else comes. Be controlled not by moods, but by wisdom. And with that wisdom, develop creative thinking and activity. Keep busy doing constructive things for your own self-improve- ment and for the benefit of others, for whoever would enter God's kingdom must try also to do good for others every day. If you follow this pattern, you will feel the mood-dispelling joy of knowing you are advancing, mentally, physically, and spiri- tually. You will surely reach God, for that way leads to the kingdom of heaven. Strive continuously to overcome moods,- for as soon as you feel moody, you are cultivating seeds of error in the soil of your soul. To indulge in moods is to die gradually,- but if you try daily to be cheerful in spite of any upsetting experiences, you will have a new birth. Until this human birth becomes transmuted into a highly spiritual birth, you cannot be \"born again\"* in God. Moods are \"catching,\" and at times of general depression can affect large numbers of people. Man should not take life's unhappy incidents so seriously. It is better to laugh a little than to make a tragedy of every misfortune. The Gita teaches: \"He who feels neither rejoicing nor loathing toward the glad nor the sad (aspects of phenomenal life), who is free from grief and cravings, who has banished the relative consciousness of good and evil, and who is intently devout—he is dear to Me.\"t To have an optimistic disposition and try to smile is constructive and worthwhile; for whenever you express divine qualities, such as courage and joy, you are being born again,- your con- sciousness is being made new by the manifestation of your true soul nature.

But what about the sceptics and the atheists? Can the truth of reincarnation be scientifically proven to their satisfaction? Can the theory of reincarnation be in any way scientifically experimented with, so as to furnish not only hope, but actual proof, of its reality? Material scientists claim that they have not found any ac- tual proof of the existence of a God, and hence cannot offer any proof of the existence of His just law, giving equal opportunity to all life to improve through reincarnation. To such scientists, the sufferings of innocent babies and other inequities of life seem inexplicable, and point to the absence of a just Creator. Scientific Law On the other hand, most of those who do believe in a just God base their convictions on belief only, and have no scien- tific proof to offer to unbelievers. They do not dare, for the most part, to scrutinize or deeply question their faith, for fear of losing it or of creating some social inharmony. They are not aware, in other words, of the existence of a scientific spiritual law that can prove their beliefs to be truth. Buy why should not spiritual law be investigated by the same methods of experimentation used by the material scien- tist to discover physical truths?

Since the means of proof do exist, no one has a right to say that reincarnation and other spiritual laws do not operate, until he has tried the methods and seen the results for himself. A doubting physical scientist is entitled to express his opinion, but it remains an opinion only, not a fact. In physical science, certain procedures must be adopted and followed in order to prove the truth of any given theory. Germs are not visible to the naked eye ; one must use a microscope to detect their presence. If a person refuses to look through the microscope, he cannot be said to have scientifically tested the theory that germs are present. His opinion is therefore valueless, since he has not followed the prescribed rules for arriving at the truth of the theory. So it is in spiritual matters. The method has been discovered, the rules laid down, and the result is open to any- one who is interested enough to experiment. In the Western world, owing to lack of this scientific approach to spiritual law, the value of religion has been greatly diminished as a vital factor in the life of man, and spiritual doctrines are believed in or rejected simply on the grounds of personal bias, rather than as a result of scientific investigation. How Were the Spiritual Laws Discovered? How did the spiritual scientists (rishis) of ancient India discover these unalterable cosmic laws? Through experiment on the life and thought of man, in the laboratories of their hermitages. To find the truth of physical things, we must experiment with physical substances. So, to find the truth of reincarnation, or the passage of the same soul through many bodies, it is necessary to experiment upon the consciousness of man. These scientists of old found that the human ego per- sists through all changes of experience and thought during the states of wakefulness, dream, and dreamless sleep during one's lifetime. The cognitive experiences changed, the environment, sensations, thoughts, and bodily states changed, but the sense of identity, of \"I,\" did not change from birth to death. The Hindu experimentalists argued that through concentration on the self, through a constant, conscious, aloof, unidentified"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"REINCARNATION CAN BE SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN 213 introspection or watching of the various changing states of life—of wakefulness, dreaming, or dreamless sleep—that one could perceive the changeless and eternal nature of the self. Ordinarily, one is conscious of his waking state, and some- times he is conscious also of his dreaming state. It is not uncommon, during a dream, for a person to be aware that he is dreaming. Through certain methods and practices, one can maintain conscious awareness during every state of his being: wakefulness, dreaming, dreamless sleep, and turiya, \"deep sleep,\" the ever-awake superconsciousness (the unrestricted region of mind) beyond dreamless subconsciousness. Relaxation in Sleep During sleep, there is involuntary relaxation of energy from the motor and sensory nerves. Through practice, one can produce this relaxation during the waking state also, at will. In the big sleep of death, there is total relaxation—the retirement of energy from the heart and cerebrospinal axis. By deep medi- tation, this complete relaxation may be produced consciously in the waking state. In other words, every involuntary function may be accomplished voluntarily and consciously by practice. The rishis of ancient India analysed death as the with- drawal of the electricity of life from the bulb of human flesh with its wires of sensory and motor nerves that lead to the different channels of outward expression. Just as electricity does not die when it is withdrawn from a broken bulb, so life energy is not annihilated when it retires from the involuntary nerves. Energy cannot die. It withdraws, upon the occasion of death, into the Cosmic Energy. Current Withdrawn In sleep, the conscious mind ceases to operate—the current is temporarily withdrawn from the nerves. In death, the human consciousness permanently ceases to express itself through the body,- it is as though one had a paralysed arm—he is mentally conscious of that arm, but cannot function through it. Medical records describe the case of a clergyman who once fell into a state of suspended animation. He heard everyone around bewailing his apparent death, but could not express his"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"214 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST awareness through his physical organs. His body motor had \"stalled\" and refused to respond to his mental commands. Af- ter he had passed twenty-four hours in this state, and was about to be taken away for burial, he made a supreme effort and was able to move. This instance illustrates the constancy of the awareness of \"I-ness\" or personal identity, even though the body is seemingly lifeless. The rishis taught that one must learn to separate the en- ergy and consciousness from the body, consciously. One must consciously watch the state of sleep, and must practise con- scious voluntary withdrawal of energy from the heart and spinal regions. Thus he learns to do consciously what death will otherwise force upon him unconsciously and unwillingly. * An Amazing Case There is a case on record, in the files of French and other European doctors, of a man named Sadhu Haridas—in the court of Emperor Ranjit Singh of India—who was able to sep- arate his energy and consciousness from his body and then con- nect the two again after several months. His body was buried underground and watch was kept over the sopt, day and night, for months. At the end of this time, his body was exhumed and examined by the European doctors, who pronounced him dead. After a few minutes, however, he opened his eyes and regained control over all the functions of his body; and lived for many years more. He had learned, by practice, how to control all the involuntary functions of his body and mind. He was a spiritual scientist who experimented with prescribed methods for learn- ing the truth of cosmic law. As a result he was in a position to demonstrate the truth of the theory of the changelessness of personal identity and the eternal nature of the life principle. * The life energy enters the body at the medulla, is stored in the reservoir of the cerebrum, and then descends into five other centres of life and conscious- ness in the spine, whence it is distributed to the organs of sensory perceptions and to all other parts of the body. At death, the life energy retires irrevocably into the spine and leaves the body through the medulla. The accomplished yogi can voluntarily and consciously withdraw the life energy from the body and senses into the spine, directing it upward to the highest centres of divine per- ceptions, where he is joyously aware of being \"dead\"—freed from sensory delu- sions of being limited to a purely physical existence."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"REINCARNATION CAN BE SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN 215 Those who want to prove for themselves the scientific truth of the doctrine of reincarnation should first prove the principle of continuity of consciousness after death by learning the art of consciously separating the soul from the body. * This can be done by following the rules laid down many centuries ago by the Hindu savants: Learn (1) to be conscious during sleep, (2) to be able to produce dreams at will, (3) to disconnect the five senses consciously, not passively as during sleep, and (4) to control the action of the heart, which is to experience conscious death, or the suspended animation of the body (but not of the consciousness) that occurs during the higher states of superconsciousness. Follow the Practices Bhagavan Krishna taught: \"The ego is continuously con- spious of itself in childhood, youth, and old age,- the embodied soul is uninterruptedly conscious not only of these states but also of attaining another body after death (in the long series of 'lives' and 'deaths' that are the ego's alternations between the physical and astral worlds), \"t By following the practices that lead to the four states out- lined above, we can follow the ego in all states of existence— we can follow it consciously through death, through space, to other bodies or other worlds. Those who do not learn these things cannot retain their sense of personal identity, of aware- ness or consciousness, during the big sleep of death, and hence cannot remember any previous state, or even the \"deep sleep\" states during one life. By adopting the methods of the ancient Hindu scientists who experimented with such laws, and who thereby gave the world a knowledge that is priceless and demonstrable, one may come to know the scientific truth of reincarnation and all other eternal verities. * The Christian mystic St. Paul understood and demonstrated this mastery of life and death; he declared: \"...I die daily\" [I Corinthians 15:31, Bible), t Bhagavad Gita 11:13."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Reincarnation: The Soul's Journey to Perfection Self-Realization Fellowship Temple, Hollywood, California, February 20, 1944 Reincarnation is the progress of a soul through many lives on the earth plane, as through so many grades in a school, before it \"graduates\" to the immortal perfection of oneness with God. Souls that are living in an imperfect state (unaware of their divine identity with Spirit) do not, upon the death of the physical body, automatically enter a state of God-realization. We are made in the image of God, but by identification with the physical body, we have put on its imperfections and limitations. Until this imperfect human consciousness of mortality is removed, we cannot become gods again. A prince ran away from his palatial home and sought shel- ter in a slum. As a result of intoxication and of mixing with persons of bad character, he gradually lost sight of his true identity. Not until his father found him and took him home to the palace did he remember that he was actually a prince. Similarly, we are all children of the King of the Universe who have run away from our spiritual home. We have kept our- selves locked up in human bodies for so long that we have for- gotten our divine heritage. As often as we have come on earth we have developed new imperfections and new desires. So we come back here again and again until we fulfill all desires; or until, through increase of wisdom, we banish those desires. We must satisfy our desires, or, by cultivating wisdom, do away with them altogether.

But it is necessary to do so with wisdom and discrimination,- otherwise even small desires may come back in a stronger way, reinforced by experience. People who feel a desire to drink, for example, often \"reason\" thus: \"I will have all I want today, and tomorrow I will do without.\" After several repetitions of this experience, the usual result is that they find they have instilled a habit, and then it is difficult to get rid of it. The same thing may happen with any other desire. God is not a dictator who has sent us here and is telling us what to do. He has given us free will to do as we please. We hear a great deal about the importance of being good. But if we all go straight to heaven when we die (as some claim), what is the point in trying to do good while we are here? If there is the same reward for everyone at the end of life, why not be a greedy, selfish person, since the path of evil is often the easiest one to take? There would be no use in emulating the lives of great saints if when we die we all—the good and the bad alike—become angels. On the other hand, if God has it in His plan for us all to go to Hades, again there would be no use in worrying about how we behave in this life.

The time element is most impor- tant in our progress. One life-span only may not afford suffi- cient time. If a child dies early in life, there is a reason for that death; and because he did not have enough time in which to express his potential, human or divine, he will be given another opportunity in which to do so. Such a person is like a boy who is sick and cannot go to school. The boy does not leave school forever; as soon as he is well he goes back to school to start his lessons where he left off. So it is with life. If we don't have a chance to learn our lessons in this life, we shall have opportu- nities to learn them in some other. When you can see \"behind the scenes\" you will realize that life on earth is a puppet show.

You go along 365 days a year, year after year, and perhaps you have made some progress,- but your nature will be the same after death as it was before death. You will not become an angel just because you die! Only the body changes. Death makes no difference, otherwise. Death is like a gate you will pass through. Your body will be gone but you will be in every other respect the same. If you have a violent temper, you will not leave it behind, at death, with your phys- ical body. Your violent temper will remain with you until you conquer it. If in your present life you have observed the laws of healthful living, in your next incarnation you will possess a healthy body. The last portion of life is more important than the first, because what you are at the end of this life is what you will be at the beginning of the next. The first part of life is usually stupidly misspent, in a sort of bewildered state. Then romance comes, and finally disease and old age,- the struggle with the body starts. I have coined a phrase, \"patchwork living,\" to describe how one has to keep on patching and repatching the body to keep it going. The body is a trouble most of the time: a \"spark plug\" is missing, or the \"tires\" give out; you have headaches or a cold, or the stomach goes wrong; there is difficulty with the teeth, and so on. Always trouble, trouble! That is why it is so necessary to your happiness that you realize you are not the body, with all its aches and pains, but an immortal soul. I don't take life seriously at all. I say, \"Lord, anytime you want to remove this body from the soul, it is all right.

The Hindu scriptures say that it takes a million years of harmo- nious, disease-free living for the soul to be liberated. Therefore, comparatively little change is to be expected in the ordinary man from life to life. But one's spiritual evolution may defi- nitely be hastened by determined effort in right living and by the help of a true guru. The sages of India have analysed mankind as belonging to four basic types: the Sudras, those capable of offering service to society through bodily labour,- the Vaisyas, those who serve through mentality, skill, agriculture, trade, commerce, busi- ness life in general; the Kshatriyas, those whose talents are ad- ministrative, executive, and protective—rulers and warriors; and the Brahmins, those of contemplative nature, spiritually inspired and inspiring. Qualitatively, Sudras are those who see in life no greater purpose than the satisfaction of wants and desires of the body; such persons eat, sleep, work, multiply, and finally die. Mil- lions today live in the Sudra or \"labourer\" state—concerned merely with the comfort and pleasure of the body. The man in the Vaisya or mentally active state is always busy getting things done. Some people of this class think of nothing else but business,- they live only to earn money, which they usually squander on sense enjoyments. But the best Vaisya type of businessman is much more evolved and creative in nature. The third or Kshatriya class are those who, after having had the experience of earning money and of creating something along business lines, begin to understand what life is all about; they strive by self-control to win the battle with the senses. (The Vaisya man doesn't engage himself in such effort for inner improvement. He simply earns money and produces children and seldom thinks about the meaning of life except in terms of"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"REINCARNATION: THE SOUL'S JOURNEY TO PERFECTION 221 business.) But the third or Kshatiiya class takes life more seriously. Such a man asks himself, \"Should I not struggle with and destroy my bad habits?\" He feels a desire to overcome evil tendencies and to do what is right. The last and highest state is that of the Brahmin: knower of Brahma or God. * Analyse Yourself to See How You Should Change To recapitulate the four basic types of consciousness in man: Sudra is the sense-bound state of existence; Vaisya is the business or creative stage of man. Kshatriya is the warrior state, when man desires to do battle with his senses and to con- quer his attachment to them. Brahmin is the wisdom state, attained by man when he has overcome all attachment to the senses and remains consciously immersed in Brahma, God. Every human being fits into one of these four classifica- tions, and if you analyse yourself you can find your class. Think over your life from childhood days and try to reason out in which of the four classifications you belong. Reflect on whether you have been living for sense pleasures, only cater- ing to the senses and earning money; or perhaps just working without thinking or acting creatively. Analyse yourself and see if you have been creative from your childhood. Some children, for example, think readily along mechanical lines, and want to open up and take apart things so that they can put them together again. Others show the greatest pleasure in drawing, or in playing or listening to music. It is not necessary to be an expert or a prima donna in order to consider that one has shown signs of creativity in this life. Even a nonsensical song such as \"Yes, We Have No Ba- nanas\" is a product of a creative mind. Anything one creates, whether it is expertly done or not, is an expression of creative talent. A flair for writing novels or for acting or for woodcarving or for painting or for music or for working with machinery, if exhibited early in life, indicates that you were probably in the Vaisya state in your past life. Husbands and wives should not ridicule each other's or their children's creative tendencies. It is a sin against the * See caste in glossary."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"222 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST evolutionary process of God to try to suppress another's creative spirit. Ask yourself if from childhood you have always tried to perform actions in accordance with the guidance of your con- science. Were you constantly watching your actions and trying to correct yourself when you were wrong? Did you have that struggle within from childhood? That reflects the third or Kshatriya state. But if from childhood your thoughts have always been of God, you have entered the fourth or spiritual state of the Brahmin. Recognition of your belonging to one of the less advanced of these four types of mental attitude should not discourage, but encourage you. If upon self-analysis you find that you have not yet attained to the highest state, do not think yourself help- lessly unfortunate. The idea is that if you haven't changed yet, it is now time that you should. Otherwise you will carry your present state into the next life too. When death comes you want to feel that you have passed that particular \"grade\" of life, and that you are free to go on to higher grades. Therefore you should change your life now. Analyse yourself and learn what you were before. Then you can begin to remould your life more ideally. Learn to check your moods. The violent feelings you may experience in the present were all created in the past. If it were not so, why is it that some children are jealous from the very beginning, while others in the same family are calm and loving? There are children who would strike you if you were to tell them not to do a thing; others are quietly obedient. Another child may steal. Why? These traits are simply outcroppings of prenatal tendencies created in former lives. I was once given a little baby to hold. I almost dropped it, for God suddenly revealed to me that that baby had been a cruel murderer in a previous life. But ordinarily, the past is a closely guarded secret. You may discover the true details only if the Lord wishes you to know them. Discern Between Inner Worth and Outer Position Once, in New York, a woman who was helping with Self- Realization Fellowship office work confided to me that she had"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"REINCARNATION: THE SOUL'S JOURNEY TO PERFECTION 223 met a marvellous man, a \"psychic,\" who had told her wonder- ful things about herself, including the revelation that in a former life she had been Mary, Queen of Scots. I did not believe she had been that queen, and I silently uttered a little prayer that God would banish her delusion. A few days later a student came to see me and, with great excitement, said, \"I have just met a famous psychic (the same one the office worker had mentioned), who told me that in a past life I was Mary, Queen of Scots.\" I asked the office worker to come into the room; and, placing the two \"queens\" face to face, I asked, \"Which one of you is the real Mary, Queen of Scots?\" The ladies, happily, realized their mistake—which was one of undiscriminating credulity and of readiness to confuse true inner worth with conspicuous outer position. The truth is, we love to be flattered. Unscrupulous persons thus may take advantage of us now and then. But who you were in a previous life and whether or not you were important in the eyes of the world is of little consequence. It is best to be born as a divine or Brahmin type, regardless of worldly position. All of you have something of that divine type in you; otherwise you would not be here this morning. Exchange of Souls Between East and West Out of millions of people, you have been drawn to this temple, because you have had something to do with the Orient and its spiritual teachings before. Now that you are an Occi- dental, outwardly, other Occidentals may laugh at you for going to what may seem to them a \"heathen\" church. Those who feel a prejudice against the East did not recently come from there; but those who feel a leaning toward the East were probably born there in a recent past life. By such indications one can distinguish Oriental and Occidental souls. Did you from early childhood enjoy the fragrance of incense, and stories and pictures of the East? Such inclinations would show that you had been quite recently in contact with the Orient. Many souls from the East have reincarnated now in Amer- ica. Desiring material perfection, they have been born here to enjoy the fulfillment of that desire and to help encourage American spiritual ideals. Similarly, many souls that formerly"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"224 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST were born in America have since reincarnated in India in order to benefit from her spiritual riches and to help India in the development of the material side of her civilization. I hope that many of you may go there to help India, and that many in In- dia will come here to serve in America. This world is God's family. He is trying to improve all nations. He has no prefer- ence for one over another. Another test of your past is your preference for certain sen- sations. Some people like heat all the time. They have become accustomed, in other lives, to warm climates. Others like cold better, which shows that they had been born in cold climates before. If you have always had a special feeling for the moun- tains, or the sea, you may be certain you brought that attach- ment from another life. There are people who become lonely if they are out of the city, and cannot stand quiet places. That attitude too was cultivated in the past. Those who have a driving ambition throughout life were important men before. To have that tendency and not develop it is to suppress oneself. In the proper environment such a per- son could become a great man. There are others who remain unsuccessful, no matter what they do to get ahead. This indi- cates they have carried a failure tendency from the past. But they should not give up the battle to overcome it. Such persons must conquer wrong tendencies now or they will manifest those faults in the next incarnation. George Eastman once told me that in the early years of his Kodak company he offered stock for twenty-five cents a share; still it wouldn't sell. The family of the girl he wished to marry objected to the match. The adverse circumstances were such that it seemed he would never become a success; yet, after a while, everything opened up for him. Why? Because he had been creative and ambitious before, and he kept on cultivating those tendencies in this life. From childhood I wished for large buildings and many peo- ple about me, and for shady trees and water wherever I might go. And these are what I attract. I also knew from childhood that I would have such things; that when I wished and worked for it, these places would come easily to me. When I talked about it, people sometimes laughed sceptically. Nevertheless,"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"REINCARNATION: THE SOUL'S JOURNEY TO PERFECTION 225 such environments have materialized. At our Ranchi school we have a big pond; our Dakshineswar headquarters faces the Ganges River; our Encinitas hermitage overlooks the Pacific Ocean.* So, through analysis of your present strong tendencies you can pretty accurately surmise that kind of life you led before. Past Associations Influence Present Affinities You may find that you have a strong affinity to certain for- eign languages and that you are able to learn them quickly. Madame Galli-Curci, for example, amazed me by the ease with which she learned many phrases in Bengali. A love of certain languages is the result of past-life associations. You are attracted to German or French or Chinese or Bengali because you have spoken them before. Recently I met a young American girl who told me, \"I have never studied any Oriental language, but lots of times I hear strange words in my mind. I can say them, but I don't know what they mean.\" She forthwith said about nine words in Bengali. She had never in this life studied the language, nor had she known anyone who spoke Bengali. Yet she knew these words and pronounced them correctly. In travelling, you begin to like certain scenes more than others. If some place stands out above all the rest in its attrac- tion for you, you have probably been in that vicinity before. So by these various clues you may discover certain general ideas about your past lives. From this point on, meditation can bring about a deeper knowledge of what you were before. Occasionally it happens that you go for the first time to a certain place where you seem to recognize certain scenes; but * The school in Ranchi, Jharkhand, was founded in 1918 on the estate prop* erty of the generous-hearted Maharaja of Kasimbazar.

With me, recognition has always been instant, especially of those who had been disciples before. * The following authentic case of remembrance of a past-life experience became world famous. A little girl, born in a small village in India, began inexplicably to pine away for a village in another part of India. Her condition became so serious that a doctor advised that she be taken to the distant village. This was done, and to the amazement of her companions, from the moment she entered the outskitrs of the village she began to describe in detail everything in it. She knew people by their names (although she had never before been to this village), and went directly to a certain home where she called a man by name, saying that he had been her brother in her previous life. Nor did she stop there. She explained that in her past incarna- tion she had hidden some gold pieces in a brick wall of the same house, but that she had died without ever having told anyone about it. The little girl went to the place in the wall, and lo! the gold pieces were there still. She described her clothes and how they had been packed away, and they were found to be exactly as she had said. In the face of such evi- dence, we are not justified in doubting the genuineness and sig- nificance of her experience. There is another case of a saint in India who went to a cer- tain temple on a riverbank and said: \"My temple was near here. It is now in the river.\" Divers went down, and found under the water a very old temple. This man had been, in a previous life, the saint to whom the now submerged temple had been dedi- cated. A Pure Heart—A Clear Insight If you keep above the consciousness of sex, and make your heart pure, so that when you look at others you will not be conscious of whether they are men or women, you will be able always to recognize at once those souls you have known be- fore.

Suppose you see a six-month-old baby, and then do not see it again until many years have gone by and the baby has become a man. You probably do not recognize that baby in the man. Yet certain fea- tures are the same, you would disover, if you had known that baby long enough to fix those features firmly in your mind. So, certain features of our past life remain with us. The eyes espe- cially will be like they were before. Eyes hardly change because they are the windows of the soul. Those whose eyes reflect anger or fear or wickedness should try to change, to remove unlovely qualities that hide and hinder the expression of the beauty of the soul. Owing to the change of environment and company, your mind and body change somewhat. But the eyes change little. You are reborn with the same expression in them. You can also tell by your inclinations if you were a man or a woman in your past existence. Many women are mannish, and many men want to be like women. Both man and woman are equal in importance. Reason and feeling are present in both men and women. But in man reason predominates, and in woman feeling predominates. It is easier to influence a man by appealing to his reason than to his feeling; a woman responds more readily to an appeal to her emotions. By God-communion you bring about the harmony or bal- ance of these two qualities within yourself. I never acknowledge myself to be either man or woman. I feel for others with the love of a mother, but no one can dissuade me by an appeal to my emotions if my reason, or fatherly nature, does not concur. To achieve a divine balance of reason and feeling should be the purpose of both man and woman. Man usually has to cultivate more feeling, and woman has to cultivate more logic. We Must Perfect Love in at Least One Relationship There is a deep reason why God does not usually allow us to recall our previous lives. It is because we would be very clannish with those we knew before, instead of expanding our love to encompass others. God wants us to give friendship and love to all, but we must perfect it in at least one relationship."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"228 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST When you meet old friends again, you can perfect your love in relationships with them.

First Self-Realization Fellowship Temple at Encinitas, California, November 26, 1939 Many persons predict a second coming of Christ. Others think that the real Christ has yet to come a first time. But Jesus did come on earth, and he went away. These are facts. Had his life been only a myth, as some say, his influence would not have survived for so many centuries. Even though he was crucified, his mission was taken up by people all over the world, because he lived for God. \"Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him.\"* Because of this passage in the Bible, many sincere per- sons believe that Christ is literally going to descend out of the clouds to us. The real explanation is metaphysical. When you close your eyes you behold darkness, but behind that darkness is the inner light. The contrast epitomizes the difference be- tween this world and the kingdom of God. When I close my eyes and concentrate my will, I see Christ in that light;! and every true devotee who is able to penetrate the spiritual eye shall see him. In that inner light I behold Jesus just as clearly as I see another person in this world. Everything perceived in that light is much finer.

Such experiences are not given to those who med- itate just for a few minutes and then concentrate on something else.

True visions are emanations of reality. Divine Justice and the Law of Reincarnation You may or may not believe in the law of reincarnation; but if this life is the beginning and the end of human existence, it is impossible to reconcile the inequalities of life with a divine justice. Why is one man born in a rich family, whereas another child arrives in a poverty-stricken home, only to die of starvation? Why is one person healthy enough to live 100 years, and someone else sick all the time? Why are Eskimos born in the cold north and other peoples in moderate climates, where the struggle to survive is easier? Why are some babies born blind, or dead? Why? Why? Why? If you were God, would you do such unjust things? What is the use of reading and living according to the scriptures, if life is predestined by a whimsical God who deliberately creates beings with bodies or brains that are imperfect? According to the law of cause and effect, every action creates a commensurate reaction. Therefore whatever is hap- pening to us now must be a result of something we have done previously. If there is nothing in this life to account for present circumstances, the inescapable conclusion is that the cause was set in motion at some prior time; that is, in some past hu- man existence. Your strongest moods and character tendencies did not begin with this birth; they were established in your consciousness long before. Thus we may understand how some persons show from early childhood certain definite talents, or weaknesses, and so on. We may understand, too, how the perfect life of Jesus on earth was the result of several previous incarnations in which he had developed self-mastery. His miraculous life as Christ was the result of many past lives of spiritual schooling. He became an avatar,* a divine incarnation, because in previous lives as an ordinary human being he fought the temptations of the flesh and conquered. His example gives the rest of mankind definite hope. Otherwise, what chance have we? If God had sent angels to teach us I would say, \"Lord, why didn't You * See glossary."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"WILL JESUS REINCARNATE AGAINf 231 create me as an angel? How can I emulate beings who were created perfect and who have had no experience with the tests and temptations that You have given me?\" We need for our ideal a being who is essentially like us. Jesus had temptations to face. \"Get thee behind me, Satan/' he said. And he conquered. Had he never known temptation, his saying, \"Get thee behind me, Satan,\" would have been playacting, and how could that inspire us? Although he had already conquered the flesh in other lives, he had to feel its weaknesses again in his incarnation as Jesus, to show human- ity by his mastery how high he had grown spiritually, and to give heart to all men by his example. Jesus Was Eliseus in His Former Life Jesus attained most of his perfection in his former incar- nation as Eliseus (Elisha). I know for certain that he was Eliseus in a past life, and that Jesus' guru, John the Baptist, was Elijah (Elias), in his former life.* Eliseus' later incarnation as Jesus was foretold several hundred years before the event, because he was destined to fulfill a divine plan of God's. That prophecy is told in the Book of Isaiah (7:14), eight centuries before Christ: \"Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.\" St. Matthew, recording the event of Christ's birth, stated: \"Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being inter- preted is, God with us.\"t Jesus had learned all of life's lessons in this school of many incarnations, and had demonstrated his complete victory over material consciousness. That is why the Heavenly Father said of him, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, \"t Jesus was sent on earth as an example, that God's other children might know one who had overcome the delusions of this world. Great as he was, Jesus nonetheless said humbly: \"I * Referring to John the Baptist, Jesus said, \"And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come\" [Matthew 11:14). t Matthew 1:22-23. * Matthew 3:17."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"232 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me.\"* His entire love was for God. His whole consciousness was absorbed in the Father. We are all children of God. Many incarnations ago He created us as He created Jesus. In the Gospel of St. John we find Jesus himself declaring: \"Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?\"+ Jesus was made in the image of God, as are we ; and he conquered delusion, showing us how to do likewise. If you conquer delusion in this life you will go back to God and reincarnate no more. \"Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out.\"* But will Jesus come again? Metaphysically, he is already omnipresent. He smiles at you through every flower. He feels his cosmic body in every speck of space. Every movement of the wind breathes the breath of Jesus. Through his oneness with the divine Christ Consciousness [Kutastha Chaitanya] he is incarnate in all that lives. If you have eyes to behold, you can see him enthroned throughout creation. One who is liberated, as Jesus is, becomes one with Spirit. Yet he retains his individuality; for once God has created a human being, He keeps in His cosmic consciousness a perma- nent record of that creation. Every thought and action of every creature is recorded in the consciousness of God. Jesus referred to this when he said, \"Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?\"§ Christ Comes in Vision and in the Flesh to His Devotees Jesus as an individual personality can reincarnate in two ways: in vision and in the flesh. If you have great devotion you can see him inwardly exactly as he appeared when he lived on earth. A number of saints have thus beheld him and have relived with him various events of his life. Jesus can reincarnate again at any time, in the physical body or in the inner light, according to your devotion and power of concentration. Reincarnation is forced upon most of humanity, but because Jesus has freed himself he can come or not, as he wishes.

Years ago, when I was living and teaching in Boston, I once became so busy that I forgot God for three days. The thought of continuing like that was intolerable; I was preparing to pack up everything and leave America. But just then a student of this path came by and asked to meditate with me. As we sat there in meditation I began to pray: \"Lord, I love Your work here in America, but I love You more than the work, and if I am going to forget You in this country I will leave.\" Inwardly I heard the voice of God: \"What do you want?\" Impulsively I said, \"I would like to see Krishna and Christ with all their disciples.\" Instantly I beheld them, on a sea of gold, just as clearly as I am seeing you,- and I worshipped them. But in a little while my mind began to doubt. \"This is not real,\" I thought. So I prayed again: \"Lord, if the vision is true, let the other devotee in this room also see it.\" My friend sud- denly cried out, \"Oh! Krishna and Christ, on a sea of gold!\" Then a new doubt arose: was it only thought transference? But even as this idea crossed my mind, the voice of God said: \"When I leave, the room will become filled with the fragrance of the lotus, and whoever comes shall notice it.\" Each person who later visited me in that room unfailingly asked, \"What is this strange fragrance of flowers that I smell?\" For most of his followers Christ exists as an ideal person- age they have read about in the Bible. But to me he is much more than that. He is real. Once, eight years ago, he came alone and meditated with me all night long. During that time I saw a vision of the Hermitage.* Many other times I have seen him in visions, and talked with him. And that same Christ you too can see. You must be prepared to give up everything for commu- nion with God. He will test you.

One saint said, \"I don't care when He comes—I know He will come.\" That is the attitude one must have. When you make up your mind to work to attain the Christ consciousness that Jesus had, God will help you to fulfill that desire. But first you must attain self-mastery, even as Jesus did. God does not bestow great spiritual powers on devotees until they show Him they have conquered their human weaknesses. Otherwise they might hurt other persons, even destroy whole nations, by misuse of the divine might. Jesus had sovereign power,- he could easily have saved him- self from crucifixion, but during the agony in the Garden he only said, \"Father, not my will, but thine, be done,\"* and on the Cross, \"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\"+ In those final tests he showed he had wholly conquered all ego-impulses. When you have unlimited power, as Jesus did, and when everyone spurns you and still you do not retaliate, you are a conqueror indeed. All Great Avatars Will Come Again Every saint who has come on earth has contributed toward the fulfillment of God's desire for the spiritual upliftment of all His human children. The great ones come with two purposes: to inspire and enlighten a certain number or a large mass of people,- and to train real disciples, those who pattern their lives after the master's. The latter are the members of the saint's true \"family,\" constituting an inner group in whom he plants his spiritual life. Jesus had twelve such disciples—and others too—but one of the twelve betrayed his love and trust. The most difficult task for every God-ordained spiritual teacher is to produce others like himself, but Jesus made genuinely Christlike disciples. Every spiritually enlightened teacher tries to enable many devotees to commune with God. Yet each great master never- theless leaves some \"unfinished symphony.\" Because it re- mains unfinished, that teacher has to come back again; but the time depends on God's will. What I am telling you is not in any book, nor is it anyone else's idea; but it is true. * Luke 22:42. t Luke 23:34."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"WILL JESUS REINCARNATE AGAINf 235 Jesus often healed others, but they didn't always appreci- ate it. And he tired of healing their physical ills; he wanted men to know God. He sought only their highest good, but they crucified him ; and so not all of his desire for their spiritual development was fulfilled. That is why he has to come back again. Great ones such as he return to earth to take more souls to God. Even though they have attained their own perfection, their desire for others' happiness and perfection has not been fulfilled. They want to bring their lost brothers back to God. When you pray to Jesus he feels your prayer. Free souls such as Jesus are aware of the calls of their devotees. You may not know they are receiving the vibrations of your feelings, but they are. And when your loving demand is very strong, the great ones come to you. Their desire is to redeem the whole earth, because every saint of God-realization knows there is no death for him. He is living in that Eternal Joy. Yet such saints are aware of the world's grief. They say to the Heavenly Father, \"People are killing one another and suffering in many other ways. Why must this be?\" And God says: \"I will send you back sometime to help them.\" The God-ordained saviours of mankind have to return to earth again, but when they will come, no one can say. Thus many people believe in Christ's second coming; but when it may happen depends on the will of God. The great ones come only with the permission of the Heavenly Father.

Similarly, this life may be realized as a dream only when we awake in Cosmic Consciousness. During waking consciousness, the thought of a beautiful landscape does not carry with it an immediate power of materialization. But in sleep we have a heightened creative power of visualization and manifestation,- our thoughts swiftly erect the various structures of a dream. The projection of dream images requires both thought and energy, just as the projection of moving pictures requires both film and the electrical energy of light. In sleep, life energy is released from various bodily de- mands and retires to the brain cells, in which are stored the thought films of all past experiences. The enlivening action of the energy on the stored-up thought films in the subconscious mind results in the projection of the mental motion pictures we call dreams. Dreams are actually lessons in the working of Cosmic Consciousness. They come to man for a reason,- their purpose is to awaken in him a realization of the dream nature of the universe and of the method of its operation. The sages of India since ancient times have spoken of the universe as a materialization of the thought of God. It is easy to say, of course, that this universe is a dream. But the verisimilitude of \"life\" in our everyday experiences makes it nearly impossible for us to believe that the world is nothing more than a cosmic dream. It is necessary that we first develop mind power in order to be able to realize that the universe is actually made out of the thought of God and that, like a dream, it is structurally evanescent. 237"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"238 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST We know that thoughts are invisible. But in dreamland they may be made visible by the force of energy. So originally this whole universe—in the form of God's thoughts—was invisible, hidden within the cosmic stream of consciousness. Only when those thoughts were crystallized by God's cosmic intelligent vibration, or energy, did they become visible to us as the material universe. So, although it is difficult to realize that this cosmic dream universe is merely a dream, we should endeavour to think along this line. Many practical benefits will come to us from such a true understanding of the physical world. To illustrate, let us say that a sleeping man dreams he is a great and powerful warrior; that he goes to war, is shot, and lies dying, fust as he is feeling very sad, he suddenly wakes up. He laughs at his dream fears as he realizes he is not really a warrior, nor is he dying. In \"real\" life one may have the same kind of experience. A soldier who goes to war and is mortally wounded suddenly wakes up in the astral world and realizes that the war experi- ence was all a bad dream—that he has neither broken bones nor a physical body. Nevertheless, he is still conscious of life and of his individuality. In order to realize that all the happenings of this world are dream experiences, we should learn how to visualize our thoughts—how to recharge them with the energy of concen- tration until they become visible manifestations. Proper vi- sualization by the exercise of concentration and will power enables us to materialize thoughts, not only as dreams or visions in the mental realm, but also as experiences in the material realm. Matter Originates in Thought Starting with the power of his creative imagination, man has built wonderful scientific devices and a marvellous mater- ial civilization. Inventions are the result of the materialization of human thought. Many people try to achieve something in the realm of thought, but they give up when difficulties arise. Only those persons who have visualized their thought very strongly have been able to manifest them in outward form."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"THE DREAM NATURE OF THE WORLD 239 Everything on earth had its birth in the factory of the mind— either in God's mind or in man's mind. Actually, man cannot think an \"original\" thought. He can only borrow God's thoughts and become an instrument to materialize them. Experiment with your thoughts. Try out your strongest thoughts on your body. See if you cannot overcome undesirable habits and persistent ailments. When you are successful you may apply your thought to make changes in the world around you. The relationship between thought and matter is very subtle. Suppose you see a wooden pillar, and try, by the power of thought, to remove the pillar. You cannot do that. In spite of what you think, the pillar is still there. It is a materialization of someone's previous thought. It will not go away merely by your thinking it is not there. Only when you realize it as a materialization of thought may you dematerialize it to your consciousness. As you learn by experimenting with overcoming habits, pain, and so on, you will begin to understand that the entire design of the body and all its processes are controlled by thought. One may gather great wisdom by cultivating the con- sciousness that this world and everything in it is only a dream. First of all, do not take your earth experiences too seriously. The root-cause of sorrow is in viewing the passing show with emotional involvement. If you continually think to yourself, \"I haven't lived as I ought to have lived,\" you only make yourself miserable. Rather, do your best to be better; and no matter what difficulties come, ever affirm, \"It is all a dream. It will soon pass.\" Then no trouble can be a great trial to you. No happenings of this earth can in any way torture you. The consciousness of pain also has to be overcome if you are to know that the world is only a dream. When I was a child I was hurt frequently when playing football, and when- ever I dreamed of playing football I always dreamed that I was hurt. That fear-thought of being hurt had become rooted in my subconscious mind, so that I suffered dream injuries even in sleep! So one should not take his troubles too seriously, lest they darken the subconscious mind.

Then we can understand why there is so much difference in everything in the world: some people are poor, some are rich; some are healthy and some are sick. Although it may seem to be a terrible and cruel game, the justification of the complications of life is that all of it is only a dream. Take it as such. Think of the many aspirations and hopes you entertained as a child and as a youth. They have gradually left you, but do not be discouraged; always believe that, whatever is coming, it will simply be another scene in the dream movie of God that is being shown in the playhouse of our minds. We have to behold dream tragedies and dream comedies that we may be variously entertained. If you can go to a movie and see a picture of war and suffering, and afterward say, \"What a wonderful picture!\" so may you take this life as a cosmic picture-show. Be prepared for every kind of experience that may come to you, realizing that all are but dreams. Each human life constitutes a drama; and the events of each day represent a drama. You are living a fresh one each of the year's 365 days. The thought that you are merely a player in these dramas is very comforting. Realize that the acting out of whatever part you are called upon to play does not affect your real being. At the end of every earthly incarnation you are the same—the immortal soul—untouched by sickness, sor- row, or death. \"The man who is calm and even-minded during pain and pleasure, the one whom these cannot ruffle, he alone is fit to attain everlastingness.\"* Pride Is the Greatest Barrier to Wisdom The experiences of my life have intensified my conviction that human pride is the greatest barrier to wisdom. Egotistical pride must go. It is a blind that prevents our seeing God as the sole Doer, the Director of the Cosmic Drama. You are playing different parts in this cosmic movie-house, and you may not foresee what part will be assigned to you tomorrow. You should be prepared for anything. Such is the law of life. Why sorrow, then, over life's experiences? If you take every happening * Bhagavad Gita 11:15."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"THE DREAM NATURE OF THE WORLD 241 as you would if you were seeing someone else playing it in a motion picture, you will not grieve. Play your 365 roles each year with an inward smile and with the remembrance that you are only dreaming. Then you will never again be hurt by life. You have played many roles through many incarnations. But they were all given to entertain you—not to frighten you. Your immortal soul cannot be touched. In the motion picture of life you may cry, you may laugh, you may play many parts; but inwardly you should ever say, \"I am Spirit.\" Great conso- lation comes from realization of that wisdom. You cannot expect to wake up from the delusion that earth life is real merely by running away into the forest. You have to play out to the end the part that is given you. Each human being is contributing to the enactment of the motion picture of the cosmos. If you want to be happy you should play out your part with dignity, assurance, and happiness. When you are awake in God He will show you that you are unchanged, even though you have played countless parts in His earth drama. Dissociate Yourself from Your Experiences Think of it! Of the fifteen hundred million people who have died every hundred years, each one has played a definite part in this cosmic motion picture. In fact, each human being has played in addition a separate \"home movie,\" his own pri- vate motion picture. If you were to multiply all the motion- picture lives portrayed by those millions of beings, you wouldn't be able to count them. But this show has a purpose: that you learn how to play the various parts of the life movie without identifying your Self with your role. It is important to avoid identification with pain or anger or any kind of mental or phys- ical suffering that comes. The best way to dissociate yourself from your difficulty is to be mentally detached, as if you were merely a spectator, while at the same time seeking a remedy. Don't expect to attain unalloyed peace and happiness from earthly life. This should be your new attitude: no matter what your experiences are, enjoy them in an objective way, as you would a movie. You have to find true peace and happiness within yourself. Your outer experiences should be only fun. You can convert all of them into miserable ones if you allow your"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"242 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST mind to do so. You may have good health and not appreciate it at all. But if you become unwell, then you will appreciate what it is to have health. Show gratitude to God for what He bestows on you, without waiting for reverses to make you grateful. You are a child immortal. You have come on earth to en- tertain and to be entertained. This is why life should be a combination of both meditation and activity. If you lose your inner balance, that is just the time when you are vulnerable to worldly suffering. Don't disgrace the name of God, the One in whose image you are made. Awaken the innate fortitude of the mind by affirming, \"No matter what experiences come, they cannot touch me. I am always happy.\" When I look back and compare, I find that life was much simpler at the time we started our first hermitage (in a little mud hut in India that we had rented for one rupee) than it is now, when we have the responsibility of maintaining this large institution. Yet I preserve my mental balance no matter what trials come. Learn to laugh at difficulties by remembering that you are immortal: \"Killed many times, I yet live,- born many times, I am yet changeless.\" Whether you are suffering in this life, or smiling with opulence and power, your consciousness should remain unchanged. If you can accomplish evenminded- ness, nothing can ever hurt you. The lives of all great masters show that they have achieved this blessed state. In order to be able to say with realization that all things are in the mind, you must first develop an inner consciousness of divine peace that remains unruffled by the experiences of this earth. Accept them as you would dreams; and the time will come when you will find that, just by the power of your strong thought, whatever you think will materialize. This is very difficult to do, but it can be done. A scientist must busy himself with going through several experiments in order to arrive at one fact. But the spiritually developed man is able to perceive the fact without going through a physical process. If you first become one with God, then whatever you think can be materialized. This truth was demonstrated many times by Jesus. He had realized his unity with God."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"THE DREAM NATURE OF THE WORLD 243 Concentrate First on God One's first concentration should be on union with God. Every day as you go through various earthly situations, men- tally practise your oneness with God. If a pain comes along to disturb that consciousness you should reason, \"Well, if I were asleep I wouldn't feel this pain,- why should I be aware of it now? All experiences are fleeting dreams.\" Practise overcoming all trials in this manner. The first state of concentration is to be able to see in your mind's eye anything that you wish. For example, I can keep looking at this room and concentrating upon it until, when I close my eyes, I can still see the room exactly as it is. This is the first step in deep concentration, but most people haven't the patience to practise it. I had the patience. As you continue to practise visualization you will find that your thoughts become materialized. The cosmic law will so arrange it that whatsoever you are thinking of will be produced in actuality, if you command it to be so. Suppose I am thinking of an apple, and the apple appears in my hand. That would be a demonstration of the highest power of concentration. The great ones can materialize anything right before your eyes, as did Babaji when he materialized a palace at the time of Lahiri Mahasaya's initiation in the Himalayas.* That was an expression of the power of concentration in its highest form. Nothing worthwhile may be gained without effort and without concentration. * See Autobiography of a Yogi, chapter 34. Nikola Tesla, renowned electrical scientist and inventor, understood the possibility of direct materialization. He wrote: \"Long ago he (man) recognized that all perceptible matter comes from a primary substance, or a tenuity beyond conception, filling all space, the Akasa or luminiferous ether, which is acted upon by the life-giving Prana, or creative force, calling into existence, in never-ending cycles, all things and phenomena. \"Can man control this grandest, most awe-inspiring of all processes in nature? Can he harness her inexhaustible energies to perform all their func- tions at his bidding, more still cause them to operate simply by the force of his will? \"If he could do this, he would have powers almost unlimited and super- natural.

Yesterday I was sitting in my room, looking back over my life, and I realized that everything in the outer world that had promised great happiness had deceived me; but one thing has never deceived me—my inner peace. Indescribable billows of happiness surge over my soul. As I passed through various ex- periences over the years, that unchanging inner peace has been proof to me of the existence of God. I was just thinking this when suddenly I saw a great Light. Everything else vanished. There was feeling—that was all. My hand was not a hand, but a feeling. When I touched my hands to- gether there was no flesh there, only feeling. Then I understood that I had become thoughts,- everything around me, the light and the room and the weight of the body—all were nothing but thoughts. It was a delightful experience. Gone were the sorrow and sadness I had felt for things past, and in their place a great sense of freedom. That consciousness of God-peace is never-ending. It is the only real state of happiness. Everything else will fail you. Nothing else can make you happy because only the joy of His presence is real.

May all sons and daughters who have been nur- tured by a mother's love be themselves filled with a mother's affection, which is unconditional love, and express it toward others. Thus shall they solace the world with peace and bring heaven on earth. The mother's love is not given to us to spoil us with indulgence, but to soften our hearts, that we may in turn soften others with kindness, and free struggling souls from the hard knots of bondage to the world. Those who are helplessly shack- led by sin and dire difficulties need our tenderness and love. My sincere and complete devotion to my earthly mother was the first cause of my love for the Divine Mother. Thus it was my great love for my mother that led to my illumination. In India we like to speak of God as Mother Divine, because a true mother is more tender and forgiving than a father. The mother is an expression of the unconditional love of God. Mothers were created by God to show us that He loves us with or without cause. Every woman is to me a representative of the Mother. I see the Cosmic Mother in all.

Certain sceptical followers of a great saint wanted to test him, and sent to him some beautiful prostitutes. He quickly jumped up and cried: \"Mother Divine, in these forms You have come to me. I bow to you all.\" The women knelt before him and were ashamed. From that moment they were spiritually changed. Every man who looks upon woman as an incarnation of the Immortal Mother will find salvation. A husband should see in his wife the pure beauty of the Mother Divine. Looking upon the wife as the Mother, he will find in her a holy essence not discerned before. Mothers would not be able to love their children if God hadn't implanted that love in them. Yet credit belongs to the instrument also, because the flood of divine love passes through the human mother. All the great masters have shown honour to their mothers. Swami Shankara, * after the death of his mother, disregarded the monastic injunctions against per- forming ceremonial family rites and cremated her body in a divine flame that he caused to emanate form his hand. A home is made gracious by the presence of the Divine Mother in the form of the human mother. Isn't that a thought to remember? Do not forget it. Love for the Mother must be constantly cultivated in your heart, so that whenever you see a woman, you behold her as your mother. If you look upon woman without lust of the eyes, you will be able to draw from her store of spiritual treasures. Why was the mother given such love? That she might love her child unconditionally. Loving one's own child is only a practice of the love divine. The mother thinks it is her own child, but it is the child of God. The child will be taken away as soon as the Divine Spirit calls. So every mother should extend that love she feels for her child unto all the children of the earth. * Lord Shankara's Prayer to the Divine Mother for Forgiveness of Sins bears the refrain: \"Though bad sons are many, never has there been a bad mother.\""},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"248 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST A mother is expected to look after her son, and a son is told to honour his mother; but I say that a son should not only love his mother but should look on all women as expressions of the Divine Mother.

She should realize that it is not her own love she gives, but the love of the Mother Divine in her. She should be proud of her children, but should not limit herself by bestowing love only on her own sons and daughters. A mother should give divine unconditional love to all. This is my message for you today. Mothers, be proud that the Divine Mother took your form to give love tangibly to the world, not only to your children but unto all children of the earth. Then you will be really blessed; and instead of thinking that you have one child, or five chil- dren, you will realize, \"I have many children all over the earth.\" In that awareness you are one with the Divine Mother. The mother who looks upon all God's children as her own is no longer a mortal mother. She becomes the Mother Immor- tal. This is what all women saints are. One day they realize: \"The great love that I feel for my child I now feel for all. Now I know that I am not this body, but an expression of the Cosmic Mother.\" Think what you can do!

He must keep himself pure, for it is through him and through all other fathers that the Heavenly Father looks after the children of earth. A human father's body and mind ought to be a temple of the Divine Father. As an instrument of the Divine Being, the father plays his greatest creative role when he implants in his children thoughts that will lead to God-realization. To produce offspring is not a unique accomplishment; the animals do that. But to produce children on the plane of divine love and in a spiritual consciousness is an important achieve- ment. Even animals may be bred to order; yet many human children are born out of passion and accident, emotion and evil. How can they be pure and perfect? The perpetrators of thefts and other crimes are usually children who were born out of passion, although sometimes there is a good soul here and there. Example Is the Best Teacher Character building should be taught in schools and colleges, but fathers should realize that example is more important than schooling.

How intricate is the universal mechanism! Reflect on the way we are made, and in what orderly fashion the whole machinery of creation runs according to cosmic law. We all see the flowers and enjoy their beauty, but who knows what is causing the flowers? Anything one uses or sees every day—be it a handkerchief, a musical instrument, a house, or a tree—he should question and ponder by what means, of what substance, it is made. Cars are taken for granted; but if you were to visit the factories in which they are produced, you would realize how complicated automobiles are. Consider too what went into making the paper for the daily news, and the intricate machinery that imprints it—no human hand could operate so fast. And if the creation of everyday man-made objects can be so complex, how vastly more complicated the creation of plants, animals, and human beings! It takes ten years' study of medical science to understand the composition, functions, and requirements of the seemingly simple human body. Even a ca- sual analysis reveals much to wonder at—though I sometimes think God could have made a few improvements!

When the skin of the plant is removed, one can see the intricate network of tubes that channel this sap. That which carries on this process of sustenance and growth is the mystery called life. When I am in the ecstasy of God-consciousness, I behold this life in even a blade of grass. Little did I dream that I would be able to see such hidden marvels of creation! To concentrate on these mar- vels is to stand in awe of what the Lord has done. With calculated precision God has ordained the structural form of each living thing, and the requirements for maintaining that form in good working order. If there is any deficiency in those requirements—food, for example—plants, animals, and human beings suffer. The average person draws from his food all the various chemical elements his body needs; but there are many dietary transgressors whose meals do not contain all the required elements, or the correct balance of them. Improper nourishment is one of the main causes of all sickness in man. The effects of dietary deficiency can be seen almost immedi- ately in a plant when some necessary chemical is omitted from its food. There are vital exchanges between man and all other liv- ing things. For aeons India has had the custom of cremation and scattering the ashes of the dead. In this and other ways man feeds Mother Earth, and her plants in turn feed man. The reciprocity between man and trees is well known.

However, through another process called respiration, trees continuously release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, particularly at night when the counteracting influence of carbon-absorbing, oxygen-producing photosynthesis is not present. As night air is usually still, the heavy carbon dioxide gas settles near the ground. In part for this reason, the custom of sleeping on beds—that is, above ground level—came about. The Limitations of the Physical Senses Science has taught us a great deal about the intricate mech- anisms of our universe and about the substance of which we are all made, but there is still vast knowledge to be uncovered. We could perceive more and appreciate more if we developed the underlying powers of our sensory organs. Things we should see with our eyes we do not see, things we should hear with our ears we do not hear, because our senses are too habituated, too attached, to experiences of the limited gross physical world. Freedom from that attachment is not negation of sensory enjoyment; it permits a broadening of the God-given sensory powers to their fullest spiritual potential. On the material plane man has discovered various ways to increase his seeing power. The unaided physical eye receives only limited impressions of colour. However, under ultraviolet light, drab-looking pieces of rock in which certain minerals are present will show forth luminescent colours.

Even if St. Francis were here at this moment in his astral form, you would not be able to see and hear and touch him. Yet it is possible to advance beyond ordinary sensory limitations, for I have seen him. Often man does not cognize even things that his senses are able to perceive.

An engineer, he was seeing the lake in his own way. So we view things according to our different mentalities and moods. Every soul is encased in a composite vibration of sensa- tions, thoughts, feelings—all the factors that make up a per- son's being, or consciousness. Each one has a different com- position, a different vibration. All the things you have done since childhood are stored in tabloid form as tendencies in your brain. They make you what you are. Because we do not see this tabloid pattern, we wonder why people behave as they do. Some become suddenly elated, or inexplicably angry or moody,- even they don't know why. Some are always busy crit- icizing or gossiping about others, when there is plenty of \"house-cleaning\" to do in their own \"home\"!

How complex is man! each one in himself a full-length novel. The Infinite Potential of Thought Man is supposed to get something out of this life besides eating, sleeping, and working. The thinkers begin to wonder about life. They observe and question why things happen, or do not happen, in a certain way. We have a first and then a second set of teeth; why not a third? What causes this regulation? Be- cause of man's unquestioning acceptance of many delusive thoughts of physical limitation, he allows them to control his present sphere of existence. Thinkers do not accept the in- evitable,- they turn their efforts toward changing it. This is the ingredient that makes progress possible. I am thrilled when I see the great manufacturing centres, the remarkable inventions, and other exceptional human accomplishments. How much has come from the brain of man! And the brain itself is infinitely more intricate than anything it has produced. There is a story about a certain king who showed such affectionate regard for his prime minister that others in the court, noticing the monarch's obvious preference, were jealous. Realizing this, the king wanted to show them why the minister was his favourite. Some music sounded in the distance, and the king turned to one of his courtiers, saying, \"Please find out what is going on.\" After some time the man returned with the information that it was a marriage procession. \"Who is going to be married?\" inquired the king. The courtier didn't know, so another courtier was sent out. The man returned with a reply to the king's latest query, but when the sovereign asked another question he could not answer. The result was the same with courtier after courtier. Finally the king called for the prime min- ister and asked him to go and find out what was taking place. When the minister returned, the king plied him with questions, every one of which the alert and thorough prime minister was able to answer satisfactorily.

The mentally idle do not like to think, because even that seems too much work for them. Thought is fascinating. No one will ever be able to tabu- late all the tendencies and perceptions of the mind; its capac- ity is infinite. Yet the mind cannot think an original thought: there is not a single idea that God has not originated already in conceiving His past, present, and future creations. Therefore if you think deeply enough about a subject, the answer to any question about it will come. You must feel as well as think; if you do not have feeling along with your thoughts, you will not always be successful in reaching the right conclusion. Feeling is an expression of intu- ition, the repository of all knowledge. Feeling and thought, or reason, must be balanced; only then does the divine image of God within you, the soul, manifest its full nature. Hence Yoga teaches one how to balance his powers of reason and feeling. One who does not have both equally is not a fully developed person. In God-Consciousness Everything Becomes Beautiful In my younger days I used to go sight-seeing, but my in- terest was only in temples. As my consciousness changed with the practice of meditation, I began to look at the world differ- ently; everything seemed transformed and interesting to me. Now I see behind all creation the kingdom of my Father. It is enchanting beyond any dreams of this world! And sometimes I see the beauties of His kingdom showing through the gross physical creation. As you progress spiritually and draw closer to God, He reveals to you more and more wonders of creation. Even in the dead and ugly-looking stalks of a wheat field after the harvest you will see life.

In the astral world everything is motion, every- thing is living; there is nothing called \"dead.\" Even in the phys- ical world death is not cessation of life, only a change into a different form. Life is still throbbing in the \"lifeless\" object. In the bones of dead animals I have beheld rich colours and vi- brating light. You see only the gross material products coming from God's hidden factory behind creation; but if you went into the factory itself, you would behold in what marvellous manner everything in this world has been brought into manifestation. The factory behind creation is beyond imagination,- the whole universe is a single thought in the mind of God! So sim- ple, yet the galaxies are guided by mathematics inconceivable by man. Everything runs in perfect order. What tremendous in- telligence is manifested in creation! The Infinite is working in everything. All the different eddies of motion called life are controlled by that Cosmic Intelligence. Every hundred years a billion and a half persons leave this earth, and more than that many are born. What complexities of supply and demand are created thereby! Even so, the Divine Intelligence has given ample food to take care of human needs. Man alone is responsible for lack and misery on earth. By this time we could have had a millennium—everyone healthy and supplied with all of life's necessities, living in a happy and peaceful way in a wisely governed existence. But man's self- ishness, and power in the hands of the inept, destroy such a possibility. Abraham Lincoln expressed the highest ideal of government when he said it should be \"of the people, by the people, and for the people.\" He was a deeply spiritual man. Even so, he. had to suffer because of the ignorance of a few. This World Is a Temporal Place It is natural to wonder where exceptional men such as Lincoln, and departed dear ones, once so tangible! have gone after death. Such questions arise in the mind, not to discour- age you, but to awaken in you a realization of the temporal dream-nature of life. The Bhagavad Gita* tells us: \"That which is night (of slumber) to all creatures is (luminous) wake- * 11:69."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"258 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST fulness to the man of self-mastery The seeming state of wakefulness of the ordinary man is perceived by a sage to be, in reality, a state of delusive sleep.\" Thus most people are sleeping soundly throughout this dream-life; only the man of realization is awake. He is not interested in the activities that engross the ordinary man who busies himself seeking wealth and sense pleasures, and wast- ing time in shallow social engagements. Man makes a nervous wreck of himself pursuing the fleeting attractions of this world, whereas the joy and wonder of God, which is beyond descrip- tion, would give him so much more: happiness and fulfillment unending! Only a little while you live as an individualized image in God's dream-world. You are dreaming your mortal existence; it is part of God's cosmic dream. Every day you are living in this dream of physical being. Every night, in deep sleep, it is gone. And one day, when you awaken in God—who is your real Self—the dream will be gone forever. Seek the Lord Who Is Hiding Behind Creation Use your time rightly, to discover the factory of the Divine behind this world. Once for an entire day I beheld in vision the infinite wonders of creation, and I prayed: \"O Father, when I was blind I found not a door that led to Thee. Thou hast healed my eyes; now I discover doors every- where: the hearts of flowers, the voices of friendship, memo- ries of lovely experiences.

Snatch yourself away from the demands of the world, and do not go to bed at night until you have consciously communed with God. I seldom retire before four o'clock in the morning; only during the night can I find freedom from my responsibilities and be wholly with God.

Control your life, and set aside time to practise meditation for communion with Him. Then everything in this world will be a wonder to you. As scientists made their discoveries by following certain disciplines and physical laws, so will you find God without fail when you scientifically follow spiritual laws. You are helping yourself in the highest way when you study and apply these laws as set forth in the Self-Realization Fellowship [Yogoda Satsanga] teachings. Forget not the things I have told you. \"A word to the wise— those who are spiritually awakened—is sufficient.\" Yet Jesus said: \"The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few.\"* If you receive these teachings and practise them, you will realize every truth I have told you. It is not complicated; I have given only those spiritual techniques that will enable you to perceive and commune with God. No matter how unpleas- ant your circumstances in this world, when you discover God you will see Him working through you and manifesting in everything, and you will be filled with His love and joy. India's rishis remind us that health and prosperity, mate- rial accomplishments and possessions, are not lasting. Why concentrate only on goals that are perishable? What is lasting is the ever-new joyous contact of God and the attainment of Self-realization—finding out who you are, knowing that the image of God is within you. When you have that realization, you will be a satisfied person. The scriptures of India describe one who attains this state as a siddha, \"successful one.\" When I was teaching congregations of hundreds and thousands I was often called \"successful.\" That did not impress me. One may be recognized by the whole world and yet be unknown to the only One whose attention matters; and he who attracts the notice of God may be entirely unknown to the world. Which would you prefer? I wanted only the recognition of my Father. The acclaim of the world can be so intoxicating that man forgets to cultivate the all-fulfilling approbation of the Lord.

We are visible to ourselves every day as a physical body. But there are many ways in which we manifest our essential invisibility. For example, close your eyes. Your form is invisible to you; how do you know you exist? You are aware of the body's weight; you can hear, smell, taste, and touch. Nevertheless you are real to yourself only in terms of ideas. You are an invisible nucleus around which many thoughts are revolving. Now open your eyes. Are you the form that you see, or that inner being you were just now conscious of with eyes closed? The visible man is of little importance; the invisible self, or soul, is of utmost importance. During sleep you are unaware of the visible man; but you are aware of yourself, for when you wake up you know whether you slept well or poorly. Therefore your invisible self is real. Take that away and your outer visibility is meaningless. Without the invisible self the body would be as worthless as a corpse. The invisible man within is the real one. But strange to say, man doesn't try to analyse what that invisible self is. He is so interested in the form he can see, thinking constantly about his physical appearance and well-being he doesn't stop to reason out that the inner unseen self is the reality. Within the physical body, yet invisible to physical eyes, is an identical body of light, the astral encasement of the soul. If one of your fingers has been cut off, you still feel as if that finger were there. Anyone who has lost a limb knows this sensation. There is an invisible astral counterpart for all the bodily parts. Behind your physical heart is an invisible heart. Without it, your visible heart would not beat.

These parts—tissues of light and energy—constitute the astral body of the invisible man. The astral body looks exactly like the visible one, except that its form, being made of light and energy, is exceedingly subtle. If you are physically afflicted you should not say, \"My sight is gone,\" or \"I have lost a hand.\" Your invisible eyes and hands are still present. Though your physical arm may be paralysed, your invisible arm is not disabled. Never believe that the invisible organs are in any way affected by disease of the physical organs, because your negative thought would impede the flow of intelligent life energy into the physical body parts. Electrical currents are passed through a wire. Which is more important, the wire or the electricity? The wire exists merely for the passage of the electricity,- the electricity does not exist for the wire. So the body exists for the use of the invisible man, the soul, not he for the body. However, the physical body must be in a certain condition for the invisible self to remain there. What a pity that this invisible self is tied to the body! If it were not, we could go walking on the water and fly in the sky and come back into the physical body again. The astral body of the invisible self has sensory perceptions much greater than those of its physical counterpart. Man has invented machines that in some ways are better than the physical body, which has many limitations. But when your consciousness of the invisi- ble astral body is developed, you will realize that it can hear what the physical ears cannot hear, and see what the physical eyes cannot see. It can also smell, taste, and touch objects far beyond the range of the physical senses. And you can make it large or small at will, just as pictures on a movie screen can be made large or small by the man in the projection booth.

The physical body has backaches and stomachaches,- it suffers deterioration in old age; it is the nas- tiest little animal! always crying and whining for something.

Your astral form of light consists of 19 elements and your invisible causal form is made of 35 thoughts—the 19 ideas that produced the 19 electrical elements of your astral body, t and the 16 ideas that produced the 16 gross material elements of your physical body. God first created the iron and potassium and other chemical elements in idea; then He materialized them to make your physical body.

By higher spiritual advance- ment you will see that your subtle astral body can be reduced to 35 thoughts, and that your consciousness behind those 35 thoughts is the Reality; for your consciousness, or soul, is a spark of the cosmic consciousness of God. When you are viewing a motion picture you see many fig- ures on the screen, but if you look up you see only one beam of light projecting those images.

When those light-produced forms can be made true to touch and taste also, you will have produced the fivefold aspects of God's creation. The five senses by which man apprehends creation have their correspondences in the five elemental elec- tricities—ether (sound), air (touch), fire (sight), water (taste), and earth (smell)—from which creation was materialized. Someday the whole world will appear to you as a kind of motion pic- ture—forms of light that are true to the five sensory percep- tions. The terrible things that are happening in the world now are distressingly real; but when you are able to behold them as creations of light and shadow, you will understand that they are only a show, a part of God's play. * The cosmic vibration, or Aum, structures all physical creation, including the human body, though the manifestation of five tattwas (elements): earth, water, fire, air, and ether. These are intelligent vibratory forces. Without the earth element there would be no state of solid matter; without the water ele- ment, no liquid state; without the air element, no gaseous state,- without the fire element, no heat; without the ether element, no background on which to produce the cosmic motion picture show. The creative cosmic vibration enters the body of man through the medulla, and is then divided into the five elemental currents by the action of the five lower charkas, or centres: the coccygeal (earth), sacral (water), lumbar (fire), dorsal (air), and cervical (ether)."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"THE INVISIBLE MAN 265 You are only dreaming that you have a body of flesh.

In the visible man lie all the troubles and limitations of the world. Whenever we are conscious of our bodies we are tied to the body's limitations. Hence the great masters teach us to close our eyes and remind ourselves, by meditation on the invisible self, that we are not restricted to what our physical bodies can do. I used to affirm with deep conviction: \"I am not limited by my physical body. Wherever I want to go, I am instantly there.\" You may say, \"That is only a thought.\" Well, what is thought?

Sincere seekers after God who practise scientific methods of prayer and meditation need never fear such beings. God is the Spirit of all spirits. No harm from negative spirits can come to one whose thoughts are on God. The Triune Nature of Man To understand better what astral beings are, let us first un- derstand what we are. When God created us, we existed first only as consciousness. We were a creation of His mind. Is it not true that whenever you create something new, the initial step is to visualize a model of it in your mind? Then you gather * Luke 8:26-33."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"WHAT ARE GHOSTS f 271 together the materials, and finally you construct the tangible image of your idea. In the same manner, we and everything in creation are triune: mental (the idea), astral (the building ma- terial), and physical (the gross end-product). The physical body is made of 16 elements. How God com- bined the chemical materials of physical elements to express intelligence is a marvel! Nevertheless, this body is anything but perfect. We can conceive of a much better one! I would like to create a body that would be like asbestos, able to go through fire and not burn,- one in which there could be no broken bones, no unpleasant coughing. The physical body has pains and aches: its \"spark plugs\" are often \"missing\"; first one part and then another gives out, and finally the heart fails. Americans like to get a new car every year, but they have to keep this old body-model sixty or seventy years! Yet even when it is falling apart, still you want to hang onto the model you have, until finally the Lord says, \"Come on, get out of it!\" Then you spring from the worn-out physical form and see that you are encased in a luminous body, an astral body of light and energy. * You rejoice to find that you can hear, you can see, you can touch; and that your new form possesses no bones to be broken, no flesh to be hurt. Our astral body is composed of 19 elements, which are mental, emotional, and lifetronic. These are intelligence; ego; feeling; mind (sense consciousness); five instruments of knowl- edge (the subtle powers behind the physical sense organs of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch); five instruments of action (the powers for the executive abilities to procreate, excrete, talk, walk, and exercise manual skill); and five instru- ments of life force (those empowered to perform the crystal- lizing, assimilating, eliminating, metabolising, and circulatory functions of the physical body). * There are many planes or spheres in the astral world, constituting the heaven or hell of life after death. \"In my Father's house are many mansions\" {John 14:2, Bible). A person's good behaviour while on earth draws him to one of the higher spheres of light, peace, and joy. Evil deeds attract one to a lower, dark sphere where his experiences may be akin to hellish nightmares. One remains in the astral world for a karmically predetermined time, and then again takes rebirth on earth in physical form."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"272 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST These are all subtly made. We can hear, smell, taste, touch, and see in the dream world through the power that is in the five senses. And in the astral world, even without the physical organs of the ears, eyes, nose, tongue, and skin, we still have with us the power of all five sense perceptions. The astral body is weightless and travels as light travels. You can at will make the astral body very small like an atom or you can make it very large. Why not? God, the divine operator of the cosmic movie of creation, can enlarge or reduce the size of the picture on the screen. He is the projectionist, running the film from the booth of eternity. You are an individualized ex- pression of His infinite light. Your astral body is therefore much freer from the cosmic limitations that so strongly bind the physical form. But God had first to think of what materials He wanted to put into the physical and astral bodies before He actually created them. We therefore have also a causal or idea body of 35 elements: the 16 ideas that go to make up the elements of the physical body, and the 19 ideas that constitute the elements of the astral body. From the causal thought-forms the astral body's five instruments of life force make visible the astral body of light and the physical body of gross matter. The following experiment illustrates the idea. Close your eyes and visualize a horse on the left. At first your concept is fuzzy, but if I suggest a white horse, you can more easily visualize it. Now think of a black horse on the right side. You are creating mental or causal images. Switch them about so that the white horse is on the right side. If you can visualize a little more strongly, you will be able to see these thought-forms as real images. That is what you do in a dream: your mind is more concentrated then, causing your thought-forms to become visible to you. Dreams and visions are astral in essence, being composed of light and energy. Could you actually make the astral images of the black and white horses true to the physi- cal senses, you would have materialized a physical creation. So essentially we are made of 35 ideas, which make up the ideational or causal body of man. Encased within the 35 thoughts is the spirit of God, which is called the soul. Just as one flame emerges from the tiny openings of a gas burner as"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"WHAT ARE GHOSTS f 273 many individual flames, so are we all one light, flowing from God into many bodies. At Death We are Still Encased in the Astral and Causal Bodies When you die, your physical body of 16 elements disinte- grates, but the 19 elements of your astral body remain intact. Where, then, are all those souls who have left this earth? They are roaming in the ether. \"That is impossible,\" you say. So let us make a comparison. If a primitive tribesman came here and I told him that music is audible in the ether, he would laugh at me, or perhaps become frightened; but if I then brought a radio and tuned in a station where music was playing, he would no longer be able to deny the truth of my statement. I could sim- ilarly show you right now that astral beings are roaming in the ether, and you couldn't deny it. The astral world is right here, just behind the gross vibration of the physical cosmos. If you were to behold the multitude of astral beings in the ether around you at this moment, many of you would be afraid; and some of you would try to seek among them your departed loved ones. If you concentrate deeply at the spiritual eye you can view with inner vision that luminous world in which are living all the souls who have gone on to the astral plane. In human beings the heart acts as a receiving instrument and the spiritual eye as a broadcasting station. Even if you cannot see your lost beloved ones, if you can calmly concentrate your feel- ing on the heart, you can become aware of the reassuring pres- ence of those dear to you who are now in astral form, enjoying their freedom from flesh thralldom. I see many astral beings who have left the material plane, but they cannot see me. I don't make myself visible to them, but I can behold them if I so desire. * Therefore, we are not fully released at death when we depart from the physical form.

It is only when man dons a physical form that he becomes a visible being in this world. After the death of his physical body, he remains in the astral form as a \"ghost\": an intelligent, invisible being, with essentially the same mentality and characteristics he had on earth. Inhabitants of the astral realms can of course see one another in their luminous bodies. But astral beings are not or- dinarily visible to us on earth unless we know how to perceive the astral world through the spiritual eye. When souls shed the astral body and go into a mental form in the causal world* they are not nonentities, but they do become truly invisible, even as ideas are invisible. Jesus said, \"Destroy this [body] temple and in three days I will raise it up.\"+ He meant that he had to divest himself of the physical, astral, and mental bodies (by casting out all ves- tiges of attachment to a form) to become one with Spirit. It took three distinct efforts to do this. If a departed soul has unfinished desires created while on the earth plane, it continues to feel in the astral those desires and the wish to express itself through a material body. And so that soul in its astral vehicle is drawn again into a united sperm and ovum cell and is once more in a physical form. The Intelligence in Prana Creates the Physical Body The prana that permeates the physical body is intelligent life force (\"lifetrons\"). The electricity that illuminates the light bulb does not create the bulb; but the electricity or life force in the united human sperm and ovum cells guides the embryonic and subsequent development of the entire human body.

When you are reborn the next time, you bring with you that consciousness of a missing arm; and if that negative thought is strong enough it may inhibit the creative action of the intelligent life force that grows the arms of your new body. You should therefore never identify yourself with the flaws of your physical form. They do not belong to you, for you are the pure, perfect image of God—the soul. So you see, before you took on this physical form you were a ghost, and when you die you will become a ghost again. We are also ghosts when we sleep, for in sleep we are not aware of ourselves as a physical body at all. Since you are a ghost when you are asleep, and you will be one after death, why be afraid of ghosts? That is what you were and that is what you are going to be. The only difference is that when you enter the astral world at death you cannot create at will a physical body like the one you now have. Only great masters who have attained oneness with the Divine Creator can do so. Spiritually ad- vanced souls can condense the subtle vibrations of the astral vehicle into a tangible body.

One such incident happened here. Seva Devi was a very devoted student. She became extremely ill, but she never com- plained about it to anyone. She knew her time had come to leave this earth. One day when I visited her in Los Angeles she said to me, \"Please don't hold me here.\"t Later on, I was stay- ing in the Self-Realization Fellowship Hermitage in Encinitas for a time. I had been given a radio and was waking up early in the mornings to listen to broadcasts from India. One morning I suddenly felt intuitively the subtle astral vibration of Seva Devi; she drew my astral body to her through her devotion. My physical body was as dead. I was told later that Seva Devi ex- claimed, just before her passing, \"Swamiji is here!\" She was aware of being consciously ushered by me into the other world. $ Some time afterward I saw her glowing astral form; she was sitting in one of my classes, just as real as she used to ap- pear in life. If anyone had touched me at that time, he would have seen her too. However, one who is in that state of astral consciousness does not usually allow others to touch him. We have passed through death and rebirth so many times, why be afraid of death? It comes to free us. You shouldn't wish for death, but be comforted in the realization that it is our es- cape from so many troubles; it is a pension after the hard work of life. I am making death very charming! People also fear death because they have been in this cage of flesh so long that they feel timid about leaving its security. But it is foolish to be afraid.

One man in New York came to me and assured me that he could travel astrally. \"I don't think you can/' I said. \"You are only imagining you can do so.\" Still he insisted that I test him. \"All right/' I agreed, \"go downstairs astrally and tell me what is in the restaurant there.\" He was quiet for a moment; then he told me, \"There is a big piano in the right-hand corner.\" I knew he was imagining it, for I had observed that his breathing was normal and so was his pulse.* \"On the contrary,\" I said, \"I think you will find there two women sitting at a table.\" He laughed at me.

Many people tell me that somebody they know is using black magic on them. I say to them, \"You are sitting in the castle of God.

Originally, Satan was an archangel.* He was given the power to create the world according to God's plan. After he had completed his assignment, he was to go back to God, as God intended all creation to return to Him. But if this intelligent power, personified in the scriptures as Satan, were to retire into Spirit, creation would disappear. To prevent this, Satan im- planted evil (that is, material) desires in man, fulfullment of which would necessitate man's return to earth again and again, thus keeping the machinery of creation going. In this way the devil tries to see to it that man doesn't get a chance to go back to God. There is a great tug-of-war between the devil and God. One cannot dismiss the problem by thinking that Satan is a mere delusion. God would be very ignorant if he didn't know about the evil in the world. And why did Jesus say: \"Get thee behind me, Satan\" and \"Deliver us from evil\" if there is no Satan? Why is it necessary to pray to God at all if there is no devil? Evil does exist. When the Lord created man, He created the devil too. Satan, with his power of maya, exists in order to test the children of God. Unless fire melts iron, steel cannot be forged. When disease or suffering comes, you should realize that it is a test of God's maya. You must pass these tests. You must not be upset by them. Though Jesus was suffering on the cross, he surmounted that divine test. Many great souls have died of terrible diseases and suffering. Saint Teresa of Avila was afflicted with tuberculosis, and yet she said, \"I don't want the Lord to shorten my trials. I want to suffer bravely and work as long as I can.\" And when her body died she was lifted up in Christ. * \"And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven\" ( Luke 10:18, Bible). \"Know thou that all manifestations of sattwa (good), rajas (activity), and tamas (evil) emanate from Me.

The Temptation of Adam and Eve To hold man to earth life, Satan created sex ; that tempta- tion has been with man since the beginning of time. The Lord created man and woman by will power,* their bodies were ma- terializations of His divine wisdom and love.* Man and woman originally had the same power as He to create children by men- tal fiat. Adam and Eve were empowered by Him to propagate the species by immaculate or divine means. As my guru Sri Yukteswarji explained, the evil force, Satan, tempted Eve to taste the fruit (sex) in the midst of the garden (body).t God had said that the original man and woman were to enjoy all the sensations of the tree of life (astral spinal centres of con- sciousness and energy that enliven the body and the senses) except the experience of sex, which is in the midst, or centre, of the body garden. The \"serpent\" that tempted Eve is the coiled-up spinal energy that feeds and stimulates the sex nerves. When the emotion or Eve-consciousness in any human being is overpowered by the sex impulse, his reason or Adam also succumbs. * Man expresses more the aspect of reason, with feeling hidden; woman expresses more the aspect of feeling, with reason less predominant, t Genesis 3:3 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"282 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST Sexual pleasure is a delusive counterpart of God's bliss. Thus when sex is divorced from faithful love, and used only to gratify lustful instincts, it becomes a tool of the devil to keep man's consciousness locked in the senses, unable to experience God-consciousness, or realization of the Self as Spirit: ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Joy. Sex and desire for wine and money—these are the counterfeits created by Satan to displace the ecstasy of the soul. When Adam and Eve tasted of the sex sensation, they fell from Paradise,- they lost that divine consciousness by which they could feel their oneness with God in soul ecstasy, and they were forced out of the garden of Eden. Ever since, human beings have had to reproduce their kind the sexual way, like the animals. Women give birth in a troublesome and painful manner.

It is part of the drama of God that the West was meant to have material power, and the East, spiritual power, so that amity might come through an inter- change of their characteristic qualities. The spiritual freedom of the East overrides material suffering. The West needs that kind of spiritual freedom; God's Western children, being more fortunate physically and materially, need to develop spiritually and to receive the spiritual illumination of the East.

Jesus is a divine colossus standing between Orient and Occident, telling East and West to exchange their better quali- ties. Can you see him there? I see him. He urges the West to spiritualize itself and the East to industrialize itself—the East to accept the Western missionaries of science and industry, and the West to accept the Eastern missionaries of the Spirit. To the West he says: \"Love your Eastern brothers. I came from the Orient.\" To the East he pleads: \"Love your Western brothers; they have received and loved me, an Oriental.\" Isn't that a beautiful thought? It would make a magnificent picture. Christ is not the property of either East or West—an East- West bond is manifested in his life. He belongs to both, and to all the world. His universality is what makes him so wonder- ful. Jesus took the body of an Oriental so that in being accepted as guru by the Occidental he would thereby symbolically draw East and West together. Those in the West who have adopted Christ as their own should remember that he was an Oriental. Love and sympathy for Jesus should be expanded into love and sympathy for all Orientals, and for all the world. God does not prefer Orientals or Occidentals.

Jesus journeyed to India to return the visit of the three \"wise men from the east\" who came to pay homage to him at his birth.$ They were guided to the Christ Child by the divine light of a star—not a physical luminary, but the star of the omniscient spiritual eye.

The words Jesus and Isa (pronounced \"Isha\") are substantially the same. Is, Isa, and Iswara all refer to the Lord, or Supreme Being. \"Jesus\" derives from the Greek form of the name Joshua or Jeshua, a contrac- tion of Jehoshua, \"help of Jehovah\" or \"Saviour.\"* The title \"Christ\" is also found in India—it was perhaps given to Jesus there—in the word \"Krishna,\" which sometimes I purposely spell \"Christna\" to show the correlation. \"Christ\" and \"Krishna\" are titles signifying divinity, meaning that these two avatars were one with God.

He is aware of whatever we do within His universal form, just as we are conscious of our little selves. Through oneness with that Christ Consciousness Jesus was able to know, without being told, that Lazarus was dead. The wonders of God's creation cannot be discovered by a cow; it is the unique potential of human beings to attain the omniscience of oneness with Christ Consciousness. I ask those who do not believe in God: \"Whence came the intelligence in man and in the universe, if it is not produced in some divine 'Factory' hidden behind the ether?\" Such mysteries prompted Einstein to say that space looks very suspicious. Space is concealing God; His Intelligence is hidden there, for out of the \"nothingness\" of space comes everything. Being one with this Intelligence, which guides every atom in creation, Jesus could materialize his form anywhere he wished. And he can still do so, just as he used to appear every night to St. Francis in Assisi. Jesus was conscious not only of his microcosmic physical form, but also of all creation as his macrocosmic body; he could truthfully say: \"I and my Father are one.\"* He experienced his presence in all atoms, even as does his Father. Jesus alluded to the omnipresent Christ Consciousness when he said, \"Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without [the sight of] your Father, \"t Christ came at a critical time in history, when the world was sorely in need of spiritual hope and regeneration. $ His message was not intended to foster multifarious sects, each claiming him as their own.

Jesus assured the downtrodden, the white and the dark man, the Oriental and the Occidental, that they are all children of God; whoever is pure in heart, no matter what his race or colour, can receive the Lord. The charcoal and the diamond receive the same rays of the sun, but the diamond reflects their radiance. So, both in the Orient and the Occident, those who have diamond mentalities shall reflect God and be called the sons of God, and those who keep themselves dark with evil qualities shall not be able to reflect His light. Train Your Heart to Feel the Brotherhood of Man All mankind should open its heart to Jesus' great message: \"[God] hath made of one blood all nations of men.\"t That is the Christ inspiration I love so much. I want to make that mes- sage a living reality, to give it a practical application. Colour prejudice is the most foolish of all man's displays of ignorance. Colour is only skin deep. God gave darker skin pigment to races that originally lived under climatic conditions requiring greater protection from the sun, a purely practical measure; therefore white, olive, yellow, red, or black skin is nothing to be particularly proud of. After all, the soul wears a bodily over- coat of one colour in one lifetime and other hues in other in- carnations. So the colour of one's complexion is a very super- ficial thing. To have any colour prejudice is to discriminate against God, who is sitting in the hearts of all the red, white, yellow, olive, and black peoples of the world. Besides, it is well to remember that whoever hates any race will surely reincar- nate in that bodily form; thus does the karmic law force man to overcome his soul-stifling prejudices. Train your heart to feel the brotherhood of man—that is most important. Although Jesus' teachings were preordained to establish their strongest foundation in the West, he chose an incarnation in an Oriental body, and in the Jewish race, which has had a long history of persecution, because he wanted to demonstrate * John 1:12. t Acts 17:26."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"JESUS: A CHRIST OF EAST AND WEST 289 the folly of judging others according to distinctions of race and colour. True Christianity must be lived; racial divisions must be banished. Prejudices and lack of real brotherhood are causes of war and disunion among God's children. We must work at eradicating all incitements to war ; in hate and prejudice lie bombs and misery. Jesus warned: \"...for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.\"* It is not the sword, but the practice of Christ principles that shall ultimately free the world. In the highest sense, God alone protects you. You can best help this world by ideal living, as taught by Christ and all spiritually enlightened ones. Above all else, love God; don't you see that the whole answer is in His hands? When He will push aside the screen of mystery, you will see the answer to all that was theretofore obscure and unfathomable. Some Westerns consider the Hindus heathens,- they don't know that many Hindus consider Westerners heathens also— ignorance is fifty-fifty everywhere. I am sometimes asked if I believe in Jesus. I reply: \"Why such a question? We in India reverence Jesus and his teachings, perhaps more than you do.\" In order to love Christ you must live what he taught, you must follow the example of his life. Jesus said: \"...whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.\"t India has practised this teaching more than any other nation. Many who call themselves Christian do not even apply it; they say that it is a beautiful philosophy, but if you were to slap them they would return twelve slaps, a kick, and maybe a bullet! Anyone who so retaliates is not a true Christian, or lover of Christ, for that is not the spirit of the all-forgiving Jesus. Every time you see the symbol of the Cross it should remind you of what it stands for—that you must bear your crosses with right attitude, even as Jesus did. When you mean well and still you are misunderstood or mistreated, instead of being angry you should say, as did Christ: \"Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.\" Why forgive one who wrongs you?

But if you manifest spiritual strength you are blessed, and the power of your righteous behaviour will also help the other per- son to overcome his misunderstanding. Those eternal principles of truth and righteousness taught by Jesus we take very seriously in India—we take them liter- ally, without rationalizing them to suit our purposes. Jesus said: \"And everyone that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.\"* That spirit of renunciation for God is all-pervasive in India. Especially in olden days it was the ideal of every man to give at least one part of his lifetime to God alone. God Does Not Like to be Forgotten Complete renunciation is not necessary for everyone, but if you forget God while fulfilling your material duties, God will not like it. Give time to Him alone, without work. I always save time in the morning and night for God, and the rest of the day I serve Him wholeheartedly. The Lord says in the Gita: \"Whatever actions thou dost perform...dedicate them all as of- ferings to Me. Thus no action of thine can enchain thee with good or evil karma, \"t You came on this earth for God. It is His world, not yours. You are here to work for Him. Life will very much disappoint and disillusion you if you labour only for yourself, because eventually you will have to leave everything; you will be forced to practise renunciation then! The message of Christ is one of compassion and forgive- ness, renunciation (in spirit if one cannot do it in actuality), morality, brotherly love and unity and equality, and supreme love for God. Remember Jesus' admonition: \"And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?\"* The authenticity of the life of Christ has been questioned by many agnostics. Some have propounded the theory that Jesus was legendary, his life a mere fictitious drama. I know that Christ is real, for I have seen him many times.

A Vision of Christ at the Yogoda School in India One day at my school in Ranchi, I was sitting with the young boys when I saw someone coming toward us, from behind the boys, and wondered who it was. Then I saw it was Jesus; his feet were not touching the ground as he approached. He came very close to us and then vanished. A few years later, in Boston, I again saw Jesus. I was meditating and deeply praying to God because I felt that for three days I had forgotten Him—I had been so engrossed in fulfilling the responsibilities He had given to me. I told the Lord: \"I am going to walk out of this work!\" The right attitude is to love God and Love His work because of Him. Those who do missionary service, but never make the effort to meditate or commune with God, never find Him. Because I felt that the activities of my ministry had taken me away from God, I prayed, \"Lord, I will go away. I will not remain in America and do Your work unless I know You are with me.\" Then a Voice came through the ether like a beam of light: \"What do you want? You cannot go.\" Many times in my life God has thus prevented me from carrying out my desire to run away from my duties to this cause, to be only with Him. I replied to the Divine Voice: \"Let me see, on a sea of gold, Krishna and Jesus and their disciples.\" Even as I made this inward request, I saw those divine ones coming toward me! \"It is a hallucination,\" I thought. \"If the person meditating with me sees this also, then I shall believe.\" Instantly my companion exclaimed aloud: \"Oh, I see Christ and Krishna!\" Then I rationalized, \"This is thought transference.\" I was doubting and praying to God to help my unbelief when the Voice said: \"When I leave, the room will become filled with the fragrance of the lotus, and whoever comes shall notice it.\" As the vision vanished, the whole room became permeated with a marvellous lotus essence.

A salesman should never try to sell something he does not believe in. One should teach only those things he has practised and experienced. Devotees of this path should sincerely study the Yogoda Satsanga Lessons and meditate deeply each night before going to bed.

Wor- shipping Jesus is not truly meaningful until one can expand his consciousness to receive within himself the Christ Consciousness. That is the second coming of Christ. Unless you do your part, a thousand Christs come on earth would not be able to save you. You have to work for your own salvation. Then Christ can help you.

The sun shines equally on piece of charcoal and a diamond, but only the diamond reflects the sun's light. God's light also shines equally on all stages of life, but the reflection is greater from some than from others. The divine light is fully reflected by the man of realization. Every human being is essentially a soul, covered with a veil of may a. Through evolution and self-effort, man makes a little hole in the veil; in time, he makes the hole bigger and bigger. As the opening enlarges, his consciousness expands,- the soul becomes more manifest. When the veil is completely torn away, the soul is fully manifest in him. That man has become a master—master of himself and of maya. The great ones are not specially manufactured by God. They became masters through their own efforts. They had to work and fight for liberation, just as all the rest of mankind is struggling toward the light of soul freedom.

They have their weaknesses, their struggles and temp- tations, and then through righteous battle and right behaviour, they attain victory. In this way they show that all men can be and are meant to be spiritually victorious over the forces that would deep them from realizing their inherent oneness with God. A Christ and a Krishna created perfect by God, without any effort of self-evolution on their part, and merely pretend- ing to struggle and overcome their part, and merely pretending to struggle and overcome their trials on earth, could not be ex- amples for suffering humans to follow. The fact that the great ones too were once such mortals, but overcame, makes them pillars of strength and inspiration for stumbling mankind. When we know that divine avatars, in order to make them- selves perfect, once had to go through the same kinds of human trials and experiences that we do, it gives us hope in our own struggle. A God-realized master is known by his spiritual deeds. Miracles are not the most important of these. Some of the miracles that Christ performed can be duplicated in other ways by scientists today. On the spiritual side, Christ himself said: \"He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do.\"* Miracles such as you have heard about I have seen demonstrated many times by the masters; but these are not the criterion of their greatness. The power to perform miracles comes naturally to those who know God, because they are in tune with His cosmic laws; but those who become attached to miracles will lose Him. God alone must be the goal of our hearts.

The manifestation of God in the life of divine beings is sometimes measured in terms of the quantitative and qualita- tive good they do. But great ones who fully manifest God are equally one with Him. So it is impossible to make comparisons between the masters (or avatars), and foolish to try, because being one with God they are all the same; they are all equal before Him. But to me Krishna and Christ stand supreme. By the greatness of his loving sacrifice, Christ has influenced the whole world. Krishna manifested a different aspect of the Infinite Father. In contradistinction to Christ, who was a renunciant, Krishan was a king; and I bow to one who can be a king and remain a divine one at the same time. To be in the world but not of the world is very difficult, for you live in the midst of temptations and desires and yet must remain untouched by them. Krishna came on earth much earlier than Christ, about three thousand years before, some scholars say. The lives of Christ and Krishna have not only a great spiritual concomi- tance; there are also parallels in the personal stories that come down to us. Both Jesus and Krishna were born of devout, God- loving parents. Krishna's parents were persecuted by his wicked uncle, King Kansa; King Herod's threats tormented the mother and father of Jesus.

These two avatars, both Orientals, are generally recognized in the West and East respectively as the supreme incarnations of God. Jesus Christ and Bhagavan Krishna gave to the world two of the greatest books of all times. The words of Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita and of Lord Jesus in the New Testament of the Bible are sublime manifestations of truth, great models of spiritual scripture. These two bibles give essentially the same teaching. The deeper Christianity that was preached by Jesus has been lost sight of today.

There is a differ- ence of meaning between Jesus and Christ. t Jesus is the name of a little human body in which the vast Christ Consciousness was born.

It would be a metaphysical error to say that the omnipresent Christ Consciousness is circumscribed by the body of any one human being. Jadava Krishna is the Christ of the Hindus.

You are aware of whatever is happening in any part of your body, and in the same way God feels everything that is going on in His body—the cosmos. When you can feel His omnipresent consciousness in your fingertips, in your heart and head and wherever there is any vibration of creation; when you can feel yourself in every speck of space,- when your sympathy and love have spread everywhere and you feel oneness with everything, you are in Christ Consciousness.

When the wave dances on the sea it thinks it exists as a separate entity. But once it realizes, \"I cannot exist without the ocean,\" the wave sees that it is the ocean, that the ocean has created a little wave out of itself. Similarly, God can manifest Himself as a soul within the form of man, but He cannot be limited by that form. The Bhagavad Gita says: \"The Supreme Spirit, transcendent and existing in the body is the detached Beholder, the Consenter, the Sus- tainer, the Experiencer, the Great Lord, and also the Highest Self.\"* Jesus understood that \"The Father has become my- self.\" This truth is also brought out in the Hindu scriptures: \"Tat twam asi,\" \"That thou art.\" Concepts of God and Trinity Agree Hinduism as well as Christianity believes in one God. A few misunderstanding Westerners who have visited India have brought back stories that prejudice others against Hindu reli- gious practices. I could similarly go back to India and say that I found America to be a place of murderers, racketeers, and drunkards; but I realize that such persons do not constitute the whole of America. There are defects in India as there are de- fects in America and everywhere else. Some Indian teachers in- struct their followers to concentrate on an image representing a particular aspect of the Infinite Spirit. The visible image helps devotees to increase their concentration and devotion in prayer to the unseen Spirit. Uninformed Westerners conclude that In- dians as a whole worship idols. But we worship only Brahman, Spirit. The concept of one God is the same in Hinduism as in Christianity. The concept of the Trinity is also exactly the same in the Hindu and Christian scriptures. The Trinity is not a negation of the one God; it illustrates a metaphysical truth, that the One became Three when God made this creation. In the beginning—when there was no creation—there was Spirit. But Spirit wanted to create, and by His wishful thought He projected a great sphere of light, or cosmic energy, which became the universe. That cosmic energy is the Holy Ghost. \"Ghost\" means something invisible and intelligent. \"Holy * xm:22."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"300 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST Ghost\" refers to the spiritual vibration or energy of creation in which the intelligence of God is immanent as Christ Consciousness, \"the only begotten Son,\" * God's pure reflection in creation. This Christ Intelligence holds the universe in balance. God the Father is the Intelligence beyond creation; the Son or Christ Consciousness is His Intelligence in creation; and the Holy Ghost is the intelligent vibration of creation itself. Long before Christ spoke of it, the Trinity was described in the Hindu scriptures: \"Aum, Tat, Sat\" —Cosmic Vibration, Christ Intelligence, and God the Father. The Bible tells us of Jesus Christ's promise that when he was gone from this world he would send the Comforter,! the Holy Ghost. Every vibration emanates a sound. The Holy Ghost is the Cosmic Intelligent Vibration, whose sound is the Aum or Amen heard in deep yoga meditation. Saint John spoke of it when he said: \"I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, \"t That sound is the Holy Ghost. In its vibration is our comfort. We are living in a new age in which God's voice of cosmic vibration, of Aum and Amen, can be heard from the two ends of the two hemispheres in the scriptures of Krishna and Christ. It was in the land of India that Krishna spoke of the Aum sound§ and it was another Oriental Christ who spoke of this same vibration, calling it Amen or Holy Ghost, as the means of communing with God. By attuning your consciousness within in meditation, you can hear and commune with the Aum or Amen vibration in which you meet the great Comforter.

Through such communion, you become one with Spirit; then there is no longer a Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are seen to be the one Spirit. The Pitfalls of Body Consciousness Consider the limitations of this physical body. Looking outward you see disease, suffering, pain, and heartaches; but on the other, inner side of this body, in the subtle centres of spir- itual consciousness, is the Comforter. When your mind follows the stream of ordinary outward consciousness you will know Hades,- but when by meditating on Aum your mind follows the stream of the inner consciousness, you will find the great Heaven that exists behind this body. That is why Jesus said, \"Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body more than raiment?\"* As soon as you become concentrated on the limited physical body you will fall into the pit of misery. It is popular in these times to seek prosperity, but you may become ill and unable to enjoy your abundance. Therefore Jesus warned that we should seek the kingdom of God first. Your consciousness must be with God. This is man's highest duty. \"For all these things do the nations of the world seek after; and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.

When you seek with that determination, \"all things shall be added unto you\"—not before.

Isn't it foolish not to renounce a few material things in order to realize the kingdom of heaven? But seldom do even devout Christians follow what Christ said here; not many are able to follow this path. Yet renunciation is not self-punishment; it is the investment of a few temporal trinkets in order to gain the eternal treasure—God. Worldly persons have left God for perishable acquisitions, but I have left perishable things for God. The Gita also advises renunciation. Krishna says: \"For- saking all other dharmas (duties), remember Me alone; I will free thee from all sins (accruing from non-performance of those lesser duties).\"+ The shame and trouble and misery that will arise from forsaking worldly duties God will forgive you. But the Gita says more: \"The sages call that man wise whose pursuits are all without selfish plan or longings for results, and whose activities are purified (cauterized of karmic out- growths) by the fire of wisdom. Relinquishing attachment to the fruits of work, always contented, independent (of mater- ial rewards),the wise do not perform any (binding) action even in the midst of activities.\"X Therein Krishna declares that it is not necessary to forsake all things outwardly to find God, if everything you do is without selfish motive, and done only to please Him. To forget God for worldly duties is to show colossal ingratitude, for we cannot do our duty to our family and others without the power borrowed from Him. In India hundreds go away into the forest just to think of God alone. That is the way that Christ taught when he called to his disciples, \"Follow me.\"§ They left their work and their homes and forsook all, even their lives, for God. Significance of Krishna's Life for Modern Man Lord Krishna says in the Gita that what man really needs to do to find the kingdom of heaven is to renounce the fruits of * Mark 10:29-30. + XVHI:66. * IV: 18-20. § Matthew 4:19."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"CHRIST AND KRISHNA: AVATARS OF THE ONE TRUTH 303 action. God has sent man into this life so circumstanced with hunger and desires that he must work. Without work human civilization would be a jungle of disease, famine, and confu- sion. If all the people in the world were to leave their material civilizations and live in the forests, the forests would then have to be transformed into cities, else the inhabitants would die because of lack of sanitation. On the other hand, material civ- ilization is full of imperfections and misery. What possible remedy can be advocated? Krishna's life demonstrates his philosophy that it is not necessary to flee the responsibilities of material life. The prob- lem can be solved by bringing God here where He has placed us. No matter what our environment may be, into the mind where God-communion reigns, Heaven must come. A heaven without Thee, O God, I want not! I love to work in the factory if I can but hear Thy voice in the noisy wheels of the machinery. A material life without Thee, my Lord, is a source of physical misery, disease, crime, ignorance, and unhappiness.\"* To avoid the pitfalls of the two extremes, renunciation of the world, or drowning in material life, man should so train his mind by constant meditation that he can perform the necessary dutiful actions of his daily life and still maintain the consciousness of God within. All men and women should remember that their worldly life can be freed from endless physical and mental ills if they add deep meditation to their daily routine of living. A balanced life of meditation and activity, without attachment to the fruits of action, is the example set by Krishna's life. The message of Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita stands at the doctrine best suited to our modern busy life of many worries. To work without the peace of God is hades, To work with God's happiness ever bubbling in the soul is to carry a portable paradise within you wherever you go. To be constantly worried even in pleasant surroundings is to live in hades; to live in the inner, boundless soul-peace, even though housed in a rickety shack, is real paradise. Whether in a palace or under a tree, we must carry with us always this inner heaven. * Whispers from Eternity."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"304 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST The yogi enjoys everything with the consciousness of God. But at the same time he can say: \"If I don't see the face of food, I shall never miss it.\" The conditions of the world should not bother you. Be not attached to anything. Jesus fasted for forty days and kept his mind always on God. If you are in the world and have no attachment to it, you are real yogi. To remain in the candy store and not touch the candy is true renunciation. However, milk will not float on water unless you make butter of it. The only way to find hap- piness and emancipation is to seek God and live by His laws. Jesus said: \"If thy hand offend thee, cut it off.\"* That kind of determination is needed. You must realize in your heart and soul this truth: \"Lord, You alone are mine. I am here just to please You.\" Renounce not only outwardly but mentally too. Jesus did not mean that man should not eat or put on clothes; he him- self ate food and wore clothing. He did mean that one should be mentally non attached to dress and food. He was teaching that renunciation must be accomplished mentally as well as externally. \"Take no thought...for your body\"t means \"Don't worry too much about food and clothing and the demands of the body.\" It is more important to be clean inside than outside. If you can be pure within and also clean without, that is even better. Moral Doctrines Universal in the Scriptures We find the main moral doctrines of religion in both the Bible and the Hindu scriptures. The message of the Gita includes the precepts of the Ten Commandments of Chris- tianity, and also the reason why it is wrong to break them. The Gita wisely warns: \"He who ignores the scriptural commands and who follows his own foolish desires does not find happi- ness or perfection or the Infinite Goal.\"* You can be moral without being religious, but the principles of morality are a necessary beginning in the practice of religion; for true religion is deeper than morality—it is contact with God. You should not concentrate on your faults, nor think of yourself as a sinner. * Mark 9:43. t Matthew 6:25. * XVI:23."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"CHRIST AND KRISHNA: AVATARS OF THE ONE TRUTH 305 Affirm that you are a child of God, and dwell on what Jesus said: \"I and my Father are one.\" Reincarnation in the Gita and the Bible Reincarnation, so beautifully expounded by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, is one of the most helpful and inspiring spiritual doctrines; without it we cannot understand the justice of God. Why would a baby be bom crippled? Why would God send to a family two babies who are strong and whole, and one who is lame? If we are all made in God's image, where is the justice of this? Only reincarnation can explain it. The crippled baby is a soul that in some past life transgressed God's laws and, as result, lost the use of his legs. As it is the mind that molds the body, and this soul had lost the consciousness of having healthy legs, it was unable to create a perfect pair of limbs when it came back again in this life. And so we must come, and come again, until we regain our lost perfection. He who becomes perfect shall not have to return to earth anymore. Those who have overcome desire shall be one with God. Jesus spoke of this when he said: \"Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out.\"* The Gita similarly promises: \"O Arjuna! this is the established in Brahman' state. Anyone entering this state is never (again) deluded.

Desire brings you back to this earth. We have been prodigal children, and unless we forsake desires we cannot go back to God. If suddenly we have to leave this earth with desires still in our hearts, we must come here again until we work them out. It is necessary to regain self-perfection be- fore we can return to God. When the storm is on, the wave rises out of the ocean, but as soon as the ocean is calm again, the wave can sink back into the sea. So it is with us. As soon as this storm of material desires is over we can melt again into the ocean of God. * Revelation 3:12. 111:72."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"306 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST Early Christianity taught reincarnation.

Christ came to awaken the divine con- sciousness of brotherhood in the East and West. It is true that Christ lived in India during most of the eighteen unaccounted for years of his life, studying with India's great masters. That doesn't take away from his divinity and uniqueness,- it shows the unity and brotherhood of all great saints and avatars. The great ones come on earth to show that the Christ Consciousness they have attained is what all who live here must seek. You just expand your consciousness and banish your suffering. Eating food doesn't make physical pain go away. Acquiring possessions doesn't stop mental suffering. Reading spiritual books doesn't satisfy the soul. The masters of India say that the purpose of religion is not to create certain doctrines to be followed blindly, but to show mankind the perennial method of finding everlasting happiness. As the businessman tries to alleviate the suffering of others by sup- plying some need; as every man is an agent of God for doing some good on earth, so Krishna, Christ, Buddha—all the great ones—came on earth to bestow on mankind the highest good: knowledge of the path to Eternal Bliss, and the example of their sublime lives to inspire us to follow it.

It is said that during the golden era of Rama's rule no accidents or premature deaths or natural dis- asters disturbed Ayodhya's perfect harmony. There will be more harmony and health in every home as the individual members of the family live more rightly. When family mem- bers selfishly take away from one another, the house naturally will be filled with disharmony. So also with the nations; only when mankind lives rightly will the kingdom of God come on earth. But time is short. You are here today, and tomorrow you are gone. As a human being, it is your highest privilege to seek God. You should use the freedom He has given you in this life to prove by experiment the eternal spiritual truths. Sin is that which causes you suffering. Virtue is that which makes you lastingly happy. If there is no spiritual harmony in your mind, even a new house and a new car cannot make you happy; you will have your hades with you just the same. Real happiness can stand the challenge of all outer experi- ences.

As soon as you tell a child not to do a thing, he at once wants to do it. These Ten Commandments are being broken every day, everywhere. Unless their spiritual meaning is understood, people will always rebel against them. The Ten Command- ments are eternal rules of conduct that have been set forth in all the great world religions. However, the scriptures for the most part do not explain the psychology and utility of these commandments. People accept them in church but do not act upon them outside of church, rationalizing that these precepts are impractical. Yet the breaking of the Ten Commandments is the primary source of all the misery in the world. What is the utility of the commandments? In the Bhagavad Gita we are told to forsake all else and remember God alone. \"Absorb thy mind in Me, become My devotee; resign all things to Me; bow down to Me. Thou art dear to Me, so in truth do I promise thee: thou shalt attain Me.\"* This corresponds to the first of the Ten Commandments given to Moses: \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\" God- realization should be the goal of living. Material duties cannot be performed without power borrowed from God. To perform one's ordinary duties, and forget Him, is the highest sin. Sin means ignorance, acting against one's highest good. How many times have you felt a burning sorrow in your heart? Why? Be- cause you didn't act rightly; because God was not first in your heart. The Gita says: \"Forsaking all other dharmas (duties), remember Me alone,- I will free thee from all sins (accuring from non-performance of those lesser duties).\"+ There should be no other god in your life who means more to you than God. Even though Jesus was one with the Father, he said: \"I do not know all the things that my Father knows.\"* As soon as man begins to worship possessions, name, fame—anything less than God—he finds unhappiness. \"Those who worship lesser gods, O Arjuna, they go unto them; My * XVm:65. t XVm:66. * \"But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father\" ( Mark 13:32)."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"THE TEN COMMANDMENTS: ETERNAL R ULES OF HAPPINESS 311 devotee comes unto Me.\"* Only God can fulfill man's dreams of lasting happiness. No diversion should be allowed to replace worship of the Supreme Lord. If you study the Hindu scriptures you will see how they correspond with the Ten Command- ments of the Bible. \"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.\" Sym- bol worship is all right for a few, but it has more bad than good results. To worship the cross of Christ and forget what the cross stands for is to worship a \"graven image,\" because you have lost sight of its significance. When a great spiritual teacher passes on, his image, or some symbol of his life, is usu- ally kept and venerated, and this is all right provided you re- member and emulate his qualities. But if you worship an im- age without conscious regard for what it represents, then you have forgotten the Infinite. To have a picture or a statue of Je- sus is acceptable if it helps you to dwell on his divine qualities. Then you are not worshipping a graven image, but the ideal the image represents to you. Whatever worship ritual you perform with the consciousness of Spirit is pleasing to the Lord. But in Moses' time many worshippers had forgotten God; they were venerating mere objects, even sacrificing goats to them. In India it is customary to make a picture or statue of a saint, or perhaps to fashion an image symbolic of a specific manifestation or quality of the Divine, and place it in a tem- ple. The people offer flowers to God or to the spirit of the saint represented by the picture or statue, and meditate on the divine qualities it symbolizes. Such worship is acceptable in God's eyes.t True devotees do not allow their consciousness to dwell on the object, but concentrate with deepest love and attention on the Spirit behind it. A great saint of India used to go into samadhi (ecstatic communion with God) whenever he offered his devotion before the image of the Divine Mother in the temple where he worshiped. \"I was placing flowers at the feet * Bhagavad Gita VII:23. t \"Whatever embodiment (a God-incarnate, a saint, or a deity) a devotee strives faithfully to worship, it is I who make his devotion unflinching. Absorbed in that devotion, intent on the worship of that embodiment, the devotee thus gains the fruits of his longings. Yet those fulfilments are verily granted by Me alone\" (Bhagavad Gita VII:21-22)."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"312 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST of a stone symbol,\" he said, \"when suddenly I beheld that, untouched by my body, I was one with the Sustainer of the universe. I began placing flowers on my own head.\" If you can do so, it is much better to concentrate inwardly on God than to focus your attention first on an external inter- mediary symbol, and then transfer that concentration to the Spirit. God is infinite. How could an image encase Him? This is the reason behind the second commandment. We should not worship an image as God, because He is infinite. Being infinite, God cannot be limited to any form, human or stone; yet He is manifest in all forms. One can rightly say that God manifests in every man as well as in great saints, for He is present in all. The sun shines equally, also, on a piece of charcoal and a diamond. But the diamond receives and reflects the sun's light, whereas the charcoal does not. Similarly, all people are exposed to the light of God, but not all receive and reflect that light. To do so they must purify themselves by meditation and by following the Ten Commandments. \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.\" When you say the name of God, you must be inwardly aware of what you are saying. Were it possible to look into oth- ers' minds when they are praying, you would see that a great many are thinking about almost anything but the Lord. They are taking the name of God in vain. When we pray we should try our utmost to concentrate our whole attention on God, in- stead of saying \"God, God, God\" and letting our minds dwell on something else. An aunt of mine had the habit of saying her prayers on beads. She could almost always be seen busily fin- gering her beads. But she approached me one day and confessed that although she had been doing this for forty years, God had never answered her prayers. No wonder! Her \"prayers\" were hardly more than a nervous physical habit. Don't think of anything but the Spirit when you are pray- ing. Try your utmost to be sincere. The use of beads in prayer, and japa, repetition of the name of God, are good when prac- tised with devotion and concentration. But these all too often become mechanical; they are lower forms of worship. But to whisper \"God\" in your heart on beads of love—that is true"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"THE TEN COMMANDMENTS: ETERNAL R ULES OF HAPPINESS 313 worship. It is insulting to God also if you sing hymns or chant to Him with an absent mind. The Bhagavad .Gita similarly stresses the importance of a concentrated mind while worshipping God. When you pray, your heart and your mind should be filled with the love of God. \"He attains the Supreme Effulgent Lord, O Arjuna! whose mind, stabilized by Yoga, is immovably fixed on the thought of Him.\"* \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.\" Out of a week of seven days, how few people devote even one to God! To keep apart one day for Him is in the best interests of your own welfare. Sunday is the sun's day—the bright day of wisdom. Many never use it to think of God, though to do so is the highest wisdom. If on that day, you could just be alone and quiet for a little time, enjoying that stillness, you would see how much better you feel. Observe the Sabbath in this way; it will be a salve to the lacerations of the preceding six days. Everyone needs one day a week in the spiritual hospital to heal his mental wounds. Don't observe the sabbath as a forced duty; enjoy it. When it becomes for you a day of peace and joy and contentment, you will look forward to it. Seclusion is the price of greatness. You may be surprised at what seclusion with God will do for your mind, body, and soul. In the early morning, and before retiring, you should immerse yourself in His peace. India's sages counsel not only a regular day for seclusion, but stress the need for quiet meditation during four specific periods every day. In the early morning, before you get up or see anyone, remain calm, feeling peace. At noon, be quiet for a while before taking lunch; and before your evening meal, have another time for peace. Before going to bed, go into that silence again. Those who faithfully observe silence in seclusion during these four times of the day cannot but feel in tune with God. Whoever cannot manage four times a day should observe each morning and evening a period devoted to God. By doing this you will have a different, happier life.

The calm man doesn't make mistakes. When thousands of others are failing, he succeeds. You must be calm to be successful. Those who do not observe the sabbath by feeling this divine peace develop great moodiness. They become nervous automatons. Through the portals of silence the healing sun of wisdom and peace will shine upon you. The sabbath should be a day of rest and cultivation of divine peace. However, activity that expresses wisdom and peace is also appropriate on the Sabbath. \"Honour thy father and thy mother.\" The human father and mother should be honoured as the representatives of God, the supreme Parent, who has empowered them with His gift to create man. The mother is God's unconditional love incarnate, because a true mother forgives when no one else does. The father is a manifestation of the Heavenly Father's wisdom and protection of His children. One should not love father and mother apart from God, but as representations of His protect- ing love and wisdom. The Supreme Spirit becomes the father and mother to help each child. Therefore honour Him in your parents. \"Thou shalt not kill.\" The meaning is that one should not kill for killing's sake; for then you become a murderer. One should not take another's life in a moment of violent emotion. But if your country is attacked and goes to war, you should fight to protect those whom God has given to you. You have a righteous obligation to defend your family and your country. \"Thou shalt not commit adultery.\" The ideal of sexual union should be the creation of children made in the image of God, and the expression of the pure love of the soul that is felt"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"THE TEN COMMANDMENTS: ETERNAL R ULES OF HAPPINESS 315 between marriage partners who behold only God in each other. Those who live solely on the physical plane, never thinking of love or the high purpose for which the sex sense was intended, are, in the spirit of this commandment, committing adultery. One is then no better than the animal, who has his sex and goes his way. Except for the purpose of procreation, and the expression of mutual true love in the holy state of matrimony, the creative urge is intended by God to be transmuted into energy and divine realization. Insofar as you can absorb the sexual power, you can develop great mental powers to write, paint, or express yourself creatively in a thousand other ways. As you ultimately control and spiritualise the creative energy, you will feel great peace and love and bliss in God. Saints who have thus spiritu- alized the sexual energy are very powerful, able to demonstrate wonderful achievements in the world and in the interior search for Truth. Thus the highest use of sex is the sublimation of its power in order to manifest spiritual thoughts and ideals and wisdom. It is detrimental to your mental and physical well-being if you concentrate on sex apart from the expression of marital love or the procreative purpose of married life. One should not dwell on sex thoughts or act promiscuously on sex thoughts. When you can exercise this restraint you can develop the right atti- tude toward sex and its wholesome divine purpose. The universe and man were immaculately created by God's will. In the beginning, man also was empowered to create immaculately by will, as God did. Man lost this power when he was tempted to concentrate on sexual rather than spiritual expression of the divine creative power. To be enslaved by sex is to lose health, self-control, and peace of mind—everything that man needs to be happy. \"Thou shalt not steal.\" If all the people in a community of 1,000 steal from one another, each will have 999 enemies.

If you want to be treated well, you should treat others well. It is important to speak the truth at all times. To be always truthful one must understand the difference between fact and truth.

Many people who enjoy criticizing cannot themselves stand criticism, and may even have the same flaws they so righteously deplore in another. Character study is important primarily in this respect: one needs constantly to take note of virtues in others and to implant those good traits in himself. I study character when I choose people with whom to work. But I have an entirely different standpoint for choosing. Sometimes I let a person that I know is \"bad\" be with me, in the hope that he will change. If he responds to my spiritual thought for his welfare he becomes better; and if he doesn't, well, I take that chance. I am like a medical doctor who risks exposure to a disease in order to help a patient. All doctors have to take that chance because their desire is to serve.

Aristotle studied physiognomy as a guide to character. Hindu teachers go deeper. They say that the main thoughts of all one's incarnations are reflected in the eyes. Though the eyes reveal the whole story of the soul, not only of this life but of past lives, still it requires a master's mind to analyse the reve- lation of your past lives reflected in this life. Once in a while you are walking along and suddenly notice something in the eyes of a passer-by, and you think, \"I don't like him,\" or as the case may be, \"I like him.\" Eyes tell the whole story. Fear, anger, jealousy, greed, generosity, love, courage, spirituality—all these qualities, good and bad, cause corresponding reflections in the eyes. Detectives can control their facial muscles so as not to betray by their expressions what they are thinking, but they cannot hide the suspicion in their eyes. A yogi has calm eyes because he is thinking of the tranquil Spirit. Facial and bodily features have been studied, even the bumps on the head have been analysed; but physical appear- ance does not always tell the story, and different cultures draw different conclusions from their observations. Some say that fat people are luxury-loving and don't like to work, and that thin people are more spiritual. Yet in India, fatness in a spiri- tual person is viewed favourably. Caesar was wary of Cassius' \"lean and hungry\" appearance, in which he saw a threat to his power. Some writers have theorized that those who are thin think too much, hence flesh doesn't build up on them. A study of history shows that both lean and stout people have been good rulers. If you are persistently fat now, you were fat many times before; or if in this life you are chronically thin, you have been thin for several incarnations. You have inherited the tendency from the past; and no matter what you eat, that thought-pattern tends to manifest itself."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"HOW TO READ CHARACTER 319 Physiognomy as a revealer of character is true if one takes into account the fact that all the thoughts that have passed through a particular mind during many incarnations show in the body. But it takes the intuitive power of a master to \"read\" one's physiognomy completely and correctly. For example, Socrates was very ugly. He met a great as- trologer who said, \"Socrates, you are the most evil and wicked person I know.\" Socrates' students were very angry at the as- trologer, but their teacher replied: \"You are right. I have been all that in the past. But though I have overcome it by wisdom now, still the things I did then are registered in this body, making it appear ugly.\" No two faces are the same. Each is different because of characteristics that have manifested themselves in this life and in past lives. So it is not a matter of simply judging people as bad or good because their present looks are repellent or pleas- ing. St. Francis was not physically attractive, whereas his dis- ciple Brother Masseus was a handsome man. But Masseus did not possess as great a spiritual beauty as St. Francis. Emotions as a Clue to Character There is another branch of investigation related to phys- iognomy; that of pathognomy, the study of man's feelings and emotions through the outward signs of his facial expressions and bodily movements, and through study of his emotional reactions to various incidents in his life. Feelings and habits indicate one's characteristics,- but some people have cultivated the ability to hide their true feelings because they don't want to expose themselves to others. Two husbands heard the news that their wives had drowned. One was showing great grief and the other was not saying anything; but the one who showed sorrow outwardly felt less love for his wife than did the husband who didn't reveal by his facial expression any pain at all. So pathognomy, finding out the true feelings and reactions of people, is a very deep study. You can analyse people more surely according to their feel- ings than according to their physical appearance. I combine the two methods for the most accurate analysis. All those who"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"320 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST come to me for training I place in certain situations to see how their minds and feelings will react. If they respond adversely I try to correct them; but I don't do this unless the person has asked to be corrected, and has given me the authority and per- mission to guide him. Some people are emotionally stirred at the slightest thing. Musicians in this country are as a rule very emotional, and most of your music is emotional, because it is written around the theme of human love. In India music centres around the thought of God. That is why it tends to quiet the storms of emotion and to bring out deep spiritual calmness. Not all Western musicians are emotional, of course; nor are all Indian musicians spiritual, though for the most part they are. The Sanskrit word for musician is bhagavathar, \"he who sings the praises of God.\" In dealing with emotional people you can seldom bank on their stability. Today they are enthusiastic about you and tomorrow they leave you. I have seen such persons come to the ashram, and within a few days they would make me feel they were going to be as firmly loyal as the disciple John. Next month I would find they had gone. If anything hurts me, it is when an avowal of friendship is withdrawn by a breach of that trust. When I give my friendship to anyone, I never take it back. Even-Mindedness, a Key to Development One can easily tell the difference between the motor type and the thoughtful type of man: the former always wants to work and the latter wants to think things through. Both types are needed. Motor types like to act at once. They should be taught to direct their energies into spiritually rewarding activ- ities. In order to help each type to create a harmonious balance, I advise motor types to meditate and think more, and thought- ful types to meditate and work more. People addicted to bad habits—overeating, smoking, drinking—have to be carefully handled. Any obstruction of desire causes anger. If you take food away from a greedy man he will be wrathful. It is useless to try to help such sense slaves until they themselves indicate a real desire to improve."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"HOW TO READ CHARACTER 321 Swami Shankara said that even-minded people will know God. The Master of the universe sits on the altar of even- mindedness. By even-mindedness man enjoys the perfect equilibrium of peace. One of the three basic qualities predominates in every man, according to Hindu philosophy. * Sattva is the quality of those who have spiritual tendencies. Thy eat properly, culti- vate good habits, and are devoted to the Lord. The rajas qual- ity is manifested in those who are active; such persons keep busy with work until they die. Those in whom the tamas quality is uppermost fill their lives with quarrelling, anger, jealousy, sensuality, and laziness. Any habit that holds you from spiritual attainment should be overcome. You must be the master of your thoughts and actions. It is better to be the active rajasic type and to have your habits under control than to be the tamasic type; but the sattvic type in whom goodness manifests itself is ideal. Those who want to improve themselves should mix more with sattvic types. Very few people know in what lies their own good. By this one criterion you can judge anyone. Ninety-nine percent of all people fail under this test. Tell a person, for his own good, to do a particular thing, and he will do exactly the opposite. Why? Because he can't help himself; his materialistic habits are too strong. Very often people won't do what you suggest, even though they know it is good for them, just to prove that you can't influence them. Those who really want to improve should mix more with those who are calm and self-controlled. Try to mix with people who are normal, and better still, with people who are supernormal. The weak should seek out the strong and the strong should seek out those who are even stronger. A wrestler will never increase his strength unless he works out with a stronger man. Animal Characteristics in Man After judging the mental qualities of sattva, rajas, and tamas in others, you can analyse their physical behaviour. *A11 creation is subject to the influence of three inherent gunas or qualities: sattva, rajas, and tamas —spiritual or elevating, activating, and obstructing."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"322 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST Some say that women are \"catty.\" But men can be just as catty. The cat eats the tame canary and then sits as calmly as any yogi in order to feign innocence of his unwelcome act. Some people enjoy being destructive to others' peace and happiness. Their whole purpose is to disturb and upset; like predatory wolves, they go about in society and seek out fights. Certain types of people have been compared to the jay—chattering all the time. It is said that man was created first, and that the god Twashtri then took the gentleness of the moon, the softness of the down from the swan's breast, the beauty of the flowers, and the chatter of the jay, and, combin- ing these things, made woman. And man was so happy. But after a while he went to Twashtri and said, \"She is a beautiful creature. I really appreciate her. But she talks without rest and she has become the bane of my life. Take her back.\" Then after two months the man again visited Twashtri. \"I am very sad,\" he said. \"Please return the woman to me.\" But after a while he came again and said, \"Please take her back.\" This time Twashtri said, \"No, you have to keep her!\" Poor man! he couldn't live with her, but neither could he live without her. Women can complain, for their part, about men. Unless man and woman understand each other's nature, they igno- rantly torture one another. Both were created equal in God's eyes; no man can come without woman, and no woman can come without man. It is the duty of man and woman to attain within themselves a balance between their respective pre- dominating and hidden qualities. Man is guided more by reason and woman more by feeling. Each should strive for an inner balance of both reason and feeling, and so become a \"whole\" personality, a perfected human being. Some people behave like donkeys. No matter how much they have suffered from the consequences of sense slavery, they stubbornaly go on nourishing their bad habits. They seem to have no memory whatsoever, quickly forgetting the painful results of sense indulgence and so never learning from their experiences.

Intuition Is the Surest Judge of Character Though an interesting study of character is possible through analysis of the eyes, the emotions, and the physical features, as has been pointed out, the greatest and highest way to learn about character is through soul intuition. If your mind and feeling remain perfectly calm, you will be able to feel intuitively and exactly the nature of each person you meet. My task is to take all kinds of people for training and help. It is not good to set a limitation on any human being, confining his possibilities to a certain analysis; but whether he changes or remains the same, intuition will be able to tell you, more than your diagnosis of the eyes, feelings, or physical features, whatever the nature of that person is. Intuition is the greatest analytical power. As a mirror reflects all things held before it, so when your mind-mirror is calm, you will be able to see reflected in it the true quality of others. If you are busy doing good to all, remaining calm and meditative, the true character of whoever comes to you will be revealed to you."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"How to Be Happy at Will Date and place unknown As you watch the faces of human beings, you can usually classify their expressions into four basic types, with corre- sponding mental states: smiling faces, bespeaking inner and outer happiness,- grim faces, denoting sadness; dull, unsmiling faces, revealing inner boredom; and calm faces, reflecting an inner peace. A desire satisfied produces pleasure. A longing unfulfilled creates sadness. Between the mental crests of happiness and sadness are troughs of boredom. When the high waves of plea- sure and pain and the depressions of boredom become neu- tralized, the state of peace manifests. Beyond the state of peace there is an ever-new state of bliss, which the individual can find within himself and rec- ognize as the true native state of his soul. This bliss is buried beneath the exciting mental waves of exuberant pleasure and deep depression and the hollows of indifference. When these waves disappear from the mental waters, the placid state of peace is felt. Reflected in the calm waters of peace is the ever-new bliss. Basis of Reactions Most people in the world are tossing on the waves of exciting pleasure or pain, and when these are wanting, they are bored. As you watch the faces of others during the day—at home, in the office, on the streets, or at gatherings—you can see that there are only a few who manifest peace. When you see a merry countenance and ask that person, \"What makes you happy?\" he is likely to answer in this way: \"I had a raise in salary,\" or, \"I met an interesting person.\" Behind happiness lies the fulfilment of a desire. 324"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"HOW TO BE HAPPY AT WILL 325 When you see a doleful face and make sympathetic inquiry, its owner may reply, \"I'm a sick man,\" or, \"I lost my wallet.\" His desire to regain health (or his lost money) has been contradicted. When you see a face registering a sort of blank neutrality, and you ask, \"What's the matter? Are you unhappy about something?\" he promptly answers in the negative. But if you press him, \"Are you happy?\" he will say, \"Oh, no, I'm just bored.\" Negative and Positive Peace You may meet a refined, well-to-do man living on an estate, looking healthy and plump, and neither unduly happy nor sad or bored. In such case you might say he is peaceful. But when that comfortably fixed person has too much of this kind of peace—which few people have the good fortune to experience—he thinks within, \"I've had enough peace—I need some excitement and diversion.\" Or he may remark to a friend, \"Please give me a knock on the head to make me feel that I'm alive!\" The negative state of peace is derived from the absence of the three mental states of happiness, sadness, and boredom. Without change or excitement, protracted negative peace becomes stale and unenjoyable. But after long-continued indulgence in the happy, sad, and bored states, negative peace is enjoyable. For this reason, the yogis advocate the neutral- ization of the waves of thoughts by concentration to achieve mental peace. Once the yogi has stilled the waves of thought, he begins to look beneath the lake of calmness, and finds there a positive state of peace—the ever-new joy of the soul. I met a very wealthy man in New York. In the course of telling me something about his life, he drawled, \"I am disgust- ingly rich, and disgustingly healthy—\" and before he could finish I exclaimed, \"But you are not disgustingly happy! I can teach you how to be perpetually interested in being ever newly happy.\" He became my student. By practising Kriya Yoga, and by leading a balanced life, ever inwardly devoted to God, he lived to a ripe old age, always bubbling with ever-new hap- piness.

To be able to do this you must drink and drink of His bliss from the cask of deep meditation until you become a bliss alcoholic, manifest- ing bliss in sleep, dreams, wakefulness, and all circumstances of life that might otherwise tend to make you boisterously happy, or abysmally sad, or saturated with boredom or tempo- rary negative peace. Your laughter must echo from the caverns of sincerity. Your joy must flow from the fountain of your realized soul. Your smile must spread over all the souls you meet and over the whole universe. Your every look must reflect your joyous soul and spread its contagion to gloom-drunk minds. Stop dreaming that you are just an ordinary mortal, con- stantly going through mental ups and downs. No matter what happens, remember always that you are made in the true image of Spirit. The living joy in all things—the Fountain of Cosmic Bliss—must shower you with Its spray, and send joy trickling through your thoughts, through every cell and tissue of your whole being.

It is natural for us to be partial to our own ideas, but because of this partiality we often fail to recognize that the ideas of others may be bigger and better ones. When we learn to be open-minded and not opinionated about anything, we grow in understanding and wisdom. A person is mentally free when his judgment is no longer influenced by the prejudices, customs, and conventions that are imposed on him by racial, national, and familial back- ground. In the West you sit on chairs; in the East we sit on the floor, because the climate is extremely warm and the air is cooler near the floor. But one cannot say that everyone should sit on the floor just because the East finds it more comfortable to do so. National customs and conventions limit our outlook considerably; but as soon as we become free from blind slavery to our provincial prejudices and habits, we can see truly what is right or wrong in any other nationality. As individuals we are to some extent limited by our desire to do whatever contributes to our own personal good. Thus each human being is more or less fenced in by his egoistic desires and experiences. As he increases the range of his expe- rience, his consciousness begins to stretch; it is like a rubber band that can be expanded infinitely without breaking. Indeed, the more you stretch your consciousness, the greater it will be. Learning to love our relatives is simply a training in stretching our consciousness. It is a preliminary practise in loving all others as we do our relations, whom we think of as our own. We have to learn to look on family and strangers alike, 328"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"STEPS TOWARD THE UNIVERSAL CHRIST CONSCIOUSNESS 329 because all are children of God. He has given you certain family members with whom you are practising stretching your consciousness. When the husband serves the wife, and she serves him, each with the desire to see the other happy, Christ Consciousness—God's loving Cosmic Intelligence that perme- ates every atom of creation—has begun to express itself through their consciousness. Whenever you do something for someone else, without any selfish motive, you have stepped into the sphere of Christ Consciousness. If you limit your love to your family, however, you have only that much capacity to express Christ Consciousness. When you love your neighbours as your family, your con- sciousness expands and you express a greater degree of Christ Consciousness. When you feel for all people with the love that you feel for your own loved ones, when you have that soul preparedness to do for anyone else as you would do for your own, then you are exactly expressing Christ Consciousness. Selfishness is destructive to one's own interests,- hence it is an unwise policy in any relationship or endeavour. Many of the customs in India give wonderful practice in expanding the consciousness through unselfishness. The mother never eats until the children and the father have had their food. As a result they feel for her and have a sympathetic desire to share choice tidbits with her. However, to feel concern only for yourself and your own few loved ones is still selfish. When you do something for others as feelingly as you do for self and family, you leave the little territory of selfishness and enter into the vast realm of Christ Consciousness. So the first step toward Christlike unselfishness is to expand your consciousness to include your neighbours' inter- ests and well-being. It is not necessary to give everything away,- but you should have an intense desire to help others, and be prepared, mentally and physically, so that when the occasion arises you can do the same for your neighbours as you would do for yourself. You can do it, but you don't. Whenever you find a lonely heart, or a brother weeping by the wayside, and your heart goes out to that soul, your consciousness impinges on the Christ Consciousness."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"330 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST Human love has its limitations. Family feeling is hemmed in by clannishness. Patriotic love is greater, for when you are ready to give up your happiness for the welfare of your country, you have expanded your consciousness on a much wider scale. And when you can feel for all nations as for your own country, your love manifests in an even greater way—you become a wider channel for the expression of the universal Christ Con- sciousness. Jesus could say, \"Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?\"* because he was aware that there is only the one love of God manifesting through all individual human re- lationships. In my consciousness I see no difference in an American, an Indian, an African, a German, a Frenchaman, or an Englishman —that comes from the training I received from my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar. Most parental, social, and educational training tends to foster prejudices. I love all races and nation- alities alike. I do not want to be limited by attachment to any one country. After all, we are only Americans or Indians for a little while; when we die we are all the same. If we are conscious of being world citizens, we have an expanded consciousness. Psychological Expansion of Consciousness You can stretch your consciousness psychologically so that you no longer feel for your little self, but rather for the good of the whole world as your expanded self. That is one way of expressing Christ Consciousness. Every day you think thousands of thoughts—about a thousand an hour. When you are writing you are thinking, in about an hour and a half, twenty-five hundred thoughts. The ordinary human being thinks about twelve thousand thoughts a day. A deep thinker puts forth about fifty thousand. I have found that by concentrating it is possible to produce as many as five hundred thousand thoughts in a day. I used to know a man in India who knew eighteen lan- guages and was a Master of Arts in twelve of them. Think how many thousands of thoughts were passing through his brain! Yet was never mixed up. * Matthew 12:48."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"STEPS TOWARD THE UNIVERSAL CHRIST CONSCIOUSNESS 331 You are to some extent conscious of every thought that you think during wakefulness. If you receive a pinprick any- where on your body you are instantly aware of it. That means your consciousness is present in each of the trillions of cells in the body. At the end of sixty years can you remember all the thoughts that you have had? It seems impossible. Yet all events of your life have been recorded in your subconscious mind, and that mind does recall most of those thoughts that were outstanding. The more you develop concentration and memory, the more you can recall. Conscious, Subconscious, and Superconscious Memory The scope of the mind is very grand. God has given you waking consciousness, subconsciousness, and superconscious- ness. Your conscious mind has certain limitations,- after a few years it begins to forget various things. But your subconscious mind has a greater memory capacity,- every thought and expe- rience is stored in the repository of subconsciousness. Your conscious mind may forget every word that I am saying, but your subconscious mind is registering them all. Behind the subconscious is your superconscious mind, which never forgets anything. The superconscious mind has kept a record of everything you have done, every thought you have thought. When death comes, all these thoughts and experiences flash through your mind before you leave the body. Those impressions that are strongest determine the environ- ment and habits of your next life. * As an ego your consciousness is present everywhere within yourself, and is therefore present in each thought that you think. If you can expand your consciousness beyond ego into the realm of superconsciousness, you can watch from that point all the thousands of thoughts passing through your con- scious mind. Those who have developed the superconscious mind can remember all the thoughts of a lifetime, and of pre- vious lives as well. In divine memory nothing is forgotten.

If your consciousness is aware of all those thoughts, several trillions of them, then you have Christ Consciousness: omniscience, conscious awareness of everything in creation. God gives man a mental barrier so that no one else can know his thoughts. You are alone with your thoughts even though you may be with many people. Even those who have Christ Consciousness do not intrude on the thoughts of others unless they have been ordained by God to guide others, or have been requested by their disciples to take that liberty in order to help them perfect their sadhana. Sympathy a Key to Christ Consciousness If you would develop Christ Consciousness, learn to be sympathetic. When genuine feeling for others comes into your heart, you are beginning to manifest that great consciousness. When you talk unkindly about others, you are far from the uni- versal sympathy of Christ Consciousness. Jesus said: \"Bless them that curse you.\"+ He practised divine sympathy. Jesus fought against those who were doing wrong; but he hated no one, because he saw God in everyone. Lord Krishna said: \"He is a supreme yogi who regards with equal-mindedness all men....\"* Do not sully your own thoughts and tongue by crit- icizing others. Be sincere with everyone, and above all, be sin- cere with yourself. God watches you. You cannot deceive Him. God is the whisper in the temple of your conscience, and He is the light of intuition. You know when you are doing wrong; your whole being tells you, and that feeling is God's voice. If you don't listen to Him, He becomes quiet. But when you wake up from your delusion, and want to do right, He will guide you. He is always waiting for the time when you will return Home. He sees your good and evil thoughts and actions, but they do not matter to Him.

He could have destroyed his enemies with a look, yet just as God is con- stantly forgiving us even though He knows all our wicked thoughts, so those great souls who are in tune with Him give us that same love. The transcendental way to develop universal sympathy is meditation. The man whose mind dwells in the supercon- scious state is always happy, always wise and loving, and always retains the after-effects of meditation. If you can retain effortlessly that consciousness you feel just after meditation, you have attained superconsciousness. When someone unknown comes before you, you will instantly know all about that person's life. But Christ Consciousness is still farther beyond: you feel everything in the universe in your con- sciousness at the same time. By developing sympathy for all, you can expand your con- sciousness and learn everything there is to be known. Just as you are aware of your body and limbs and thoughts and brain si- multaneously, so when you have Christ Consciousness you will feel the bodily sensations of every human being you meet, and know all the thoughts they have ever had. When the scribes and the Pharisees brought an adulteress before Jesus for judgment he said, \"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.\"* How did Jesus know about their private lives? He lived in the all-permeating divine Christ Consciousness. In that consciousness you are able to feel what others are doing and thinking. Sometimes you even forget momentarily in which body you are living.

Marvellous realizations will come to you. Sometimes, when that state comes, you feel yourself simultaneously in the stars, in the moon, and in every blade of grass. We are a part of the divine Christ Consciousness present in all creation. Each individual intelligence is a part of that vast Christ Intelligence. We are like the jets in the burner of a gas stove. There are many little holes through which the flames are pouring, but under the burner there is only one flame. We are little flames coming from the big flame of Life. Beneath all the tiny jests of human life is One Life; behind the flowers, behind all nature, is One Life. When you feel your consciousness in every pore of cre- ation, you have Christ Consciousness.

In India we might also call it Krishna Consciousness, because the consciousness of our great avatar Jadava Krishna, like that of Jesus Christ, was in tune with the Christ Consciousness in everything.

St. John declared: \"As many as received him [the Christ Con- sciousness that was manifest in Jesus], to them gave he power to become the sons of God.\"* My guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar, manifested the Christ Consciousness. He was always calm, and all my thoughts and feelings were reflected in the mirror of his calmness. Sri Yuk- teswarji wasn't interested in what others were saying; he was interested in what they were thinking. It was impossible to dis- semble with a true teacher such as my guru! His consciousness was aware of all that was going on. The Christ Consciousness dwelt also in Lahiri Mahasaya. One day when he was discoursing to his disciples on Christ Consciousness as explained in the Bhagavad Gita, Lahiri Mahasaya suddenly cried out, \"I am drowning in the bodies of many souls off the coast of Japan!\" The next day his disciples learned from a newspaper account of the deaths of a number of persons whose ship had foundered the preceding day near Japan. Life and death are but a passing from dream to dream. They are only thoughts: you are dreaming you are alive, and you are dreaming you are dead. When you get into the great Christ Consciousness, you see that life and death are dreams of God. Because Jesus lived in that consciousness he could say: \"Destroy this [bodily] temple, and in three days I will raise it up.\"+ He knew he could transform that dream of death into a dream of life, even as God can. Develop sympathy and unselfishness if you would expand your consciousness. I have no consciousness of possession. I can leave everything in a moment if God calls, for I am not bound to anything.

When the weather is too warm the Westerner suffers without some- thing to cool him, and when it is too cold he is miserable without warmth from artificial heat. But the masters of India teach a different philosophy. They say that sensitivity to heat and cold, pleasure and pain, accrues from the delusive sugges- tions of the senses and man's habit of catering to sensations; and that he who is wise rises above all dualities. The great ones do not suggest that man discipline himself to the point of doing injury to his system; rather, they advise that when cold or heat is intolerable, one should free himself mentally from the sensation, at the same time seeking a commonsense remedy for the condition. The Gita teaches: \"Those who are attached to sense plea- sures cannot gain the mental equilibrium of meditation; they fail to receive union with God through ecstasy (samadhi).\"* Learning to disconnect oneself mentally from the disturbance of sensations brings peace of mind. That man who remains untouched by the sensations that come and go, being neutral to their ever changing stimuli, manifests the soul's essential changelessness,- in that unchanging consciousness he becomes one with the Changeless Infinite. Slavish response to the various sensations of the body disturbs both mind and soul. With the disturbance of the soul man loses his true nature, which is calmness.

He put us in this body that is subject to conditions of heat and cold, pain and pleasure,- but He wants us to look on these dualities with even-mindedness. He wants us to rise above them. We should develop endurance, without being rash. When we cannot avoid excessive heat or cold, we should simply disconnect the mind from it. The more we strive to practise this, the more the mind will free itself so that no unwanted sensations can touch the consciousness. Pain Is Perceived Only in the Mind The skin's surface does not feel touch sensations; they are experienced in the brain. One cannot taste, touch, smell, hear, or see except through the mind. We seem to experience taste on the tongue, but it is actually the brain that registers flavour. Similarly, when some part of the body hurts, the pain is really in the mind, not in the body-part. We have two instruments for perceiving pain: the nerves and the grey matter of the brain. But we perceive only if the mind allows a connection between them. Unless the mind says there is pain, there is no pain. This is the marvellous discovery of India's great masters. Under chloroform you do not feel pain, because sensations do not reach the mind. At the nerve endings there are fine fibres through which the pain sensations are relayed to the brain. Chloroform prevents the relaying of these pain signals. The brain is the sensitive instrument of the mind, and all the sensations of the body are reported to the mind through the nerves and the brain. The mind, being identified with the brain, receives and interprets these sensations. A mind made strong by the practise of powerful and positive thinking is less affected by sensations of pleasure and pain. It recognises sensations in the way God intended—as a form of academic experience. Sensitivity was given to man only to protect the body; without sensation, one could cut himself badly and not know it. Sensitivity was never intended to cause pain. Animals have not developed this faculty to the degree that man has, hence they experience less pain. Otherwise, the cruelty practised on animals in some methods of killing would be intolerable. The lobster is put in boiling water while it is still alive!"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"EVEN-MINDEDNESS IN A WORLD OF CHANGE 339 Because pain and pleasure are created by the mind, pain in the body can be lessened by practising control of the mind. Then one can experience a sensation without its producing pain, receiving only its guiding or warning message. The Bha- gavad Gita goes very deeply into it, and that is what the Gita tells us. Oversensitivity to pleasure and pain strengthens their effects; reduced sensitivity makes one less subject to pain and less enslaved to sense pleasures. I have trained my body and mind to be less sensitive and have found myself free from sense disturbances. That training is the way to gain freedom. There was a doctor who had such mind power that he was able to perform a major operation on himself. The very thought makes the mind protest that one could not do it, because the mind has been enslaved by bodily attachments. But mind can be made powerful by training. The more you discipline your mind, the more it will be under your control. A pampered child suffers greatly over even a little hurt; a Spartan-trained child may hardly wince at serious injury. You Can Free Yourself from the Sensory Dictators In this respect the system of training given in India under great masters is entirely different from that given in Western schools. Indian masters train their students to free themselves completely from slavery to the body and its sensations. The comforts and conveniences developed in the West encourage pampering the body; as a result, little or no effort is made to cultivate mental strength. In India we are trained from child- hood to nip in the bud the dictates of sensations. In my school at Ranchi we had the children sleep on little mats on the hard floor, and they grew healthier. Westerners are conditioned to too many external necessities in order to sleep well or be at peace. In India we were taught to sit on the hot sand in medita- tion. Gradually we could sit in the heat all day long; and in the cold, likewise. As a result of this training I found such mental strength that nothing can affect or disturb my consciousness. When I disconnect my mind from the sense telephones, I am not bothered by anything. Some years ago the weather was terribly hot—extremely so. Everyone else was panting. I was getting by mental association"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"340 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST the discomfort they were feeling. I had intended to do some writing, but I was so uncomfortable I could not concentrate. Then I chided myself, \"What is the matter with you?\" And I prayed: \"Lord, the same electricity makes the heat in the oven and ice in the refrigerator. It is cool here.\" All around me the atmosphere became cool, as though a sheet of ice surrounded me. I began to feel great inspiration and wrote without any difficulty. Another time, many years ago, I was travelling across country in an open touring car. Accompanying me were several young men, all Self-Realization students, one of whom served as my secretary. He and I slept in the car, sharing one small blanket. The night was freezing cold. When I went soundly to sleep he pulled the blanket completely off me ; and when I half wakened from the cold I subconsciously pulled the blanket off him! This went on for some time. Then my mind said: \"Why are you behaving this way? It is all right. You are warm!\" I threw off the blanket and began to meditate. My body became as warm as toast. The students were shuddering with cold when they awoke two hours later and discovered me sitting there, immobile. I was in divine ecstasy. They thought I had left my body! Roused from samadhi by their exclamations, I smiled and said, \"What is all this commotion about? Let us resume our journey.\" \"But you were sitting in this bitter cold with no coat or blanket!\" they protested. Nevertheless, I did not catch cold. I was the only one who was warm! What you must do is discipline your mind to be more positive. If you make up your mind you are not going to catch cold, you will be less likely to catch one. The mind must be trained to overcome pain as well. Mental sensitivity magnifies pain. To magnify pain is to forget the indomitable image of God within you. Habits Begin to Form at Age Three The ancient sages of India taught that all habits begin to form in man at the age of three. It is very difficult to change them after they are set. If your family and environment create early prejudices in your mind, you may carry them throughout life. One of the first things I learned from my guru, Swami Sri"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"EVEN-MINDEDNESS IN A WORLD OF CHANGE 341 Yukteswarji, was to overcome mental prejudices toward sensations. At the time I first came to him for training, I in- variably caught cold if I didn't use a blanket when the weather was chilly. But Master taught me differently. As a result I became free of the cold-catching tendency I was virtually born with. Until Master's training, I had caught colds one right after the other. Some people say we should depend only on mind, and others believe we should cater to bodily sensations. Both positions are extreme. According to one theory, it is good to have a physical examination regularly to see how the body is getting along, just as one has his car checked over periodically. This is sensible enough, but remember, you are not a machine. If your mental well-being is too dependent on the condition of the body, a time will come when the mind is so enslaved by the body's demands that no amount of any kind of physical aid helps. This explains why we have chronic diseases. The phys- ical debility became chronic because the mind simply refused to be master of the body. In the beginning it is better to follow the moderate path. If you have a cut, put a little iodine on it, but don't depend wholly on medicines. Take adequate, sensible precautions until gradually you can depend more on the mind. Even great masters have used medicines, which are, after all, God-created herbs and chemicals. Medicine is not necessary to a master, but to show that God's power works in countless ways he may sometimes choose to use pharmaceutical remedies. In any event, victory lies in the power of the mind. When you know with absolute conviction that you can do without all medica- tion with no ill effect, you are victor. A certain master who had broken his arm had it treated and bandaged. When a rich man came to visit him shortly after, his worried disciples thought that the visitor, seeing their master with his arm in a sling, might become disillusioned. \"Don't pay any attention to these devotees,\" the saint remarked. \"They imagine that because you see my broken arm you will think God doesn't look after me anymore. And it is paining, too!\" Another time this same master was in ecstasy,"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"342 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST singing about God, when he fell on a small pile of hot charcoal nearby. Still he went on singing to God. When the disciples picked him up, they discovered some of the hot coals clinging to his back, burning the flesh. The devotees were alarmed, but the master laughed and said calmly, \"Well, why don't you remove them?\" He never complained of any pain. Such is the mental aboveness masters show. On this occasion the saint demonstrated that he was above pain, and on the other he showed that he was capable of human suffering and of bearing it humbly. Develop an adamant attitude toward the body. \"The ideas of heat and cold, of pleasure and pain, are produced by the con- tacts of the senses with their objects. Such ideas are limited by a beginning and an end. They are transitory; bear them with patience.\"* Why be so sensitive about a little cold or a little pain? Think of the agony of those who suffer in war. But even stronger than the patriot is the spiritual man; he develops a greater mental courage through disciplining his mind to endure, and ultimately rise above, every kind of pain and trouble. Man's Life Is Totally Independent of the Body The body is only a flesh-covered cage of bones in which the bird of life stays for a time. The life itself is totally inde- pendent of the body. But the life has become identified with the limiting conditions of the body,- hence it suffers. If you analyse body and mind you will find there is no connection between them, except what you give. Only in the daytime do you accept the sensations of the body. At night in sleep, when your mind is detached from the body, you are not aware of its sensations,- you feel a deep peace. Being made in the image of God, man can live in the body completely separate from physical sensations. But instead he adopts the conditions of the body as though they were his own. To be free of sensations, one has to separate himself mentally from the body. Therefore the saints teach mental detachment from both pleasure and pain. To understand and experience mental aboveness, one must practise it. I have proved this truth to myself, and I know how wrong it is to be sensitive. * Bhagavad Gita 11:14."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"EVEN-MINDEDNESS IN A WORLD OF CHANGE 343 Catering to sensations is the cause of all suffering and misery. God didn't intend for us to suffer; He created sensory percep- tions to guide and entertain us in the form of mental pictures. He meant for us to use the body-instrument wisely, not to become so identified with it that it makes us miserable. St. Francis called the body \"Brother Donkey.\" If one loves a pet dog with a deep attachment, he will be sensitive to his pet's sensations, even though he is not physically connected with the dog's nervous system. In the same way, our body-suffering is due to too much mental attachment to \"Brother Donkey.\" The mind must acquire greater control over the body. To be able to live by the power of mind is wonderful, because the mind can do whatever you want it to. How to start depending more on mind? Little by little habituate yourself to heat and cold, to sleeping on a hard bed, to being less dependent on accustomed comforts. While I have been speaking to you I have been utterly unconscious of the high temperature today,- but just now as I mentioned the heat, I began to feel it. Once I was lecturing in Milwaukee when the weather was extremely hot. In addition, the heat inside my body had increased greatly, as it does when I am speaking of spiritual things. My mind said, \"You cannot continue the lecture without wiping your face,- it is wet with perspiration.\" I reached into my pocket for a handkerchief, but found none. Then I looked in the spiritual eye and suggested to my mind, \"There is no heat at all.\" Immediately the feeling of oppressive heat vanished; I was calm and cool. The Right Way to Look at Death Practise these things and see if what I am saying is not true. You can increase pain by sensitiveness and lessen it by mental detachment. When a dear one dies, instead of grieving unrea- sonably, realize that he has gone on to a higher plane at the will of God, and that God knows what is best for him. Rejoice that he is free. Pray that your love and goodwill be messengers of encouragement to him on his forward path. This attitude is much more helpful. Of course, we would not be human if we did not miss loved ones; but in feeling lonesome for them we don't want selfish attachment to be the cause of keeping them"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"344 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST earthbound. Extreme sorrow prevents a departed soul from going ahead toward greater peace and freedom. Most of the people living on earth today were not here a hundred years ago. Others were here before us. And we who are now walking the streets of the world will not be here a hundred years hence. It will be all over for us, and the new generation will not give us a thought. They will feel, as we do now, that this world belongs to them; but one by one they too will all be taken away. Death must be good, otherwise God would not have ordained that it happen to everyone. Why live in fear of it? Those who are afraid of death cannot know their true soul nature. \"Cowards die many times before their death; the valiant never taste of death but once.\" * The coward lives over and over again a mental picture of pain and death. The valiant experience only the final death, quickly and without pain. If one dies of natural causes or is spiritually advanced, the body of sensations simply drops off, and when the consciousness reawakens on another plane it has all the sensations of the body without any physical form. Awareness is all mind, just as it is in dreams. This is not difficult to picture. In death one merely sloughs off his gross physical body, which is only a lower form of mind and the cause of all manner of troubles for the soul. Exude Peace and Goodness There are roughly two kinds of people: those who contin- ually lament what is wrong with the world, and those who smile away life's difficulties and remain always positive in their thinking. Why take everything so seriously? How won- derful this world would be if everyone were more positive, more harmonious! In the jungle of civilization, in the stress of modern living, lies the test. Whatever you give out will come back to you. Hate, and you will receive hate in return. When you fill your- self with inharmonious thoughts and emotions, you are destroying yourself. Why hate or be angry with anyone? Love your enemies. Why stew in the heat of anger? If you become riled, get over it at once.

Good and Evil Are Created in the Mind In the ultimate sense, everything starts in the mind. Sin is created in the mind. Little children go naked without any consciousness of sin. To the pure-minded everything is pure. To the immoral everything is evil. An undisciplined mind causes great havoc in our lives. Sense-enslaved minds are the perpetrators of all wars, cruelties, and injustices. God put you in this sensate physical form with the intention that you live in the world as an introspecting soul, enjoying the movies of creation without becoming identified with them. That is how God wants you to live: to demonstrate mind control not only when everything is rosy, but in the midst of your troubles also. Far from just talking about it, Self- Realization [Yogoda Satsanga] teaches you that self-mastery. The dance of life and death goes on all the time,- but man has the mental power to rise above all sensory experiences of change, to be unaffected by life's inconstancy. The Bhagavad Gita offers us sublime assurance of this freedom: \"The rela- tivities of existence (birth and death, pleasure and pain) have been overcome, even here in this world, by those of fixed equal-mindedness. Thereby are they enthroned in Spirit—ver- ily, the taintless, the perfectly balanced Spirit.\"* When you manifest changelessness you become a king among souls. Changeless within, even though body and mind are constantly changing, you become one with the Changeless Infinite. The teaching of the Gita is inimitable. It deals in minute detail with life as it is, and shows how man should behave under all circumstances. It is correct to say, \"I am made in the image of God\"; but having lost touch with that image you must learn how to become one with it again. The message of * Bhagavad Gita V:19."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"346 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST the Gita shows the way. Gold that has been covered with sev- eral layers of clay will still be there, though hidden. To discover it you must break through the clay. Similarly, many claylike strata of habits and sensations cover the golden soul. This \"mud\" is the cause of man's nervousness and fear—of all ungodlike qualities. To remove the \"mud\" one must develop an impervi- ous mental attitude toward the body and the senses. What fears we have about the body! I have pictured and experienced in my mind all kinds of suffering, and have overcome them. When the Soul Commands, the Mind Obeys In order to realize you are made in the image of God you must rise above fear and anger and destroy oversensitivity. Don't be finicky. Say to yourself: \"Today I sleep in a bed; to- morrow I lie on the ground, it doesn't matter. All is the same to me.\" Practise this mental neutrality, and the mind will do exactly what you tell it. The mind is extremely tricky, but if you train it, it will behave. When you say, \"I can't live without beefsteak,\" the mind echoes, \"I can't live without beefsteak.\" But if you, the soul, give the command, \"Slavery, begone!\" the mind will obey. So be not the servant of the body or the mind. Freedom from sense slavery is the only way to peace and hap- piness.

Spiritual Melancholia This disease is prevalent among those who are mentally and physically idle under the pretext of being too busy with spiritual things. These sufferers neglect the great and small duties of material life in the name of serving God, and thus invite the devil to work his mischief in them. They suffer from pessimism and lack of appreciation for all things good and beautiful in the material life. This is a contagious disease, and all spiritual aspirants must guard themselves against it by keeping their blood of energy warm and immune with constant healthful worthwhile activity. Spiritual Indigestion This results from indiscriminately swallowing a lot of men- tal patent medicines in the form of pseudo-spiritual books and lessons by quack spiritual doctors.

Worst of all, it hangs on for a long time, and the victim easily becomes reinfected even after seeming recovery. Mental Catarrh This disease consists in harbouring chronic worldly worries. Sufferers usually neglect to use their powerful weapon of will and therefore passively yield to their constant fears instead of fighting and routing them. Psychological Fixation Its victims become one-sided in the pursuit of happiness. They begin to think that money is happiness, or that fame is happiness, or health, or power. They sacrifice everything else —youth, reputation, peace of mind—on the altar of their all- consuming ambition. They learn too late that the balanced life —observing all the laws of nature and of God, and combining activity with calmness—alone can bring happiness and fulfil man's natural destiny. Sufferers from psychological fixation become wholly obsessed with some one ambition until their perspective on life is warped and distorted. One man, for instance, was very successful in his business and amassed a million dollars; but before he could use it he died of excessive worry and a nervous breakdown.

Spiritual Principles Should Be Taught Physical diseases, being tangible, painful, and repugnant, arouse our active resistance, and we seek to remedy them by exercise, diet, medicine, or some other definite method of cure. But psychological diseases, though the root cause of all human woes, are not prevented or attended to promptly and are allowed to wreck and devastate our lives. Educators, physical culturists, preachers, reformers, doctors, and lawmakers will hasten the true progress of civilization only when they themselves first learn, and then teach others, how to develop harmoniously all the factors of life and of man's nature. This is the true education and all-round human culture that all the world is seeking. Educational authorities deem it impossible to teach spiri- tual principles in public schools because they confuse them with the varied conflicting religious dogmas. But if they would concentrate on the universal principles of peace, love, service, tolerance, and faith that govern the spiritual life, and devise practical methods of growing such seeds in the fertile soil of the child's mind, then the imaginary difficulty would be dissolved.

I consider properly organized schools as gardens where infant souls are grown and nurtured. The gardeners should be well selected and given cooperation by parents and the public. We should never neglect teachers, for they are soul moulders. The care and spiritual nourishment of the early life of a human plant usually determines its later development. I sincerely praise the modern school system of America and its constantly improving methods of intellectual and, to a certain extent, physical training.

The boy who belongs intellectually to Class A, or who is a great baseball or football player, often attracts notice and is encouraged by the teacher, but very few observe or warn him rightly if he is leading a dark Class D moral or spiritual life.

Initiative is the power to create,- to create means to do something that nobody else has done; it is trying to do things in new ways, and trying to create new things. Initiative is that creative ability which is derived directly from your Creator. What have you done in your life with this divine gift? How many people really try to use their creative ability? Weeks, months, years pass, and they are always the same,- they have not changed, except in age. The man of initiative is as glorious as a shooting star—creating something from nothing, making the impossible possible by the great inventive power of the Spirit. Don't Be a One-Horsepower Person There are three kinds of people with initiative—the extraordinary class, the medium class, and the common class,- and there are hundreds of others huddled together in a \"no man's land\" of nonentity. Ask yourself this question: \"Have I ever tried to do anything that nobody else has done?\" That is the starting point in the application of initiative. If you haven't thought that far, you are like hundreds of others who erroneously think they have no power to act differently than they do. They are like sleepwalkers,- the suggestions coming from their subconscious mind have given them the conscious- ness of one-horsepower people. If you have been going through life in this somnambulistic state, you must wake yourself by affirming: \"I have man's greatest quality—initiative. Every hu- man being has some spark of power by which he can create something that has not been created before. Yet I see how easily I could be deluded with the mortal consciousness of limitation that pervades the world, if I allowed myself to be hypnotized by environment!\" But if you say: \"Every avenue of activity is already overcrowded; why try at all?\" you are allowing yourself to be hypnotized by a frustrating worldly consciousness. That is why in every walk of life so many men, lacking initiative, remain unsuccessful."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"INCREASING THE POWER OF INITIATIVE 355 On the spiritual side, also, many people passively follow the same path throughout life. Even though unsatisfied, they unthinkingly remain in the denomination to which their fam- ilies belong. Or perhaps they were born Baptists, but a change of residence places them near a Congregational Church, so they become Congregationalists. Man ought to adapt himself conscientiously, according to his inner dictates, to all life's experiences. He should not act blindly. My guru, Sri Yukteswarji, used to say, \"Remember this: if you have within you that faith which is truly divine, and if there is something you desire that is not in the universe, it shall be created for you.\" I had that indomitable belief in an inner strength, in the spiritual strength of my will, and I always found that some new opportunities were created to give me the things I wanted. The power of initiative within you remains undeveloped, unformed, unexploited, unused. That power is native to the soul; it has actually been given to all of you, but you have not used it. How can you acquire initiative? If you have not devel- oped the power to think creatively for yourself, or the initiative to make your own way, your first attempt should be to try to improve on what someone else has done. The effort to make improvements on the inventions of others is the most common form of initiative. The second or medium quality of initiative is shown by people who write or invent something new, but of no particular significance. The best or most extraordinary quality of initiative is that which makes you stand out before the world in a blazing flame, like a Burbank or an Edison. Those were men of invincible ini- tiative, spiritual initiative. Was God partial to these great men, that they possessed this particular greatness? Were they chosen by Divine Will to take so much glory? No. They simply used their initiative to bring forth the greatness and the glory that is every man's birthright as an immortal child of God. Those who look for personal glory are never great; inflated with pride, they lack any real support from God. Those who enjoy giving— whether it be strength, courage, music, art—are great men."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"356 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST Most people who have become great have been subcon- sciously guided: they had a tinge of greatness in their heredity that gave them an initial advantage. They used that hereditary advantage in their life to become extraordinary, to become outstanding. If you have a quality of greatness, you have been unconsciously led by forces of mind whose power enabled you to change your environment by reincarnating, and in that new environment to bring forth the greatest flowering of your initiative. In this sense, great men are \"born.\" You Must Discover the Power You Have But I know that great men can also be made, or developed from seemingly nothing. There is a way to become great, to acquire this extraordinary power of initiative. By wisdom, by right training, and by practice of the Self Realization [Yogoda Satsanga] teachings you can develop that power of initiative and bring it into full play. The ones who made the struggle long ago are the ones who now see the fruition of their activities. You must discover the power you have; you must strive to overcome apparent impossibilities. You must be prepared to withstand the critical opinion of the world in order to succeed in a great way in any vocation. You must stay away from one-horsepower people in order to be original—to think differently, to speak a little differently. And be untiring in your zeal. The man of extraordinary initiative swallows up all difficulties, believing in his heart that he is right. With unflinching steadiness march on your path, realiz- ing that behind you is the infinite Creative Power. You must first get yourself into conscious contact with that Infinite Power. It is the Source of all initiative, and when you contact that superconscious Power, your conscious and sub- conscious minds also become filled with power.

I know now that within myself is that great infinite Principle, which is the Source of all art, all music, all knowledge. If That is behind me, I cannot fail.

Show dauntless determination in everything you do. Most people are content to feed themselves on dead quo- tations, to go on collecting the ideas of others, without ever showing the individuality that is within themselves. What is distinctive about you? Where is the great uniqueness of God's power in you? You have not been using it. The Lord's Infinite Power Sustains You I was reluctant, at first, to become a teacher—the implica- tions frightened me. A teacher has to be a shock-absorber; the minute he becomes disturbed, he cannot help those who seek his aid. A true teacher has to love everybody; he has to under- stand humanity, and to know God. But when Sri Yukteswarji told me that my role in this life was to be that of a teacher, I called on the Lord's infinite power to sustain me. When I started to give lectures, I made up my mind that I would speak not by book learning but by inner inspiration, holding the thought that behind my speech was the inexhaustible Creative Power. I have also utilized that Power in other directions, to help people in business and in many different ways. I have used mortal mind to reflect Immortality. I did not say: \"Father, do it,\" but \"I want to do it, Father. You must guide me; You must inspire me ; You must lead me.\" Do little things in an extraordinary way,- be the best one in your line. You must not let your life run in the ordinary way; do something that nobody else has done, something that will dazzle the world. Show that God's creative principle works in you. Never mind the past. Though your errors be as deep as the ocean, the soul itself cannot be swallowed up by them. Have unflinching determination to move on your path unhampered by limiting thoughts of past errors.

Your family may forsake you; good fortune may seemingly desert you; all the forces of man and nature may be arrayed against you; but by the quality of divine initia- tive within you, you can defeat every invasion of fate created by your own past wrong actions, and march victorious into par- adise. Though you be defeated a hundred times, be determined that you are nonetheless going to conquer. Defeat is not meant to last for an eternity. Defeat is a temporary test for you. Nat- urally God wants to make you invincible, to have you bring into play the almighty power that is within you, so that on the stage of life you can fulfill your high destined role. God Meant the World for Our Entertainment How are you going to find out what role suits you? If we all want to be kings, who will be the servants? On the stage the parts of a king and of a servant are equally important if the roles are played well. You must remember that this is why we are sent into this world with differences, with desires for vari- ous vocations. God meant the world to be a play, a huge spec- tacle for our entertainment. But we forget the Stage Manager's plan and want to play our part as we see fit, and not as He desires. You fail on the stage of life because you are trying to act a part different from the one divinely designed for you.

Circa 1949 The enigmas of God's creation, and of how He Himself came into being, almighty and powerful, have been pondered in every heart that yearns to know about God. No scripture has fully elucidates these seemingly unanswerable questions. But If you contemplate and try to feel the entire perception of the subject as I shall describe it, you will find the answers to these questions—answers that I received from the very depths of my soul and from God. The Infinite, God, is the ultimate cause of all finite cre- ation. He projects the power of maya, the storm of delusive rel- ativity —the illusion that the One has become the many— which, blowing over the ocean of His Being and His vibratory wish to create, stirs into manifestation the waves of finite cre- ation. \"Unborn though I am,of changeless Essence! yet be- coming Lord of all creation, abiding in My own Cosmic Nature (Prakriti), I embody Myself by Self-evolved maya-delusion.\"* Manifesting Himself as the creative Cosmic Intelligent Vi- bration, and using the help of the storm of delusive relativity, God forms out of Himself all finite vibratory waves of mind, energy, and matter: electrons, protons, atoms, molecules, cells, and blocks of solid matter—clusters of island universes float- ing in the sphere of space, surrounded by wandering radiations. Thus Intelligent Cosmic Vibration is the first manifested cause of all created things, though the different finite forms of matter are created or caused secondarily by arrangement and combinations of certain basic forms: cells derive from mole- cules, molecules from atoms, atoms from electrons and * Bhagavad Gita IV:6. 360"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"WHO MADE GODF 361 protons, electrons and protons from lifetrons, and lifetrons from thoughtrons * of the Infinite. Creation exists, and is caused by God; therefore God ex- ists. We can say that intelligent creation exists because of an intelligent God. But who created God, out of whom all things else have come? The Infinite Himself.t The law of causation applies only to finite objects; it does not apply to the Infinite. As all waves on the ocean become dissolved in the ocean, so all finite objects manifesting from the aforesaid finite causes lose themselves in their Eternal Source. Similarly, the law of cau- sation operates outwardly in creation, but is lost in the Infinite. Through the law of causation, our original parents—the finite creations known as Adam and Eve, who themselves were special creations of the Infinite—helped to create all human- ity. Because we are created by our parents—and our parents by our grandparents, and all mankind has come from Adam and Eve—we ask who created God. We apply to the Infinite the law of causation that created us. This is erroneous reasoning. Varying Perspectives When you are dancing with the waves of the ocean, you can't get a perspective of the ocean as a whole,- but from the air you have a bird's-eye view of its vast expanse. Similarly, when you concentrate on creation and are immersed in it, you can- not see anything but creation and the law of causation work- ing therein. But when with closed eyes you learn how to look within, you see neither finite forms nor the law that created them, but glimpse the formless, causeless Infinite. * The name given by Paramahansa Yogananda to the first and most subtle manifestation of the creative vibration emanating from Spirit; the primal ideas behind all matter.

Spirit Is Free from Causation So it is foolish error for finite, causation-born human beings even to question, \"Who made God?\" The Infinite made the law of causation that created all finite things, though the Infinite Itself exists without having been caused. As an absolute monarch may make all the laws in his kingdom with- out being bound by them, so the King of the Universe makes all the laws in His kingdom, including the law of causation that governs His finite creation,- but He is not subject to His laws. \"I, the Unmanifested, pervade the whole universe. All creatures abide in Me, but I do not abide in them.\"* Though present in all things, God is in no way bound by finitude. Therefore the Infinite is. We deduce His existence and omnipotence from his powerful manifestations in creation. His power is fully active in the manifested state. And during cosmic dissolution, all power, cosmic intelligence, and the law of causation become inactive and dissolve into the Absolute, there to await the next cycle of God's creative manifestation.

That sphere beyond manifestation is the hiding place of Spirit. The Infinite, beyond the categories of vibratory intelli- gence, energy, space, and time, is thus a thing in Itself. It can be felt and known as the eternal power that exists without a beginning or end. Creation is caused by God, but God simply is. No one, nothing made God—He has been and will be what He is forever and forever. \"O Arjuna! there is nothing higher than Me, or beyond Me.

Likewise the physical body of, let us say, Henry Jones, manifests weight, form, dimension, and visibility,- the thought of Henry Jones has none of these qualities of matter. Yet a powerful mind, versed in the art of visualization, can in a hallucination or a consciously produced dream see Henry Jones, shake hands with him, weigh him on a scale, and see that he is tall and slight. A visualization, hallucination, or even a dream representation of the body of Henry Jones is more real than the mere thought concept of his body, because dream objects are apperceived by the senses of touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing.* What then is the difference between a thought of Henry Jones; a visualization, hallucination, or dream perception of Henry Jones's body; and his living physical body?

Thus men of divine understanding, who have experienced the truth about the nature of God and man, are sometimes wrongly accused of illusions and hallucinations by those who are yet in thrall to cosmic delusion. It is not right for those under maya to decry the testimony of one who is not. Only he who has transcended cosmic delusion through his own inner realization may correctly judge the truth.

In this case, the peo- ple who are under the cosmic delusive influence created by God would think, \"That person is suffering from illusion,\" even though they themselves are victims of the cosmic delu- sion by which they see the metaphysically untrue, but mun- danely true body of Henry Jones. So, if everything in creation consists of dream pictures in the consciousness'of man, then all is delusion, and the mental picture or hallucination of one person, based on the reality of the physical body of Henry Jones in this cosmic dream-world, is delusion within delusion, or illusion. The wise man who awakens from the influence of the cosmic dream perceives the physical body of Henry Jones and all matter as delusive cosmic dream, and the mental concept of matter or Henry Jones as a delusive dream within God's cosmic dream. A mental error or illusion in one person can be corrected by others who do not participate in the error,- but an error shared by all cannot be corrected by any except those who have attained Self-realization, and who thereby know the truth that \"things are not always what they seem\"* to the senses.

How did this motion originate from the Cosmic Intel- ligence? All the vibrations in the ether are manifestations of the Intelligence-guided cosmic energy.

Likewise the microcosm, or body of man, came into being first as a vibratory thought-form, the causal body. This in turn produced the grosser vibrations that make up the astral or energy body of man, which produces the still grosser vibrations that structure the solid physical body.

So the one block of ice can be changed from a visible, cold, solid mass to invisible, intangible gases with the same weight. The process may be reversed, and the gases recondensed into liquid and frozen into the vanished block of ice. Similarly, the solid human body can be reduced to liquids and evaporated into invisible gases; but man has not yet learned how to bring it back in its original form.

In the mother aspect of wom- anhood there is purity. Woman was given the motherly instinct to save man from the pitfall of evil. That is her primary pur- pose; she was not created as an object of lust. Nothing is more sacred than the unconditional sympathy of woman toward man. A stern, dignified court judge is but a child to the wife in his home. Every woman should feel love for all the world if she would manifest the Divine Mother's love. To inspire mankind with mother love is to bestow the greatest blessing a woman possesses. God Is Both Father and Mother In creating this universe God revealed two aspects: the masculine or fatherly, and the feminine or motherly. If you close your eyes and visualize vast, illimitable space, you be- come overwhelmed and enthralled—you feel naught but pure wisdom. That hidden, infinite sphere wherein there is no cre- ation, no stars or planets—only pure wisdom—is the Father. And Nature with her diamond-dazzling stars, the Milky Way, the flowers, birds, clouds, mountains, sky—the countless beauties of creation—is the Divine Mother. In Nature you behold the mother aspect of God, full of beauty, gentleness, tenderness, and kindness.* The beauty in the world bespeaks the creative motherly instinct of God, and when we look upon * In this context, Paramahansa Yogananda is emphasizing what we have come to regard as true \"motherly\" qualities, the gentle and loving responses we find in a mother's nature. On other occasions, Paramahansaji has also pointed out that form and qualities presuppose manifestation, and manifestation presup- poses relativity. Mother Nature must also enforce the inherent and inexorable cosmic laws of the universe. Break those laws, and Divine Justice dispenses its corrective punishment; hence the fierce demonstrations we sometimes behold in nature. These are results of man's own wrongdoing, which throws the cosmic harmony out of order. (See karma in glossary.) But the consistent beauty of Divine Mother is that if the devotee appeals to Her unconditional love, She may be persuaded to assuage the retaliatory power of those laws. Thus in Hinduism, Divine Mother is sometimes depicted as Kali; her four arms symbolize cardinal attributes, two beneficent and two destructive—the essential duality of Mother Nature.

So God is both Father and Mother. The Christian and Hindu scriptures describe God as triune: Father, Son, Holy Ghost— Sat, Tat, Aum. The Father is the wisdom aspect of God; Holy Ghost, the mother aspect; the Son is cosmic cre- ation—the emblem or principle through which the father and mother aspects of God express their divine love. We are the children of that love. \"As above, so below\"—in the human family we see in miniature the greater family of the Holy Trinity: God the Father represented in the human father; Holy Ghost or Nature manifested in the mother; the Son symbol- ized in the child, expression of the love of both father and mother. Jesus spoke of God as Father. Some saints speak of Him as Mother. In His transcendental aspect, God is neither Father nor Mother,- but when we think of Him in terms of human rela- tionship, He may become for us either Father or Mother. God is both infinite wisdom and infinite feeling. When He mani- fested Himself in creation, God gave His wisdom a form in the father; and He gave His feeling a form in the mother. Each, alone, is imperfect, only half of God's nature, because the father moves and is moved by reason, whereas the mother moves and is moved by feeling. The father wants to govern the child by reason,- the mother, by feeling. The mother says, \"Teach him by love.\" Sometimes a great deal of love is good; but if you give too much sweetness, and that only, you may spoil the child. Sometimes a little strictness is good, but severe punishment for errors only drives a child to greater error. This is why the two aspects of God must be man- ifested through the parents in the upbringing of the child; both are necessary for its ultimate welfare. Every father should strive to temper his reason with love, and every mother to tem- per her love with reason. When I think of my guru, Sri Yukteswarji, I see in him the sternness of a father and the kindness of a mother, without the weakness or blindness of either. Every father and every mother is potentially endowed with both the fatherly wisdom and the motherly tenderness of God. They have to perfect"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"374 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST these endowments. Parents so easily become blind to the faults in their offspring! If you can't see your child's faults, there is something wrong with you love. Parents should learn to love their children unconditionally, without allowing love to blind them to errors in a child's action or thinking. They should love their child in spite of any misdeed, but should not support him in his error. Help you children to extricate them- selves from the pitfalls of evil, rather then drive them farther down by supporting them in their wrongdoing. They won't return any love to you for that misguided indulgent love. Pure Reason and Pure Feeling Are Intuitive Pure reason and pure feeling both have intuitive qualities. Pure feeling sees as clearly as pure reason. Most women have a keenly developed intuition. Only when they become unduly excited do they lose their intuitive powers. Pure reason is also intuitive, if this power is sufficiently developed. Otherwise, should the premise be wrong, the conclusion will be wrong also. Sooner or later, every man who reasons clearly will develop true intuition, which never errs. A jealous, hateful, angry woman will see these qualities reflected in others. If she continually harbours such destructive emotions, she will lose, alas, her intuitive gifts. For this reason every woman should strive to be less emotional and to keep herself free from wrong emotions. She will then develop that intuitive mother-aspect of God. My mother had great intuition because she was entirely free from jealousy, hate, and anger. God never forsakes anyone. When, having sinned, you believe your guilt to be measureless, beyond redemption; and when the world declares you of no account and says you will never amount to anything, stop a moment to think of the Divine Mother. Say to Her, \"Divine Mother, I am Your child, Your naughty child. Please forgive me.\" When you appeal to the mother aspect of God there is no retort—you simply melt the Divine Heart. But God will not support you if you continue to do wrong. You must forsake your evil actions as you pray. Confession embodies a sound principle.

But if you violate nature with wrong practices time after time, you will never remain healed. I know a boy who always boasts, \"I can do anything I please, for I will be forgiven next week when I confess.\" This is the wrong view. If you don't forsake the evil as well as confess it, you will not be forgiven. The divine man develops both the fatherly and motherly qualities in himself. He can feel toward anyone the same love a mother has for her children. These were the feelings of Jesus when on the cross he said: \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\" How could he know such love for those who were crucifying him? He had developed both the fatherly and the motherly aspects of God. To Jesus the men nailing him on the cross were not enemies with javelins and spears,- they were his children who didn't understand him. Who but a mother could think of them as Jesus did? A mother whose son is torturing her is afraid only of what may happen to him. This is what Jesus understood; this is how he could say, \"Father, forgive them.\" If you develop the motherly aspect of God, you will feel love for all the people of the world. And if you appeal to God as the Divine Mother, She quickly gives in, for you have appealed to Her tenderness and unconditional love. When you worship God as the Mother, you can stand and face Her and say, \"Di- vine Mother, naughty or good, I am Thy child. I may have been in the clutches of evil for many incarnations, but do I have to make full recompense according to Thy law? I cannot wait so long a time to enter Your presence! Mother, please, forgive me! Why must You exact punishment of me? What is done is done. It is all past. I am not going to sin again.\" The Divine Mother may reply: \"You are naughty; go away from Me.\" But you must say, \"You are my Divine Mother. You have to forgive me.\" Then She says: \"Ask of Me salvation,-1 will give you salvation. Ask of Me wisdom, and I will give you wisdom. But do not ask of Me My love, for when you take that away I have nothing.\"* If you continue to cry, \"I want Your love!\" the Divine Mother * From an old Bengali song.

He invited me to sit down, adding: \"I am talking to my Divine Mother.\" His whole countenance shone with the reflection of Her love, and I could feel the intense vibrations of that great love. Whenever I was in his presence while he was communing with the Cosmic Mother, the love I experienced in my heart was a thousand million times more than that I felt for my earthly mother, whom I so dearly loved; at such times I thought I could not exist another moment without my Divine Mother. \"How is it that you can commune with the Beloved Mother and I cannot?\" I said to him one day. \"Please ask Her if She loves me. I must know!\" Insistently I pleaded until finally the saint agreed. \"I will make your plea to the Beloved.\" That same night in meditation I had a great divine experi- ence: Seeking the seclusion of my small attic room as soon as I arrived home, I meditated until ten o'clock. Suddenly the darkness was lit with a beauteous vision. The Divine Mother stood before me, tenderly smiling. \"Always have I loved thee! Ever shall I love thee!\" With these words She disappeared. It was barely sunup the next morning when I hurried to the saint's home. I saw by his eyes that he was wandering in the gardens of the Infinite; such love of God is rarely seen. \"Did the Beloved Mother say anything about me?\" I asked. \"Mischievous little sir!\" \"What did Divine Mother say? You promised to tell me,\" I chided.

I prostrated myself at the saint's feet; I knew the Divine Mother was walking in them. He it was who gave me the revelation and the understanding of the mother aspect of God. He told me that later my guru would come to me, one who would be endowed with the wisdom aspect of God: \"Through his guidance, your experience of the Divine in terms of love and devotion shall be translated into his terms of fathomless wisdom.\" A Test of Faith I will tell you a little story about Divine Mother and an experience I had with Her. On the grounds of Self-Realization Fellowship headquarters there is a small wishing well of cast concrete. Shortly after its purchase I was helping the boys to move it into place. The well accidentally slipped and fell with all its terrific weight on my foot. There was terrible pain and much swelling in the foot, which seemed completely mashed. I was carried to my room. My friends wanted to call a doctor. \"If Divine Mother tells me to see a doctor,\" I said, \"I will go to one. If She does not, I won't go.\" I waited, hoping to feel inwardly what Her wish might be. Day by day the pain in my leg became almost unbearable; there was no sign from Divine Mother. The following Sunday I had a large class to teach. It seemed that I would have to be carried to the platform. I could not get my foot into a shoe. Satan tempted me that Sunday, saying, \"Why don't you pray to be healed?\" but to pray would have been to doubt. Divine Mother knew my plight, and I was willing to abide by Her wish. \"I am not going to pray,\" I said. \"The Mother knows what is wrong with me.\" Inwardly I vowed my unconditional"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"378 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST surrender to Her: \"Whether sunk beneath the wave of death or moving on the oceanic waves of life, I am with Thee evermore.\" \"Look at these people,\" Satan spoken again. \"They will all laugh at you. They have never seen you sick before, and now they will see you with an injured foot.\" \"I don't care.\" Once you have Divine Mother's love, nei- ther praise not blame can touch you. I was limping along toward the platform where I was to speak, when inadvertently I slipped on the threshold; my in- jured foot was badly twisted. So great was the pain, I felt as if every bone in it had splintered. But the moment I stepped for- ward again the terrible swelling collapsed suddenly, all pain gone; I was able to slip my foot into a shoe. That was one of the greatest demonstrations of the power of love that I have ever experienced. I walked as if nothing had ever been wrong with my foot. Needless to say, I was thrilled —not because of the healing, but because of the Divine Pres- ence. She wanted to see if I would pray for a healing. Had I prayed, perhaps in due course of time the injured foot would have had a natural recovery; but I would not have had that all- assuring divine experience. Another time, in Palm Springs, I was singing to the Divine Mother: \"Mother, I give You my soul call. You can't remain hidden anymore! Come out of the silent sky, come out of my cave of silence.\"* Suddenly She appeared! I saw Her in the stones, the palms, everywhere! God has no form, but to please a devotee He can take any form that devotee desires. You have no idea how wonderful the Divine Mother is ; how great She is; how loving She is!

The souls of all creatures, through unconscious recol- lection of their divine origin, tend naturally to seek their Source. This accounts for the upward evolution of everything in the universe. But, in conformance with God's plan for cre- ation, it is only upon attaining a human body, with its superior brain and nervous system, that each soul is at last endowed with the means to remember consciously its original oneness with Spirit. Memory is that power by which we mentally reproduce our experiences. If it were not for memory we would forget all our perceptions of life; we would have to start afresh, like infants, every day. A person who has \"lost\" his mind, and hence his memory, behaves like a child. There is no value in having experiences if we cannot recall and relive them. We learn by introspection and by analysing our past behaviour. In man's memory lies the value of being a human creature. John remembers that he is John each morn- ing upon awakening; and it is through memory that he associ- ates his life experiences with his identity as John. Whenever we wish it or need it, any experience that we have had can be reproduced by the subconscious mental fac- ulty. By remembering what we have done before, we can per- form again some skillful action that we have learned, or reason out which actions to repeat or avoid in a particular situation. * This talk was one of a series of outdoor Summer School classes that Parama- hansaji conducted at the headquarters on Mt. Washington. He taught under a large pepper tree that he called \"The Temple of Leaves.\" 380"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"THE ART OF DEVELOPING MEMORY 381 The subconscious mind is always active, recording experi- ences during the daytime and working even in sleep, looking after the bodily house like a night watchman. Upon waking, one always knows whether he has had a good or a bad sleep. That memory power of the subconscious mind is a faculty of the ever-awake, ever-joyous Lord. Implanted in each soul is the memory seed of that consciousness, for the soul knows itself to be ever living in God. Memory is the seed of immortality by whose cultivation we may recall all the events of this life and of our past lives. Develop Divine Memory If we can remember all our experiences as mortal beings in this life, why is it that we do not recollect all the divine expe- riences that have happened in the soul? Memory has two natures: mortal memory reproduces the experiences of this life, and divine memory reproduces the experiences of the soul throughout all its incarnations. Most people are aware only of mortal memory. Why is our divine memory asleep? Some people are able to recall many experiences, both mortal and divine,- others cannot well remember even their recent past. Memory has different grades in different people according to brain capacity. Education, concentration, meditation, and various memorable experiences are required to develop a good memory. Without developing memory one cannot become a well-educated person. If one has an experience and subsequently forgets it, all values of that experience are lost to the conscious mind. By improving the quality of memory, we can make it pow- erful enough to remember all things, even our divine origin. By awakening the divine memory, whereby we can recall every experience of all our past lives and ultimately realize our immortal soul nature, salvation is attained.

He has begun to devise mechanical and other types of indoor equipment to help him exercise his body. x When one performs physical exercises, it is necessary to concentrate the mind on the activity in order to reap the fullest benefit. It is not just the flexing of muscles, but the inner power of concentration to awaken and redirect the life force that gives the body strength. Foods That Increase Memory Power There are certain foods that are brain foods,- and there are muscle foods, nerve foods, and foods that help to build up and maintain the different body organs. As an aid in developing memory we should eat foods that increase brain power. Pro- teins are helpful in developing memory. Ground-up pecans and almonds, mixed with a few drops of lime or orange juice and taken before bedtime, will improve one's brain power, yogis say,- milk and cheese also are good brain foods. Yogis suggest that, at times of worry or strain, one should drink the juice of one or two limes in a glass of water, rinse the head with cold water, and apply cold water on the temples, between the eyebrows, and at the nostrils and ears. The nerve processes are calmed immediately, the mind becomes more peaceful, and good memory returns. Avoid eating too many fatty foods, which tend to cause fatty deposits to build up in the blood vessels on the surface of the brain. The Hindus say that pork and beef are injurious to man's health; these two meats contain much uric acid. The pig and cow have poor memories. By eating their flesh, man may develop their physical and mental traits. Practise Exercising Memory Memory can be developed by exercising it. It is incorrect to say that a man who was born a physical weakling can never become strong.

But it has been proved that many mental deficiencies may be overcome by the practice of concentration exercises. There has been little research in this direction in the West; hence many psychologists are unacquainted with the art of deep concentration, which has been taught for centuries by India's great yogis. The correct methods for developing concentration are unknown to most people. The mental faculties are there, but they are not developed. Failure to develop one's mental capacities eventually leads to serious trouble. The brain, like the physical body, requires right exercise for health. To develop a good memory, therefore, one should not only exercise the body and eat health-building food, but should also engage in mental discipline. Make an effort to remember things. Practise the art of visualization: look at a certain object or at scenery and then try to reproduce that picture in your mind. Trying to recall the strains of songs and chants, and singing them mentally, develops memory. Anything that is done with feeling, or that rouses feeling, develops memory. Both poetry and music have emotional values. All of us re- member easily the greatest sorrows and the greatest joys of our lives. Why? Because those experiences were felt deeply. Any- thing that one strongly feels develops one's power of memory. Writing poetry, and adding and subtracting mentally are also good methods for developing memory and concentration. Meditation Strengthens Memory To increase one's power of memory, one should do every- thing with deep attention. Most people carry on their activities absentmindedly,- there is a great gulf between their actions and their thoughts. That is why they cannot remember anything very well. What one wants to recall he should perform with great attention. One should not be fussy, but whatever he undertakes should be done with his whole mind. In church one should listen to the sermon with keen attention. Work at tasks in the home with attention and interest. Keeping the conscious mind on the task at hand does not prevent one from reflecting constantly on God in the background of his mind. But when"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"384 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST one meditates, he should think only of God. The power of memory is strengthened by meditation. What is meditation? Becoming one with the soul. It means banishing the consciousness of being related to the body and to human limitations, and trying to remember that one is a soul. When man begins by conscious mental effort to relate himself to the immortal soul, rather than to the body that he inhabits for one life only, he will recall more of his past-life experiences, and will eventually remember that he has come down from the bosom of God. In Him lies the memory of all the experiences of one's life and of all lives. When man communes with his soul within, the forgotten times and powers of the deathless Self will come back into his consciousness. Meditation means to remember that one is not a mortal body but an immortal soul, one with God. During the daytime we tend to think of ourselves as human beings, but at nighttime in deep dreamless sleep we forget our mortal attitude. In meditation we can try con- sciously to forget our mortal identification; we can abandon the consciousness of the body and remember we are Spirit. Those who persevere in this practice will become masters. Remember Good Experiences Memory was given to man to reproduce good. To abuse the power of memory is harmful. To think hatefully of another per- son because of some remembered injury he inflicted on you is a misuse of memory. However, to recall unhappy experiences in order to learn the lessons inherent in them is a proper use of memory, as then one may analyse his past behaviour and avoid repeating in future the wrong acts that brought painful results. One should not bring back any wrong thought and relive it; for then it will stay longer in the mind. Memory was given to us to keep alive only life's good experiences and lessons. Get rid of wrong past thoughts by avoiding recalling them. If they come to mind in spite of you, refuse to entertain them. Let me repeat: to remember bad experiences and dwell upon them is an abuse of God's gift to us of memory. Rather one should vow, \"I shall use memory only to recall good thoughts and experiences.

A child pictures success as having all kinds of playthings, and perhaps a toy car to ride in. A poor child thinks how happy he would be if only he had a lot of toys. A wealthy child, on the other hand, may be bored with his playthings; he has a rest- lessness in his soul. In time it may become very difficult to please the child of the rich, for he already has so many posses- sions. When we are older, we laugh at the desires of our child- hood; and who knows but that whatever we are wishing for now, thinking it will bring the fulfilment of our life's dream, will one day have little significance for us? I found this to be so. I didn't want to become drunk with emotions, heedlessly bent on the follies I saw others pursuing, and I looked farther on. If we gaze a little ahead we can see for ourselves that most of the things we think we want are not going to make us really happy. Success is necessary in order to possess the essentials of life: food, clothing, shelter, and health. If you don't have these to at least a certain degree, you are in a wretched position. You should be able to attain the minimum amount of comfort and happiness that you are seeking. Whether one is a spiritual or a material idealist, all persons can agree that there are a few ba- sic physical needs that must be met so that man can preserve his bodily temple. Unless he maintains this temple, he cannot succeed in anything else. Happiness Is a Creation of Our Own Mind But what is real success? If you attained everything you wanted in this life, you would eventually become disillusioned anyway. By analysing I saw for myself that the only pleasure I had in anything was that which my mind gave to it. If I with- drew my attention, enjoyment of any object vanished. Thus I saw that pleasure is internal, a concept of one's own mind. The beauty of your most valued possession, which you may be holding in front of your eyes, disappears when your thoughts are absent from it. Only when you put your mind on it do you perceive its loveliness. Therefore it is reasonable to say that within us, and not outside us, lies most of the happiness we are seeking."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"388 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST We can magnify our happiness or minimize it. One person has a little home and says, \"I enjoy it more than a palace.\" Someone else has a palace in which he does not take as much pleasure as the other person has in his unpretentious cottage. The secret of success and happiness is inside you. If you have found success and prosperity outside, but not inside, you are not truly successful. A millionaire who is not happy is not successful. I don't mean that if you have a million dollars you cannot be a success. Whether you are rich or poor, if you get happiness out of life you are a real success. Pleasure that lasts only for a moment and leaves you with regret afterward is not happiness. In true success, even though the first excitement of delight in some accomplishment fades away, the gratifying memory of fulfilment remains. All the good things that you have done in your life stay on in your memory as a joy forever. They are the real success that you have attained. To Be Happy Under All Circumstances Is Real Success Success is not a simple matter; it cannot be determined merely by the amount of money and material possessions you have. The meaning of success goes far deeper. It can only be measured by the extent to which your inner peace and mental control enable you to be happy under all circumstances. That is real success. When you can look within and your conscience is clear, your reason unprejudiced, your will firm yet flexible, and your discrimination strong; and when you are able to obtain at will the things you need and the things you consider worthwhile, you are a success. As a child you could be happy with little things, but now you tend to think you have to own several homes and cars, even though you can see that those who have them are not invariably happy.

Evolutionary Human Progress Lies in the Power of Thought As a human being, you make your greatest evolutionary progress by the power of thought. Set aside some time each day to improve your mind. It is more commendable to read awhile than to occupy yourself day and night with housework or with noncreative activities. Plan your life so that you do not live in a haphazard way; but if your tendency is to overorganize your time, get away from that extreme also. Balance is necessary in every avenue of life. Instead of using your mind only to plan your everyday work and other passing activities, or with idle mind letting your time slip away, employ it some of the time in constructive reading. Have at hand some worthwhile read- ing material, and peruse it during free moments. It is more effective to have a variety of literature—a bit of science, a bit of history, philosophy, biography, travel—anything that will expand and inspire your mind. Books can be dear friends, and if your selections are choice ones you will experience much benefit from them. It may seem very hard at first when you read Emerson or Milton or Plato, or some of the great saints, but after a while you will find your- self thinking about what they have written. You will feel you have gained something, because all those sages received their wisdom from the infinite treasure-house of God—ideas that otherwise might not occur to you in a lifetime. However, many people read constantly and yet cannot tell you what they have read. The best way to read a book is to in- trospect about it. See how it applies to your own life. And learn to discriminate. Do not accept blindly everything that you read; it should meet the tests of your mind. To be worthwhile, books should cause you to think. If they do that, you will find that your mind is developing."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"390 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST Receive Knowledge Directly from Spirit People who do not read or meditate, who live only exter- nally, do not develop any deep understanding. Meditation keeps you directly in tune with the Power that evokes all thought. To touch that Supreme Power is meditation. As a human being you do injustice to yourself if you don't read; but to meditate is still better. I would like to read, but I can scarcely finish two pages before I am called to attend to some- thing else, so I have given up reading. I find it more profitable to meditate. As I go deep within, radiant lights appear and great joy comes, joy that remains with me all day long. Such is my experience. Such is the experience of all who commune with the ever blissful Lord. Don't waste your time. God wants you to be a balanced individual. If you allow your life to become unbalanced you will be punished by the cosmic law. Live simply, have daily physical exercise, study rewarding books, and cultivate the habit of daily meditation. If you meditate you will find much more happiness than you have ever known. All knowledge will be given to you from within. My life has been that way. I have not read twenty books since I came to America twenty years ago. I am not proud of the fact; I would have been wholly ignorant if I hadn't had, through meditation, the consciousness of Spirit. When I look at a book I see that whatever truth it contains has already been given to me from God. All thought and truth come from Spirit; if you commune with Him you receive His wisdom direct. So, read good books rather than waste time on unproductive activities,- but better still, meditate and anchor your mind on the ultimate Truth, which is God. Man's Evolution Ordained by Cosmic Law In different ages and places, man has developed, by his thought processes, various ideas about life and the soul. For instance, when members of some primitive tribes have headaches, they think their soul is lost, and they appeal to the medicine man for healing. He goes out in the woods looking for the lost soul, which he brings back in a box. Then he \"re- places\" the \"soul\" in the patient's head, and the headache is"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"391 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST supposed to go away. It is the custom in another culture, when anyone is sick, to put fishhooks into his flesh so that if he hap- pens to sneeze, his soul will not escape but will be caught by the hooks. As through the process of faulty thought some people have arrived at erroneous conclusions about the soul, so by true reasoning others have come to a more profound understanding. We know that the soul is not a puff of breath, because there are persons who have lived long in the suspended-animation state without breathing at all, showing that the soul cannot be bound by breath. * The soul is something beyond breath or any other physical condition. Whether or not one believes in himself as a soul, he is bound by the cosmic law to develop, consciously or uncon- sciously, his deeper nature. Whatever a person's occupation in life, his consciousness is evolving whenever he is planning something or otherwise using his intelligence creatively. Man evolves through every constructive action he performs. The trouble with most people is that when they are per- forming an action they are thinking about something else. They don't know how to concentrate on what they are doing when they are doing it. You should learn to think of one thing at a time with all the power of your mind. Your whole atten- tion should be there. Don't drag along. Doing things in a lack- adaisical way leads to failure and misery. Man should not be a psychological automaton, like the animal, which acts only through instinct. To be unthinking is a great sin against Spirit, which abides in you ; we are meant to be conscious of what we do. We should reflect before we act. We should learn how to use our minds so that we can evolve and realize our oneness with the Creator. Everything we do should be the result of premeditated thought. Aim for high goals. It is a waste to use the power of thought to obtain things that are not important. Learn to remove the weeds that have grown in the garden of the mind.

By doing everything consciously, not absentmindedly, you can analyse your activities; then choose what is important and cut out the nonessentials. As soon as you are through with your duties, withdraw your mind from them and employ it in other creative pursuits. God Fulfills Man's Eternal Quest Learn how to cultivate the consciousness of Spirit. That is why you were born a human being. You were created under the evolutionary law that you might exercise your divine powers to find God. The animal can't find Him. Lahiri Mahasaya was working on the science of helping animals to evolve more quickly; but he didn't live to finish this work. I, also, know of some ways to quicken the evolution of the lower forms of life. But what of the millions of human beings who are living like animals? When they leave this world they haven't fulfilled the purpose of their existence. Why not fulfil it now? You can if you concentrate. The only meaning of life is to find the all- loving God, who has kept us apart from Himself by shyly hiding from us. We must find Him. Mankind is engaged in an eternal quest for that \"something else\" he hopes will bring him happiness, complete and unending. For those individual souls who have sought and found God, the search is over: He is that Something Else. Nature Veils God's Presence Why was temptation given to man? That he might look for the One who is more tempting than any worldly temptation. The earthly lures that surround you are not intended to en- snare you, but to cause you to seek beyond them,- to make you ask, \"Who created all these things? Who made me? Who am I? Where are You, Lord? Why are You hiding? Talk to me!\" When you directly approach God with these questions, He answers. Most people don't call deeply enough to Him, and so they never find Him. You must speak clearly to Him in the language of your soul: \"Lord, I want no longer to see only the beauty You have created. I want to behold Your Face, which is more beauti- ful than the flowers, more entrancing than all other faces. I want to see Who is behind all nature.\" Even if a person covers"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"393 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST himself with a veil you can see that someone is there. So is nature like a great veil bulging with God's presence. He is hiding there, but you take just a casual look, not penetrating to see the shy Indweller. As I sit breathless, silent, watchful in meditation, I become aware of a blissful trembling stir within me, and He whispers: \"I am here.\" The intelligence God has given us is the gateway to Heaven. It is the outer door to His kingdom, but you don't use it. Why not use it now, today? Don't wait, only to leave the earth like a dog, kicked out by death. It is a crime against your soul. Your intelligence was given to you to discover why you were placed here: to find Him. How to Discover Spirit There are various techniques for discovering the Spirit. Silence is one of them. Practising silence means to silence all desires that try to percolate into your consciousness from outside, so you can go deeper within to feel your soul. Another step or technique is devotion, or speaking to God purely and simply: \"You have created me. I didn't want to be created. It is Your responsibility to reveal Yourself to me.\" Talking to Him a little while and then forgetting will never bring His response. God is \"hard to get\" because not everyone \"means business\" with Him. The technique of prayer is usu- ally ineffectual because most prayers are not deep or devotional enough. You have to repeat and repeat until you go really deep, into the superconsciousness. Prayer in which your very soul is burning with desire for God is the only effectual prayer. You have prayed like that at some time, no doubt; perhaps when you wanted something very badly, or urgently needed money —then you burned up the ether with your desire. That is how you must feel for God. Talk to Him day and night; you will see that He will respond. Yoga Is the Science of Finding God The Yoga system of contacting God is the best. It consists of various scientifically effective techniques of meditation. The great sages of India reasoned that logically there must be an exact law by which to approach God, just as there are exact"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"394 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST laws by which He operates His universes. Though their exper- iments, the spiritual laws of yoga were discovered. The science of yoga will take hold in this country more than any other form of spiritual seeking. The entire trend will be away from churches, where people go only to hear a sermon, and into schools and quiet places where they will go to meditate and really find God. Everyone should practise divine communion with God. This is what Jesus did when he was with his disciples. I am not here just to tell you about the sugar of God's presence; my greatest aim is to make sure you taste it. What is the use of my talking about God unless you know Him and taste His sweet- ness? You must realize God, as I have realized Him. It is not out of pride that I speak this way, but because I am sent here to testify to you about Him. Day and night I think about my Lord. I am not wasting my time. Everything I do I am doing only for Him, so engrossed that I don't notice the passage of time or feel fatigue from my daily activities. I feel His pres- ence when I work. That is also my meditation. I often give this illustration: Some worldly men remain drunk for years by hid- ing now and then to take a little drink to sustain the euphoric feeling; then they go back to their work. So is the divine man; he hides from people and meditates upon the Lord. Drinking deep of the intoxicating wine of God's presence, he whispers, \"Lord, You are so wonderful, so marvellous! I love You.\" Then he goes back to his duties. Inwardly he talks to God all the time, no matter what he is doing. I am never separated from Him for a second. That is the state I wanted and worked for. I remember that once in a while I used to feel that He had gone away from me, and at such time I wanted to die rather than live without Him. I didn't find happiness in anything. Thus does the lover of God suffer when separated from Him. But a time comes when the devotee beholds the Lord dancing everywhere, and feels the immortal fountain of His spirit and His bliss ever bubbling in his soul. This what you will feel if you meditate. Pray with such inten- sity that He will come to you.

In my youth, when I sought Him with prayer alone, it often took a long time to get results. After I had learned Kriya Yoga and practised it, with deep devotion, I achieved results in a few minutes. Krishna taught that yoga meditation is greater than the path of asceticism, the path of devotion or prayer, the path of right action, or the path of discrimination, t It is a faster way. An airplane will take you from Los Angeles to new York in a matter of hours,- by bullock cart the journey would last several months. If you practise yoga, you will find it to be the airplane of spiritual progress. After you have perfected yourself in the Yoga path, which embraces bodily discipline, mental discipline, and spiritual dis- cipline, the obstacles to spiritual success are overcome and you can commune freely with God. That is why it is the highest path. And that is why I am trying to acquaint people with it. Yoga is not a myth, a creation of someone's imagination. It is a true science. Why shouldn't you take from India the greatest methods for finding God that have ever been given to mankind? I went to the masters in India for training, and they taught me about Christ in a profound and loving way such as never I heard in the West. I saw Christ in their company. They talked with him. Did St. Francis lie to us? He saw Christ every night. Lord Jesus lives! I have seen him. When you are behind a screen you see everyone else outside, but they can't see you. So the saints and the angels can see you, but you can't see them unless you prac- tise yoga.t * Bhagavad Gita XD:8. t Bhagavad Gita VI:46. t There have been mystics of various faiths who, through their transcendent powers of devotion to God, have attained to the breathless state of supercon- scious ecstasy that alone brings true inner vision.

Then I asked: \"Do you see Christ?\" \"I don't deserve it,\" he answered. \"Maybe after death he will visit me.\" \"No,\" I assured him, \"you can see him from tonight if you make up your mind.\" Tears were in his eyes, and he remained silent. You must pray intensely. If you sit night after night prac- ticing meditation and crying to God, the darkness will be burned up, and you will see the Light behind this physical light, the Life behind all life, the Father behind all fathers, the Mother behind all mothers, the Friend behind all friends, the Element behind all elements, the Power behind all powers.

There is no other way. If every- one in this world were a millionaire there would still be trou- bles and sorrows, for you cannot buy unshakable happiness. That comes only by following a technique of yoga, and by devotion, by going within. Practising yoga is half the battle. Even if you don't feel enthusiastic in the beginning, if you go on practicing you will come to feel that tremendous longing for God which is necessary if you are to find Him. Why don't you make the effort? Whence do all the beauti- ful things in creation continually emerge? Whence comes the intelligence of great souls, but from the storehouse of the Infi- nite Spirit? And if these wonders you see about you are not enough to induce you to seek Him, why should He reveal Him- self to you?

Never have I felt such joy. This world is all a motion-picture projection of God's mind. There is no death, no disease, no wickedness.

Use your reason is all your actions; otherwise you may thoughtlessly convert yourself into a helpless slave of undesirable habits. Impeach a Bad Habit-President and Install a Good One A strong bad habit presiding for a long time over the bod- ily country brings chaos and misery. Spiritual famine, mental fevers, and a universal poverty of body and mind exist in that misruled land. A strong bad habit should be impeached before a tribunal of daily introspection under the presiding judge of conscience, who should inform the court of reason that the in- evitable outcome of persistence in the offending actions will be an impaired nervous system, wasted powers, and vanished hap- piness. This constantly sounded note of warning may serve gradually to persuade the jury of reason to the decision to put away forever the guilty victimizing habit. Sometimes it is difficult to convince the court. Many per- sons who excessively smoke, drink, or indulge in sex experi- ences do not seek or even wish to be free of these slavish com- pulsions. They delusively think that there is nothing harmful about what they are doing because they don't immediately suf- fer disillusioning painful consequences. Childlike, they fail to visualize the ultimate results of their actions. They do not see * For people who have established in previous lives the pattern of a harmful habit, such as alcoholism, the \"first drink\" was taken many lives ago; that is why in this life even the first drink can revive that habit with alarming sud- denness and often tragic consequences."},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"HABIT—YOUR MASTER OR YOUR SLAVEt 407 that they have set into motion laws that work impartially for good or ill, according to the nature of human actions; that, although the shovels of harmful habits dig slowly, they yet dig surely a yawning, untimely grave, a pit of misery toward which the slave of wrong habits proceeds through scorching flames of suffering. Of such entrapped persons the Gita says: \"Harbour- ing bewildering thoughts, caught in the net of delusion, crav- ing only sensual delights, they sink into a foul hell.\"* First convince your mind that you are going to overthrow the tyranny of the undesirable ruling habit; then begin the work of constitutional agitation and actual impeachment. A whining or sorrowing attitude, gentle remonstrance, or even violent but spasmodic rebellion is of little avail. It is through continuous repetition of certain actions that you are the maker of your habits; and you must undo hurtful ones by a similarly regular effort, implemented by conscious exercise of will and the discriminative power of reason. Relate your actions to new and better habits. Keep them continuously busy, interested, and attentive in serving good habits and in fraternizing with other good actions. If your actions begin to revert to their old dangerous habit-influenced associations, don't become discouraged. Persist in right ac- tions, give them sufficient time and attention, and the voting strength of the new good actions will increase and finally become powerful enough to overthrow the worthless habit and to elect in its place a worthy one. It Takes Time to Establish Habits, Good or Bad It takes time for even a bad habit to attain supremacy, so why be impatient about the growth of a rival good habit? Do not despair about your undesirable habits; simply stop feeding them and thus making them strong by repetition. The time that elapses in the formation of habits varies with individual nervous systems and brains and is chiefly determined by the quality of one's attention.

The potency of concentration and will to create good and bad fortune is strikingly summed up in the Biblical verse: \"For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance,- but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.\"* This truth is particularly applicable to habits. A man of good actions strengthens his will to perform further good actions, and thus increases in virtue with little effort. But a slave of bad habits debauches his will and reason, so that eventually he is not only powerless to create new good habits, but also has weakened his hold on whatever good habits he may have had at the start. Government of one's actions by intuitional, wisdom- guided discrimination, uninfluenced by either good or bad habits, imparts unbounded power of will. \"But that man suc- ceeds supremely, O Arjuna, who, disciplining the senses by the mind, unattached, keeps his organs of activity steadfast on the path of God-uniting actions.\"+ A man with such power can in- stantly fix a new habit in his brain, or stop one at will. An ideal democracy presupposes rational, willing obedience to good laws, without any goading by higher authority or other exter- nal influences. Similarly a wise man, one who is really free, avoids error and performs good, not from the compulsion of habit but from free and reasoned choice. Such a one does not permit himself to be dominated by even a good habit, lest in so doing he fail to exercise full discriminative choice of action. A good habit may be in force simply because there has never been any temptation of evil to overthrow it. A good habit thus es- tablished is not necessarily fixed permanently in the nature, because it has been maintained not from discriminative choice and reason but as a result of favouring circumstance. All national tastes and human customs are habits, cir- cumstantially acquired as a result of environmental influence. Love of Americanism or of Hinduism is the outcome of habit and familiarity. If I had had the choice, I would have preferred to be a human \"chameleon,\" free to embrace the desirable aspects of all nationalities and all creeds. * Matthew 13:12. t Bhagavad-Gita 111:7.

No sooner had Mr. Roquefort touched the palate, and no sooner had his arrival become known to the cerebral cells, than the habit-lords of taste instituted a rebel- lion among the honoured guests already gathered in my stom- ach, who became very upset and began to threaten, \"If you let Mr. Roquefort in, we will all leave in a body!\" I did not enjoy this sudden embarrassment! Noticing that everyone else at the table was greatly relishing the peculiar food, I strongly urged my senses to elect immediately the Roquefort cheese-enjoying habit. Then I liked the taste at once, and have continued to like it from that time on. Why is it that you sometimes find yourself acting, or reacting, contrary to your real desires? Because over a period of time you have built up habits that are contrary to those desires, and your actions automatically flatter your habits. You must first establish habits that will influence your actions to cater to your true ideals. Habit is an automatic mechanism for performing actions without expending the mental and physical labour ordinarily involved in performing actions that are new to us. Wrongly used, this mechanism is an archenemy, threatening man's citadel of free choice. Be practical.

And bad habits are the pieces of mere glass that seem to satisfy you, because they are more easily come by; but which, being delusory, will in the end bring disappointment. Satiety will overtake you, so that nothing gives you pleasure. I do not have to go through those experiences; I can see the end of human pleasures, and I have found in God the only real and lasting joy. The true definition of \"old age\" is that state wherein one has become bored with the world. I tired of the pleasures of life very quickly,- * and this world would have been extremely boresome to me had I not sought and found the joy of God. The happiness and abundance I find in Him are measureless. Eternity is not long enough for me to explain the joy of the devotee's heart when God enters. This is not exaggeration, because God's joy is eternal—unceasing, ever new, boundless. All of us have glimpses of it now and then—soul recollections of a state of eternal happiness. In this world everybody wants to use us for his own pur- pose. Only God—and a real master who knows God—can truly love us. The ordinary human being does not know what love is. When someone's company gives you pleasure, you tend to think you love that person. But in reality it is yourself you love,- your ego has been pleased by the other person's attention, that is all. Would you go on \"loving\" that person if he should cease to please you? What it means to love someone else more than oneself is very difficult to understand, and even more difficult for the average person to practise. To illustrate, I will tell you a true story of real love. There was in India a devoted husband who loved his wife very deeply. Another man became infatuated with her. She ran away with her lover, who eventually left her without friends or funds. One day her husband came to see her. He spoke gently. * The death of Paramahansaji's mother when he was about eleven was a turn- ing point in his life, strengthening his already ardent spiritual inclinations into an iron resolve to find God. The divine wisdom garnered in previous incarna- tions manifested early in this one ; thus he was able by discrimination to see the inherent disillusionment in the experiences of this world, and to realize that lasting happiness could come only from God.

The husband wasn't concerned for his honour; he was thinking only of the welfare of his beloved. One great stumbling-block in the way of giving true love is our habits. In our hearts we all want to be angels, but .our habits make us devils. In the morning we make up our minds to adhere to good, but during the day we forget our resolution. \"The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\"* Flesh means habits. Our spirit, our wisdom, is willing; but our good habits are weak. The Gita says, \"The eager excitable senses do forcibly seize the consciousness even of one who has a high degree of enlightenment, and is striving (for liberation), \"t Many people don't understand the terrible nature of habit. Some persons form habits very quickly. This is all right when establishing good habits,- but it is dangerous when performing actions that may create bad habits.

The other day a pitiable case came to me. This person, when not drinking, is a good man,- but as soon as he starts drinking he becomes a fiend. He would go to extremes to do good when he is sober; but when drunk he beats his wife and causes terror. He has come for healing, and I know that if he tunes in just a little bit he will be helped. But see how terrible evil habits are! When this man is not under the influence of liquor, you wouldn't be able to see a trace of evil in him; and at such times he is so filled with remorse about his evil habit of drinking that he wants to destroy himself. But still he drinks! That is what habit does. If you make up your mind to do something good you must do it. Don't let anything stand in your way. But before you make a resolution, determine that it is a good one. When I make up my mind I absolutely do not listen to any contradic- tions. I sometimes take a long time to make my decision, but when I do, nothing can stop me. A law of God operates for you when you strongly make up your mind and then adhere firmly to that resolution. All of us mean well; but habits sometimes make us do things, against our will, that are harmful to others and to our- selves. Therefore, make up your mind not to be imposed upon by bad habits. Why Let Your Habits Dictate to You? Your forefathers came here to escape from rules that took away freedom to act according to one's conscience. Freeborn Americans don't like to have anyone dictate to them. Why then should you let yourself be dictated to by your habits? Such as when you don't want to eat, and still you eat; or when you don't want to fight with others, yet you do. What is the matter? You have allowed yourself to become a slave to bad habits. Just being born in America or in other democratic lands does not guarantee freedom of the mind and heart. To be free is to be able to perform right actions according to the dictates of one's own soul-wisdom, not out of compulsion of habit, or blind obedience, or unreasoning fear. Wisdom confers true freedom, and that is the real spirit of America."},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"414 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST Doing whatever you please is not freedom; it is an abuse of freedom.

There can be no real freedom under such circumstances. Freedom comes only by following the law of self-government. To do freely what you ought to do, when you ought to do it —to be guided by your wisdom—is the only real freedom. Slavery to habits is slavery in its worst form. Resolve to be free.

Habits of living and doing and thinking; habits of environment and of nationality. In the latter case, habits are imposed upon us. I follow my own ways. When I started for America in 1920, I had a long beard. You would think that men with beards would appear more venerable; and in India beards are admired for this reason. But while still aboard ship, I was persuaded that Americans, on seeing a man with a long beard, would be more inclined to remark, \"There goes a wild man from the jungle!\" After I understood that few American men wear a beard, I was willing to abandon mine; but I resolved to keep my hair long, because my guru, Sri Yukteswarji, wore his hair long. So no one was able to influence me to cut my hair short. If I were to cut off my long hair now, the same people who ridiculed its length years ago would laugh at me for having short hair, and would feel that the stature of the inner man also had been shortened. We don't really know what is right or real, because we are always comparing things on the basis of outer appearances. Therefore we are often incorrect in our judgments.

True Freedom Versus Whim Freedom In the West many people believe in freedom of a different kind—I call it whim freedom. Because of a mistaken concep- tion of the real nature of freedom, some parents make their children habit-slaves for life by indiscriminately giving in to their desires. The child grows up thinking that so long as his desires are satisfied he will be happy,- and that the purpose of life is to satisfy desires. Later he realizes that he has been mis- led; the world outside is much different from what he has seen at home. To satisfy every whim is not so easy in the world! Others may push him around in order to gain their own ends; and he too becomes callous in order to satisfy his whims and desires. \"Believing that fulfillment of bodily desires is man's highest aim, confident that this world is 'all,' such persons are engrossed till the moment of death in earthly cares and concerns.\"* Parents should try to equip their children with firm will and discrimination, so that they can make their way in the world and still remain apart from its bad habits. Teach children how to be really free. Don't let them become slaves to the body and to undesirable habits. It is good to train a child in regular- ity of daily habits, but he should be trained also in evenmind- edness: if he gets to sleep on time, all right; if not, all right. If he has his dinner on time, fine; if he cannot eat on time, fine. Children should be taught to respect the rights of others; but to be free of habit slavery to anything or anyone. * Bhagavad Gita XVI: 11."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"416 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST Fight Bad Habits With \"Won't\" Power When a mule wants to be agreeable, it is quite obedient, but when it makes up its mind to stop cooperating, nobody can move it.

Some people have to be told every day what to do, even though their duties may be substantially the same,- but ordi- narily people perform routine daily activities as a matter of habit. This is fine if they have cultivated good habits; but it is unfortunate for those who have adopted bad habits. Most people possess a combination of both. Habits Are Mental Phonograph Records Repeated performance of an action creates a mental blue- print. Every action is performed mentally as well as physically, and repetition of a particular action and its accompanying thought-pattern causes the formation of subtle electrical pathways in the physiological brain, somewhat like the grooves in a phonograph record. After a time, whenever you put the needle of attention on those \"grooves\" of electrical pathways, it plays back the \"record\" of the original mental blueprint. Each time an action is repeated, these grooves of electrical pathways become deeper, until the slightest atten- tion automatically \"plays\" those same actions over and over again. Yet by concentration and will power you can erase even deep grooves of long-standing habits. If you are addicted to smoking, for example, say to yourself: \"The habit of smoking has long been lodged in my brain.

I know a man who wanted to get rid of the smoking habit. He was a chain smoker, but he had great faith that he could overcome the habit. I told him: \"After I have given you a heal- ing I want you to smoke. It will taste just like a bundle of rags and you will not enjoy smoking anymore.\" And this was so. When he tried to smoke the next day he became nauseated. He had been receptive to my strong thought, and I had momen- tarily been able to transmit my consciousness to him. After that he was freed from this bad habit. Biting the nails is another foolish, useless habit. Why should you do such things against your will when you are the king of the castle of your life?

Awaken that wisdom which revives in you the power of free will, enabling you to rise above the compulsive instinct of ordinary habits. \"Even if thou art the chief sinner among all sinners, yet by the sole raft of wisdom thou shalt safely cross the sea of sin.\"* The best way to get rid of habits is to will them out of your mind at once!

When I have eaten certain foods and found myself becoming bound by a wish for them, I stopped eating those foods until the desire was gone. When I went to Singapore I found there a certain fruit that is delicious; but I watched myself that I didn't form a craving for it. I knew that if I did not take care I could find myself wanting it morning, noon, and night. That is the way we enslave ourselves. So although I had full enjoyment of the fruit that one day, I didn't regret its absence on the next day. If we are watchful of the things we enjoy, there is no need to fear. We should keep our freedom at all costs. So many people go on eating foods that they know are not good for them. But if I say I won't eat a food, that is the end of it. Isn't that freedom? to do things, not because your habits compel you, nor because your friends persuade you, but because your own wisdom tells you?

You can install habits at will by the power of wisdom. I can make myself like anything that wisdom demands.

In childhood the body is more responsive to the mind; it can more easily make the body do its bidding. But later on, as the child develops various habits, the body and mind do not work in the same harmony as before.

The disciples pre- sent could not bear the sight, but St. Francis told the physician to proceed with the treatment.

Jesus let his body suffer the pains of crucifixion, even though he was already redeemed, for he thereby willingly worked out on his own body some of the karmic suffering due his disciples and the world. But he knew the relationship between mind and body; he saw them as a delusory creation in the cosmic dream of God. The body is merely a cluster of sensations. It is not easy to cut off sensations, but you can do so by remaining con- stantly in the consciousness that you are a soul, one with Spirit. When the mind is almost wholly dominated by the body and its demands, as is the case with most persons, it is best to begin gradually, in little things, to dissociate the mind from the body. One difference between an ordinary man and a superman is that the ordinary man cries and gives in to suffering if he is hurt, but the yogi is established in the consciousness that he is not the body, that he is apart from it. This realization is with me all the time. Sometimes I see myself walking, and I am simultaneously aware that I have no body. In the divine con- sciousness you realize that you, as soul, have no hands, eyes, ears, or feet, nor any need of these physical adjuncts,- yet you can use and move these bodily instruments. It is possible to hear, see, smell, taste, and touch with mind power alone. In clairaudience, for example, one hears through the power within. Many saints hear the voice of God or one of His angels guiding them. They hear not with ears but with mind. Such a state of consciousness is a real experience, not imagination. But it cannot become your experience unless you meditate. If you meditate with the greatest devotion, someday when you least expect it you will have the same experience, and you will understand what I am speaking of. God is constantly showing me this truth, that the body is unreal. He has also shown me that this body shall suffer. But the physical suffering this body will endure has nothing to do with my consciousness. It comes from taking on the negative karma of others, and has no connection with misery-producing desires of self. If this body does some good to the world and to others, fine.

We can safely say that the mind can exist without the body. Wisdom and Will Govern Body and Mind What, then, are the principal powers that govern body and mind? Wisdom and will. Wisdom is the soul's intuitive, direct knowledge of truth. During warfare, range finders are used to determine where to fire shells,- once the range is found, the guns are effectively fired. Wisdom is your range finder, and your will gives the firing power to accomplish your ends according to the dictates of your wisdom. Your will should always be guided by wisdom.

If you have wisdom but not sufficient will to follow through as wisdom dictates, it is hurtful to your well-being; if you have a strong will but no wisdom, there is every chance of \"misfiring\" and destroying yourself.

Their soul is worshipping God in this way and praying, \"O Spirit, release me in this life.\" Will is a tremendous factor in life. It is the power by which you can reach the heights of God-realization, or go down into the deepest strata of ignorance. The cry of a newborn child is an expression of physiological will; the baby wills to remove the discomfort it feels. Most people have not risen above that state of babyhood. They immediately want to be rid of any discomfort, and whenever they see anything that attracts them, they cry for it. They think they have got to have it, that they can't live without it. The will that is thus overpowered by the senses is called physiological will—body-bound will, following the dictates of the senses. It is terrible to use any kind of drug, for the drug enslaves the will to the body. I once knew a man who used opium. All day long he slept in a stupor. It took him years to overcome his slavery. To use narcotics is one of the greatest sins against Spirit. Drink is the same. Both mean destruction of will power. The great saints have warned against them. Under no circumstance should you let yourself be tempted, for in a short while you can be lost. Drink and drugs are sins against the soul because they paralyze the will, without which soul- realization and salvation are impossible. Many people are bound by physiological will. The very power that governs prana and enables it to efficiently operate the human machine is destroyed when strong habits of sex or drink or hatred take over. And once they are established they are very difficult to conquer. Once you are in the habit of show- ing temper whenever you are crossed, you follow that habit in"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"424 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST spite of your wish to behave otherwise. Habit destroys the supreme gift of heaven—will power—by which you can work out your own salvation. Without Wisdom, Will Becomes Habit-Bound If God and heaven were imposed on us, then we would be their slaves. But the Lord has given us free choice by which we can accept good or cast it out, accept evil or cast it out. The powers that God has given you by which you can make this choice are wisdom and will. Find out whether you have control over your will or not. Don't let your will be devitalized by bad habits. After physiological will comes habit-bound will. Your will automatically enters this second phase unless it is guided by wisdom. Sometimes a good man's child is lacking in truthful- ness and good habits. Certainly the child has had every opportunity to learn to be good; yet the moment he becomes old enough to start using his own will, he gets into all kinds of mischief. Why? Usually in such cases the child's nature from past lives is karmically inclined toward wrong thinking and habits. Through his family training in this life he learns to perform good actions; but they are only superimposed on his real nature. Because his will is controlled only by me- chanical good habits, rather than by soul wisdom and true un- derstanding, he readily succumbs to temptations when he is free of the good influence of the family. If you ask thieves and habitual drinkers if they like their way of life, they usually say \"No.\" They thought when they started their wrong actions that they would be happy. They never realized that the effects would be hurtful to them. For this reason I deeply feel for people who have done wrong. I cry for them. \"But for the grace of God, there go I.\" Evil is a sort of opiate. That is why we should have places where people who have gone wrong can learn how to live and how to think. Jail is not a suitable place of reform. Such persons need to mix with superior men who can help them. All around you are thieves of circumstances, trying to steal your vitality of will; but no one can take away your will but yourself. The child wants his own way. When he grows up,"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"DEVELOPING DYNAMIC WILL 425 unless his will has been curbed and guided by wisdom, he finds that he is a slave to desires. Are you not doing things today that you know you ought not to do, and which you know will bring you unhappiness later on? Overstimulation of the senses devitalizes the will, so do not create an unnatural craving for anything. Suppose you like a certain food very much. Your will power should be such that you can do without it henceforth. It is impossible to say what you really like and don't like, because your inclinations are always changing. If you analyze yourself you will see that in the matter of likes and dislikes we are all crazy. We don't know why we like certain things and don't like others. What you like through the influence of your wisdom, and what you like as a result of your physiological habits, are two different things. I can make myself like some- thing, and the next minute I can make myself repelled by it. To be guided by wisdom is to be king of the world. The wise man tries first to determine if he is right; then he acts. But if he makes a decision and then finds out he was wrong, he immediately acknowledges his mistake. Never use your will power to be stubborn. You can talk with some people for an hour, and they seemingly agree with you, and then they turn around and say just the opposite. They don't want to give up their own way. That is not will power, but slavery to the ego. You can see such slaves all around you. They think they are free, but their will is chained; they perform actions mechani- cally, guided by good or by evil habits. But when you can say, \"I stay away from evil because evil works against my happiness,\" or \"I am good, not because I am forced to be, but because good leads to my own happiness\"—that is wisdom. Such was my guru's training. One thing we should always remember: If will is guided by wisdom, it will produce something constructive in our life. When Jesus said to the Heavenly Father, \"Thy will be done,\"* it was not because he lacked will power, but because he wanted his will to be guided by God's. When the Divine Will intimated, \"Give up the body,\" Jesus had to use a great deal of will power to conquer the weakness of the flesh. * Matthew 26:42."},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"426 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST Human will has become divine will, completely attuned to Spirit, when even though it is necessary to give up the body, one is able to do so willingly, as Christ did. A body-bound slave would have said, \"They are trying to crucify me ; I must try to save myself.\" If Jesus had done that, he would not have been the Christ who lives in our hearts today. Stages of Will Development Man progresses from the physiological will of infancy to the unthinking will of childhood. That is when he is used to obeying his mother, doing whatever she tells him to do. After unthinking will comes blind will; he gets away from the mother's will and begins to feel his own will power. This comes in youth. He tests his own will and begins to use it to get what he sets his heart on. As a child I wanted a bicycle and I got it. Then I wanted a horse, but I didn't get it. A long time after, though, I did receive it. Every desire that I have had has been satisfied by the Lord. Everything I have wished for has come to me. That was His blessing. I was always careful that my wish was right before I used my will to carry it out. It is good to be stubborn in good things, but never otherwise. When you are wrong, you should correct yourself. If you don't blind yourself to good by using your will for wrong things, then you progress from blind will to thinking will. After Mother died, when I was only eleven years old, and so grief-stricken! my eldest sister Roma loved to guide me. Others tried to use force, but Roma won me by love. Even when I was obstinately saying to her, \"Go away, go away,\" I found myself obeying her wishes. The nature of a saint is tender like a flower, but stronger than thunder when he makes up his mind about something good, because his will is guided by wisdom. It was not the eas- iest thing to convince my guru when I felt I had a better idea, but as soon as he saw that I offered a different angle he would say: \"You are right. Let us do it that way.\" But when I was wrong, he couldn't be moved."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"DEVELOPING DYNAMIC WILL 427 Thinking will is the most marvellous instrument you can imagine. Are you governed by thinking will, or by blind will, or by physiological will? Thinking will is the way toward wisdom. When you get a notion in your mind that you must go to the movies, that is physiological will. And when you decide, \"Well, it doesn't matter, I will go some other time,\" that is thinking will. Will that is not guided by habit is thinking will. If you don't want to smoke, you should not smoke. If you do not feel hungry, don't eat just because of habit. Whenever I wish to refrain from taking food, no one can tempt me to eat. Another habit amongst those hardest to control is that of harsh speech. Speaking unkindly to others paralyzes your will. Never be cranky. Whenever you get angry you make your face ugly. Be so loving and kind that everyone who meets you says of you, \"I would like to see that person again.\" When you control your own speech you will not be so sensitive to others' remarks about you. I quit anger when I was a little child. But I often discipline with strong words those understanding ones whom God has sent me for training. To those who don't understand, I never say anything. See how wonderful will power is. After you have devel- oped thinking will, you begin to reason, \"I must produce something worthwhile with this power,\" and you take up one thing at a time and try to accomplish it. You revolve that will around a problem of health or of finances or of controlling a habit, or around the desire to know God. If you will and act until victory, then you have attained dynamic will. The World Will Try to Trick You Everything in life tempts you away from God. In the beginning most devotees fall down, because they don't use their divine will; they put off meditation. Day after day, week after week, they put it off. You know you want to love God, you know you ought to get busy making the effort now, and still you procrastinate. I remember a period in my childhood when I lost a great deal of time in this manner. I was already meditating every day, and I had resolved to meditate much longer each day. But I kept putting it off until suddenly I"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"428 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST realized a whole year had gone by. Then I remembered the story about the cat and the sparrow. The cat caught a sparrow, but the sparrow was wise. He reminded the cat that it was proper first to lick clean his face and paws in preparation for the sparrow meal. This made sense to the cat, so he let the sparrow go and took his time washing himself. In the meantime the sparrow flew away to a high branch. The cat finally said, \"You can come down now. I am ready for my dinner.\" But the sparrow chirped, \"Too bad; I am now at the top of the tree.\" So the cat resolved: \"Henceforth, I will eat my sparrow first and then wash myself.\" First things must come first. When you awaken in the morning, meditate. If you don't, the whole world will crowd in to claim you, and you will forget God. At night, meditate be- fore sleep claims you. I am so strongly established in the habit of meditation that even after I lie down to sleep at night, I find I am meditating. I can't sleep in the ordinary way. The habit of being with God comes first. In Your Will Power Lies the Image of God Will power means freedom. Will power means Heaven. If you don't permit your will to be weakened by the attractions of the world, you will reach your divine goal. But most of you have allowed your will to be sapped by bad habits—many of you indulge in them every day—smoking, drinking, angry speech. You think you can't do without these things. But there was a time when you didn't know what smoke was, or what drink was, or what anger was. You have given up your freedom by acquiring these habits. Must you remain a slave to them? How can you find God unless you free your will power, by eliminating these worldly habits and by using that will to med- itate instead? No matter what happens to your body, meditate. Never go to sleep at night until you have communed with God. Your body will remind you that you have worked hard and need rest, but the more you ignore its demands and concentrate on the Lord, the more you will burn with joyous life, like a globe afire. Then you will know that you are not the body. In your will power lies the image of God. That image has been desecrated"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"DEVELOPING DYNAMIC WILL 429 because you have made a slave of your mind. When I left India to come to America, my guru said: \"Forget you were born among Hindus, and don't adopt all the ways of the Americans ....

If the whole world stood against me, and I saw that I was right and others were wrong, I would not change my mind. Nothing Is Impossible When Will Becomes Dynamic Choose a good, wholesome, constructive goal and then determine that you are going to achieve it. No matter how many times you fail, keep on trying. No matter what happens, if you have unalterably resolved, \"The earth may be shattered, but I will keep on doing the best I can,\" you are using dynamic will, and you will succeed. That dynamic will is what makes one man rich and another man strong and another man a saint. It is not Jesus and a few others who alone know God. If you make the right kind of effort, you will find God. What is the value of using dynamic will today to be a great doctor, or a suc- cessful businessman, when tomorrow you may die? This is why Jesus said, \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God.\"* Use your will to know God first; then He will direct your path in life. You are using dynamic will when day and night you whis- per within, \"Lord, Lord, Lord,\" with the deepest desire to find Him. It is better to use your will to seek God than for anything else. I am so happy that He blessed me with the divine will power that my guru, Sri Yukteswarji, awakened in me. Before I met Master I was exercising that will power right and left in useless things. But even then, whenever I started something, I employed dynamic will to complete it. I remember the first time I used dynamic will to help oth- ers. My friend and I were just little boys then. One day I said to him, \"We are going to feed five hundred people.\" \"But we haven't a paisa! \" he exclaimed. \"We are going to do it just the same,\" I assured him. \"And I think the money is going to come through you.\" \"That is impossible!\" he scoffed. An intuitive conviction * Matthew 6:33."},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"430 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST prompted me to say: \" Don't offend your mother in any way. Do whatever she asks you to do.\" One day later he came running and told me this story. \" I was bathing and Mother called me. I was going to say, 'Don't bother me now while I am bathing,' but instead I asked her what she wanted. She told me to go and see my aunt who lived nearby. I said, 'All right.' \" When I went to see my aunt, the first thing she said to me was, 'Who is this crazy boy you are mixing with? Have you lost your mind? What is this I hear about your feeding five hun- dred people?' I was angry with her. 'I must leave now,' I told her, and started to go. But she stopped me, saying, 'Your friend may be crazy, but his idea is good. Here are twenty rupees.'\" The boy had nearly fainted with surprise. He ran to me at once to tell me the news. When we went to buy the rice and other things, the people in the neighborhood had already heard of our plan, and added more food. In the end we fed two thou- sand people! The same divinely charged will power also brought about the first library I founded, Saraswat Library in Calcutta. When you make up your mind to do good things, you will accomplish them if you use dynamic will power to follow through. No matter what the circumstances are, if you go on trying, God will create the means by which your will shall find its proper reward. This is the truth Jesus referred to when he said: \"If ye have faith, and doubt not,... if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, it shall be done.\"* If you continuously use your will power, no matter what reverses come, it will produce success and health and power to help people, and above all, it will produce com- munion with God. This is the kind of will power you must develop—the will power that will run the ocean dry if necessary in order to ac- complish what is good. The greatest will should be used to meditate. The Lord wants us to discover our divine will and use it to find Him. Develop this God-seeking dynamic will. It is not profound words that will give you emancipation, but your own efforts through meditation. * Matthew 21:21."},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"Seek God Now! Self-Realization Fellowship International Headquarters, Los Angeles, California, July 15, 1941 God-realization is attained only by great effort on the part of the yogi, and by divine grace. Though God can be ap- proached by law, still, as the Searcher of Hearts, He must be convinced that a devotee really wants Him before He sends His grace. God withholds final illumination from a devotee, how- ever perfected he may be in the science of Yoga, who does not wholeheartedly desire Him. I recall a time in the ashram of my guru, Swami Sri Yuk- teswar, when month after month, with the greatest devotion, I was seeking God; yet I was experiencing a sort of stagnation. When I questioned Master about my problem, he said, \"You think that if you had more mental power or more miracle power you would realize more fully that God is with you. But that is not so. Suppose He responded by giving you control over the whole universe. Possession of such power would leave your heart still unsatisfied. God is the Ever-New Joy you already feel in meditation. When man loves that Joy above everything else in this world, desiring it more than money and fame, more than his indulgences in moods and habits and sensory experi- ences, God will open the way.\" Few devotees are prepared to make such \"sacrifices.\"* It is at once very easy and very hard to please God. He is playing with His devotees even in tests, and He tests them all the time. How easy it is to pack the day with foolishness, how difficult to fill it with worthwhile activities and thoughts! Yet God is not so much interested in what we are doing as in where the mind is. Everyone has a different difficulty, but God doesn't listen to any excuses. He wants the devotee's mind to * \"The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few\" ( Matthew 9:37, Bible). 431"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"432 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST be engrossed in Him in spite of any troublesome circum- stances. Even as I am engaged in talking to you now, my mind is ever on God. I am with Him inwardly all the time. I live in His Joy. Loving and craving naught else but that joy, I find that all obstacles to God-union give way before me. This declara- tion is not a fairy tale; it is true. But not until God has received all of the devotee's love will He come. It will seem that He has forsaken us sometimes, but such tests are inescapable,- if we steadfastly refuse to give up our search, God receives us as His own. In worldly ambitions there is always an element of uncertainty. Some people spend year after year trying whole- heartedly but unsuccessfully to make money. But in the spir- itual path no wholehearted devotee is ever unsuccessful. His labours are never in vain. Perseverance Is the Whole Magic of Spiritual Success The greatest enemy of divine realization is the body,- it becomes easily tired and wants to give up. A true devotee never relaxes his effort nor admits the supremacy of the body. Con- tinuous vigilance is required. We must believe, against all seeming odds, that He will come. Even an agnostic who thinks that there is little likelihood that God exists, but who perse- veres in the search for Him, will ultimately find Him. Even though God may not seem to respond, one should not succumb to doubts but should unremittingly continue in the holy quest. Perseverance is the whole magic of spiritual success. If the Lord responded easily and openly to the devotee's prayers for divine illumination, all men would immediately seek Him— not for love of Him, but for the illimitable rewards. This world is God's playhouse. It is part of His intricate drama here that He has made it very difficult to discover His presence. Because the search is not easy, we tend to forget Him. Even when we see our loved ones pulled away into the mysterious unknown, we do not think seriously about our hav- ing to go too, sometime. But one should not wait for the approach of death to realize the importance of seeking God. It is every man's supreme and immediate duty. Each minute of"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"SEEK GOD NOW! 433 life should be a divine quest. The burning question in our hearts should be: \"When shall I find Thee, O Lord?\" No matter what happens, never give up the vital search. Suppose one sits to meditate, and friends arrive. There is noth- ing to do but to cut the meditation short; yet one may still keep his mind on God. Whatever the activity, the inner atten- tion should be on Him. He is so necessary to us! Get busy now ; time is passing, and one day the fearful realization will come that life has gone by as though in a twin- kling, and still He has not been found. Let no day pass without your having made an effort to meditate on Him. Soon, surpris- ingly little effort will be needed. Great happiness comes to the devotee who is steadfast. Without unquenchable enthusiasm nothing can be gained. The Bhagavad Gita teaches the importance on the spiritual path of rising above bodily sensations. The contact of the senses with outer environment produces sensations of heat and cold, pleasure and pain, and other oppositional states. The average man is easily affected by these sensations, but the Gita teaches that one should be neutral to them. This is not a rec- ommendation to be rash! If the yogi finds the sensations of heat or cold are extremely difficult to bear, he should seek an out- ward remedy without becoming inwardly involved. He who can practice mental neutrality is on the way to becoming a saint. He who lives in the bodily temple without being affected by changing sensory perceptions, remaining even-minded dur- ing pleasure and pain, cool and heat, and so on, becomes a true king among men. Having attained changelessness, he is one with the changeless Spirit. All who came to my guru's ashram for spiritual training were disciplined in this way. The aspiring yogi of the West as well as of the East must discipline himself similarly. He should refrain from making too much fuss about the body. If he sees he is finding time for everything else but is too busy for God, he should take the whip of discipline to himself. Why be afraid? There is everything to gain. If a man will not himself cry and struggle to attain his own salvation, will anyone else do it for him?"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"434 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST God-realization is the most difficult state to reach. Let no one fool himself, nor think that someone else can \"give\" it to him. Whenever I fell into a state of mental stagnation, my guru could do nothing for me. But I never gave up trying to keep in tune with him by cheerfully performing whatever he asked me to do. \"I have come to him for God-realization,\" I reasoned, \"and I must listen to his advice.\" At his ashram we young disciples seemed to be always cooking, and there were many other excuses not to meditate. Yet even though I worked harder there than in my own home, I found the environment of the ashram to be spiritually helpful to me. Keep a Daily Appointment with God Let no devotee miss his daily appointment with God. The mind may suggest the movies or some other distraction; but when the time comes for God each day, keep that sacred engagement. Otherwise you will be a long time finding Him. There is a personal element in the search for God that is more important than mastery over the whole science of Yoga. The Heavenly Father wants to be sure that His children desire only Him, that they will not be satisfied with anything else. When God is made to feel that He is not first in the devotee's heart, He stands aside. But to him who says, \"O Lord, it mat- ters not if I lose sleep tonight, so long as I am with Thee,\" He will come. Positively! From behind the countless screens of this mysterious world the Ruler of creation will come forth to reveal Himself behind each one. He talks to His true devotees, and plays hide-and-seek with them. Sometimes He suddenly unveils a comforting truth when one is worried. In time, and in direct or indirect ways, He grants every with of His devotee. Fulfilment of a particular desire seems necessary only if one lacks conviction that he can find perfect fulfilment in God. One who is at peace in God is not tortured by unfulfiled earthly desires. \"Taking shelter in Me, all beings can achieve the Supreme Fulfilment....\"* No one can hurt me by thwart- ing me in some outward matter, because to me God is suffi- cient; His joyous presence is the only conditioning factor in my happiness.

The world worships men of power, like Alexander the Great and Napoleon, but think of their mental states! Then think of the peace that Christ had. His peace could not be taken from him. We think we will seek that peace \"tomor- row.\" Anyone who reasons this way will never find it. Seek it now. We do not neglect eating and our other duties to the body. They are very important to us. But one who loves God intensely loses all worry about the body. This is what Jesus meant when he said: \"Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.\"* Not until you feel in your consciousness the absolute importance of God will you reach Him. Do not permit life to cheat you. Form those good habits that make for true happiness. Follow a simple diet, exercise the body, and meditate daily—no matter what happens, rain or shine. If you are unable to exer- cise and meditate in the morning, do it at night. Pray to Him every day, \"Lord, even if I die, or if the whole world crumbles away, I am going to find time daily to be with Thee.\" Who is interested in God alone? Very few. Most people want to talk about spirits and miracles and so on. But he who knows God will be told by Him everything he has ever wanted to know. Kriya Yoga—Highest Method of God-Contact Kriya Yoga is the highest method of God-contact. In my own search for God I travelled all over India, and heard wisdom from the lips of a number of her greatest masters. I can there- fore vouch for the fact that in Self-Realization [Yogoda Sat- sanga] teachings are the highest truth and scientific techniques given to mankind by God and the Great Ones. The aftereffects of Kriya bring with them the utmost peace and bliss. The joy that comes with Kriya is greater than the joys of all pleasurable physical sensations put together. \"Unat- tracted to the sensory world, the yogi experiences the ever-new joy inherent in the Self. Engaged in the divine union of the soul * Luke 12:22."},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"436 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST with Spirit, he attains bliss indestructible.\"* From that joy ex- perienced in meditation I receive the rest of a thousand sleeps. Sleep becomes virtually unnecessary to the advanced Kriya Yogi. When by Kriya Yoga the devotee enters samadhi, wherein his eyes, breath, and heart are quieted, another world comes into view. Breath, sound, and movement of the eyes belong to this world. But the yogi who has control of the breatht may enter the heavenly astral and causal worlds and commune there with God's saints, or enter cosmic consciousness and com- mune with God. The yogi is not interested in anything else. Whoever will give less importance to everything else, remembering what I have said, will get to God without fail. Everyone must eventually get there. But what is the use of my telling these truths to you unless you practise them? My loving attention on you is no wanting; but even if I were to remind you each day of these truths, they would not help anyone who does not himself make the effort to practise meditation. No one is greater than God, enthroned in the heart of every man; yet even He does not force us to seek Him. He has given us free will. But he who follows a true guru, and keeps faith with him by adhering to his instructions, will transform his whole life. \"Comprehending that wisdom from a guru, thou wilt not again fall into delusion, \"t To Find God, Be Loyal to God It is easy to see in a person's face whether or not he is a lover of God. True devotees may be called fanatical in their devotion to Him. The only right kind of fanaticism is loyalty to God—night and day, night and day, thinking of Him. Without this kind of loyalty it is impossible to find God. Those who never miss Kriya , and who sit long in meditation and pray intensely to God, will discover the longed-for Treasure. This world is but a dream.

Sorrow and joy, pain and pleasure, cold and heat are but dreams of this world. The Lord is the only Reality. We should always pray that no test or temptation will ever have the power to make us forget Him. When I pray thus I receive more result than at any other time. Then, even if something very serious comes to divert me, I nevertheless see immediately that I am safe in His arms. It is difficult to know Him. The path to God is like a razor's edge. But discouragement is never justified, because we don't have to acquire or win anything; we have only to realize that v God is already within us. That is why negativeness should be completely put out of one's mind. Cooperating with the guru's thoughts makes the path easy. If the disciple says, \"I can't do this,- it is too hard for me,\" he is held back. No one has entangled us in moods and habits and desires but ourselves, and no one but ourselves will free us. Keep a diary of your spiritual life. I used to make a record of how long I had meditated daily and how deep I had gone. Seek solitude as much as possible. Do not spend your leisure in mixing with people for merely social purposes. God's love is hard to find in company. The Lord is discovered in silence, and Kriya shows you the way. To establish God-consciousness in the souls of men is my great interest. I see that everything else is futile. The one pur- pose of Self-Realization Fellowship [Yogoda Satsanga Society of India] is to teach the individual the way to personal contact with God. Those who make the effort cannot miss Him. Make a solemn promise in your heart and pray to the Father that He bless you with the haunting desire to find Him, that you may not waste any more time in the useless diversions of this earth. Pray to the Father: \"As we are bound by Thy laws of cre- ation to work, may we perform our duties only to please Thee.

To love all, to sacrifice for all, and to have boundless pleasure in helping others—this is the grace I have received. We should do for others as if it were for ourselves. If a coat that we need costs fifty dollars, we spend it gladly. When we can do that for another with the same sense of joy, we know the true spirit of giving. \"My Words Shall Not Pass Away\" May the Christmas spirit you feel not end with today,- rather may it be with you every night as you meditate.

If we all follow the spirit of Jesus we shall surely experience every day his presence within us. For the Christ Consciousness that was manifest in Jesus was not meant to be the light of one century only, but of all centuries for eternity. That is why Jesus said: \"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.\"* The joy that Christ felt, the joy that he told the world to seek, and the spiritual rules of conduct he exhorted us to follow—to love our enemies and to turn the other cheek—are timeless. The commandment to love God with all your heart, mind, and soul was not intended merely for the biblical generations; it is an eternal law. Life Is a Caravan Many who were with us last Christmas are not with us now, and who knows who will be here next Christmas? Such is the way of life. And still life goes on. It is a caravan in which we are travelling for a little while. Some of our companions have fallen into ditches of folly and ignorance, but when they are tired of the suffering they experience, they will begin to seek the safe guidance of the Owner of the caravan, who is also the Owner of this earth—none other than the Heavenly Fa- ther. Even though we part in this caravan, and the beginning and end of our journey are shrouded in darkness, still, life has a deep meaning: to teach us to seek God earnestly. This world may also be likened to a play. The actors do not come out of nowhere; there is a backstage. After their part is over, the players do not cease to exist; they only go behind the scenes for a rest. It is the scheme of the Stage Manager that we come here to play for a time on this stage of life; then we depart. We are not dead—only backstage, hidden behind the screen of time, according to the direction of the Stage Manager. And we will be seen on this stage of life again and again, until we become such good actors that we can play our parts per- fectly, according to the Divine Will. Then He will say: \"You need go no more out. You have done My Will. You have played your part, and acted well. You did not lose courage.

It is only by good associations that you can find your way out of the dark- ness of ignorance. The blind cannot lead the blind. Mixing with those who love only social gatherings will waste your time, but association with those who love God will give you the love of God. The Lord said in the Bhagavad Gita: \"Among thousands of men, perhaps one strives for spiritual attainment; and, among the blessed true seekers that assiduously try to reach Me, perhaps one perceives Me as I am.\"t Very few people are interested in God. It is said that the child is busy with play, the youth is busy with sex, and the adult is busy with worries. How few think of the eternal bliss of Spirit! But he who seeks God, and who seeks with all the depth and fervour of his soul until he finds Him, is wisest of all men. The Lord knows what you think; and if you love Him He will reveal Himself to you. Never Forget God No matter what I have gone through, my joy has been like a silent stream continuously flowing beneath the sands of my thoughts. These silent rivers of divine joy cannot be seen with the eyes, but whenever you dig deeply through the outer layers of consciousness you discover them. Let not anyone else know how deeply you feel for the Lord. The Master of the Universe knows of your love; don't display it before others, or you may lose it. When in the silence of the soul and in every phase of life you turn within and say, \"Father, I have not forgotten You\"— when that kind of devotion wells up from the depths of your heart—God comes to drink from the fountain of your love. The only purpose of life is to enjoy Him. It is possible. I would not speak of it if I didn't know His limitless joy and bliss. You too must find Him. God is. The saints have not lied to you. And I * \"Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out\" ( Revelation 3:12, Bible). + Bhagavad Gita VII:3."},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"442 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST am not lying to you. Then why waste time? Why be forgetful of Him? I know how terrible are the consequences. Forgetful- ness of that inner Source of happiness is the cause of all human suffering and misery. We put forth our hands to receive His gifts of life and sun and food and all the other things He bestows on us ; but even as we receive them, we are unmindful of the Giver. If you have lovingly given presents to someone and then find out that he never thinks of you, how hurt you feel! God feels that way, too. Every day we use His gift of sight to see the world; we accept His gifts of thought and reason, but we are oblivious of Him. If God is ever a beggar, it is to ask your love. He is contin- uously pursuing you; He coaxes you through the words of the saints. Do not ignore Him! March on Toward the Lord 's Kingdom The joy that you felt yesterday after eight hours' medita- tion is continuous with me. Naught else could give me so much happiness. Everything else is a waste of time. Why hang on to worldly delusions? Every minute that I am with you I will try to impress on your consciousness the importance of seeking God. Remember, when you are trying to improve spir- itually, you are moving toward His kingdom,- and when you are not trying, you are standing still, or slipping backward. March on! Use your nights for meditation. That is the way to discover Him. It seems very hard to find God, yet He is the easiest to please as soon as you convince Him that He means everything to you. That day He will come to you. Dear friends, I hope this Christmas will not end tonight for you. My Christmas never ends. It is with me day and night. The Lord is with me and I am with Him. That is His promise in the Bhagavad Gita: \"He who percives Me everywhere and beholds everything in Me never loses sight of Me, nor do I ever lose sight of him.\"* Those who are addicted to wine are all the time drunk.

No tongue can ever describe this hap- piness. The Bible mentions that on the day of Pentecost the Apostles were enveloped by the Holy Ghost. Doubters said, \"These men are full of new wine.\"* They were drunk, indeed, but with the wine of divine bliss! The wellspring of undiluted joy of Spirit lies buried within your soul. Dig with the pickax of meditation until you discover it, and bathe in that fountain of eternal bliss. And so, dear ones, my Christmas will go on forever, in ever increasing joy everlasting. If this joy were limited, as worldly happiness is, a time would come when all would be finished. But no saint will ever be able to exhaust the ever-new bliss of God. Even though the masters know Him fully, His joy is ever new to them throughout eternity. If the delights of Spirit were not endless, even the saints would want to come back to earth now and then for diversion, like ordinary mortals who return again and again. But the saints are eternally happy, as no one else is. This is the wealth they receive when they give up everything else for love of the Lord. Nothing can destroy the joy and peace of their being. That is Christhood. Please Man by Pleasing God Therefore seek only to please God. Try to please man, too, but not at the cost of pleasing Him. To attain the recognition of man by your own God-realization is the greatest thing you can do. Time is flying. Why are you waiting? There is no real- ity to worldly life. Though you have to eat and sleep, one day the switch of your heart will be suddenly pulled, and you will have to leave everything behind.

Why neglect your one Eternal Friend?\" Wisdom becomes dimmed when you use your mind wrongly, or mix with bad company. To seek God is the highest way to happiness. Neither human love nor any other mortal experience comes near His bliss. Anyone who tells you that something else is more important than seeking the Lord is wrong. Nothing can be greater than finding Him who created you. This is why the Hindu scriptures say: \"Forsaking all duties, if it is necessary, pursue Me. For the forsaking of all duties you will incur sin, but I shall forgive that because no duties can be performed without receiving power from Me.\"* Duty to God nullifies all other duties. When you resolutely leave everything else to attain Him, then you are on the path to realization. To be able to do duty to God and to man is wonderful. To do duty to God without duty to the world is all right. And to do duty to the world and not to God is to be like a mule carry- ing a bag of gold. The mule knows only the weight of the gold; he cannot use it. To do duty to God first, and then, with His consciousness to help the world, is divine. And this is what the Self-Realization Fellowship [Yogoda Satsanga] teachings stand for: to gain fellowship with God through realization of the Self; and, having that divine fellowship, help others to attain it.t Wherever your heart is, there your mind is also. Wherever those you love may be in the world, your heart is drawn to them. You must feel that way about God; you must love Him with all your heart. And love Him also with all your mind; if your thoughts are roaming as you pray, it is a mockery. Last of all, love God with all your soul. As you approach God, defeat- ing all your temptations with the sword of wisdom, closing one by one the doors of the senses, and one by one saying good-bye to restless worldly thoughts, then you will love God with all your heart, all your mind, and all your soul.

God is twinkling in the Milky Way, and through our intel- ligence and reason. He is present in every blade of grass; every flower mirrors His smile. In every good thought there is the joy of Spirit. He is everlasting. As you develop spiritually you see that He is your true Self, reflected in you as the soul, just as the moon can be reflected in a vessel of water; you realize that you are the pure image of Divinity. By greater effort you become able to break the vessel of the mortal ego; then the reflected soul image within it becomes one with the moon of Spirit. Seek the Recognition of God We don't want the praise of man,- the recognition of God is what we are seeking. \"For what everyone is in Thy sight, so much is he, and no more,\" said St. Francis. If before Him we are immaculate, nothing else matters. In doing good we must sometimes suffer. To find the Lord we must be willing to suf- fer. What is it to endure discomfort of the flesh and discipline of the mind to gain the eternal solace of Spirit? Christ's joy in God was so great he was willing to give up the body for Him. The purpose of life is to attain that tremendous happiness—to find God. Renunciation is not an end; it is the means to an end. The real renunciant is he who lives for God first, regardless of his outer mode of existence. To love God and conduct your life to please Him—that is what matters. When you will do that, you will know the Lord. Every noble thought in your mind brings you closer to Him. Those thoughts are like a river leading to the ocean of Spirit. Devotion is the one offering that tempts God. He is not moved by all the rich gifts and promises that are made to Him. But into the garden of a life redolent with sweet devotion God is tempted to come. When the fragrance of your devotion oozes forth unceasingly from the rose of your heart, the mighty Deity must come to you."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"446 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST No matter how our thoughts run away from the Lord or how forlorn we feel, still the footsteps of our devotion lead us to the haven of Spirit. No matter how far we have strayed away, through devotion we can still reach Him; our lives need not be spent in vain. Although you have regular duties, they are no excuse for saying you cannot seek God. While others sleep, you concen- trate on Him. You will find you are a hundred times more happy and rested. Do this night after night, without thinking of time. When you are meditating, just remind yourself, \"I am with Him, and that is all that matters.\" When you plant a seed in the ground, you must not take it out every day to see if it is germinating; you will only hamper its growth.

Don't lose sight of Him. The world will go on without you. You are not as important as you think. Countless men have been thrown into the dustbin of the centuries. Do not let your life pass uselessly. If in your heart you love God, you are greater than the most materially accomplished man. When you please God, you come closest to pleasing everybody. So learn to love Him. Don't feel that you have to mix with people all the time. When you do mix, do everything you can to help others; but when you are alone, be alone with God. When you attain Him, all things else will be added unto you. It is not what you hear that redeems you, but what you do with what you hear. Many hear what they should do, but few act upon it. Don't paralyse your determination. When you know a thing is right, why shouldn't you go after it? Why shouldn't you cry for the Lord until the skies are shaken with your prayers? Surrender to Him completely. And never doubt Him. Dive deep in the ocean of meditation. If you don't find the pearls of His presence, don't blame the ocean, blame your diving. Dive again and again until you find Him. \"Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\"* Remember, * Matthew 7:7 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"WHY WASTE TIME!

Use your common sense and intuition to recognize the true teachers who know Him. Those alone who have experienced God can lead you to Him. Use the night hours as much as you can, and the early morning, and all free moments between demanding duties, to pray inwardly to God with all your soul: \"Reveal Thyself!\" Solitude is the price of God-realization.

Earth has no illusion for me; I have seen through them all. You too should realize that you are visiting this earth only temporarily; you are here solely to learn necessary lessons and to help all who cross your path. You do not know why you have been cast in a particular role, so you must learn what God expects of you. Don't harbor per- sonal desires; your only desire should be to follow the Lord's will and to live and work for Him. We are here today, tomorrow we are gone: mere shadows in a cosmic dream. But behind the unreality of these fleeting pictures is the immortal reality of Spirit. Life here on earth appears futile and chaotic until we are anchored in the Divine. This is why, as I have often told you, I am here to testify to the supreme importance of Spirit. Do not concentrate upon ephemeral worldly goals and human attachments. Such fanati- cism takes your mind away from the Lord and your eternal Self in Him. \"He who has overcome attachment both to sense objects and to actions, and who is free from ego-instigated plannings—that man is said to have attained firm union of soul with Spirit.\"* You came here through the will of God, but He gave you freedom to live according to your own will. You should learn now to be obedient to the will of the Almighty. This is how I try to be. Every morning I ask Him to tell me what He wants me to do; then I see Him working through my hands and brain, and everything goes as He wishes. That is the Power you should trust, the Power through which you can find guidance, happiness, strength, and freedom. * Bhagavad Giat VI:4. 457"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"458 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST That is the Power which will give you emancipation. No other duty is important if it takes your thought and desire away from your duty to God; all else is illusion. To grasp this truth I had to remove all worldly hallucinations from my brain, through meditation and the company of great masters. I want to instill this understanding in your hearts: until you realize that God is more important than anything else, and until you spend your life in seeking to please Him, you are not spiritually evolved at all. To Ignore God Is Not Common Sense Is it not true wisdom to do His will and to be directly help- ful in bringing others back to Him? My greatest joy is to remind others of the importance and necessity of remembering God. This earth is a foreign land; we are not in our own Home. In an instant you may be required to leave this world; you will have to cancel all your engagements. Why then give any other activity first importance, with the result that you have no time for God? That is not common sense. It is because of maya, the net of cosmic delusion which is thrown over us, that we entangle ourselves in mundane interests and forget the Lord. Jesus said: \"If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.\"* He was speaking not literally but metaphorically; it is only if the mind has become enmeshed in wrong desires that any of the sense can offend the divine soul image within man. Christ meant that so long as wrong desires lead the senses astray, we shall remain oblivious of God, in whom our real happiness lies. Therefore it is better, he said, to be maimed of the senses than to misuse them. Christ spoke in a dramatic way to point out that nothing in life, not even the body, is of any value is of any value if we remain in ignorance of God. Without knowing Him, life becomes a \"hell\"—a hornet's nest of troubles. There is no security in this world; one never knows from what quar- ter disaster may strike. •Matthew 5:29."},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"CONTROLLING YOUR NEW YEAR'S DESTINY 459 A man with cancer lies in the hospital. \"Well,\" you say, \"that is not I; it is somebody else.\" But I have mentally put myself in such bodies and I know how hopeless those people feel. While you are well and strong, do not spend your time on foolishness. God understands everything; He knows He has sent us to this terrible place. He grieves in His heart at our sufferings. Nothing hurts Him more than to see us grovel in the mud of delusion. He wants us to come back Home. And to those who make the effort to know Him, He responds: \"From sheer compassion I, the Divine Indweller, set alight in them the radiant lamp of wisdom which banishes the dark- ness of ignorance.\"* For every man who retraces his steps to God, there is a great celebration among the angels. They actually appear and receive that returning soul in great joy. There is no way back Home if you weave around you a snare of worldly desires. You came to play your part on the stage of time, to fill the role that you were designed for in the divine drama; but the essential part of your role is to think of Him and to do His will, naught else. Every thought, every act, is deluded that does not place Him first. The Hindu scriptures say: \"As soon as you feel the desire for God, immediately change your life and plunge into Him.\" Each soul must find its way back alone. No one but you is responsible for your mistakes and habits. Once you have found your Self in your soul, you are free. But so long as you are not free, so long there is danger; you will have to come back to earth and work out all the desires that remain unfinished.! Your body is mortal, but the soul outlasts the body. If you die wanting a Cadillac you will have to come back here for it; you will not be able to get it in heaven, where cars are not used. Although the force of desires is strong, the potency of Divine Will is stronger. That Will is in you and will work through you, if you permit it, and if you refuse to let worldly motivations weave nets of incarnations around you. *Bhagavad-Gita X: 11. t Desires may be worked out by material fulfilment or, according to one's spir- itual development, by the mental process of discrimination or the spiritual process of deep meditation."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"460 MAN'S ETERNAL QUEST Seek God while you are young and strong, because in old age and disease you may not be able to seek Him. By the time most people begin to understand the true meaning of life, the body is weakening; they have to spend their time looking after the frail physical machine instead of pursuing the search for Reality. The only purpose of life is to find God. If you are married, you and your loved one should seek the Divine together. But if you are unmarried, obey at once Christ's command: \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God.\" When you know Him, He will tell you what to do. Otherwise, you don't know what fate may await you in marriage. The tragic stories that come to my ears are unimaginable! Terrible tales of human incompatibility. People should be taught in youth how to control their emotions. I don't think anyone should marry without first having learned to control his impulses. Until one is emotion- ally stable, he is not fit to have a family. The greatest thing is to possess self-control; then, if you want to marry, the right person will be drawn magnetically into your life. Ignorance is like a great poison in the system. Because of it we don't realize our true nature, made in the image of God. First of all, find out by ceaseless prayer what the Lord wants you to do. There is nothing greater than obeying His will. It is your desires that enslave you and make you think, \"I want this\" or \"I want that.\" Do not act on what your enemy, the ego, dictates; seek rather to do the will of the Heavenly Father, your sole Friend. So long as ignorance remains, you cannot tell how many incarnations of suffering may be ahead of you. Eliminate ignorance by meditation. The longer you meditate, the more completely you will \"cauterise\" the injurious mental bacteria that have been infecting you for ages. For instance, some peo- ple are prone to anger; they do not realize that they have been cultivating the habit of wrathfulness for many lives. Others are slaves to the sex instinct as a result of bad habits for incarnations. It is best to struggle to get rid of bad habits now. \"Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out (reincarnate no more).\"* * Revelation 3:12 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"CONTROLLING YOUR NEW YEAR'S DESTINY 461 Daily say with me to the Lord: \"I am working for You.

So long as there is a weeping brother by the wayside, I will come again into this world to wipe away his tears. Why should I be con- tent to enjoy the blessings of heaven while others are suffering? The Romance of Divine Love Reform your life. Every night commune with Him; talk to Him,- pray to Him sincerely. Give up the mockery of half- hearted prayer. Say, \"Lord, I know You are here. You must talk to me! Come out of the cave of silence.\" This prayer is ex- pressed in a song I wrote to the Divine Mother when I visited the desert near Palm Springs. Mother, I give You my soul call! You can't remain hidden anymore. Come out of the silent sky, Come out of the mountain glen, Come out of my secret soul, Come out of my cave of silence. I had just finished the song when I saw a wondrous form, the Divine Mother! appear from out of the sky. In response to my soul call, I beheld everywhere, in everything, the Cosmic Mother. I prayed and worshiped Her. She blessed me and talked with me. The greatest romance is with the Infinite. You have no idea how beautiful life can be. \"Unattracted to the sensory world, the yogi experiences the ever-new joy inherent in the engaged in the union with Spirit, he attains indestructible bliss\" (Bhagavad Gita V:21). When you suddenly find God everywhere, when He comes and talks to you and guides you the romance of divine love has begun."},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"GOD! GOD! GOD!

Weeks after his departure his unchanged face shone with the divine luster of incorruptibility. Mr. Harry T.

Our astonishment in- creased as day followed day without bringing any visible change in the body under observation. Yogananda's body was apparently in a phenomenal state of immutability \"No odour of decay emanated from his body at any time The physical appearance of Yogananda on March 27th, just before the bronze cover of the casket was put into position, was the same as it had been on March 7th. He looked on March 27th as fresh and as unravaged by decay as he had looked on the night of his death.

That ancient science is embodied in the specific principles and meditation techniques of Kriya Yoga (see glossary, and chapter 26 in Autobiography of a Yogi). Lost to humanity for centuries during the dark ages, Kriya Yoga was revived in modern times by a line of enlightened mas- ters —Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Swami Sri Yukteswar, and Paramahansa Yogananda. To disseminate the liberating spiri- tual science worldwide through Yogoda Satsanga Society of In- dia/Self-Realization Fellowship was the mission entrusted to Paramahansa Yogananda by his guru and paramgurus. During his lifetime he travelled extensively, giving lectures and classes in India, the United States, and Europe. Yet he knew that many more than he could teach in person would be drawn to the yoga philosophy and practises. Thus he conceived \"a series of weekly studies for the yoga seekers all over the world\"—to per- petuate in their original purity, and in written form, the teachings handed down to him by his lineage of gurus. The Yogoda Satsanga Lessons present the methods of con- centration, energization, and meditation taught by Paramahansa Yogananda that are an integral part of the Kriya Yoga science. In addition, this comprehensive home-study series makes available the whole range of subjects covered by him in his lectures and classes offering his inspiring and practical guidance for attaining balanced physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. After a preliminary period of study and practise, students of the Yogoda Satsanga Lessons may request initiation in the ad- vanced Kriya Yoga meditation technique described in this book.

Caste in its original conception was not a hereditary sta- tus, but a classification based on man's natural capacities. In his evolution, man passes through four distinct grades, desig- nated by ancient Hindu sages as Sudra, Vaisya, Kshatriya, and Brahmin. The Sudra is interested primarily in satisfying his bodily needs and desires; the work that best suits his state of development is bodily labour. The Vaisya is ambitious for worldly gain as well as for satisfaction of the senses,- he has more creative ability than the Sudra and seeks occupation as a farmer, a businessman, an artist, or wherever his mental energy finds fulfilment. The Kshatriya, having through many lives ful- filled the desires of the Sudra and Vaisya states, begins to seek the meaning of life,- he tries to overcome his bad habits, to con- trol his senses, and to do what is right.

These centres are referred to as chakras (\"wheels\") because the concentrated energy in each one is like a hub from which radiate rays of life-giving light and energy. In as- cending order, these chakras are muladhara (the coccygeal, at the base of the spine); svadhisthana (the sacral, two inches above muladhara); manipura (the lumbar, opposite the navel); anahata (the dorsal, opposite the heart); vishuddha (the cervical, at the base of the neck); ajna (traditionally located between the eye- brows; in actuality, directly connected by polarity with the medulla; see also medulla and spiritual eye)-, and sahasrara (in the uppermost part of the cerebrum). The seven centres are divinely planned exits or \"trap doors\" through which the soul has descended into the body and through which it must reascend by a process of meditation. By seven successive steps, the soul escapes into Cosmic Con- sciousness. In its conscious upward passage through the seven opened or \"awakened\" cerebrospinal centres, the soul travells the highway to the Infinite, the true path by which the soul must retrace its course to reunite with God. Yoga treatises generally consider only the six lower centres as chakras , with sahasrara referred to separately as a seventh cen- tre.

Though the word guru is often misused to refer simply to any teacher or instructor, a true God-illumined guru is one who, in his attainment of self-mastery, has realized his identity with the omnipresent Spirit. Such a one is uniquely qualified to lead the seeker on his or her inward journey toward divine realization. When a devotee is ready to seek God in earnest, the Lord sends him a guru. Through the wisdom, intelligence, Self-realization, and teachings of such a master, God guides the disciple. By fol- lowing the master's teachings and discipline, the disciple is able to fulfil his soul's desire for the manna of God-perception. A true guru, ordained by God to help sincere seekers in response to their deep soul craving, is not an ordinary teacher: he is a human ve- hicle whose body, speech, mind and spirituality God uses as a channel to attract and guide lost souls back to their home of im- mortality. A guru is a living embodiment of scriptural truth. He is an agent of salvation appointed by God in response to a devo- tee's demand for release from the bondage of matter. \"To keep company with the Guru,\" wrote Swami Sri Yukteswar in The Holy Science, \"is not only to be in his physical presence (as this is sometimes impossible), but mainly means to keep him in our hearts and to be one with him in principle and to attune our- selves with him.\" See master.
