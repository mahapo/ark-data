Reflecting the myriad ways in which the Infinite Spirit may beaddressed and perceived, these metaphysical methods had a wide appeal. After1925, when Sri Yogananda established in Los Angeles an internationalheadquarters for his society and began publishing the magazine East-West (whichhe renamed Self-Realization in 1948), many such meditations were printed in themagazine; and in 1932 a collection of nearly 200 of them was published bySelf-Realization Fellowship in Metaphysical Meditations.

It is the most practical sciencein the world. Most people would want to meditate if they understood its valueand experienced its beneficial effects. The ultimate object of meditation is toattain conscious awareness of God, and of the soul’s eternal oneness with Him.What achievement could be more purposeful and useful than to harness limitedhuman faculties to the omnipresence and omnipotence of the Creator?God-realization bestows on the meditator the blessings of the Lord’s peace,love, joy, power, and wisdom.Meditation utilises concentration in its highest form. Concentration consists infreeing the attention from distractions and in focusing it on any thought inwhich one may be interested. Meditation is that special form of concentration inwhich the attention has been liberated from restlessness and is focused on God.Meditation, therefore, is concentration used to know God.1[part0008.xhtml#Y7LjA9tBSZC0V3aqvwL_Yw1038]In response to the love of exalted devotees, God has manifested Himself invarious cosmic forms. He also manifests Himself in truth, in divine qualities,in the creative power and beauty in nature, in the lives of great saints andavatars (divine incarnations), and in the soul of every human being. Thusmeditation on any of these concepts brings a deep realization of the omnipresentAbsolute, of Him who is ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss. Andbecause meditation gives direct perception of God, it raises the practice ofreligion above the differences of dogma.In this book are meditations of three types: prayers or loving demands addressedto God, affirmations about God or truth, and spiritual guidance and inspirationto be directed to one’s own consciousness. Select a meditation that meets yourpresent need. To help focus your mind on that spiritual thought, practise thefollowing meditation instructions: Sit on a straight chair, or in a cross-leggedposition on a firm surface. Keep the spine straight and the chin parallel to thefloor. With eyes closed, gently focus your gaze and concentrate your attentionat the point between the eyebrows. This is the seat of concentration, and of thespiritual eye, or divine perception, in man. With the attention fixed at thiscentre of calmness and concentration, practise the meditation you have chosen.Audibly or mentally repeat the words slowly, concentrating on them intentlyuntil you become absorbed in the inner meaning. Meditate until you feel that theconcept on which you are meditating has become a part of your own consciousness.The first proof of God’s presence is an ineffable peace. This evolves into joyhumanly inconceivable. Once you have touched the Source of truth and life, allnature will respond to you. Finding God within, you will find Him without, inall people and all conditions.[image128.jpg]1 [part0008.xhtml#Y7LjA9tBSZC0V3aqvwL_Yw1029] Complete instruction in the theoryand practice of the scientific methods of meditation taught by ParamahansaYogananda is given in the Yogoda Satsanga Lessons.

Drop yourmind into the bottomless well of your heart. Hold the mind on your heart that isbubbling with life-giving blood. Keep your attention tied to the heart, untilyou feel its rhythmic beat. With every heartbeat feel the pulse of almightyLife. Picture the same all-pervading Life knocking at the heart-door of millionsof human beings and of billions of other creatures. The heart-throb constantly,meekly announces the presence of Infinite Power behind the doors of yourawareness. The gentle beat of all-pervading Life says to you silently, “Do notreceive only a little flow of My life, but expand the opening of thyfeeling-powers. Let Me flood thy blood, body, mind, feelings, and soul with Mythrobs of universal life.”To Awaken Mental FreedomSit still with a straight spine. Cover up your fidgety eyeballs with the sheetsof your eyelids. Hold them still. Then loosen your mind from the consciousnessof body-weight. Relax the nerve-strings that are attached to the heavy musclesand bones of your body. Forget the consciousness of carrying a heavy bundle ofbones tied in the thick cloth of flesh. Rest. Free your mind from theconsciousness of a beast of burden. Do not think of your body-load, but feelyour soul untied from the constant material quality of heaviness. Mentally racein your fancy’s airplane above, beneath, left, right, in infinity, or whereveryou want to go. Feel and meditate on this, your mental freedom from your body.Dream, dwell, and feel this body-aboveness when sitting still; the consciousnessof freedom will constantly increase.[image182.jpg]Universal PrayerMay Thy love shine forever on the sanctuary of my devotion, and may I be able toawaken Thy love in all hearts.[image187.jpg]O Father, receive Thou the fervour of my soul, the devotion of incarnations, thelove of ages that I have kept locked in the vault of my heart.Divine Father, in my temple of silence I have made a garden for Thee, decoratedwith the blossoms of my devotion.With aspiring heart, with zealous mind, with flaming soul, I lay at Thy feet ofomnipresence all the flowers of my devotion.O Spirit, I worship Thee as beauty and intelligence in the temple of Nature. Iworship Thee as power in the temple of activity, and as peace in the temple ofsilence.I Will Wait for TheeIn the centre of my heart I have a mystic throne for Thee. The candles of myjoys are dimly lighted in the hope of Thy coming. They will burn brighter whenThou appearest. Whether Thou comest or not, I will wait for Thee until my tearsmelt away all material grossness.To please Thee my love-perfumed tears will wash Thy feet of silence. The altarof my soul will be kept empty until Thou comest.I will talk not; I will ask naught of Thee. I will realize that Thou knowest thepangs of my heart while I wait for Thee.Thou dost know that I am praying; Thou dost know that I love no other. Yetwhether Thou dost come to me or not, I will wait for Thee, though it be foreternity.[image199.jpg]I will drive away all despondency in order to make a mighty effort to feel Godby meditation, until He finally appears.My Offering to TheeEach morning I offer my body, my mind, and any ability that I possess, to beused by Thee, O Infinite Creator, in whatever way Thou dost choose to expressThyself through me. I know that all work is Thy work, and that no task is toodifficult or too menial when offered to Thee in loving service.[image205.jpg]Divine Mother, with the language of my soul I demand realization of Thypresence. Thou art the essence of everything. Make me see Thee in every fibre ofmy being, in every wisp of thought. Awaken my heart!Beloved Father, my wordless chants of yearning for Thee will sing in cadencewith my heart-throbs. I shall feel Thy presence in all hearts. I shall watch Thyhands working in the law of gravitation and in all other natural forces. In thetread of all living creatures I shall hear Thy footsteps.Thou unseen Charmer of Souls, Thou art the fountain flowing from the bosom offriendship. Thou art the rays of secret warmth that unfold buds of feeling intoblossoms of endearing, soulful words of poetry and loyalty.As I radiate sympathy and goodwill to others I open the channel for God’s loveto come to me. Divine love is the magnet that attracts all blessedness.Father, enter Thou into my soul through the portals of my heart’s devotion andthrough my ardent prayers.I will not become too much attached to things, as this will cause me to forgetGod. We lose possessions, not as a punishment, but as a test to see if we lovematerial things more than the Infinite Lord.I obey Thee in the temple of discipline.I love Thee in the temple of devotion.I worship Thee in the temple of my love.I touch Thy feet in the temple of stillness.I behold Thine eyes in the temple of delight.I feel Thee in the temple of emotion.I fight for Thee in the temple of activity.I enjoy Thee in the temple of peace.I will rise with the dawn and rouse my sleeping love to waken in the light oftrue devotion for the peace-God within.Heavenly Father, in an invisible church built of devotion granite, receive Thoumy humble heart offerings, daily renewed by prayer.Divine Mother, open wide the bud of my devotion and release its fragrance, thatit may spread from my soul to the souls of all others, ever whispering of Thee.I Have Heard Thy VoiceDivine Mother, I have heard Thy voice whispering in the fragrance of the rose.

Tempt me with Thy presence instead. Beloved Lord, fill my heart withundying devotion to Thee alone.My Well of SilenceHis laughter caught my heart. His joy invaded my sorrowful heart as I swung in ahammock beneath the pines under the blue.I felt the sky astir and His presence moving through me. My body became still;my power of silence dug into my bosom until a bottomless well sprang up.The bubbling waters of my well clamoured and called all thirsty things around meto come and drink of my inspirations. Suddenly the vast blue pouted and plungedits blue lips into the well of my heart. The pines, the sailing clouds, themountains, earth and the planets put their mouths into my well of bliss. Allthings in creation drank of me. Then, satisfied, they plunged into the waters ofmy immortality. Their gross bodies touched the transmuting pool of my soul andbecame purified and luminous. Just as grains of sugar dissolve in a pot ofsparkling water, so the cloudlets, tall hills, scenic beauties, stars, lakes,worlds, brooklets of laughing minds, long winding rivers of ambitions of allcreatures travelling along many trails of incarnations — all melted in the oceanof my all-dissolving silence.[image238.jpg]O Divine Shepherd of Infinite Perception, rescue the lambkins of my thoughts,lost in the wilderness of restlessness, and lead them into Thy fold of silence.Beloved Father, let the embers of my devotion glow with Thy presence evermore.Beloved God, pluck the lotus of my devotion from the mire of earthlyforgetfulness and wear it on Thy breast of ever-awake memory.I bow to Thee, O God, in the temple of the skies, in the temple of Nature, andin the soul-temples of human brothers.I Worship God EverywhereI bow to the one infinite Father, differently manifesting in the many churchesand temples that have all been erected in His honour. I worship the one Godresting on the various altars of different teachings and religious faiths.Today I will worship God in deep silence and wait to hear His answer through myincreasing peace of meditation.I will mingle my inner devotional whispers with the prayers of all saints, andcontinuously offer them in the temples of silence and activity until I can hearHis whispers loudly, everywhere.This day shall be the best day of my life. Today I will start with a newdetermination to dedicate my devotion forever at the feet of Omnipresence.Expanding Love(Meditate, dwell on, and feel this)My kingdom of love shall expand. I have loved my body more than anything else.That is why I am identified with and limited by it. With the love that I havegiven to the body, I will love all those who love me. With the expanded love ofthose who love me, I will love those who are mine. With the love for myself andthe love for my own, I will love those who are strangers. I will use all my loveto love those who do not love me, as well as those who love me. I will bathe allsouls in my unselfish love. In the sea of my love, my family members, mycountrymen, all nations, and all beings will swim. All creation, all the myriadsof tiny living things, will dance on the waves of my love.[image253.jpg]I saturate myself with the perfume of Thy presence, and I wait to waft with thebreeze the aroma of Thy message of love to all.In the temple of my earthly mother’s love I will worship the incarnated love ofthe Divine Mother.All desire for love I will purify and satisfy in sacred divine love for Thee, OGod!Beloved Infinite, I will keep Thee ever imprisoned behind the strong walls of myundying love.Whether or not Thou answerest my demands and prayers, I shall go on loving Thee.O Father, teach me to vivify my prayers with Thy love. May I realize Thynearness behind the voice of my prayer.I know that just behind the screen of my love-demands Thou art listening to thesilent words of my soul.I will behold God Himself bestowing on me His divine love through the hearts ofall.Naughty or good, I am Thy child. Sinner or saint, I am Thine own.Teach me to drink the everlasting nectar of joy found in the fountain ofmeditation.Divine Father, teach me to worship Thee on the altar of silence within and onthe altar of activity without.Beloved God, purify the dross in me.

He is the fragrance oozing from the incense vase of all hearts. He is agarden of celestial blossoms and bright thought-flowers. He is the love thatinspires our love-dreams.I feel Him percolating through my heart, as through all hearts, through thepores of the earth, through the sky, through all created things. He is theeternal motion of joy. He is the mirror of silence in which all creation isreflected.[image406.jpg]My earthly experiences serve as a process of destruction of my limiting mortaldelusions. In God even the most “impossible” dreams are realized. (“I will givehim the morning star.” — Revelation 2:28, Bible).I am submerged in Thine eternal light; it permeates every particle of my being.I am living in that light. Divine Spirit, I behold only Thee, within andwithout.I will close my physical eyes and dismiss the temptations of matter. I will peerthrough the darkness of silence until my eyes of relativity open into the oneinner eye of light. When my two eyes that behold both good and evil becomesingle, and behold in everything only the divine goodness of God, I shall seethat my body, mind, and soul have become filled with His omnipresent light.The reality of my life cannot die, for I am indestructible consciousness.All the veils of my ignorant outer life are burned in the light of my awakeningin Christ, and I behold the Intelligence of the baby Jesus cradled in the petalsof roses, in the weaving of lights, and in the love thoughts of all true hearts.I am infinite. I am spaceless, I am timeless; I am beyond body, thought, andutterance; beyond all matter and mind. I am endless bliss.The ocean of Spirit has become the little bubble of my soul. Whether floating inbirth, or disappearing in death, in the ocean of cosmic awareness the bubble ofmy life cannot die. I am indestructible consciousness, protected in the bosom ofSpirit’s immortality.I am no longer the wave of consciousness thinking itself separated from the seaof cosmic consciousness. I am the ocean of Spirit that has become the wave ofhuman life.Like a silent invisible river flowing beneath the desert flows the vastdimensionless river of Spirit, through the sands of time, through the sands ofexperience, through the sands of all souls, through the sands of all livingatoms, through the sands of all space.O Father, Thou art sacred perennial joy, Thou art the joy I seek, Thou art thejoy of the soul. Teach me to worship Thee through the joy born of meditation.The Holy Sound of AumTeach me to hear Thy voice, O Father, the cosmic voice that commanded allvibration to spring forth. Manifest to me as Aum, the cosmic song of all sound.O Holy Ghost, sacred Aum vibration, enlarge my consciousness as I listen tothine omnipresent sound. Make me feel that I am both the cosmic ocean and thelittle wave of body-vibration in it.O omnipresent cosmic sound of Aum, reverberate through me, expanding myconsciousness from the body to the universe, and teach me to feel in Thee theall-permeating perennial bliss.O infinite Energy, infinite Wisdom, recharge me with Thy spiritual vibration.O cosmic sound of Aum, guide me, be with me, lead me from darkness to light.I Am Flying HomeGood-bye, blue house of heaven. Farewell, stars and celestial celebrities andyour dramas on the screen of space. Good-bye, flowers with your traps of beautyand fragrance. You can hold me no longer. I am flying Home.Adieu to the warm embrace of sunshine. Farewell, cool, soothing, comfortingbreeze. Good-bye, entertaining music of man.I stayed long reveling with all of you, dancing with my variously costumedthoughts, drinking the wine of my feelings and my mundane will. I have nowforsaken the intoxications of delusion.Good-bye, muscles, bones, and bodily motions. Farewell, breath. I cast thee awayfrom my breast. Adieu, heart-throbs, emotions, thoughts, and memories. I amflying Home in a plane of silence. I go to feel my heart-throb in Him.I soar in the plane of consciousness above, beneath, on the left, on the right,within and without, everywhere, to find that in every nook of my space-home Ihave always been in the sacred presence of my Father.I Am in All PlacesI am beholding through the eyes of all. I am working through all hands, I amwalking through all feet. The brown, white, olive, yellow, red, and black bodiesare all mine.I am thinking with the minds of all, I am dreaming through all dreams, I amfeeling through all feelings. The flowers of joy blooming on all heart-tractsare mine.I am eternal laughter. My smiles are dancing through all faces. I am the wavesof enthusiasm in all God-tuned hearts.I am the wind of wisdom that dries the sighs and sorrows of all humanity. I amthe silent joy of life moving through all beings.Heavenly Father, teach me to find freedom in Thee, that I may know nothing onearth belongs to me; all belongs only to Thee. Teach me to know my home is Thineomnipresence.O Cosmic Silence, I hear Thy voice through the murmur of brooks, the song of thenightingale, the sounding of conch shells, the beat of ocean waves, and the humof vibrations.Beloved God, no more with words but with the burning flame of my heart’s love Iworship Thee.Teach me to behold Thy vastness, Thy changelessness behind all things, that Imay perceive myself as a part of Thy changeless Being.O mighty Ocean, I pray that the rivers of my desires, meandering through manydeserts of difficulties, may merge at last in Thee.I will conflagrate all space and roll over its bosom, unburnt and deathless. Iwill dive into infinity, never reaching the end. I will run and race and spreadmy laughter in all things, in all motion, and in the motionless void.Awaken me, O Heavenly Father, that I may arise from the confining tomb of fleshinto the consciousness of my cosmic body.O immortal Love, unite my love with Thy love, unite my life with Thy joy, and mymind with Thy cosmic consciousness.Let me behold naught but beauty, naught but good, naught but truth, naught butThine immortal fountain of bliss.In the hall of creation, O Divine Mother, everywhere I hear the rhythm of Thyfootsteps, dancing wildly in the booming thunder and softly in the song ofatoms.EXPLANATION OF “AUM” AND “CHRIST CONSCIOUSNESS”In Autobiography of a Yogi Paramahansa Yogananda says: “‘The Comforter, which isthe Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you allthings, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said to you’(John 14:26). These Biblical words refer to the threefold nature of God asFather, Son, Holy Ghost (Sat, Tat, Aum in the Hindu scriptures).“God the Father is the Absolute, Unmanifested, existing beyond vibratorycreation. God the Son is the Christ Consciousness (Kutastha Chaitanya) existingwithin vibratory creation; this Christ Consciousness is the ‘only begotten’ orsole reflection of the Uncreated Infinite.“The outward manifestation of the omnipresent Christ Consciousness, its‘witness’ (Rev. 3:14, Bible), is Aum (Om), the Word or Holy Ghost: invisibledivine power, the only doer, the sole causative and activating force thatupholds all creation through vibration. Aum the blissful Comforter is heard inmeditation and reveals to the devotee the ultimate Truth, bringing ‘all thingsto your remembrance.’”[image450.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"On Finding God"},{"pageContent":"On Spreading Ripples of PeaceFix your mind inwardly between the eyebrows on the shoreless lake of peace.Watch the eternal circle of rippling peace around you.

The flood of peace flows over theboundaries of your mind and moves on in infinite directions.[image466.jpg]With the sword of peace, O Lord, let me fight through the thick skirmish oftrials.I am the prince of perpetual peace playing in a drama of sad and happy dreams onthe stage of experience.PeacePeace flows through my heart, and blows through me as a zephyr.Peace fills me like a fragrance.Peace runs through me like rays.Peace stabs the heart of noise and worries.Peace burns through my disquietude.Peace, like a globe of fire, expands and fills my omnipresence.Peace, like an ocean, rolls on in all space.Peace, like red blood, vitalises the veins of my thoughts.Peace like a boundless aureole, encircles my body of infinity.Peace-flames blow through the pores of my flesh, and through all space.The perfume of peace flows over the gardens of blossoms.The wine of peace runs perpetually through the winepress of all hearts.Peace is the breath of stones, stars, and sages.Peace is the ambrosial wine of Spirit flowing from the cask of silence,Which I quaff with my countless mouths of atoms.Meditation on SilenceMy silence, like an expanding sphere, spreads everywhere.My silence spreads like a radio song, above, beneath, left and right, within andwithout.My silence spreads like a wildfire of bliss; the dark thickets of sorrow and thetall oaks of pride are all burning up.My silence, like the ether, passes through everything, carrying the songs ofearth, atoms, and stars into the halls of His infinite mansion.[image493.jpg]Let me not drug myself with the opiate of restlessness. Beneath the throb of myheart may I feel the presence of God’s peace.I will fill my heart with the peace of meditation. I will pour heartfuls of myjoy into peace-thirsty souls.All spiritually successful persons, such as Jesus, Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, SriYukteswar, Swami Shankara, and other masters are manifestations of our oneFather, God. I am happy in the thought that my spiritual ambition to realizeunity with God is one that has already been attained by all great masters.Each day I will meditate more deeply than yesterday. Each tomorrow I willmeditate more deeply than today. I will meditate during most of my leisurehours.O Lord, with the soft touch of intuition I will tune my soul radio and rid mymind of static restlessness, that I may hear Thy voice of cosmic vibration, themusic of atoms, and the melody of love vibrating in my superconsciousness.Today I will seek Thee, O Father, as the ever-increasing bliss of meditation. Iwill feel Thee as boundless joy throbbing in my heart. Finding Thee, I shallfind all things I crave through Thee.Teach me to find Thy presence on the altar of my constant peace and in the joythat springs from deep meditation.Bless me, that I may find Thee in the temple of each thought and activity.Finding Thee within, I shall find Thee without, in all people and allconditions.Teach me to feel that it is Thy smile manifesting in the dawn, on the lips ofroses, and on the faces of noble men and women.God’s Flaming PresenceI will do away with the mockery of parroting prayer. I will pray deeply untilthe darkness of meditation burns with Thy flaming presence.Heavenly Father, I cannot wait until tomorrow for Thy song. Today I willbroadcast my soul-call into the ether with such loving concentration that Thoumust respond through the receiver of my silence.O Spirit! ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss!

Meditateon it and it will grow larger. Watch not the limitations of the little bubble ofyour joy, but keep expanding it until it grows bigger and bigger. Keep puffingat it with the breath of concentration from within, until it spreads all overthe ocean of infinity in your consciousness. Keep puffing at the bubble of joyuntil it breaks its confining walls and becomes the sea of joy.[image514.jpg]In the sound of the viol, the flute, and the deep-toned organ I hear God’svoice.Within the soul is the joy that my ego is seeking. I suddenly become aware ofHis bliss honeycombed in the hive of silence. I will break the hive of secretsilence and drink the honey of unceasing blessedness.My Beloved Is Calling MeWith flowers, with bright skies, with the divine manna of joy in happy minds,with souls full of wisdom, with songs of the birds, with divine melodies in thehearts of men, my Beloved is calling me to retrace my footsteps to His home ofpeace within.I will seek the kingdom of God in the joy arising from constant, long, deep,continuous meditation. I will conscientiously seek to find the Lord within, andwill not be satisfied with the little imaginary inspirations that come fromshort, restless silences. I will meditate more and more deeply until I feel Hispresence.By realizing God I shall be reclaimed as His child. Without asking or begging Ishall receive all prosperity, health, and wisdom.O Thou Perfume of all hearts and all roses, I mind not how many days of scaldingsorrow cross the threshold of my life to search and test me. Through Thyblessing may they remind me of my errors that have kept me away from Thee.Protector of All, I care not if all things else are wrested away from me by myself-created destiny; but I shall demand of Thee, mine Own, to guard the slendertaper of my love for Thee.O glorious Omnipresence, let not the fire of memory for Thee be blown out by thegusts of oblivion arising from the whirlwinds of my worldliness.Through meditation I will stop the storm of breath, mental restlessness, andsensory disturbances raging over the lake of my mind. Through prayer andmeditation I will harness my will and activity to the right goal.My Omnipresent ThroneI came down from my omnipresent throne of love in the bosom of space and in thehearts of twinkling lights to find a cozy place in the heart of man. I stayedthere long, shut out from my large, large home.I was everywhere; then I hid myself away in the small places. Now I come out ofmy hiding places. I open the gates of the human limitations of family, caste,colour, and creed. I am racing everywhere to feel again my consciousness ofomnipresence.Through the transparency of my deepest meditation I shall receive the light ofthe omnipresent Father passing through me.The moment I am restless or disturbed in mind, I will retire to silence andmeditation until calmness is restored. I will begin each day with concentrationand meditation on the Supreme Being.Meditations on the ChristI will follow the shepherds of faith, devotion, and meditation. Guided by thestar of soul wisdom, the shepherds will lead me to the Christ.I will behold the “only begotten,” the sole reflection of transcendental God theFather, born in the womb of finite vibratory matter as the Christ Intelligencethat shepherds all creation to an intelligent divine end.I will break the chains of restlessness and will limitlessly expand the power ofmy meditation until the universal Christ Consciousness is able to manifest fullythrough me.Bless me, Father, that the single eye of realization lead me to behold throughall the veils of matter the infinite presence of Christ.I Will MeditateBeloved God, since no earthly engagement is possible without my using powersreceived from Thee, I will renounce everything that interferes with my dailyengagement to meditate on Thee.Today I will meditate no matter how tired I think I feel.

Never lose hope. Yoursoul, being a reflection of the ever joyous Spirit, is, in essence, happinessitself.If you keep the eyes of your concentration closed, you cannot see the sun ofhappiness burning within your bosom; but no matter how tightly you close theeyes of your attention, the fact nevertheless remains that the happiness raysare ever trying to pierce the closed doors of your mind. Open the windows ofcalmness and you will find a sudden burst of the bright sun of joy within yourvery Self.The joyous rays of the soul may be perceived if you interiorise your attention.These perceptions may be had by training your mind to enjoy the beautifulscenery of thoughts in the invisible, intangible kingdom within you. Do notsearch for happiness only in beautiful clothes, clean houses, delicious dinners,soft cushions, and luxuries. These will imprison your happiness behind the barsof externality, of outwardness. Rather, in the airplane of your visualisation,glide over the limitless empire of thoughts. There behold the mountain ranges ofunbroken, lofty, spiritual aspirations for improving yourself and others.Glide over the deep valleys of universal sympathy. Fly over the geysers ofenthusiasm, over the Niagara Falls of perpetual wisdom, plunging down the hoarycrags of your soul’s peace. Soar over the endless river of intuitive perceptionto the kingdom of His omnipresence.There, in His mansion of bliss, drink from His fountain of whispering wisdom,and quench the thirst of your desire.

When I find myself, I shall race through all hearts with the torch of mysoul-smiles. My heart will smile first, then my eyes and my face. Everybody-part will shine in the light of smiles.I will run amid the thickets of melancholy hearts and make a bonfire of allsorrows. I am the irresistible fire of smiles. I will fan myself with the breezeof God-joy and blaze my way through the darkness of all minds. My smiles willconvey His smiles and whoever meets me will catch a whiff of my divine joy. Iwill carry fragrant purifying torches of smiles for all hearts.[image576.jpg]I will help weeping ones to smile, by smiling myself, even when it is difficult.In the cheer of all hearts I hear the echo of Thy bliss. In the friendship ofall true hearts I discover Thy friendship. I rejoice as much in the prosperityof my brothers as I do in my own prosperity. In helping others to be wise Iincrease my own wisdom. In the happiness of all I find my own happiness.Nothing shall blight my smiles. Grim death, disease, or failure cannot daunt me.Disaster cannot really touch me, for within my soul I possess the unconquerable,unchangeable, ever new bliss of God.O divine silent Laughter, be enthroned beneath the canopy of my countenance andsmile through my soul.I will try to be a joy billionaire, finding my wealth in the coin of Thy realm —ever new bliss. Thus I shall satisfy my need for spiritual and materialprosperity at the same time.Spreading Divine JoyBeginning with the early dawn each day, I will radiate joy to everyone I meet. Iwill be mental sunshine for all who cross my path. I will burn candles of smilesin the bosoms of the joyless. Before the unfading light of my cheer, darknesswill take flight.Let my love spread its laughter in all hearts, in every person belonging toevery race. Let my love rest in the hearts of flowers, of animals, and of littlespecks of stardust.I will try to be happy under all circumstances. I will make up my mind to behappy within myself right now, where I am today.Let my soul smile through my heart and let my heart smile through my eyes, thatI may scatter Thy rich smiles in sad hearts.I will always behold in my life the perfect, healthy, all-wise, all-blissfulimage of God.Healing Light of GodThy perfect light is omnipresent in all my body parts. Wherever that healinglight is manifest, there is perfection. I am well, for perfection is in me.Thy healing light has been shining within me, around me, but I kept the eyes ofmy inner perceptions closed and beheld not Thy transmuting light.I will plunge the gaze of my faith through the window of the spiritual eye andbaptise my body in the healing light of Christ Consciousness.Heavenly Father, teach me to remember Thee in poverty or prosperity, in sicknessor health, in ignorance or wisdom. Teach me to open my closed eyes of unbeliefand behold Thine instantaneously healing light.For Health and VitalityToday I will seek God’s vitality in the sun, bathing my body in its light toappreciate the life-giving, disease-destroying gift of the ultraviolet rays fromthe Lord.Heavenly Father, my body cells are made of light, my fleshly cells are made ofThee. They are Spirit, for Thou art Spirit; they are immortal, for Thou artLife.The light of Thy perfect health permeates the dark nooks of my bodily sickness.In all my body cells Thy healing light is shining. They are entirely well, forThy perfection is in them.I recognise my illness to be the result of my transgression against health laws.I will undo the evil by right eating, exercise, and right thinking.With faith in my Father I behold the shadows of sickness obliterated now andforever. I fully realize that His light exists always; I may not be overwhelmedby my self-created darkness, except when I willfully close my eyes of wisdom.Father, help me, that I may naturally, spontaneously, and easily form the habitof proper eating. May I never become a victim of greed and thus cause myselfsuffering.Heavenly Father, charge my body with Thy vitality, charge my mind with Thyspiritual power, charge my soul with Thy joy, Thine immortality.Heavenly Father, fill my veins with Thine invisible rays, making me strong andtireless.The all-seeing eye is behind my eyes. They are strong, for Thou dost see throughthem.I Am Not the BodyBeloved God, I know that I am not the body, not the blood, not the energy, notthe thoughts, not the mind, not the ego, not the astral self. I am the immortalsoul that illumines them all, remaining unchangeable in spite of their changes.Eternal Youth of body and mind, abide in me forever, forever, forever.More and more I will depend for energy upon the limitless supply of the innersource of cosmic consciousness, and less and less upon outer sources of bodyenergy.O Father, Thine unlimited and all-healing power is in me. Manifest Thy lightthrough the darkness of my ignorance.O Spirit, teach me to heal the body by recharging it with Thy cosmic energy; toheal the mind by concentration and smiles.To Broadcast to OthersFix the gaze of your restless eyes on the spot between the eyebrows. Dive intothe sacred star of meditation.1 [part0019.xhtml#Y7LjA9tBSZC0V3aqvwL_Yw1027] Keepbroadcasting love thoughts to your dear ones of this world and to those who havegone ahead of you in robes of light.There is no space between minds and souls, though their physical vehicles may befar apart. In thought our loved ones are really ever near.Keep broadcasting, “I am happy in the happiness of my dear ones who are on earthor in the great beyond.”[image615.jpg]I will seek the kingdom of God first, and make sure of my actual oneness withHim. Then, if it be His will, all things — wisdom, abundance, and health — willbe added unto me as part of my divine birthright, since He made me in His image.Father, I have been like the prodigal son. I have wandered away from Thy home ofall power, but now I am back in Thy home of Self-realization. I want the goodthings that Thou hast, for they all belong to me. I am Thy child.I am an image of the supreme Spirit. My Father possesses everything. I and myFather are one. Having the Father, I have everything. I own everything that Heowns.Heavenly Father, I now realize that all the pursuits of a material life, eventhough crowned with fulfilment, offer only temporary joy. In oneness with Thee Ishall find the reservoir of perennial bliss.Friendship and ServiceI will abide in receptive hearts — an unknown friend, ever rousing them tosacred feelings, silently urging them through their own noble thoughts toforsake their slumber of earthliness. In the light of wisdom I will dance withall their joys in the unseen bower of silence.I will behold the person who now considers himself as my enemy to be in truth mydivine brother hiding behind a veil of misunderstanding. I will tear aside thisveil with a dagger of love so that, seeing my humble, forgiving understanding,he will no longer spurn the offering of my goodwill.The door of my friendliness will ever be open equally for those brothers whohate me and for those who love me.I will feel for others as I feel for myself. I will work out my own salvation byserving my fellowman.I know that if I offer my friendship to all, as Christ did, I shall begin tofeel the cosmic love, which is God. Human friendship is the echo of God’sfriendship. The greatest thing that Jesus Christ demonstrated was giving love inreturn for hatred. To give hatred for hatred is easy, but to give love forhatred is more difficult and far greater. Therefore I will consume hatred in theroaring conflagration of my spreading love.I will take the best from every people. I will admire the good qualities of allnationalities and will not put my attention on their errors.This day I will break the boundaries of self-love and of family loves and makemy heart big enough for all God’s children. I will kindle a fire of universallove, beholding my Heavenly Father dwelling in the temple of all natural ties.All desire for affection I will purify and satisfy in attaining the sacred loveof God.I Will Serve AllO Bestower of unceasing bliss! I will seek to make others truly happy, ingratitude for the divine joy Thou hast given me. Through my spiritual happinessI will serve all.Today I forgive all those who have ever offended me. I give my love to allthirsty hearts, both to those who love me and to those who do not love me.I will be a fisher of souls. I will catch the ignorance of others in a net of mywisdom and offer it for transmutation to the God of all gods.I will radiate love and goodwill to others, that I may open a channel for God’slove to come to all.I know I am one with the light of Thy goodness. May I be a lighthouse for thosewho are tossed on the sea of sorrow.I am the servant ready to serve all needy minds with my simple advice, with mygifts of healing truth, and with my humble wisdom gathered in the shrine ofsilence. My highest ambition is to establish a temple of soul silence in everyperson I meet.Divine ProsperityThe king of the universe is my Father. I am the prince-successor to all Hiskingdom of power, wealth, and wisdom.Falling into a forgetful state of mortal beggary, I have failed to claim mydivine birthright.O Father, I want prosperity, health, and wisdom without measure, not fromearthly sources but from Thine all-possessing, all-powerful, all-bountifulhands.I will not be a beggar, asking limited mortal prosperity, health, and knowledge.I am Thy child, and as such I demand, without limitations, a divine son’s shareof Thine illimitable riches.Father, let me feel that I am Thy child. Save me from beggary! Let all goodthings, including health, prosperity, and wisdom, seek me instead of my pursuingthem.Lord, teach me to remember and be grateful for the years of health I haveenjoyed.I will spend less and less, not like a miser, but as a man of self-control. Iwill spend less that I may save more, and with those savings bring materialsecurity to myself and my family. I will also liberally help my needy humanbrothers.The kingdom of the planets and all the riches of the earth belong to Thee, myDivine Father. I am Thy child; therefore I am the owner of all things even asThou art.Father, teach me to include the prosperity of others in the pursuit of my ownprosperity.The One in AllI will behold the Invisible in the visible forms of my father, mother, andfriends, sent here to love and help me. I will show my love for God by lovingthem all. In their human expressions of affection I will recognise only the OneDivine Love.[image649.jpg]I bow to the Christ in the temples of all human brothers, in the temple of alllife.O Father, teach me to feel that Thou art the power behind all wealth, and thevalue within all things. Finding Thee first, I will find everything else inThee.Wherever people appreciate my efforts to do good, I shall know that there is theplace where I can be of greatest service.O Lord of Law, since all affairs are directly or indirectly guided by Thy will,I will bring Thy presence consciously into my mind through meditation, in orderto solve the problems life has sent me.God is peace. Resign yourself to the infinite peace within you. God is the evernew joy of meditation. Resign yourself to the great love within you.O Infinite One, forever show Thy glowing face in all my joys and in the flaminglight of my love for Thee.Teach me to know that Thou art the power that keeps me healthy, prosperous, andseeking Thy truth.I am a spark from the Infinite. I am not flesh and bones. I am light.In helping others to succeed I shall find my own prosperity. In the welfare ofothers I shall find my own well-being.[image661.jpg]1 [part0019.xhtml#Y7LjA9tBSZC0V3aqvwL_Yw1037] “During deep meditation, thesingle or spiritual eye (variously referred to in scriptures as the third eye,the star of the East, etc.) becomes visible within the central part of theforehead.

I will guidemy ship of life, ever beholding the polestar of His peace shining in thefirmament of my deep meditation.I will be calmly active, actively calm. I will not become lazy and mentallyossified. Nor will I be overactive, able to earn money but unable to enjoy life.I will meditate regularly to maintain true balance.Today I will open the door of my calmness and let the footsteps of Silencegently enter the temple of all my activities. I will perform all dutiesserenely, saturated with peace.As I work and exercise my powers of creativity I will remember that it is Thouwho art working and creating through me.Working for GodI will acquire divinely deep, God-given concentration, and then use itsunlimited power to meet all demands of my life.I will do everything with deep attention: my work at home, in the office, in theworld — all duties great and small will be performed well.On the throne of silent thoughts the God of peace is directing my actions today.After contacting God in meditation I will go about my work, whatever it may be,knowing that He is with me, directing me and giving me power to bring forth thatfor which I am striving.I will use my money to make the world family better and happier, according tothe measure of my ability.Overcoming Fear and WorryGod is within me, around me, protecting me, so I will banish the gloom of fearthat shuts out His guiding light and makes me stumble into ditches of error.I will wipe away, with the soothing veil of Divine Mother’s peace, the dreamfears of disease, sadness, and ignorance.Teach me to be tenaciously and cautiously courageous instead of often beingafraid.I am protected behind the battlements of my good conscience. I have burned mypast. I am interested only in today.I will fear nothing except myself, when I try to deceive my conscience.Today I will burn the faggots of worries and fears, and kindle the fire ofhappiness to illumine God’s temple within.Father, teach me not to torture myself and others with the ugly fires ofjealousy. Teach me to accept with satisfaction the measure of kindness andfriendship from my loved ones that I deserve. Teach me not to moan for what Imay not receive. Teach me to use love instead of jealousy to rouse others to dotheir duty toward me.As the sun spreads vital rays of light, I will spread rays of hope in the heartsof the poor and forsaken, and kindle a new strength in the hearts of those whothink that they are failures.I will seek divine safety first, last, and all the time in the constantunderlying thought of God, my greatest Friend and Protector.Heavenly Spirit, bless me that I may easily find happiness instead of becomingworried at every test and difficulty.Overcoming AngerI make up my mind never more to wear anger on my face. I will not inject thepoison of anger in the heart of my peace and thus kill my spiritual life.I will be angry only with anger and with nothing else. I cannot be angry withanyone because the good and the bad both are divine brethren, born of my onedivine Father.I will calm the wrath of others by the good example of my tranquillity,especially when I see my brothers suffering from the delirium of anger.Teach me not to kindle anger and thus devastate with the conflagration of wraththe green oasis of peace within me and in others. Teach me rather to extinguishanger with the torrents of my unceasing love.Heavenly Father, command the lake of my kindness ever to remain undisturbed bythe storms of misery-making anger.[image720.jpg]On Criticism and MisunderstandingI will not waste my time in talking about the faults of others. If I find myselfinclined to enjoy criticising others I will first talk loudly against myselfbefore others.I will criticise no one unless asked by him to do so, and then only with adesire to help.I will try to please everyone by kind, considerate actions, ever striving toremove any misunderstanding knowingly or unknowingly caused by me.I will always hold aloft an unfading torchlight of continuous kindness to guidethe hearts of those who misunderstand me.I wipe away my tears of sorrow, finding it does not matter to Thee whether Iplay a big or a small part, so long as I play it well.I will seek God first; then all my desires will be satisfied. Whether I live ina palace or in a hut will make no difference.I will use my honestly acquired money to live simply, doing away with luxury.I make up my mind that nobody can excite me by insulting words or deeds, andthat nobody can influence me by praise to think I am greater than I am.I will care nothing for cruel, false criticism nor for garlands of praise. Mysole desire is to do Thy will, to please Thee, my Heavenly Father.I will speak the truth, but I will at all times avoid speaking unpleasant orharmful truths. I will offer no criticism that is not motivated by kindness.I will spread the sunshine of my goodwill wherever the darkness ofmisunderstanding lies.On Humility and PrideAll my powers are but borrowed powers from Thee. No one is greater than Thee, Omy Father! I would cease to live and express without Thy wisdom and strength.Thou art so big; I am so little.Train me not to be proud. Thou art the Guru-Preceptor, teaching in the temple ofall souls. I bow to Thee at the feet of everyone.I will conquer pride by humility, wrath by love, excitement by calmness,selfishness by unselfishness, evil by good, ignorance by knowledge, andrestlessness by the ineffable peace acquired in the stillness of inner silence.I will take pride in being humble. I will feel honoured when chastised for doingGod’s work. I will rejoice for any opportunity to give love for hatred.On Worldly PleasuresWisdom’s fire is burning. I am feeding the flame. No use sorrowing more! Allperishable pleasures, all temporary aspirations I am using as faggots to feedthe eternal fire of knowledge. The old cherished logs of desire that I had savedto fashion furniture of pleasures, I cast into the hungry flames.Ah, my myriad ambitions are crackling joyously at the touch of God’s flame. Myancient home of passions, of possessions, of incarnations, of many kingdoms ofmy fancy, of many air castles of my dreams — all are being consumed by this fireof my own kindling.I am beholding this blaze not with sadness but with joy, for that fire has notonly burned my home of matter but all the sorrow-haunted buildings of my fancy.I am glad beyond the wealth of kings.I am king of myself, not a fancy-enslaved king of possessions. I own nothing,yet I am the ruler of my own imperishable kingdom of peace. I am no longer aslave serving my fears of possible losses. I have nothing to lose. I amenthroned in perennial satisfaction. I am a king indeed.Overcoming TemptationTeach me, O Spirit, to distinguish between the soul’s lasting happiness and thetemporary pleasures of the senses.Teach me not to engross myself in passing sense-pleasures. Teach me todiscipline my senses that they may always make me really happy. Teach me tosubstitute for flesh temptation the greater allurement of soul happiness.I laugh at all fears, for my Father-Mother, beloved God, is attentively awakeand present everywhere with the deliberate purpose of protecting me from thetemptations of evil.O Eternal Conqueror! teach me to train noble qualities within me — soldiers ofcalmness and self-control. Be Thou their Divine General in the battle againstthe dark foes: anger, ingratitude, untruthfulness. May I raise over the realm ofmy life Thy flag of invincible righteousness.O Father, train the children of my senses not to wander away from Thy home. Turnmy eyes within to gaze upon Thine ever-changing beauty; train my ears to listento Thine inward song.Divine Mother, teach me to be so much attached to Thee that I cannot becomebound to material pleasures. Teach me by Thy love to conquer all desire for aworldly life.Divine Teacher, discipline my unwise wayward senses; spiritualise theirpleasures, that they ever look beyond the illusion of glittering visible formsto find the divine joys of simplicity.To Develop WillToday I will make up my mind to succeed in whatever I do. Will power is atremendous factor in all activities. It can start endless motions of cosmicenergy.O Eternal Energy, awaken in me conscious will, conscious vitality, conscioushealth, conscious realization.Teach me, O Spirit, to cooperate with Thy will until all my thoughts shallconform to Thy harmonious plans.There is hidden strength within me to overcome all obstacles and temptations. Iwill bring forth that indomitable power and energy.Invincible Lord, teach me to use my will unceasingly in the performance of goodactions, until the little light of my will burns as the cosmic blaze of Thineall-powerful will.Beloved Father, I know that by strong will power I can overcome disease,failure, and ignorance, but the will vibration must be stronger than thevibration of physical or mental disease. The more chronic the disease, thestronger, steadier, and more unflinching must be my determination, faith, andeffort of will.Today I will cultivate initiative. The man of initiative creates something fromnothing; he makes the impossible possible by the great inventive power ofSpirit.Heavenly Father, help me to strengthen my will power. Teach me not to beenslaved by habits. Guide me, that I may develop myself spiritually by inner andouter discipline.I will tune my free will with the infinite will of God, and my only desire shallbe to do the will of Him who placed me here.Wisdom and UnderstandingSince Thine indelible image of perfection is in me, teach me to wipe away thesuperficial stains of ignorance and to know that Thou and I are, and always havebeen, one.May all demoniac noisy thoughts take flight, that Thy silent song-whispers ofguidance be audible to my forgetful soul.I will behold wisdom in ignorance, joy in sorrow, health in weakness; for I knowthat God’s perfection is the only reality.I am an immortal child of God, living for a little while in the caravanserai1[part0021.xhtml#Y7LjA9tBSZC0V3aqvwL_Yw1019] of this body. I am here to beholdthe tragedies and comedies of this changeable life with an attitude ofunchangeable happiness.Since God has given me all I need, I will know Him first and then use Hiscounsel to desire and to do only what He wills.Being endowed with free choice, I am a son of God in reality. I have beendreaming that I am a mortal man. I am now awake. The dream that my soul isimprisoned in a bodily cage has vanished. I am all that my Heavenly Father is.Each morning I will rouse the judge of my impartial introspection and ask it totry me before the tribunal of conscience. I will direct the district attorney ofdiscrimination to prosecute the rowdy errors that steal the peace wealth of mysoul.I will build mansions of wisdom in the unfading garden of peace, resplendentwith blossoms of beautiful soul-qualities.I will strive to make myself and all others rich with God, first and last.God the transcendental Father, God the immanent Christ Consciousness, and Godthe holy creative Vibratory Force, grant me wisdom to know the truth! Andthrough my self-effort and knowledge of the law, let me climb the preciousladder of realization, to stand at last on the shining summit of attainment,face to face with the one Spirit.Shell after shell of my yearning for Thee will break down the ramparts ofdelusion. With missiles of wisdom and grim guns of determination I shall destroythe fortress of my ignorance.Dear Father, whatever conditions confront me, I know that they represent thenext step in my unfoldment. I will welcome all tests because I know that withinme is the intelligence to understand and the power to overcome.I am a prince of peace sitting on the throne of poise, directing the kingdom ofactivity.Instead of being absentminded, I will use my leisure moments to think of Thee.Divine Father, this day I will make an effort to understand the great importanceof wisely using my will power at all times.I will attune myself to Thy wisdom-guided will to direct my habit-guided will.I will cultivate calmness of mind, knowing God is ever with me. I am Spirit![image781.jpg]1 [part0021.xhtml#Y7LjA9tBSZC0V3aqvwL_Yw1026] A caravanserai, or inn whereOriental caravans rest on their journeys, here means a temporary stopping placeon the soul’s journey through incarnations."},{"pageContent":"ChristmasMeditations"},{"pageContent":"Meditation for Christmas EveLift your eyes and concentrate within.

Binay R. Sen, Ambassador ofIndia.The great world teacher demonstrated the value of yoga (scientific techniquesfor God-realization) not only in life but in death. Weeks after his departurehis unchanged face shone with the divine lustre of incorruptibility.Mr. Harry T. Rowe, Los Angeles Mortuary Director, Forest Lawn Memorial-Park (inwhich the body of the great master is temporarily placed), sent Self-RealizationFellowship a notarised letter from which the following extracts are taken:“The absence of any visual signs of decay in the dead body of ParamahansaYogananda offers the most extraordinary case in our experience .... No physicaldisintegration was visible in his body even twenty days after death .... Noindication of mold was visible on his skin, and no visible desiccation (dryingup) took place in the bodily tissues. This state of perfect preservation of abody is, so far as we know from mortuary annals, an unparalleled one .... At thetime of receiving Yogananda’s body, the Mortuary personnel expected to observe,through the glass lid of the casket, the usual progressive signs of bodilydecay. Our astonishment increased as day followed day without bringing anyvisible change in the body under observation. Yogananda’s body was apparently ina phenomenal state of immutability ....“No odour of decay emanated from his body at any time .... The physicalappearance of Yogananda on March 27th, just before the bronze cover of thecasket was put into position, was the same as it had been on March 7th. Helooked on March 27th as fresh and as unravaged by decay as he had looked on thenight of his death. On March 27th there was no reason to say that his body hadsuffered any visible physical disintegration at all.
