I’m grateful for the friends and colleagues who helped meat various points along the path.I owe a number of scholars at the University of Southern California mygratitude. I have to begin by offering a tribute to the memory of Kevin Starr,the don of California history, who took an early interest in my academic careerand always urged me to think about the state’s story in creative ways. BillDeverell knows that I invented a game of reading the acknowledgments ofmonographs on California history looking for his name. He can add this book to agrowing list that speaks volumes about the time he generously offers youngscholars on their work. I appreciate the freedom he gave me to pursue a somewhatunconventional topic and for the support that enabled me to complete thisproject. Karen Halttunen always pressed me to refine my writing and hone myargument. She also assisted me in moving efficiently through graduate school andinto a university career. Finding Diane Winston through the Southern CaliforniaReligion Writing Group was truly providential. She introduced me to the world ofAmerican alternative religious traditions. More importantly, she quickly becamea mentor, guiding me in thinking through the content, organization, and argumentof the book from the beginning.Several others helped me in vital ways. Jeffrey Kripal and Joanne Punzo Waghorneoffered detailed, thoughtful, constructive feedback that helped me sharpen andclarify my argument at a number of points. Christina Copland, a good friend andcolleague, offered intellectual companionship and incisive feedback on moredrafts of this manuscript than either of us would probably care to count. JohnParsons was a gracious host who generously set aside time in the middle of hisworkday for long discussions about Yogananda and Self-Realization Fellowshipthat helped deepen my understanding of the man and his organization. Thetreasure trove of materials he provided helped make this book much more robust.The online community Robert Ardito and Martine Vanderpoorten host provided manyimportant documents as well. The Interlibrary Loan staffs at University ofSouthern California, California State University Long Beach, and, near the end,California Polytechnic State University Pomona patiently provided an endlessstream of books and other materials. I’m very grateful to Elaine Maisner, whotook an early and enthusiastic interest in this project and skillfully guided itto completion. Andrew Winters, Jay Mazzocchi, Laura Jones Dooley, and the restof the staff of the University of North Carolina Press are outstandingprofessionals who have been delightful to work with.Several others have helped out in less direct but still significant ways. BobBain taught me to think about world history conceptually and has been apersistent cheerleader through each stage of my career. Tim Keirn is largelyresponsible for responsible for my interest in India. Through a FreemanFoundation grant, he organized a trip several years ago that took me to Indiafor the first time. That trip planted the seed that flowered as he and I ranTeach India workshops for secondary teachers for several years. A 2016 trip gaveme the chance to visit a number of key locations in the story told in this book:Vivekananda’s childhood home, the Dakshineswar Kali Temple, the Belur Mathmission, the Dakshineswar ashram, Yogananda’s childhood home in Calcutta, andYukteswar’s ashram in Puri.My family has provided ongoing support. My mom and dad expressed enthusiasm andencouragement throughout the project, as they have with all my major lifedecisions. Christa, Anna, and Sarah listened without complaint to endlessstories about Yogananda and with interest to new chapters in the ongoing saga ofthe book’s development. They also agreed to be dragged along to varioussites—though I’d like to believe they actually enjoyed the afternoons we spenttogether in Pacific Palisades and Encinitas and at the Biltmore Hotel. Christahas put up with more than anyone else. She always knew that this book would bededicated to her as a very small token of my gratitude for the countless waysshe has supported me. She made this book possible. More than that, she hasalways been the best thing in my life."},{"pageContent":"NOTE ON TRANSLITERATIONI have been eclectic in my transliteration of terms from Sanskrit, Hindi, andBengali.

In one life you can find God if youput forth strength, energy, and determination. Without determination, He cannotbe found. So remember, taking the Lessons only will not do, but if you practicethem you will get results.”PARAMAHANSA YOGANANDA, Your Praecepta: Step IV, P92, 5Devotees of the great Indian swami Paramahansa Yogananda placed two milestonesin his honor in 2017. The first was the sixty-fifth anniversary of his departurefrom this world on March 5, 1952. And the second was the centennial of YogodaSatsanga Society (YSS), the organization he founded before coming to the UnitedStates, where he lived most of his life. Prime Minister of India Narendra Modiused these twin anniversaries to celebrate Yogananda’s life and work. Speakingat the parliament’s conference center in New Delhi during an elaborate hour-longceremony at which he unveiled a postage stamp in Yogananda’s honor, Modi tookthe opportunity to remind audiences of Yogananda’s Indian identity. Concedingthat “the major part” of Yogananda’s life was “spent outside India”—and ignoringaltogether the inconvenient fact of Yogananda’s American citizenship—he insistedthat “Yogananda takes his place among our great saints.” Yogananda was a guru,not just for India, but for the world, and “his work continues to grow and shineever more brightly, drawing people everywhere on the path of the pilgrimage ofSpirit.”1 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn1]Growing Indian interest in Yogananda illustrates the so-called pizza effect, inwhich Indian teachers develop significant followings in their homeland onlyafter they establish successful ministries overseas.2 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn2]In recent years, a number of prominent Indians have claimed Yogananda as theirguru. Indian cricket champion Virat Kohli, for example, revealed thatYogananda’s Autobiography of a Yogi was the secret of his success and could befor many others as well. “The understanding and implementation of the knowledgein this book,” Kohli promised, “will change your whole perspective and life.Believe in the divine and keep marching on doing good deeds.”3[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn3] Once known largely as a spiritual guide to Americans,Yogananda has increasingly been claimed by Indians as one of their own.Images [../figures/f0002-02.jpg]The Indian government’s stamp commemorating the centennial of Yogananda’sorganizational work, beginning with the Ranchi ashram (pictured). YogodaSatsanga Society is the India affiliate of the Self-Realization Fellowship,headquartered in Los Angeles. The stamp was unveiled by Prime Minister NarendraModi during an hour-long ceremony on March 7, 2017.Paradoxically, a part of Indians’ attraction to Yogananda stems from hisinfluence overseas, especially in the United States, as the herald of yoga. TheUnited Nations’ establishment of International Yoga Day in 2015, largely atModi’s urging, inspired a number of Indians to declare Yogananda’s unrivaledimportance in spreading yoga worldwide. One Times of India writer boldly claimedthat if the United Nations had so easily welcomed International Yoga Day, “muchof the credit must go to Paramhansa Yogananda, India’s first guru in the U.S.”Though he was not as well known among Indians as the ubiquitous SwamiVivekananda, Yogananda nevertheless “played a huge role in laying the foundationfor yoga in the United States a century ago.”4 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn4]Another writer asserted that the advent of International Yoga Day was anopportune time to “tip our hats to the teacher who first introduced the modernworld to the transformative power of yoga as a timeless inner discipline.”5[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn5] And a third declared, “We should pay homage to theenlightened mystic Paramhansa Yogananda who started it all,” introducing yoga toAmericans a century earlier.6 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn6] Calling YoganandaAmerica’s first yogi may be an overstatement, but not by much. Given his imprinton the American spiritual landscape, it is appropriate to call him the Father ofYoga in the West, as followers of both Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF), hisAmerican organization, and YSS routinely do.7 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn7]Yogananda’s followers have been making this claim in some fashion for decades,honoring him as the Indian founder of an international yoga organizationheadquartered in the United States. On March 7, 1977, forty years before Modi’scommemoration, a similar—though much more subdued—ceremony took place inrecognition of Yogananda’s importance. On that occasion, a small group of SRFleaders, YSS members, and Indian dignitaries gathered at YSS’s Dakshineswarashram in Calcutta to honor Yogananda on the twenty-fifth anniversary of hisdeath, likewise with the issuing of a postage stamp. Appropriately enough,former Indian ambassador to the United States Binay R. Sen led thecommemoration: it was at a dinner in Sen’s honor that Yogananda had departedthis world in 1952.8 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn8]The location of the 1977 event was another reminder of Yogananda’s Indianidentity. The Dakshineswar property had been acquired as a result of Yogananda’sreturn visit to India in 1935–36 after fifteen years of ministry in the UnitedStates. The site recalled the vital importance of that trip, when Yogananda’sguru Sri Yukteswar bestowed the title Paramahansa on him. The Dakshineswarashram abuts the Hooghly River half a mile upstream from the imposing Kalitemple that Yogananda often visited as a young man in search of spiritual truth.But the Dakshineswar ashram also hints at Yogananda’s American identity. On theopposite bank of the Hooghly River sits the Ramakrishna Math and Missionheadquarters, established by Swami Vivekananda. Yogananda chose the Dakshineswarlocation precisely because of this proximity. He wished to found an ashramwithin view of Ramakrishna Math as a reminder of Vivekananda, the first Hindumissionary to America and the inspiration of his own missionary endeavor.9[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn9] Following in Vivekananda’s footsteps, the youngBengali swami from an unremarkable middle-class Indian family had departed fromthis very city in 1920, arriving in a United States suspicious of Indians andHindu beliefs. For more than thirty years, America was his home. He formedSelf-Realization Fellowship shortly after his arrival, moved his headquarters toLos Angeles in 1925, acquired property throughout Southern California andelsewhere, and made disciples all over the country before expanding his missionoverseas. He died an American citizen in Los Angeles and—after an abortiveattempt was made to ship his body to India—was interred in a local cemetery.Images [../figures/f0004-03.jpg]Yogoda Satsanga Ashram in Dakshineswar, Calcutta, looking across the HooghlyRiver toward Swami Vivekananda’s Ramakrishna Math and Mission at Belur.Yogananda purposely chose this property for its proximity to sites associatedwith Vivekananda and his guru. The ashram is less than a mile from theDakshineswar Kali Temple, where Sri Ramakrishna lived for many years.If Yogananda’s national identity is complex, his identity as a religious leaderis even more so. The popular recent trend toward being “spiritual but notreligious” has led several admirers to associate Yogananda with contemporaryyoga as a popular postural health practice focused on mindfulness, which theyexplicitly distinguish from normative religious practice. One describesYogananda as a “forerunner to a breed of twenty-first century psychologists,psychotherapists and neuroscientists who are generating powerful new insights onhuman nature—all aligned with Yogananda’s how-to-live teaching.” Although thisauthor accurately identifies the “empirical, scientific nature” Yoganandaclaimed for his meditation technique, he completely ignores Yogananda’s explicitcentral goal, the experience of God.10 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn10] Popularspeaker and author Deepak Chopra has expressed similar admiration for Yoganandaas a forebear of New Age spirituality, the “most viable spiritual movement inplace,” rather than the “dogma” and “aggressive fundamentalism” of religion.11[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn11] In his speech announcing the 2017 commemorativestamp, Prime Minister Modi, who practices yoga daily, engaged in similar featsof wishful thinking.12 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn12] Lamenting that it is“unfortunate that some people link spirituality with religion, whereas the twoare very different,” Modi asserted that Yogananda had been interested in theformer (antaryatra, “the inner journey,” or self-realization), not the latter(mukti, liberation).13 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn13]These false dichotomies distort Yogananda’s identity. He was a teacher both ofthe inner journey of self-realization and of religion. His first book was TheScience of Religion; he first came to the United States to attend a gathering ofreligious leaders; he incorporated SRF as a “church” in 1935; and local brancheshave long hosted weekly Sunday services with devotional singing, prayer, and asermon.14 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn14] Self-Realization Fellowship, in otherwords, bears all the marks that advocates of spirituality attribute to religion.It is a hierarchical institution with formal membership that firmly regulatesnormative beliefs and practices focused on the transcendent reality of intimatecommunion with the divine. Self-Realization Fellowship conforms to the featuresof Modern Denominational Yoga, as stated in yoga scholar Elizabeth De Michelis’sinfluential typology, in that it is collectivist, tightly structured, makesdemands on members, has stable belief and organizational systems, and promotesadherence to its own beliefs, rules, and sources of authority.15[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn15]The leaders of the religious organizations Yogananda established remain theprimary custodians of their master’s legacy. When YSS-SRF representatives metwith Prime Minister Modi at Parliament House in New Delhi in March 2016 to thankhim for his efforts to establish International Yoga Day, they presented him witha letter from then-SRF president Sri Daya Mata expressing her “warm good wishesand prayers that God may guide and bless you in the work you are doing for thewell-being and upliftment of India.” Mata reminded the prime minister thatYogananda sought to disseminate yoga globally to promote unity through communionwith the one God:Although he spent much of his time in the West disseminating India’s ancientscience of yoga meditation for attaining direct personal experience of God,Paramahansaji always cherished a deep love of India in his heart and left hisphysical form while speaking the words of his poem, “My India.” One of his goalswas to promote unity between East and West, and over the years seekers of manyfaiths and nationalities have been drawn to his universal message. He predictedthat one day the message of yoga would encircle the globe aiding in theestablishment of world peace on the basis of humanity’s direct perception of theone God.16 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn16]Yogananda’s global vision has been realized. Today, SRF has a truly worldwidepresence with centers on six continents, in nearly sixty countries, including170 in the United States and more than 300 in other countries.17[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn17]YOGANANDA AS A PIONEERING GLOBAL GURUIn this book, I explore Paramahansa Yogananda’s ministry as an Indian, anAmerican, and the founder of a global religious organization. Yogananda thusilluminates the role of religion in transnational history, a topic that hasreceived scant attention from historians pursuing transnational themes in themodern era.18 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn18] Investigating Yogananda opens acrucial window on the role of Hinduism in the development of earlytwentieth-century American religion. But Yogananda’s hybridity extends beyond anIndian-American binary. Through overseas travel, participation in internationalreligious gatherings, the creation of SRF branches around the world, and talksand articles addressing global issues, he became one of the earliest “globalgurus,” figures who “function as spokespersons, apologists, and unifiers of theHindu religion” and “creators of newer and more universalized religious formsthat break the bounds of territory, race, and ethnicity.”19[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn19] Yogananda exemplified “transnational transcendence,”an attempt to reenchant the modern world with a universal message thatintentionally rises above national borders.20 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn20] Morerecent gurus have fueled the expansion of their global ministries by reachingout to growing diaspora Indian communities, taking advantage of inexpensive airtravel to connect with followers, and, in the past few decades, using theInternet to establish a virtual presence.21 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn21] Withoutthe advantage of any of these later developments, Yogananda nurtured a fruitfultransnational ministry. Yogananda illustrates, as religion scholar Amanda Luciasays regarding more recent global gurus, “an alternative narrative toglobalization, which has often been imagined as a movement from center toperiphery.” Like later global gurus, Yogananda spread his message fromperipheral India to the center of the modern world, the United States.22[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn22]The first Indian to establish a thriving American ministry, Yogananda played asignificant role in popularizing yoga meditation and the Hindu cosmologicaltenets that have become increasingly prevalent in the United States. HisAmerican ministry, which spanned more than three decades, from 1920 to 1952, wasestablished in the United States much earlier than organizations from thecounterculture or hippie era, such as the International Society for KrishnaConsciousness (popularly known as the Hare Krishna movement) and TranscendentalMeditation. And unlike the founders of these two movements, Swami Prabhupada andMaharishi Mahesh Yogi, Yogananda chose to base his international headquarters inthe United States. Yogananda’s influence has proved at least as enduring as thatof Prabhupada and the Maharishi. Self-Realization Fellowship remains a robustorganization that boasts thousands of members and countless more casualfollowers around the world, due in large part to Yogananda’s teachings andwritings, particularly Autobiography of a Yogi, which is available in four dozenlanguages.The ministry’s success represents the emergence of a significant and distinctivephenomenon: a thriving, century-old form of modern American Hinduism. This newreligious movement emerged not, like Theosophy, through the inventiveness ofAmericans discovering Asian traditions, nor as part of a larger Indian diasporacommunity transplanting its own practices, as began to happen in significantnumbers after 1965, but through the intentional evangelism of one teacher whosepractitioners were overwhelmingly white Americans. He was “a missionary,” asSRF’s current president, Brother Chidananda, once said, of an “ancient traditionof yoga meditation.”23 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn23]RELIGIOUS NATIONALISM AND MISSIONARY HINDUISMFive features of Yogananda’s life and ministry shed crucial light on the modernglobal religious landscape. First, Yogananda’s ministry was fueled by areligious nationalism that led him to conclude, with other leading Indians ofhis day, that Hinduism could uniquely fill the spiritual void in “the West.” Asan Indian nationalist residing overseas, he was monitored, as were other Britishsubjects of the British Empire, by government officials for possible subversion.But they eventually concluded that his brand of nationalism was harmless. ThoughYogananda was sympathetic to calls for Indian independence, he expressed hisnationalism not primarily through politics but through culture. Throughout hislife, Yogananda expressed ardent affection for his homeland and its traditionsin prose and verse. But paradoxically, rather than rooting him in India, thataffection drove him to the United States, where he sought to cultivate the samelove among open-minded Americans. He abandoned the typical Indian pattern ofmonastic renunciation, wherein a handful of would-be disciples seek him out forface-to-face mentorship, and instead became an evangelist in reverse. As hetraveled throughout a nation that routinely sent missionaries to his homeland,he spread the good news of Kriya Yoga. Few Americans had ever been instructedabout yoga, since the Indian diaspora at the time was extremely small andconsisted largely of Sikhs.24 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn24] In short, Yoganandachose to proselytize Americans as a Hindu missionary.25[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn25]If conversion is, as historian Nicholas Dirks says, about “the project oftranslation, the shifting of one context to another,”26[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn26] Yogananda shared the conviction of many later gurusthat traditional Hindu beliefs and practices could be translated into a“language that resonates with modernity” and would be compelling to earnestseekers overseas, not just in India.27 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn27] Yogananda’sfundamental conviction that Hindu dharma was universal, transportable, andtranslatable—rather than being the preserve of India and its people—was ofrelatively recent vintage at the time he launched his mission. It was shaped bya view of world religions that, though complex, was ultimately inclusivist.Yogananda rejected an exclusivist interpretation of Hinduism, a view Anglicantheologian Alan Race describes as treating one’s own religion as “the solecriterion by which all religions … can be understood and evaluated.” Indeed,Yogananda frequently criticized Christianity for such narrowness. And he oftenarticulated an ostensibly pluralistic position, in which, according to Race,“religions must acknowledge their need of each other if the full truth about Godis to be available to mankind.”28 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn28] But as withVivekananda and other modern Hindu teachers, Yogananda’s pluralism wassubordinated to his conviction that Hinduism was the wellspring of truth.Religious scholar Joanne Punzo Waghorne’s description, in reference toVivekananda, of “the catholicity of his Hinduism, its inherent inclusion of all,[which] could serve as the very model for a rising new kind of universalreligion,” could equally be applied to Yogananda.29 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn29]He claimed to offer a scientific religion, available to all, that transcendedHinduism and Christianity, but this universal religion was constructed mostlyfrom Hindu materials.Some of Yogananda’s contemporaries recognized his inclusivism. Author WendellThomas observed in 1930, “The swami is seeking to explain Christianity in thelight of the supposedly deeper knowledge of Hinduism. Like Ramakrishna and hisfollowers he is using Hinduism as a basis for the reconciliation of all faiths.Like the Theosophical Society, he regards Hindu lore as the source of theesoteric, or essential, truths that underlie the exoteric, or literal, truths ofChristianity.”30 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn30] Yogananda’s deft, eruditeintegration of Christian teaching into a larger Hindu worldview was vital to hisappeal to Americans who were more charitable toward his views than Thomas. Formany American seekers, Yogananda’s Hinduism fulfilled Christian aspirations in away that American Christianity never could.Yogananda was not the first missionary of universal Hinduism, as Thomas noted,but he was more successful than his predecessors. None of the prior Indianspiritual teachers established a movement of comparable size or duration. SwamiVivekananda, who came to the United States in 1893 to attend the World’sParliament of Religions held in conjunction with the World Columbian Expositionin Chicago, was the most influential forerunner of Yogananda, and he issometimes characterized as an evangelist for Hinduism and yoga. But Yogananda,who consciously emulated Vivekananda, played a much more significant role inreshaping the American cultural and religious landscape. In part this is becauseVivekananda only belatedly adopted the role of evangelist. He originally came tothe United States seeking donations for social welfare projects in India andgradually adopted the role of religious teacher only after he recognized hisaudiences’ interest in yoga and Indian philosophy. This lack of intentional,strategic evangelizing blunted his impact. Also, Vivekananda spent much lesstime in the United States than Yogananda; he toured the nation for three yearsafter the World’s Parliament and then paid a short second visit in 1899 justbefore his premature death at age thirty-nine. Finally, the modestinfrastructure Vivekananda left behind through the Vedanta Society was notrobust enough to survive his death. His successors were often less gregariousand more ambivalent about outreach than Vivekananda. A few Vedanta centersclosed, while others limped along in the early decades of the twentieth century.Only after World War II did the Vedanta Society enjoy vibrancy in the UnitedStates. In contrast, Yogananda arrived in the United States poised to evangelizeAmerican audiences. His decades of ministry in the United States wereinterrupted only once, by an eighteen-month return journey to India. Hislong-term American presence significantly aided his reputation, his ministry’sreach, and his financial resources.RELIGIOUS ENTREPRENEURIALISM IN A CHALLENGING MARKETPLACEThe second feature of the global religious landscape Yogananda illuminates isthe nature of religious entrepreneurialism. Several scholars of contemporaryyoga have explored its connections with capitalist markets, and historians ofreligion have long done the same with American Christianity.31[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn31] But in both cases, the religious tradition beingstudied was largely embraced by the dominant culture. Yogananda’s entry into theAmerican religious marketplace with a non-Christian product in the earlytwentieth century deepens our understanding of the relation between religion andthe marketplace. Three years before Yogananda arrived, the United States passedthe Immigration Act of 1917, which restricted many categories of immigrants,including most Asians. In a nation that was often hostile to Indians andHinduism, his creativity was essential in finding an audience.32[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn32] Popular stereotypes portrayed Hindus as charlatansand thieves. Swamis in particular were seen as lechers who used mind control todupe followers. Shortly after his U.S. arrival, the Supreme Court, reflecting atrend toward xenophobia and isolationism, ruled that Indian immigrants wereineligible for citizenship.In this setting, Yogananda became, quite literally, a religious entrepreneur. Asan independent teacher, he was compelled to invent a variety of products to keephis ministry financially viable. He created a large-scale correspondence courseto teach yoga, an innovation that transformed the nature of guru-discipleshipinstruction. Some scholarly declension narratives lament the supposed corruptionof early pristine yoga through twenty-first-century commercialization, butYogananda’s example reveals how yoga entered American culture precisely as acommercial product.33 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn33]Yogananda’s success depended on a number of key attributes. He understood thedouble-edged nature of Americans’ Orientalist fascination with India andexploited it adroitly. He mastered advertising and appeals to popular culture.An authoritative presenter and genial conversationalist, he alternated betweendeep esoteric teachings and folksy anecdotes. His warm personality, sense ofhumor, and winning performance style aided his ministry. Embodying charisma inboth the technical and popular senses, this creative entrepreneurial religiousfigure seemed made for the modern American age of consumption. Yogananda had asolid infrastructure in place by the time of his death—a radio program, a dozenbooks, a magazine, and SRF centers throughout the country—that ensured hisministry’s continuity after his passing.HINDUISM IN THE CONTEXT OF CHRISTIAN AMERICA, JESUS IN THE CONTEXT OF YOGAYogananda’s ministry also reveal how missionary Hinduism’s success hinged on adeep understanding of Christian belief and practice. Situating Yogananda merelyin the small stream of American metaphysical tradition, as such scholars as MarkSingleton, Elizabeth De Michalis, and Catherine Albanese have done, isinsufficient.34 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn34] Yogananda can be properly understoodonly in the larger context of American Christianity. The scope of his ambitionsfar exceeded the small target audience of Theosophists and New Thoughtpractitioners he effortlessly drew. Seeking to win over large numbers ofAmericans, he routinely appealed to the Christian mainstream. Centuries ofEuropean imperialism and Christian missionary work made Jesus the world’sbest-known religious figure. Yogananda was a young man when he encounteredJesus, and he was quickly drawn to him. In a strategic sense, comparing his owninstruction to Jesus’s made good evangelistic sense in a predominantly Christianculture. In personal terms, comparing himself to Jesus resonated deeply andprovided a powerful sense of self-understanding that impelled his mission.A careful examination of Yogananda’s engagement with Christianity reveals hisparticular inclusivist techniques. He occasionally called his Los Angelesheadquarters, a former resort hotel, “the only Hindu American Temple.”35[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn35] But he often went out of his way to emphasize thechurchlike features of his organization, whose formal (if little used) titleafter 1935 was Self-Realization Fellowship Church. Before that, he experimentedwith different names, including “Christian Yogoda” and “Yogoda Fellowship ofReligions,” in reference to the name of his yoga brand. Local centers heldweekly services on Sunday morning, the traditional day for Christian worship.Most sites offered Sunday school and hosted annual Christmas and Easterservices.If SRF centers imitated Christian churches, the instruction Yogananda providedechoed Christian themes. He always offered special season-themed talks about thebirth of the Christ Child and the Resurrection, which were typically publishedin his magazine. And he routinely quoted the Bible and held up Jesus as anexemplary moral teacher. Using theological discourse familiar especially toAmerican Protestants, he presented yoga as the essential practical tool that ledto intimate communion with God. “Yogananda talked about Jesus,” SRF presidentBrother Chidananda once explained, “as being a perfected exemplar of what theteachings of yoga were all about, which means one thing—union with God.”36[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn36]But Yogananda’s teaching was less an integration of the two religions than areinterpretation of Christianity in light of Hinduism. As Chidananda suggests,Yogananda regularly explained how the New Testament, properly understood, spokeabout yoga and revealed Jesus as the consummate yogi. He often expounded on theBible as the partial revelation of a universal Indian dharma that elucidated andfulfilled all other religions. And in several ways, most notably in his famedAutobiography, he implicitly portrayed himself as a Christ figure. His Hinduismwith a Christian “accent” selectively adopted loanwords from AmericanChristianity while remaining largely an Indian language.37[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn37]Yogananda understood the broad context of American Christianity as Protestant.He had little interest in Catholicism, perhaps because it did not enjoy thecultural hegemony Protestantism did. And he was a frequent critic ofconservative American evangelicalism and fundamentalism for what he perceived astheological stridency on such issues as the exclusivity of Jesus, the centralityof sin, and the reality of hell, which he thought unworthy of a loving divineFather. But paradoxically, while disagreeing with fundamentalists in substance,he often imitated their style of instruction. He resembled well-knownevangelists in his personality-driven populist presentations that mixedentertainment and spiritual content, practical application and arcane doctrine.Yogananda sought to reach a wide swath of the American public. His message,however, clearly resonated more with some audiences than others. He appealedmost strongly to the restless souls in the liberal Christian tradition. Thoughthese seekers are often associated with the baby boom generation and religioussociologists have created a vast literature describing contemporary seekers,some historians have applied this label to earlier eras.38[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn38] Historian Leigh Eric Schmidt sees seekers asemerging around the turn of the twentieth century, just before Yogananda’sarrival. Many of the features Schmidt applies to seekers fit Yogananda’sfollowers: they longed for mystical experience or religious feeling, they valuedmeditation, they prized immanence in humans and nature, they expressed acosmopolitan appreciation for religious diversity, and they emphasizedself-expression.39 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn39] Yogananda’s following includedChristians primarily from liberal Protestant traditions and those interested inspirituality outside the American religious mainstream—Christian Scientists,Theosophists, and Mormons. They were drawn to the authority of an Indian swami,to his focus on the experience of the divine, and to his integration of body,mind, and spirit in an era when there was deep interest in health and the body.RELIGION, REGION, AND SACRED SPACEThe fourth way Yogananda deepens our understanding of the global religiouslandscape relates to the actual landscape. His life story, beginning with hischildhood and continuing through his ministry, demonstrates the connectedness ofspirituality and place. Visiting sacred Indian sites—Rishikesh in the Himalayas,Benares on the Ganges, Dakshineswar Kali Temple and Kalighat Kali Temple inCalcutta, among others—was central to his spiritual development, while coming ofage in Calcutta and attending college nearby placed him in intellectual andspiritual networks that were equally formative. The very viability of anoverseas mission as a vocation was a result of growing up in a particular milieuof a globalized Calcutta.In the United States, not only did his message resonate with some audiences morethan others, but it also found an easier foothold in particular regions whilestumbling in others. True, any assessment of Yogananda must include the view atthe national scale—he was undeniably an American religious figure who respondedto national dynamics of culture, economy, and religion. But he must also beunderstood by zooming in the view to the scale of the local region. As anonwhite purveyor of an unfamiliar religious tradition, he was rebuffedthroughout the American South, and he fell flat on his face in Miami. In fact,he never seemed to recognize just how close he came to being lynched there.More importantly, he began to gain traction in his ministry only after he foundthe Southern California landscape, with its hospitality to newer forms ofspirituality. His experience suggests the importance of early twentieth-centurySouthern California as a unique spiritual frontier. Though historiographicaltrends tend to emphasize Southern California’s relation to mainstreamProtestantism, particularly the link between fundamentalism and the rise of theReligious Right,40 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn40] a second—and in some cases,older—historiographic tradition paints a different portrait of the region as amagnet for religious diversity. Perhaps first articulated by California authorCarey McWilliams, this alternative historiography depicts the region as homeespecially to aberrant religious traditions. Religious scholar Sandra SizerFrankiel suggests that in the nineteenth century the California climate andlandscape lured a disproportionate number of religious seekers, who perceivedthemselves as distinct from other Americans in their open embrace of nature,rejection of sectarianism, and reticence to build mainstream religiousinstitutions. A distinctive religious climate resulted from this self-selectingmigration pattern.41 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn41] If that was a statewide patternin the nineteenth century, early twentieth-century Southern Californiarepresented a stronger distillation of that larger brew. If the white Protestantestablishment of Los Angeles found even the pluralism within Christianity“bewildering,” historian Michael J. Engh observes, even more disconcerting wasthe large influx of Jews and the arrival of Asians who practiced Buddhist,Confucian, Taoist, and Shinto traditions.42 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn42] Buthowever grudging the cultural elite’s tolerance may have been, it was sufficientto provide a stable foundation for an Indian swami’s movement to flourish therein the early twentieth century.In time, Yogananda transplanted the Hindu tradition of sacred spaces to theUnited States, establishing the properties his ministry purchased as new holyplaces. His Mount Washington headquarters in Los Angeles, the nearby LakeShrine, which eventually housed some of Gandhi’s ashes, and an ashram inEncinitas, near San Diego, all became key places for meditation and divinecommunion. In India, the same was true of the properties associated with hischildhood and ministry there. For devoted followers around the world, theselocations all became sites of pilgrimage. After his 1952 mahasamādhi, theBiltmore Hotel, where he died, and Forest Lawn, where he was buried, were addedto the list.A DIVINE GURU REENCHANTS THE MODERN WORLDThe fifth and final point relates to the “reenchantment” that Yoganandaeffectively created through his instruction and his claims to divine authority.More than a century ago, the eminent German sociologist Max Weber argued thatrational, bureaucratic, mechanized modernity had driven transcendence from theWest, leaving it disenchanted. (Indulging in Orientalist prejudice, hecontrasted this situation with Asia, where he thought spirits, idolatrousrituals, and magic continued to flourish).43 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn43] Weber’sargument was refined in subsequent decades, perhaps most compellingly byreligious sociologist Peter Berger, who envisioned the inevitable collapse of a“sacred canopy” under the weight of modern, industrial life.44[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn44] Although this argument in its extreme form has beenlargely repudiated—in part because Berger himself retracted elements of it—somerecent scholars continue to assert it passionately.45[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn45] The popularity of Yogananda’s ministry and legacycertainly adds to the mounting evidence that science, technology, and thegrowing recognition of religious pluralism did not quash Americans’ yearning fortranscendence in the twentieth century. More importantly, modern audiences foundhis instruction attractive precisely because he seamlessly integratedscientific, positivistic, and pragmatic concerns with a robust affirmation oftranscendence that allowed space for the miraculous.One of the most striking features of Yogananda’s transcendent worldview was hisclaim—and his disciples’ acceptance—of divine status. Though a familiar patternamong Indian gurus, this declaration placed him within a very small group ofAmerican religious leaders. In India, a teacher’s divine status is frequentlyanchored in hagiographic traditions that develop over decades or centuries. Incontrast, Yogananda actively created his own hagiographical tradition, in largepart through his autobiography, in which he hinted obliquely at his divine yogicpowers. His reticence to claim divine status directly reflected hisunderstanding of the humility a teacher was expected to display. It also stemmedfrom his ability to read his audience. He recognized that many Americans rearedwithin a broadly Christian understanding of transcendent deity would find suchclaims difficult to embrace directly. In the wake of the counterculture, manyAmericans expressed concern with so-called cults led by gurus—whether homegrown,Indian, or from elsewhere—who claimed extraordinary authority, but Yoganandamostly escaped such controversies during his lifetime.At least since Weber, scholars of religious movements have been interested inthe transfer of power from a charismatic leader to a successor, as his or herdeath often spells doom for a new movement. The dynamics become more complexwhen the organization’s founder has divine status. How could any successor hopeto measure up? Self-Realization Fellowship successfully weathered the loss ofYogananda in 1952 in large part due to the way he deployed his divine claims toensure the organization’s resilience. His own proclamations helped devoteesunderstand that no human need ever step into his shoes: his teachings and hiscontinued postmortem presence would provide the necessary guidance. Yogananda’scontinued authority has relativized the significance of every SRF leader who hassucceeded him. His proactive crafting of his legacy suggests one creativevariant on Weber’s model of the institutionalization of charismatic authorityand the challenge of succession.Outside of SRF, Yogananda’s assertions of status and identity provided atemplate for his disciples who established their own independent communitiesduring the counterculture era, gurus who claimed the same kind of authority andexpected the same type of obedience. Thus, Yogananda does not simply provideinsight into modern Hindu community formation in the United States. Because theimprint of his personal authority and unique views shaped his disciples indistinctive ways, he also provides a window into the development patterns of newreligious movements.RECAPTURING YOGANANDA’S IMPORTANCEYogananda’s importance as a twentieth-century American religious figure makeshis virtual neglect in the scholarly literature paradoxical. A few years ago,anthropologist Sarah Strauss observed that while dozens of yoga teachers andtheir organizations from the last century deserve their own “book-lengthtreatments,” one of the two figures “most conspicuous in their absence” wasYogananda and the Self-Realization Fellowship.46 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn46]Mark Singleton, author of Yoga Body, acknowledges that Yogananda “inspire[d]several generations of Western spiritual seekers.”47 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn47]Professor of comparative religion David Gordon White argues that, along with ahandful of other gurus, it is “the life and teachings of Yogananda that have hadthe greatest impact on modern-day conceptions of yoga as a marriage between thephysical and the spiritual, the human and the superhuman.”48[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn48] Yet, despite this importance, few scholars—includingSingleton and White—have studied Yogananda at length. In her influential Historyof Modern Yoga, Elizabeth De Michelis reduces him to part of one sentence.49[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn49] And in his discussion of “the most important moderngurus” in his book on Hinduism, David Smith ignores Yogananda altogether.50[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn50]Yogananda has appeared in some trade press books. Most recently, popular yogaauthor Philip Goldberg has offered a full-length biography in The Life ofYogananda. Goldberg provides a detailed chronology of Yogananda’s life andtackles a number of controversies in his ministry, though the tone remains thesame as his earlier American Veda, where he devotes a largely respectful chapterto Yogananda. In that earlier work, he highlights Yogananda’s engagingpersonality and speaking style, the adaptations he made to appeal to an Americanaudience, most notably his “enthusiastic embrace of Jesus,” and devotees’attraction to being “in the presence of a genuine holy man.”51[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn51] Yogananda has typically made only cameo appearancesin other trade press books. In Transcendent in America, an investigation of“Hindu-Inspired Meditation Movements,” Lola Williamson gives due attention toSRF. But because her interest is more contemporary than historical, she dealswith Yogananda himself fairly briefly and offers little in the way of broadercontext. In a remarkable oversight, Stefanie Syman, who claims to tell “thestory of yoga in America” in her Subtle Body, devotes only a few terse, somewhatflippant pages to Yogananda and his movement.52 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn52]Until recently, the only sustained scholarly attention Yogananda received in thepast two decades was through a handful of dissertations in which he figuredmerely as one of several figures. Polly Trout’s 1998 “Hindu Gurus, AmericanDisciples, and the Search for Modern Religion, 1900–1950,” places Yogananda inthe spotlight, but he has to share it with two other twentieth-century Hindufigures, Theosophical “World Teacher” Jiddhu Krishnamurti and Vedanta leaderSwami Paramananda.53 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn53] Theodore Anderson’s 2008“Reimagining Religion: The Grounding of Spiritual Politics and Practice inModern America, 1890–1940,” likewise places Yogananda in the company of otherfigures, viewing him as one of five individuals who reinvented spirituality inearly twentieth-century America.54 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn54]Anya Foxen’s Biography of a Yogi: Paramahansa Yogananda and the Origins ofModern Yoga is the major exception to this pattern. As her title suggests, Foxenis interested in the emergence of contemporary yoga, particularly in the imageof yogis in the West as purveyors of extraordinary powers, and Yoganandafunctions as a detailed case study. Foxen emphasizes from the outset that herbook is “not actually a biography” but a study of his persona, largely asportrayed in the Autobiography.55 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn55] Biography of aYogi shares a few common themes with the present work: the Indian roots ofYogananda’s teaching, his largely ignored contribution to the development ofWestern yoga, the centrality of the Autobiography to his reputation, andattention to the crafting of his persona in a culture that was often suspiciousof yogis.Despite some complementary perspectives, the two books differ significantly inemphasis. In Finding God through Yoga, I explore Yogananda’s biography insubstantial detail, in part because it seems to me that the best way tounderstand his persona creation is by teasing out the ways his life storydiverged from the public image he so carefully cultivated. More importantly,although I portray Yogananda as a Kriya Yoga instructor, I see that as but onerole he played. I emphasize his broader identity as a Hindu religious teacherwho sought to connect disciples to God in various ways. The Autobiography isundoubtedly his most famous work, but Yogananda was a prolific author and poet,an entrepreneur who sold yoga lessons by correspondence, and a magazine editor.His labor on behalf of East-West magazine indicates both his leadership in theglobal interfaith movement and the deep and abiding interest in Jesus andChristianity that was a central feature of his identity. His commentary on theNew Testament, more than a decade of work, easily rivals the Autobiography inscale and ambition. Given Yogananda’s deep interest in Jesus, I place him in thebroad context of American Christian culture. Yogananda was also the founder of asignificant religious organization. And because that global organizationcontinues to serve as custodian of his legacy, which includes maintaining hispersona, any discussion of his significance should include investigation of thisorganization and its rivals.Though recent scholarly work has begun to rectify the situation, Yogananda haslong suffered neglect relative to his significance. There are two chief reasonsfor this state of affairs, one evidentiary and the other historiographical, bothnecessary to understand before proceeding. First, access to sources offers agenuine challenge to Yogananda scholars. Like many organizations,Self-Realization Fellowship takes great care to guard the reputation and legacyof its founder. It does occasionally cooperate in limited ways with those whorequest the use of archival materials.56 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn56] Moretypical is the situation Polly Trout experienced a generation ago, when shenoted that SRF’s “historical archives are not open to the public.”57[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn57] My requests for access were declined due to SRF’slack of a research library and, after further inquiry, to the organization’smany spiritual and humanitarian priorities, which make it impossible to help thescholars who request research assistance and archival access.58[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn58]Still, abundant Yogananda materials are available, and in more recent years,thanks in part to the Internet, the accessibility of some sources has increasedsignificantly. Finding God through Yoga makes use of the extensive sources nowavailable. Though few copies of early issues of Yogananda’s magazine have madetheir way into libraries, I had access to the vast majority of issues from 1925through 1960 for this project, which proved invaluable for understanding hisviews. Not only was he responsible for overall content and tone of the nearlytwo hundred issues that ran during his lifetime, but he also contributed morethan eight hundred articles. Yogananda’s yoga course was the instructional heartof his ministry. Early editions of the lessons are now available and provideessential insight into his teachings. Though SRF’s editions remain private andsecret, copies can be accessed in various ways and reveal changes that have beenmade over the years. And apart from the Autobiography, Yogananda wrote a numberof other works that provide valuable understanding. Nearly one thousandnewspaper advertisements and articles about Yogananda are extant. More thantwenty books, memoirs, and reminiscences by friends and disciples—published bothby SRF and independently, some quite recently—provide glimpses of the privateYogananda. Several of these texts reprint letters from the Master, and more thantwo hundred are extant. Scouring various online sources yielded additionalletters, legal documents, videos, and other materials. Together, thissubstantial and varied evidence allows for a robust portrait of this importantreligious figure.The other reason for Yogananda’s scholarly neglect is historiographical. He hasfallen between two scholarly stools, not really resting comfortably on either.As a teacher and practitioner of yoga, he would seem to belong in the burgeoningscholarship on yoga. But, as indicated above, few yoga scholars except for Foxenhave seated him there. His affection for Jesus and the New Testament makes himan awkward fit for many yoga scholars, though this need not be the case, sincehis interest in Jesus and Christianity puts him in good company with many othercontemporary yoga teachers and Hindu intellectuals.59[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn59]Also, he downplayed the āsanas, or postures, that have become a centralfeature—indeed, often the defining element—of most forms of contemporary yoga.60[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn60] But his dislike for āsanas has sometimes beenexaggerated. In The Subtle Body, for example, Syman overstates the case when sheclaims that Yogananda “publicly disdained” haṭha yoga and cites as evidence afootnote from the Autobiography. In fact, issues of his magazine near the end ofhis life include long articles by SRF’s Reverend C. Bernard that provideddetailed instruction on how to perform difficult āsanas (with accompanyingphotos) and discussed the health benefits of each position.61[18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn61] In the footnote Syman cites, Yogananda actuallyexplained that haṭha yoga, “a specialized branch of bodily postures andtechniques for health and longevity,” was “useful and provides spectacularphysical results.” His only critique was that it was “little used by yogis benton spiritual liberation.” Though, as I will demonstrate, Yogananda never ignoredhealth and well-being, he did think that the yoga practices that deserved mostattention were those that led to God-realization.Most importantly, the teleological interest within most yoga scholarship on theemergence of contemporary secular yoga, which focuses on postures, health, andmental well-being, has led to the neglect of individuals who do not fit thatpattern. David Gordon White acknowledges that any element of yoga that fallsoutside the “modern-day sensus communis” of yoga scholarship, such as a focus onthe supernatural, tends to be ignored.62 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn62] ThoughElizabeth De Michelis’s influential taxonomy of yoga provides a place for“denominational movements,” most scholars of modern yoga—including De Michelisherself—largely ignore yoga’s religious dimensions. The influential work of DeMichelis, Singleton, sociocultural anthropologist Joseph S. Alter, and othershas concentrated on modern postural yoga, charting a transformation that anotherscholar, Sarah Strauss, describes in her own monograph as moving from “aregional, male-oriented religious activity to a globalized and largely secularphenomenon.”63 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn63] Yoga historian Andrea Jain offers anuanced definition, acknowledging that yoga has always embraced varied practicesand divergent aims, both physical and spiritual. Rather than treating posturalyoga as the culmination of a secularizing trajectory, she views it as a “body ofreligious practice” with sacred behaviors, an ontology, and a set of values, allof which are maintained by ritual and story.64 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn64] Butmany of the postural yoga practitioners engaged in the kinds of practices Jainhas defined as religious would be quite uncomfortable with Yogananda’s highlynormative instruction on ontology, cosmology, supernatural achievements, andcommunion with the divine. If Yogananda does not fit easily into Jain’scapacious definition of religious yoga, he is all the more out of place in thesecular framework offered by most postural yoga scholars. But althoughYogananda’s emphasis on religious themes runs counter to the dominant scholarlytrajectory, he was indisputably a teacher of yoga—and one of the most popular inthe United States before the 1960s.There is a second scholarly stool where Yogananda has failed to find the seat hedeserves. Although many scholars have explored Hindu gurus as religious figures,both in India and in the United States, the homegrown gurus they profiletypically postdate Yogananda. With the notable exception of Vivekananda,scholars tend to concentrate on individuals who established their own Americanministries only in the past few decades.65 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn65] Thisfocus on the recent past stems in part from scholarly interest in baby boomers’attraction to Asian traditions and in the formation of diaspora Indiancommunities who transported their own traditions to the United States. With afew exceptions, the placement of Hindu leaders in the very recent past conformsto the dominant narrative arc of American religious history in which a pluralismbroad enough to encompass Asian traditions is seen as largely a post-1965phenomenon.66 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn66] But the 1965 Hart-Celler Act’simmigration liberalization did not yield a critical demographic mass ofreligious diversity, as some scholars assume.67 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn67] Thelaw did contribute modestly to the growth of non-Christian religions, but itsprimary effect was to diversify the Christian population, as the percentage ofAsian and Latino Christians increased relative to Christians of Europeandescent.68 [18_notes.xhtml#intro.fn68] The Hart-Celler Act really functions as asymbolic watershed of Americans’ growing awareness of other faiths, rather thanas a marker of religious diversity per se.Of course, many scholars recognize that Hindu traditions—and the interest ofsome white Americans in those traditions—have a much longer trajectory. In thewake of the counterculture era, scholars like Harold French and Carl Jacksonexplored the influence of Hindu religion and philosophy on earlytwentieth-century America. More recently, Catherine Albanese’s masterly Republicof Mind and Spirit has provided a comprehensive survey of American metaphysicaltraditions, including influences from India and elsewhere in Asia.These authors, however, tend to consider Hindu organizations either asindependent stand-alone movements, like French and Jackson, or in the context ofNew Thought, like Albanese. Like the yoga scholars discussed above, Albaneseframes her brief treatment of Yogananda by largely ignoring the role ofChristianity, in effect walling off Hinduism and yoga from the nation’s dominantreligion. Yogananda, whose deep knowledge of Jesus and the New Testament istypical of many educated Indians of his generation, illustrates why the growthof modern Hinduism can be properly understood only in the context ofChristianity.THE PLAN OF THIS BOOKFinding God through Yoga explores the life and ministry of Paramahansa Yoganandain five chapters that follow the chronology of his life, addressing key themesas they emerge. Chapter 1 [12_chapter01.xhtml], “The Making of a ModernReligious Seeker: From Mukunda Lal Ghosh to Swami Yogananda, 1893–1920,” placesYogananda’s spiritual development in the context of Indian modernity, with rapidtravel, exposure to diverse traditions, and awareness of the outsideworld—particularly the United States and the larger West. The chapter examineshis childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, focusing on the spiritualjourney that culminated in his decision to become a swami under the leadershipof a guru. His connection to modernity deepened with his college education andadoption of modern Hinduism, a framework that severed religious belief from itshistoric embeddedness in land, caste, life stage, and gender. Thisuniversalizing of Hinduism paved the way for Yogananda’s American ministry as aHindu missionary.Chapter 2 [13_chapter02.xhtml], “The Founding of a Home for Scientific Religion:Swami Yogananda and Southern California’s Spiritual Frontier, 1920–1925,” tracesYogananda’s early years in the United States. The chapter begins by examiningthe conference that brought him to the United States and the presentation hegave there on “the Science of Religion.” It places both in the context of anintramural Protestant debate that offered competing answers to theepistemological challenges modernity raised for the universalistic claims ofChristianity. For the first few years after the conference, Yogananda struggledto establish a successful ministry. A cross-country road trip in 1924 took himto Los Angeles, which quickly became his national headquarters. This chapterexplores the role Southern California played in fostering Yogananda’s ministryat a time when many Americans were suspicious of so-called Orientals, theircultures, and their religions. The nation’s new spiritual frontier, the LosAngeles region was an ideal space for a new religious movement, a relativelytolerant center that had already fostered Hindu movements by the time Yoganandaarrived.The third chapter, “The Creation of a Yogi Guru Persona: Marketing SwamiYogananda and His Yoga Instruction, 1925–1935,” evaluates Yogananda’s ministrythrough the lens of modern consumer religion, mass marketing, and religiousbranding. The early portion investigates the religious products he touted, mostcentrally his systematic, practical method for God-realization through yoga—inthe innovative form of a correspondence course. Yogananda’s instructioninculcated a larger Hindu worldview, not just a set of meditative techniques.His East-West magazine was a promotional tool designed to highlight his brand’sdistinctiveness. The chapter also explores the way the yogi, like evangelicalpreachers of the time, promoted his message to a modern American audiencesaturated with savvy advertising and modern products. The final sectionconsiders the hazards of the religious market, including negative pressattention and several lawsuits that threatened his brand image as well as hissolvency just as the Depression arrived.“The Apotheosis of a Global Guru: Paramahansa Yogananda and His Autobiography,1933–1946,” the fourth chapter, explores Yogananda’s growing status as a globalspiritual authority and a divine figure. The chapter begins by placing Yoganandain the context of religious internationalism, a subset of interwar culturalinternationalism driven by concerns for world peace. It details his use ofEast-West as a vehicle for a cosmopolitan spiritual vision. An extravagantworldwide journey in 1935–36 from California to England, the Continent, theMiddle East, and ultimately to his home city of Calcutta solidified hisreputation as a “global guru.” The chapter also explores his lengthy exegesis oftwo sacred texts. He provided extensive exegesis of the Bhagavad Gītā in thepages of East-West, presenting it as an allegory for personal struggle againstevil temptations. In another long-running series in his magazine, he interpretedthe New Testament gospel narratives, transforming the story of Jesus and histeachings into a revelation of yogic truth that hinted at Yogananda’s own divineidentity. But it was the 1946 Autobiography of a Yogi that firmly establishedYogananda’s reputation as a guru to the world. An analysis of this text’sstructural features reveals it to be a new scripture, designed to inculcatebelief in the spiritual world Yogananda evoked and in the divine status of theyogi who wrote it.Chapter 5 [16_chapter05.xhtml], “The Death of an Immortal Guru: Charisma,Succession, and Paramahansa Yogananda’s Legacy, 1946–1952,” exploresdiscipleship and conversion in Self-Realization Fellowship, Yogananda’s dramaticdeath, and the transfer of authority that transpired afterward. The chapterprofiles twenty Yogananda disciples, employing a model of conversion to offerinsight into common patterns among those who chose to follow Yogananda and thechallenges of spiritual apprenticeship they faced as Americans raised in anindividualistic cultural ethos. The circumstances surrounding Yogananda’s deathand his followers’ efforts to cope with the tragedy are considered next.Yogananda’s death produced a crisis in leadership. Max Weber’s model of theroutinization of charisma, modified by subsequent scholars, offers insight intothe common challenge faced by organizations led by charismatic individuals,particularly after their death. Yogananda spiritualized his own leadership byindicating that his writings were to become the “guru” after his departure, butthis did not fully solve the problem of human leadership. After the short tenureof one leader, long-term female disciple Faye Wright was appointed president.Her half-century tenure at SRF stabilized the organization and routinized itspublications by and about Yogananda.A century after Yogananda came to the United States with the message of KriyaYoga and three quarters of a century after Autobiography of a Yogi was released,yoga has become ubiquitous and Hindu beliefs have become an integral part of thespiritual landscape. Yogananda played a key role in this transformation. Duringhis lifetime, he converted thousands of Americans. Since his death in 1952, hehas influenced countless others around the world through SRF and independentorganizations that trace their lineage to him, as well through Autobiography ofa Yogi and his other teachings. The Father of Yoga in the West nurtured numerousreligious offspring. Not simply a wise teacher, he came to be revered andworshipped—overwhelmingly by non-Indian Americans—as the very incarnation ofdeity. Yogananda’s story is thus indispensable to understanding the emergence ofcontemporary yoga, modern American Hinduism, and modern global religion."},{"pageContent":"ONETHE MAKING OF A MODERN RELIGIOUS SEEKERFROM MUKUNDA LAL GHOSH TO SWAMI YOGANANDA, 1893–1920Mukunda Lal Ghosh was deeply unhappy. The year was 1909, and thesixteen-year-old Bengali had been living in India’s most sacred city of Benaresfor several months, seeking spiritual enlightenment. His stay at the BharatDharma Mahamandal ashram had been frustrating and disappointing. He did not getalong with the other students and had not experienced the spiritual breakthroughhe had been hoping for. But that was about to change. One morning, he was sentto the market to help with the community’s grocery purchases. There he met SriYukteswar, the man who would become his guru and transform his life. Decadeslater Mukunda vividly recounted the marketplace meeting, presenting it as amiraculous encounter. Before leaving for the market, Mukunda received a heavenlyproclamation delivered in King James English. “‘Thy Master cometh today!’ Adivine womanly voice came from everywhere and nowhere.” Near the end of theshopping trip, the prophecy was fulfilled:A Christlike man in the ocher robes of a swami stood motionless at the end of alane. Instantly and anciently familiar he seemed; …Retracing my steps as though wing-shod, I reached the narrow lane. My quickglance revealed the quiet figure, steadily gazing in my direction. A few eagersteps and I was at his feet.“Gurudeva!” The divine face was the one I had seen in a thousand visions. Thesehalcyon eyes, in a leonine head with pointed beard and flowing locks, had oftenpeered through the gloom of my nocturnal reveries, holding a promise I had notfully understood.“O my own, you have come to me!” My guru uttered the words again and again inBengali, his voice tremulous with joy. “How many years I have waited for you!”1[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn1]The idealized nature of this retrospective account is evident. Yukteswar’seffusive affection is sharply at odds with the stern taskmaster Mukundaconsistently describes elsewhere. And the chance meeting four hundred miles fromMukunda’s Calcutta home includes remarkable coincidences that suggest divineorchestration. Mukunda’s own parents had been trained by Yukteswar’s master,Lahiri Mahasaya, and Yukteswar’s ashram just happened to be in Serampore, nearMukunda’s family home in Calcutta.There is, however, a more prosaic explanation of this meeting. Mukunda’s fatherand older brother—his mother was dead—had expressed concern about Mukunda’sexcessive religious fervor to an uncle in Serampore. The uncle, a devotee ofYukteswar, suggested writing separately to Yukteswar and Mukunda, encouragingthe two to meet, since they were both in Benares at the time.2[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn2] It was precisely because Yukteswar lived near Calcuttamuch of the year that Mukunda’s father and brother found this solutionattractive. When Mukunda agreed to abandon the Bharat Dharma Mahamandal ashramand accompany Yukteswar home to Serampore, his family breathed a sigh of relief.The dreamer would be close enough to home for them keep an eye on him until hesettled down to pursue a responsible career.This anecdote hints at several important features of Mukunda’s early life. Hewas a restless spiritual seeker, willing to travel hundreds of miles from homein search of truth. His quest led to frequent clashes with his family.Yogananda’s father, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, expected his son to follow in hissuccessful footsteps, using modern India’s civil service to carve out acomfortable middle-class life. A respectable spirituality, like Bhagabati’s own,might aid that path, but extreme fervor bordering on recklessness would destroyhis chances. Whether metaphysically orchestrated or arranged by his family, themeeting that brought Mukunda and Yukteswar together forever changed Mukunda’slife. He became Yukteswar’s disciple and eventually took his vows to becomeSwami Yogananda, a man who would ultimately interpret his life mission as beinga Hindu evangelist to the United States.The disparities between the account in the Autobiography and the lesssupernatural version found in other sources suggests Mukunda’s penchant forspiritualized retellings of past events—and the challenges of using such sourcesto reconstruct historical events. Because the success of Yogananda’s ministrydepended in large measure on the persona he created, it is instructive to teaseapart his biography and its hagiography to fully appreciate his labors ofself-invention. It is also the best way to make sense of the context that gaverise to his successful outreach to Americans. Like many modern gurus, Yoganandacreated an aura of transcendence by mystifying the mundane events of his past,and his disciples have often emulated this practice.3 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn3] A2003 film about Yogananda’s early years in the United States, produced by theorganization he founded, Self-Realization Fellowship, plays on a well-worn tropeabout the spiritually adept but technologically backward guru overwhelmed by hisfirst encounter with an American city: “He traveled via the novel Boston subwayunder a strange metropolis. Unfamiliar with Western customs, and away from thesimple living in his guru’s ashrams, the cautious visitor was entertained bymany new sights,” which apparently included tall buildings, busy streets, andelectric streetcars. This anecdote depicts Yogananda as charmingly innocent andnaive, adrift in the big city. And it is pure fantasy. Nothing would have beenmore familiar to the English-speaking son of a railroad bureaucrat who grew upin busy Calcutta—a city more populous than Boston—where electric streetcars hadbeen introduced a decade before his birth.4 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn4]Accounts like this are inspired by Yogananda’s own frequent dichotomy between atimeless, premodern, spiritual East and a soulless, modern, technological West.But such portrayals fundamentally misrepresent the context of his childhood byunwittingly recapitulating British Orientalist stereotypes about India.Orientalists began imagining India as part of a mystical, spiritual, timeless,and effeminate East in the late eighteenth century, a construct they routinelycontrasted, explicitly or implicitly, with a modern West. This representationremains one of the most pervasive and pernicious legacies of the colonialencounter, often repeated in Western historiography.5 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn5]For several decades, scholars of India have labored to disentangle the linkbetween India and timeless tradition on one hand, and the West and modernity onthe other. Members of the Bengali middle class, like the Ghosh family, had an“acute awareness,” architectural historian Swati Chattopadhyay notes, “that theywere living in a ‘modern’ age; they were becoming ‘modern.’”6[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn6]But even as India took a distinctive path to modernity, it did so under theweight of British colonialism. Scholars of India have often felt caught betweenacknowledging the severity of colonial oppression, and thus risking diminishingIndian agency, or affirming Indian agency, and thereby potentially downplayingcolonial domination. As Joseph S. Alter puts it, “Scholarship on colonial andpostcolonial India has focused on the critical problem of identity, control overidentity, and the articulation of a national identity which is neitheranachronistically ‘traditional’ in an Orientalist sense nor derivativelyWestern—and thereby modern only by proxy—on account of colonialism and thecolonial legacy.”7 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn7] The way forward, religious historianRichard King suggests, is by “dissolving the easy polarization of the twooptions” and instead viewing power relations as complex, multidimensional, andfluid, while still recognizing the very real disparities in power betweencolonizer and colonized.8 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn8]Yogananda’s childhood and later ministry can be properly understood only in thiscomplex matrix of late colonial Indian modernity that shaped his identity indistinctive ways. Bhagabati’s secure civil service job freed Mukunda to explorehis dream of spiritual enlightenment without pressure to contribute to hisfamily’s daily survival. Educational institutions (particularly highereducation) deepened his knowledge considerably, while rapid modern railtransportation offered the physical mobility to travel widely in search ofspiritual truth. And exposure to the dynamics of industrial capitalism,globalization, and science shaped Yogananda’s worldview, enabling him toarticulate a spirituality attuned to modern conditions.9 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn9]At the same time, he developed a form of religious nationalism in response tothe British colonial presence and its universalistic Christian traditions.Instructed by his guru, Swami Yukteswar, he immersed himself in the study ofSanskrit texts. He was also shaped by the intellectual milieu of the BengaliRenaissance, whose intellectuals reconsidered traditional Indian beliefs inlight of evangelical Christian and utilitarian critiques to articulate aneternal moral, spiritual, devotional Hinduism that was both fundamentally Indianand universal.10 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn10]Yogananda assumed the identity of a modern yogi, rooted in ancient Sanskrittexts but also deeply conversant with Christianity, the modern world’s mostwidespread religion. Learning about the New Testament as a young man, Yoganandaeventually began subsumed Christian teachings within his own universalisticvision of spiritual transcendence. Choosing the unusual path of becoming anevangelist to the United States, Yogananda offered modern Hinduism to thedecadent West. His message centered on yoga meditation as a practical tool forcommuning with God, situated within a larger body of Indian religious andphilosophical teachings, articulated in modern categories of thought, andcorrelated with their ultimately inferior Western counterparts.This chapter tells the story of the emergence of this yogi evangelist in fourparts. It begins by placing Mukunda’s upbringing in the context of Indianmodernity, including the importance of his father’s career in the British railbureaucracy. The next part examines his adolescence through young adulthood,focusing on his spiritual pilgrimage, which culminated in his decision to becomea swami under the leadership of Sri Yukteswar. The third deals with hiseducation, both his training under Yukteswar and his reluctant completion of acollege education. The final section considers how Mukunda, now Swami Yogananda,branched out on his own, engaging in activities that would eventually lead tohis decision to come to the United States.In attempting to reconstruct Yogananda’s early life, the scholar is immediatelyconfronted by the issue of sources. The obvious starting point might seem to beYogananda’s famous Autobiography of a Yogi, originally published in 1946. Butthis source is problematic for several reasons. Yogananda’s interest inspiritual development—and frequent digressions and supernatural events—often ledhim to give short shrift to mundane chronological information. To take just oneexample, in an early chapter Yogananda tersely explains that the “family was nowliving in Calcutta, where Father had been permanently transferred.” He providesno date or clear reason for the move, and he completely leaves out the family’ssojourn in distant Chittagong that preceded the move to Calcutta.11[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn11]I draw on three sources beyond the Autobiography.12 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn12] Thefirst is a systematic 1980 account of Yogananda’s life written by his youngerbrother, Sananda Lal Ghosh, who lived in India his entire life.13[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn13] This account has problems of its own. Some of Sananda’sanecdotes are suspect, in that he is always present when important eventstranspire in Yogananda’s life, even though the Autobiography rarely mentionshim. It seems unlikely that a sibling five years younger than Mukundaaccompanied him everywhere he went. Also, Sananda’s account shows clearawareness of the Autobiography, published more than three decades earlier.Ghosh’s work is also a SRF-sanctioned text prone to hagiography. This commentfrom chapter 2 [13_chapter02.xhtml] illustrates the book’s tenor: “Those presentat the time of Mejda’s birth said Mother was having severe labor pains. Shefervently cried out to Lahiri Mahasaya [her personal guru]. Suddenly a celestiallight filled the room, and from the concentrated rays in the center emerged theform of Lahiri Mahasaya. Mother’s pain vanished instantly. The divine lightcontinued to illumine the room till Mejda was born.”14 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn14]Still, Sananda’s embellishments do not challenge the basic veracity of the keyevents he describes with much more detail and precision than Yogananda himself.And it is possible that he was present during all of the events he describes.Even if not, he may still accurately recount incidents he heard secondhand fromsiblings or Mukunda’s friends. Despite SRF’s undoubtedly careful vetting of thisaccount of their founder, discrepancies in detail between Sananda’s andYogananda’s accounts remain, suggesting that Sananda penned an independentaccount. His occasional willingness to describe situations that paint Mukunda ina somewhat unattractive light confirms this text’s usefulness as a source.The next source is a recollection by Swami Satyananda Giri, a childhood friendof Mukunda from the time the Ghosh family moved to Calcutta.15[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn15] Sananda confirms the close relationship between hisbrother and Satyananda (born Manomohan Mazumdar), including details about howand when the two met. Satyananda, who like Mukunda became a disciple of SriYukteswar, remained in India throughout his life. Late in life, he wrote anaccount of his childhood friend and Yukteswar’s most famous disciple. Satyanandaclearly had great respect for his childhood friend and reported a number ofsupernatural events the two experienced. Still, he also offered candid criticalassessments and commented that “being in his company during childhood,adolescence, youth, and more advanced years, I have seen him actually as a humanbeing. When I saw the usual weaknesses natural to human beings in the workingworld,” rather than explaining them away as the “divine play” of a perfectlyrealized being, “I perceived them just as weaknesses.”16[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn16] An implicit jab at the Autobiography’s penchant forembellishment, this comment is also Satyananda’s own pledge of accuracy.The final source comes from Sailendra Bejoy Dasgupta, another devotee ofYukteswar, but one who met Yogananda only when he returned to India in 1935.Although Dasgupta had no firsthand experience of Mukunda’s childhood, he servedas Yogananda’s personal secretary during Yogananda’s return visit to India andwas in his “constant company” for more than a year. The two felt a strongconnection, and Yogananda, perhaps feeling nostalgic back in his homeland,recounted many childhood events to Dasgupta.17 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn17]I err on the side of caution in reconstructing the formative years ofYogananda’s life, rarely extrapolating beyond what can be conclusivelydetermined by the sources. But even a cautious approach yields a substantiallyfleshed out account of Mukunda’s family, major events in his life—including keydevelopments in his thinking and spirituality—and the fundamental ways that aturn-of-the-century Indian milieu shaped his development.18[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn18]MUKUNDA LAL GHOSH AND MODERN INDIAMukunda Lal Ghosh was born on January 5, 1893, the fourth of eight children ofGyana Prabha Ghosh, and her husband, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, a careercivil-service railroad employee.19 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn19] Bhagabati’s job hadbrought the family to Gorakhpur, a modest city of sixty-five thousand innorthern India bordered by the Himalayas. Gorakhpur’s key characteristicsforeshadowed major spiritual, political, and nationalistic influences on Ghosh’slife. The city was named for Gorakhnath, a famed twelfth-century yogi, and theGorakhnath Temple drew pilgrims from all over India. Gorakhpur was alsoimportant to the British. After the East India Company conquered the city in1801, it became a regional administrative headquarters and, later, a center forthe region’s rail system. It was a crucial staging area for Indian rebels in the1857 Sepoy Rebellion against the company, a rebellion whose eventual defeat ledto the transfer of India from company rule to direct British control. Indiannationalists came to view the rebellion as the first step in the bid forindependence.Images [../figures/f0030-04.jpg]The Ghosh family home, 4 Garpar Road, Calcutta, where Mukunda lived when hebegan his spiritual journey. The home remains in the Ghosh family, and the roomwhere Mukunda meditated as a child has been converted into a shrine in hishonor. Self-Realization Fellowship and Yogoda Satsanga Society commissioned aplaque outside indicating that the location was Yogananda’s childhood home.Bhagabati’s fortunate position as an educated civil servant profoundly shapedMukunda’s development and eventual life course. By the time Mukunda was born,Bhagabati had been an employee of the British colonial government for twentyyears. Bhagabati’s completion of high school placed him in a select group ofIndians.20 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn20] Though he qualified for college admissionbased on his exam scores, he could not afford the tuition. After a few yearsspent struggling to find work after high school, Bhagabati had managed to winone of a small number of highly coveted positions working for the imperialauthorities. One of the biggest complaints among well-off Indians at the timewas the dearth of government jobs available for the glut of college-educatedIndians, so Bhagabati’s ability to secure government employment without a degreesuggests his remarkable skill.21 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn21]Bhagabati became an assistant accountant for the Public Works Department of theIndian government in 1873 and was posted to Deoghar in Bihar, a province ineastern north India. A year and half later, he was sent to Rangoon, Burma, atthat time a remote province of British India. Bhagabati’s mother died inCalcutta while he was in Rangoon. He returned for her funeral and, while there,married Gyana. She was a good match for Bhagabati. The daughter of a deputymagistrate from Bengal, her family background in British government employmentmatched her husband’s. The couple returned to Rangoon, and Bhagabati eventuallyworked there for ten years, serving his time in the distant outpost of theBritish Raj. While there, Bhagabati passed the government accountingexamination, which paved the way for his advancement through the bureaucracy andan eventual return to north India.For the remainder of his career, Bhagabati would work for various railwayagencies, shuffling around the country as he ascended the career ladder. Morethan a quarter of a million Indians found employment in rail service, but themajority of these jobs involved hard physical labor. Only little more than 6percent of this workforce dealt with general administration, like Bhagabati.22[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn22] His job required the family to move several more timesduring Mukunda’s early years, often for short periods and to locations scatteredacross fifteen hundred miles of British India.23 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn23] Unlikethe vast majority of the Indian population on the overwhelmingly ruralsubcontinent, Mukunda grew up in urban settings surrounded by Britishadministrators, modern industrial technology and infrastructure, educationalinstitutions, and links to the larger world.24 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn24]Railroads, along with steamships and telegraphs, were part of the technologicalapparatus that enabled a tiny number of British officials to control asubcontinent of nearly three hundred million subjects.25[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn25] For this reason, the railroad has come to symbolize thepernicious effects of modernity in colonial India. But for Indian elites it alsosignaled opportunity. Employees like Bhagabati were “agents of moderntransformation,” their technical expertise indispensable for the ongoingsupervision and maintenance of the railroad.26 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn26] Forthese individuals, the railroad represented an opportunity to join the emergingBengali middle class, the bhadralok. The term almost literally translates to“gentleman,” connoting qualities of respectability, like “hard work,achievement, financial success, and social esteem vis-à-vis the Westernworld.”27 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn27] From the British perspective, this classprovided ideal candidates for government positions.28 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn28]The bhadralok’s characteristics prompted historian David Kopf, inspired by MaxWeber, to describe them as Protestants. Though clearly problematic, this labeldoes convey the ways bhadralok individuals exhibited characteristics associatedwith their middle-class counterparts in industrial Britain and America. Alongwith diligence and effort, Mukunda’s family taught him a sense of optimism aboutthe possibility of upward mobility that prepared him to understand the audienceshe would eventually address. He was raised in a household with values strikinglysimilar to those of the striving American middle classes.But occupational success in India depended on more than hard work. Latenineteenth-century Indian society was deeply shaped by the caste system, part ofthe identity that children were taught to internalize. As historian TithiBhattacharya explains, “One of the important things that a Hindu child learnedeven before he or she began school, were the names of his/her forefathers,including a detailed account of the subdivisions of his/her particular caste andclan. It was important for maintaining the intricacies of the kinship networks,in a familiar world which was at most times bound within the ancestralvillage.”29 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn29] Yogananda tells readers his parents’ casteon the second page of his autobiography, and his brother does the same in hisbiography. Ghosh supplements this explanation in a genealogical appendix, whichprovides several detailed notes about the family’s caste identity, describingwith great pride relatives who were aristocrats, servants to kings, and those of“exalted social status.”30 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn30]The caste system that helped shape the Ghosh children’s identity was a dynamicpolitical, social, and religious amalgamation of two taxonomies.31[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn31] The first was the idealized fourfold varṇa system. Inthis taxonomy, the brahmin, or priestly class, was typically the most honored,followed by the kshatriya, or warrior class, and then the vaishya, or merchantclass. Together, these three castes were dvijas, or twice-born, whose males weregranted the privilege of learning the Vedas, the most sacred texts of orthodoxreligion, and performing the saṃskāras, or rites of passage prescribed in Vedictexts. Dvijas constituted a small elite presiding over a vast majority ofshudras, or peasants.32 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn32] In the second and more complexjāti taxonomy, there were thousands of occupational classes, some numbering nomore than a few hundred members. Efforts to fit each jāti into one of the fourvarṇas led to a complex and fluid system full of exceptions. Historicalanthropologist Susan Bayly notes that caste “is not and never has been a fixedfact of Indian life.” Instead, both systems are “composites of ideals andpractices that have been made and remade into varying codes of moral order overhundreds or even thousands of years.”33 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn33] Nevertheless,“certain basic ideas” were shared across the subcontinent, including theassumption that people wereborn into fixed social units with specific names or titles. Such a unit is one’scaste or “community.” And, insofar as individuals and kin groups recognize theclaims of caste, these embody something broader than the notion of a common kinor blood tie. Indeed, caste is … a notion of attachment which bundles together agiven set of kin groups or descent units … those born into a given caste wouldnormally find marriage partners within these limits, and … regard those outsideas of unlike kind, rank or substance. Furthermore, those sharing a common casteidentity may subscribe to at least a notional tradition of common descent, aswell as a claim of common geographical origin, and a particular occupationalideal.Consequently, members of particular castes avoid sharing food “or other intimatesocial contacts” in a system of ranking viewed as “innate, universal andcollective.”34 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn34]The caste system of Bhagabati’s time was in many ways a modern colonialcreation. British officials, anxious to categorize the disparate peoples theyruled, reified caste identity as the sole, uniform, totalizing category ofIndian social organization. Beyond ethnographic curiosity, a comprehensiveethnic taxonomy helped to facilitate governance. The first government study wasconducted in 1871, but government efforts culminated in the 1881 census.35[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn35] Because caste identity determined suitability for civilservice employment, British categorization had very tangible consequences. AnAnglo-Indian editorial from 1884, for example, recommended that “posts of trustand responsibility” be reserved for “those belonging to what are considered asrespectable classes of the community from the native point of view.”36[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn36]Bhagabati was a member of the Bengali kayastha jāti, by the nineteenth century aprivileged group. Previously associated with shudras, kayasthas became widelyrecognized across northern India in the eighteenth century as they began toprovide scribal services for princes. Through this association with royalty,kayasthas began to identify themselves with the kshatriya varṇa. Kayasthas’ability to upgrade their jāti status to conform to one of the twice-born varṇapaid rich dividends. Kopf notes, for example, that kayasthas were one of onlythree elite groups that constituted the intellectual class of late nineteenthcentury Bengal.37 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn37] In the 1881 census, British officialsupheld the high ranking of kayasthas, thus helping to secure access to civilservice jobs.38 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn38]Once kayasthas had solidified their elite status, they relied on nepotism topass the benefits on to their extended kin. Sanjay Joshi explains that “kinconnections had played a very important part in getting jobs in the royal courtsand bureaucracies … so much so that certain families and kin groups then came tomonopolize particular kinds of jobs. … Such arrangements suited theadministrative needs of the state, and also the families in question. Powers ofpatronage made kin or family connections of crucial importance, and putwell-established kin elders in positions of great power.”39[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn39] Knowing how precarious civil service positions couldbe, Bhagabati was determined to use his connections to get Mukunda a railway jobwhen he came of age.Alongside bhadralok values, Mukunda’s family imparted spiritual training.Bhagabati and Gyana reared their children in an observant manner, which includedspecific beliefs and practices. Then, as now, though Indian communities had manytemples large and small, most Hindus participated in corporate worship only atlarge annual holidays; routine religious training and observances occured athome. As in many Indian households, Mukunda’s mother assumed practicalresponsibility for religious devotion. She provided moral instruction from thegreat epics, the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa.40 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn40] Shealso maintained the family shrine. The Ghosh family were devotees of Narayan,another name for Vishnu, and the Mother Goddess.41 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn41] Thefamily paid a local priest to perform daily puja, the ritual sacrifice, commonlyconsisting of incense, sandalwood, and food (such as fruit or sweetmeats), tothe family deities honored in a shrine in a dedicated alcove in the home. Afterthe deity symbolically consumes the offering, the remainder becomes prasada,substantiated grace, sanctified by the deity and ingested by the devotee. Themost important element of the worship service—whether at home or in thetemple—is darśana, seeing and being seen by the deity, which confers a spiritualblessing.42 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn42]In 1890, three years before Mukunda’s birth, a yoga master named Swami LahiriMahasaya joined the family pantheon. Bhagabati had been introduced to Mahasayaby one of the employees he supervised. Mahasaya trained disciples from all walksof life, but as a married pensioner who had worked for the British governmentfor twenty-five years, he often attracted other civil servants like Bhagabati.43[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn43] Together, Bhagabati and Gyana took yoga initiation fromMahasaya. Bhagabati would later initiate Mukunda into the first stage of thistraining.44 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn44] Because a highly developed guru like SwamiMahasaya became a pure channel for the divine presence, his image could servethe purpose of darśana alongside the representation of a traditional deity.After Mahasaya’s image was installed in the home shrine, Gyana performed dailypuja to it.45 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn45] When Mukunda was struck by cholera at ageeight, she commanded him to bow to the image mentally, as he was too weak tomove his arms. He did so and was enveloped in a brilliant light. He immediatelyfelt his symptoms disappear.46 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn46]Through his parents’ instruction, Mukunda learned the fundamental principlesthat shaped his worldview. He was taught that the human soul is a tangible,though subtle, material that outlives the individual life to be transplantedinto another body after death in a nearly endless cycle of death and rebirthknown as saṃsāra.47 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn47] The nature of an individual’srebirth depends on the karma—the fruit of one’s actions—acquired during thepresent life based on behavior, as well as the potential burden inherited fromprevious lives. Traditionally, karma was determined largely by dharma, orappropriate conduct, based on general principles and, in part, on one’s sex,varṇa, and āśrama, or life stage.The most crucial saṃskāra for members of the dvija was upanayana, or “takingnear,” in which a boy was presented before a guru to begin instruction in Vediclife. In this ceremony, the boy received the sacred thread consisting of threestrands, each in turn composed of three threads. While members of the kshatriyawere historically initiated at eleven years of age, there was flexibility in thepractice. Over time, upanayana became increasingly restricted to brahmins. Sincenone of the sources indicate that Mukunda underwent this rite, perhaps Bengalikshatriyas were no longer practicing it by the late nineteenth century.Dvija males passed through four somewhat idealized āśramas that embraced firstthe acceptance of worldly pleasure and later its rejection. Some Indiantraditions celebrate married householders’ enjoyment of material well-being andpleasure, including sexual pleasure. After raising children, a man eventuallybecame a saṃnyāsin, or ascetic “renouncer,” who had released himself from allworldly goods and attachments in pursuit of mokṣa, or release from the cycles oflife and death.48 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn48]Mukunda’s parents displayed particular dedication by embracing a modified formof saṃnyāsin while they remained in the household stage—well before the formalsaṃnyāsin life stage. Through Mahasaya’s inspiration, they had sexualintercourse only once a year, for the purpose of reproduction. Yogananda viewedthis “remarkable admission” as an indicator of the way that his parents’devotion to Mahasaya “strengthened Father’s naturally ascetical temperament.”49[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn49] Their devout conduct and sexual restraint provided amodel for young Mukunda.MUKUNDA LAL GHOSH’S SPIRITUAL PILGRIMAGEMukunda enjoyed a pleasant and unremarkable childhood. His family livedcomfortably, if modestly, given Bhagabati’s penchant for simplicity, and heattended elementary school. Mukunda’s parents argued from time to time overGyana’s fondness for charity, which the parsimonious Bhagabati consideredextravagant.50 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn50] This unexceptional childhood wasshattered when tragedy struck in 1904, the year the family moved to Bareilly, incentral north India. Gyana was staying with her husband’s extended family inCalcutta preparing for the wedding of Mukunda’s older brother, Ananta. Gyana’snephew contracted cholera, and as she was nursing the sick child, she becameinfected. Cholera, endemic to India, is typically spread through contact withhuman waste and increased mobility in the modern era exacerbated its spread.Medical researchers were just beginning to understand the link between waste,bacteria, and disease in the late nineteenth century, so treatment was rarelyeffective. A British medical handbook published in 1861 still claimeduncertainty about whether “the disease spreads from direct contagion oratmospheric causes,” while indicating that “there are abundant instances of itspassing through a camp or city in such a manner as can only be accounted for bythe almost demonstrated fact that a specific cholera-poison exists.”51[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn51] Victims often died rapidly from extreme diarrhea andvomiting, a fate that befell Gyana’s nephew. Gyana sent a telegram to herhusband notifying him of her illness. Bhagabati and the rest of the familyrushed to Calcutta. But Gyana died before they arrived. “When we reached ourCalcutta home,” Mukunda later recalled, “it was only to confront the stunningmystery of death. I collapsed into an almost lifeless state.”52[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn52] Gyana was cremated according to custom.This traumatizing experience shaped the course of Mukunda’s life. His mother’stragic death, intensified by the shocking suddenness that prevented anyfarewells, was a devastating blow. Long after her death, he remainedinconsolable, his grief a cause of great concern to his father.53[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn53] “The rent left in the family fabric by Mother’s deathwas irreparable,” Mukunda later recalled.54 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn54] Gyana’sdeath caused a rift between him and his father. He later claimed that he hadreported a premonition of her impending death to his father, who dismissed thevision and delayed departure for Calcutta by a few hours. Mukunda blamed hismother’s death on Bhagabati’s tardy response. This was a child’s irrationalresponse to trauma, as it is virtually certain that arriving earlier would nothave changed Gyana’s fate.55 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn55] For his part, Bhagabatithought stoicism the proper response to suffering, which intensified hisemotional coldness as a parent. But in private he clearly grieved the loss ofhis wife. Though he lived another thirty-eight years, he never remarried. Alongtime family servant attempted to act as a surrogate mother, but Anantagenerally assumed parental responsibilities in the home.Mukunda’s longing for maternal comfort encouraged a penchant for femalerepresentations of deity, prominent in Bengal, that both emulated his mother’sreligious practice and came to represent her. As an adult, he explicitly linkedthe loss of his earthly mother to his affection for the divine mother. His poem“The Lost Two Black Eyes” expresses how Gyana’s death left the storm-tossed“Boat of my life” “Directionless.” The “motherless sorrow” of “this orphan lifeof mine” was eased only when he found the love of “the Deathless Mother.”56[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn56] If his religious approach was shaped by affection forhis absent mother, it was equally shaped in reaction to the emotional distanceof his present father. His attitude to the divine—whether conceptualized asfemale or male—was consistently characterized by bhakti, or intense devotion.Such emotionalism was clearly at odds with his father’s reserved demeanor andhis austere religious practice.In July 1906, not long after Gyana’s death, Bhagabati was transferred toCalcutta. The city had been the center of British India since 1690, when EastIndia Company agent Job Charnock chose a location on the east bank of theHooghly River, an offshoot of the Ganges, as a protected port several milesinland from the Bay of Bengal. The East India Company consolidated its footholdin 1757, during the Battle of Plassey in the Seven Years’ War. The SepoyRebellion, exactly a century later, led Parliament to replace the company’s rulewith direct Crown rule. Calcutta, however, remained the imperial administrativecenter. With a population of 1.1 million—roughly the size of Philadelphia, anddouble the size of Boston, Baltimore, or Saint Louis—Calcutta was a dynamicglobal city that provided a decisive cultural and intellectual influence onMukunda as he moved from adolescence into adulthood.57 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn57]Calcutta was one of a half-dozen global cities that had become deeply enmeshedin the industrial world by the late nineteenth century, and these cities’ eliteswere, according to historian C. A. Bayly, “as much implicated in the industrialworld system as those of the West.”58 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn58] The entireapparatus of British Indian government, including the viceroy’s massiveeighty-four-thousand-square-foot neoclassical mansion, was roughly three milesfrom the family home. Though the government determined in 1911 to relocate thecapital to New Delhi, Calcutta continued to symbolize British colonialism.In the late nineteenth century, India was central to the global economy, andCalcutta was the most important British port for exporting goods to England andcontinental Europe.59 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn59] Humans were another export. Thefar-flung British Empire drew hundreds of thousands of poor, desperate SouthAsians into various forms of service in South Africa, Mauritius, and theCaribbean in what often turned out to be permanent resettlement. The vastmajority of those migrant laborers embarked for overseas ports from Calcutta.60[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn60] The same port that served as a transit station forgoods was also a conduit for ideas. “Radical ideas that challenged the bases ofthe traditional world order in Europe and America were a form of intellectualcargo unloaded on the docks of the great metropolis, along with the otherindustrial and commercial products.”61 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn61] This dynamicmetropolis confronted Mukunda with the reality of a globalized world and,perhaps, urged him to begin reflecting on his own place within it.Brimming with curiosity, Mukunda had little interest in formal education.Perhaps the most important outcome of his high school years was beginning tolearn English systematically. He was much more interested in physical activity.Despite his slight physique, he excelled in track, wrestling, and soccer. Almostimmediately after moving to Calcutta, Mukunda met Manomohan Mazumdar. Mazumdar’sfather supervised the Calcutta Deaf and Dumb School across the street, and thefamily lived on the campus. Though Mazumdar was a couple years younger thanMukunda, the two clicked immediately.62 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn62] Mazumdar laterremembered his time with Mukunda as “one of inspiration which stirs the deepestpart of my heart.”63 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn63]It was during this period that Mukunda’s deeply rooted interest in spiritualityblossomed. His religious interests were both more earnest and more eclectic thanthose of his family members. In addition to Gyana’s death, adolescence and thestimulating cultural environment of Calcutta formed a potent mix. Mukunda “leftno stone unturned in his spiritual investigations,” according to his youngerbrother.64 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn64] Each morning on his way to school, he andMazumdar would worship together at the Radha Krishna Temple on their way toschool. The two frequently visited the Kalighat Kali Temple and meditated inEden Gardens along the Hooghly River.65 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn65] He alsoexperimented with Tantrism, a tradition especially prominent in Bengal, where itmay have originated in the seventh century as a movement outside of orthodoxVedic traditions. David Gordon White provides a helpful definition: “Tantra isthat Asian body of beliefs and practices which, working from the principle thatthe universe we experience is nothing other than the concrete manifestation ofthe divine energy of the godhead that creates and maintains that universe, seeksto ritually appropriate and channel that energy, within the human microcosm, increative and emancipatory ways.”66 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn66] Tantrism is adiverse, fluid movement that has often been misunderstood, in part because itstraditions were usually kept secret. Knowledge about Tantra in the West waslargely mediated through the British, whose zeal to describe the putativeepitome of primitive religion often led to gross misrepresentations. Indianssometimes contributed to this exoticization.67 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn67]Scandalous stereotypes notwithstanding, Tantrism has frequently included anerotic dimension. Some Tantric practitioners intentionally flouted orthodoxVedic religious conventions by engaging in taboo activities, including the useof five substances: wine, meat, fish, fermented grain, and sexual intercourse.68[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn68] Employing a variety of texts, rituals, myths, artforms, mantras, and yantras, or mystical designs, Tantra practitioners,according to Indologist Wendy Doniger, often engaged in “worship of the goddess,initiation, group worship, secrecy, and antinomian behavior, particularly sexualrituals and the ingesting of bodily fluids.”69 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn69]Images [../figures/f0039-05.jpg]Mukunda as a teenager, far right. The adolescent Mukunda actively explored avariety of spiritual pathways in his search for the divine. His friend andspiritual companion, Mazumdar, is on the left. Also pictured are Mukunda’scousin Lalit-da and his Sanskrit tutor, Swami Kebalananda, who deepened hisunderstanding of Kriya Yoga.As Mukunda and his friends explored Tantrism, they contemplated the meaning andpower of death. They began visiting the Nimtala Ghat cremation grounds where hismother’s final rites had been performed. There they followed the Tantra sādānaof sitting on corpses or piles of skulls. Violating the severe taboo of contactwith dead humans, they confronted and thus overcame the power of death. At onepoint, Mukunda brought home a skull and crossbones, placing them on a woodenstand in his bedroom for meditation. He also routinely invited an ascetic hometo help him navigate the labyrinth of Tantric arcana. The human remains and theascetic, with matted hair and long vermilion stripe along his forehead,terrified Mukunda’s brother, who reported Mukunda’s conduct to their father.Bhagabati solemnly warned Mukunda of the danger of Tantrism’s dark spiritualpowers. Mukunda immediately ceased his most provocative activities.But his devotion to the bloodthirsty warrior goddess Kali, often associated withdeath in Bengali Tantrism, continued. He was drawn to “her terrifying Form,three-eyed and blazingly Radiant,”70 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn70] and he oftenconstructed his own images of her, building her body of straw and wood, and herhair of jute and then performing puja.71 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn71] TheAutobiography passes over Mukunda’s dabbling in Tantrism in silence, areflection of the tendency to minimize coverage of (literally) taboo activities.Still, crucial elements of Tantrism made their way into Yogananda’s worldview.This includes his understanding of yoga as the stirring up of latent divinefemale power72 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn72] and his lingering affection for Kali,though largely purged from the Autobiography and described there blandly in afootnote as “a symbol of God in the aspect of eternal Mother Nature.”73[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn73]After abandoning Tantric practice, Mukunda explored any pathway that promisedspiritual insight, including divination, hypnotism, and clairvoyance. Heattempted to communicate with the dead—most notably, his mother.74[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn74] Mazumdar, dragged along on many of Mukunda’s spiritualadventures, recognized his friend’s grab bag of Indian spirituality and Westernmetaphysical traditions. “Direct encounters with ascended beings, the radiantand divine appearances of supernatural power-endowed realized beings, thearrival of the spirit of a dead person in the midst of mesmerized people andspeaking with that spirit, and ordinary sightings of ghosts and such were thingsthat he believed in, and pursued with concentrated means in situations andoccasions.”75 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn75] In the midst of these eclectic pursuits,Mukunda first began to proclaim his ability to perform miraculous feats.Transcending time and space through meditation, he began to make propheticpronouncements about various individuals, using his younger brother as a mediumfor spiritual messages.76 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn76] Mazumdar, something of askeptic when it came to Mukunda’s more fantastic claims, noted that not all ofMukunda’s prophecies came to pass and that his skills in hypnotism were lesseffective on older subjects than younger ones—and even then did not alwayssucceed.77 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn77] Mazumdar’s doubts were not lost on his moreexuberant companion: “One day, because of some situation, he said to me, ‘Oh! Ofcourse, you don’t believe all this?’ I told him, ‘I cannot say something so bigand certain like, “I don’t believe.” My knowledge is limited. But I don’t havemuch interest in these things—meaning these kinds of supernatural workings, andI have managed my own explanations for these things as well.’ In any case, hisbelief in these remained firm and unshakable throughout his whole life.”78[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn78] However willing a companion Mazumdar may have been intheir spiritual journey together, he remained grounded when Mukunda leapt intoflights of fancy.Mukunda began to fantasize about making a pilgrimage to Rishikesh, one of thefew gateway towns to the Himalayas, considered sacred because the waters of theGanges first reach the plains from the mountains at this spot. Bathing in theGanges at Rishikesh is believed to confer salvific benefits. Mukunda’s fatherand older brother, spiritually devoted but also pragmatic, found this nearlythousand-mile journey extravagant. Mukunda, revealing both spiritual hunger anda willingness to defy parental authority, conspired to sneak away and travelthere secretly with his friends. In 1906, the year the family moved to Calcutta,he executed his plan. Pretending to be ill, he stayed home from school andlocked himself in his room; his escape through a window was not detected untilmuch later. Two friends joined him in the flight, though one eventually turnedback. Such a journey was only conceivable for a thirteen-year old boy deeplyfamiliar with geography, railroads, and timetables. Still, it was a bold andrisky undertaking. His defiant character was already well known to his family,as his older brother Ananta was on the lookout for just such a ploy. WhenMukunda disappeared, Ananta immediately telegraphed the railway station withdescriptions of Mukunda and his two friends. They eluded capture as far asHaridwar. Then, just fifteen miles from Rishikesh, a police officer detainedthem at the train station. They were held in a dismal police station for threedays while they waited for Ananta to collect them.The collapse of Mukunda’s Himalaya plans did not dampen his spiritual fervor.Though Ananta expressed sympathy with Mukunda’s disappointment with hisRishikesh capture, he nonetheless continued trying to dissuade his brother fromhis spiritual pursuits.79 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn79] But Ananta’s efforts todampen his brother’s ardor unwittingly fanned the flames instead. Ananta heldMukunda’s Sanskrit tutor, who had engaged in philosophical and spiritualdiscussions with his eager pupil, responsible for planting the idea of a railwayventure in Mukunda’s head. So Ananta fired the tutor and replaced him with SriKabiraj Mahasaya. Unbeknownst to Ananta, Mahasaya was a dedicated yogipractitioner and an advanced disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya, Bhagabati’s guru.While teaching his pupil Sanskrit, Mahasaya also introduced him to the storiesof India’s saints and the meditative practices of Mahasaya’s yoga tradition.Together, tutor and disciple explored the meaning of the Bhagavad Gītā, thePurāṇas, and other religious texts.80 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn80]This personal mentoring was only one source of spiritual energy. Other nearbyattractions also stoked Mukunda’s spiritual fervor. He regularly visited thegreat Dakshineswar Kali Temple, which pulsated with massive crowds from allaround the Calcutta metropolitan area. Several miles north of the Ghosh home,Dakshineswar was a large, sprawling complex, whose central shrine was devoted tothe goddess Kali, while a dozen smaller shrines honoring Shiva surrounded thecourtyard. Sri Ramakrishna, one of the most famous religious figures innineteenth-century India, had resided at the temple for several years until hisdeath in 1886. The alcove he inhabited within the temple complex became a shrineto his devotees. Directly across the Hooghly River from the Dakshineswar KaliTemple sat Belur Math monastery. Ramakrishna’s most famous devotee, SwamiVivekananda, founded the monastery in his master’s honor a decade afterRamakrishna’s death. It became the headquarters of the Ramakrishna order,dedicated to expanding the reach of his teaching in India and abroad.Vivekananda had become a celebrated figure in liberal American religious circleswhen he visited the World’s Parliament of Religions in 1893, the year Mukundawas born.Mukunda never had a chance to meet Vivekananda, who died of a stroke at BelurMath at age thirty-nine in 1902, several years before the Ghosh family moved toCalcutta. A shrine containing Vivekananda’s cremated remains was placed on themonastery grounds, on the banks of the Hooghly. But the Ramakrishna movement’sinfluence in Bengal far outlasted Vivekananda’s death, and Mukunda became aneager unofficial devotee. According to Mazumdar, during Mukunda’s high schoolyears, he “would become filled with the nectar of devotion whenever he wouldmeditate on Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa-deva, the divine worshiper of the Motherof the Universe.” So he “would suffer the pains of going by foot toDakshineswar,” the temple where Ramakrishna had resided. He meditated there forlong periods and conversed with Ramakrishna monks.81 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn81] Healso made frequent trips across the river to the Belur Math.82[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn82] On several occasions, Mukunda met with Sri “M,” anadvanced disciple of Ramakrishna.83 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn83] Mukunda requestedboth Sri “M” and Swami Prajnananda, the head of the Belur Math at the time, tomake him their disciple, though both declined.84 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn84]Mukunda was nevertheless deeply influenced by Ramakrishna’s teachings. As acollege student, he carried a booklet of Ramakrishna’s teachings in his pocket,meditated on them regularly, and offered to share them with interestedacquaintances.85 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn85] Yogananda’s later penchant forlighthearted anecdotes, his sense of humor, and above all his passionatedevotionalism—routinely expressed in poetic, emotional language—characterizedRamakrishna’s informal style but were deeply at odds with both his father’sstoicism and Yukteswar’s austerity. Ramakrishna’s writings likely provided theinspiration for Yogananda’s infectious, deeply affectionate way of talking aboutcommunion with the divine.Given Mukunda’s apparently intense interest in his teachings, the depth ofRamakrishna’s influence on the future Yogananda has too often gone unnoticed.This stems in part from the attention given to Mukunda’s formal discipleship toYukteswar and in part to the paucity of references Yogananda makes toRamakrishna in his Autobiography or elsewhere. Given the significance of theguru-disciple relationship, he undoubtedly wished to give proper deference tohis actual mentor. At the same time, his drive to emulate Vivekananda may haveplayed a part. Fashioning himself in the mold of Vivekananda, he did not want toappear as a second-rate, knock-off version. To highlight the uniqueness of hisown American ministry, he downplayed any sense that his teaching was derivativefrom Vivekananda. This included erasing most traces of his dependence onVivekananda’s mentor.Images [../figures/f0043-06.jpg]The Dakshineswar Kali Temple in Calcutta, a massive nineteenth-century complexdevoted to the goddess Kali and, in twelve smaller shrines surrounding the maintemple, Shiva. The temple is a popular spot for devotees, and Mukunda visited itregularly as a young man, particularly the location in the complex where SriRamakrishna spent many years.THE EDUCATION OF A SWAMIIn 1909, Mukunda continued his search for spiritual enlightenment by followinghis friend Jitendra to Benares, where he had gone to join the Bharat DharmaMahamandal hermitage. One of India’s most sacred sites, Benares had been apilgrimage site for centuries. The Benares ghats on the edge of the Gangesalways teemed with pilgrims waiting to cremate their departed loved ones, asthis auspicious site was thought to automatically grant the deceased liberationfrom the cycles of saṃsāra. The Mahamandal, “perhaps the most successfulorthodox organization on the subcontinent,” according to Kenneth Jones, enjoyedthe patronage of rajas, large landowners, and merchants.86[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn86] A popular reform movement begun in latenineteenth-century Punjab, the organization grew dramatically after itsrelocation to Benares early in the new century. In 1915, it had six hundredbranches spread throughout India, and another four hundred affiliatedorganizations. The Mahamandal was willing to make Vedic texts available to allpeople, regardless of sex or caste. Rather than assuming that Hinduism was thepreserve of the Indian people, the organization also made the very modern claimthat it “is the universal Dharma for all mankind.” Still, its definition ofdharma was extremely traditional, even occasionally reactionary, stressing thesupreme importance of varṇāśramadharma, an individual’s spiritual duties basedon caste and life stage. Defending orthodoxy in the face of challenges by moreradical reform groups such as the Arya Samaj, the Mahamandal’s staff includedmissionaries who sought to convert Indians to the “one true faith.” In additionto its emphasis on varṇāśramadharma, the Mahamandal stressed such traditionalpractices as child marriage and cow protection while opposing the constructionof new mosques.87 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn87] From his short stint with theMahamandal, Mukunda would take several key ideas: the concept of a universaldharma, the vision of a unified Indian religion, and the novel concept (in anIndian religious context) of evangelization, though his target converts would beAmericans rather than his fellow Indians.Despite the crucial values the Mahamandal instilled in Mukunda, he was deeplyunhappy there. Not long after arriving, he found himself at odds with his fellowashram members. The “household was alienated, hurt by my determined aloofness.My strict adherence to meditation on the very Ideal for which I had left homeand all the worldly ambitions called forth shallow criticism from all sides.”They knew little about meditation, in his view, and “thought I should employ mywhole time in organizational duties.”88 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn88] Satyanandaoffers a different account; he suggests that Mukunda’s dreamy spiritualitycaused him to neglect mundane housekeeping routines, provoking resentment fromhis colleagues, who had to pick up the slack.89 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn89] Eitherway, Mukunda was unable to get along with the other initiates and restless toleave the ashram. His rescue came through the fateful encounter with Swami SriYukteswar recounted above.Yukteswar had been born in Serampore, near Calcutta, in 1855, the only child ofwealthy, solidly middle-class parents. His father was a landowner and businessowner, his mother a dutiful wife who taught her son Hindu traditions. He was abright, curious person drawn to all kinds of knowledge and never one to sufferfools gladly. Even as a boy, he had a deeply analytical mind, resorting toscatological humor to ridicule teachers behind their backs when they failed todemonstrate consistent logic. As a young man, he was a strong student and giftedmathematician. His scientific curiosity later drew him to Calcutta MedicalCollege, where he learned anatomy, physiology, and some medicine. He also becameenamored of naturopathy, a German practice emerging in the nineteenth century.Images [../figures/f0045-07.jpg]Yogananda’s guru. Born Priya Nath Karar, he took the title Swami Yukteswar Giriwhen he entered the swami monastic order in 1884 to learn Kriya Yoga. Heconverted his family home in Serampore into an ashram and opened a second inPuri. His book The Holy Science, which sought to harmonize science, the Bible,and yoga, influenced Yogananda’s later teaching.His interests were broad and eclectic. He excelled in sports, horseback riding,and hunting. He was fond of music and learned to play the sitar. Throughconnections with a neighborhood noble family who took a liking to him, Yukteswarwas introduced to a number of prominent Indians, including nationalist writerBankim Chatterji. Chatterji’s novel Anandamath, banned by the British as asymbol of colonial resistance, unveiled his song “Vande Mataram,” destined tobecome an independent India’s national anthem.90 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn90]A tragic family life freed him to pursue his spiritual interests more deeply. Afew years after marrying, Yukteswar’s wife died. Later, his only daughter alsodied. He viewed their deaths as having exhausted the karma he had carried intohis present life. Now he was free to become a saṃnyāsin and travel widely,acquiring wisdom and knowledge. He displayed a spiritual thirst in many wayslike his later pupil. He sought out a teacher of the Santal tribal people,learned Tantric and Vaishnavite traditions, and even became a member of theTheosophical Society. During this search, Yukteswar explored the Ramakrishnamovement, headquartered ten miles from his family home, and eventually becamefriends with Vivekananda. Later, after founding his own community, Yukteswarsought to affiliate formally with the Ramakrishna Order. Although this did nottranspire, Mukunda’s future mentor clearly had some affinity for the movement.91[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn91]In 1884, Yukteswar found a focus for his peripatetic spiritual path. The noblefamily that had introduced him to Chatterji were devotees of Sri LahiriMahasaya. Yukteswar heard remarkable things from them about Mahasaya’s wisdomand knowledge. He eventually departed for Benares, determined to track down theelusive swami. After finding Mahasaya’s address, Yukteswar bathed in the Ganges,dressed in proper clothing, and presented himself before his would-be guru.Mahasaya agreed to give Yukteswar Kriya Yoga initiation. Yukteswar returned toSerampore and devoted himself to the guru’s instruction. One of Yukteswar’sdisciples describes Kriya Yoga as “an esoteric doctrine of spiritual effortspractised in India from hoary ages by aspirants after Self Realisation andEmancipation from worldly bondage. It is a set of physical and mental techniquesby following which consummation of Yoga can be achieved.” Kriya “represents aspecially designed mode of efforts, physical as well as mental, which is thesecret technique of the Yogis,” while yoga designates “the only process adoptingwhich one can get over the disturbing factors, physical as well as mental, inattaining the quietude deemed essential for Self Realisation.”92[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn92]As Yukteswar accepted the specific discipline of his guru and the Kriya Yogapath, he sought to integrate his broad knowledge of Hindu traditions and ofother religions. He had spent some time learning about Islam, and at SeramporeCollege he read the Bible and learned about the life of Christ. He wasespecially drawn to the book of Revelation, learning to interpret it as aprophetic confirmation of his own astrology-based Hindu eschatology.93[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn93] At some point, Yukteswar shared with Frenchmissionaries his “new understanding and perspective of their religiousscripture, the Bible, as it pertained to the arrival of Lord Jesus, His sādāna,education, the wondrous experiences of His companions etc.” The missionary,anxious about the harm this perspective might cause to ordinary Christians,asked to borrow the book and later claimed to have lost it.94[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn94]In 1894, Yukteswar wrote a book in this same spirit, The Holy Science, a shortwork that presented yoga—though he avoided this word—as part of a coherent,systematic practice leading to the highest goal of religion, self-knowledge. Hislanguage reflected Christian terminology: the Gospel, God the Father, sin, andrepentance. Employing this Christian vocabulary enabled him to translateChristian theology into the categories of Hindu thought. God the Father wasreally sat, the only reality in the universe. Repentance meant, not turning fromsin, but abandoning māyā, or ignorance, and rediscovering one’s participation indivinity and thus experiencing liberation. Practical methods to achieveliberation included vegetarianism, extended time in the open air, and spendingtime with those to whom one was “magnetically” drawn. Successful practice wouldlead to supernatural yogic powers:Life and death come under the control of the yogi who perseveres in the practiceof Pranayama. In that way, he saves his body from the premature decay thatovertakes most men, and can remain as long as he wishes in his present physicalfrom; thus having time to work out his karma in one body; and to fulfil (andthus get rid of) all the various desires of his heart. Finally purified, he isno longer required to come again into this world under the influence of Maya,darkness, nor to suffer the “second death.”95 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn95]The Holy Science also aligned modern science with ancient texts to fundamentallyreconceptualize Indian cosmology. According to widely accepted calculations ofastronomical treatises from the early centuries of the Common Era, all ofhistory for the last several millennia—and for countless millennia to come—hasfallen under the shadow of the Kali Yuga, a dark age in which knowledge of theVedas progressively degenerates. Yukteswar carefully parsed the treatises thatdescribe the sequence of the universe’s great ages, proving the error in theircalculation of the eras. Then, citing Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, Yukteswarcorrelated these Indian treatises with contemporary astronomical knowledge andconcluded that the present age is Dwapara Yuga. Like arcane millennialistdebates among Christians, Yukteswar’s date-setting had important theologicalconsequences. The upshot of his discovery was the recognition that, “the darkage of Kali having long passed away, the world is reaching out for spiritualknowledge, and men require loving help from one the other [sic].”96[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn96] This fundamentally optimistic view of people’s thirstfor spiritual knowledge deeply shaped Yogananda’s own upbeat expectation of areceptive audience for his message.Yukteswar was also the first to introduce Yogananda to Jesus and the Bible,while reinforcing his pupil’s incipient understanding that the Bible could onlybe understood in light of the greater truth of Hindu dharma. “Master expoundedthe Christian Bible with a beautiful clarity. It was from my Hindu guru, unknownto the roll call of Christian membership, that I learned to perceive thedeathless essence of the Bible, and to understand the truth in Christ’sassertion—surely the most thrillingly intransigent ever uttered: ‘Heaven andearth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.’”97[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn97]Yukteswar embraced a view of other religions common among latenineteenth-century educated Indians. In the introduction to The Holy Science,Yukteswar explained that the “purpose of this book is to show as clearly aspossible that there is an essential unity in all religions; there is nodifference in the truths inculcated by the various faiths; that there is but onemethod by which the world, both external and internal, has evolved; and thatthere is but one Goal admitted by all scriptures.” On one level, this pluralistview acknowledged the legitimacy of all religions. On another level, however,Yukteswar’s inclusivism led him immediately to concede that “this basic truth”of unity “is one not easily comprehended,” becoming clear only through anexposition that revealed the underlying dharmic understanding of reality.98[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn98] Yukteswar shared the belief of other modern Indiansthat, as Hindu scholar Jeffery Long explains, “Hindu Dharma is an absolute, interms of which all religions can be measured, sometimes being foundpraiseworthy, and at other times found wanting.” Such an outlook “proceeds froma specific worldview that is held to be true and in terms of which the truthclaims and the salvific efficacy of other religions may be evaluated.” Indeed,leading Indian figures at the time, including Gandhi and Vivekananda, affirmed“religious pluralism while at the same time do so using unabashedly Hinducategories and extolling the distinctiveness of Hindu Dharma.”99[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn99] On one level, Vivekananda asserted that all religionswere partial forms of God realization. But on a higher level, the eternalDharma, derived exclusively from Indian sources, transcended all religions asthe embodiment of the one eternal religion. Vivekananda ultimately resolved thetension between these two views by, as one scholar puts it, placing his view of“the absoluteness of Vedanta” above his competing view of the “harmony and unityof religions.”100 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn100] This outlook would prove deeplyinfluential in shaping Mukunda’s later theology.The relationship between Mukunda and his mentor developed quickly. Though hisfather and older brother did not immediately allow Mukunda to take the swamivows that would make him a formal devotee, they were powerless to diminish thetremendous influence Yukteswar came to exert over him. Ironically, some ofYukteswar’s directives were in line with Bhagabati’s own desires for his son.The yogi convinced his academically indifferent protégé to attend college.Envisioning an international career for Mukunda early on, Yukteswar wasconvinced that his future success hinged on the credibility that came with auniversity degree, just as it had for Vivekananda.101 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn101]Yukteswar had longed to travel to overseas himself, to “teach the universalmethods by which the West will be able to base its religious beliefs on theunshakable foundations of yogic science.” But by the time he took Mukunda as astudent, he was in his mid-fifties and probably realized that the chance for hisown overseas mission had passed. Instead, he would send his student as an“emissary to the West.” Indeed, Mukunda made a much better candidate for thistask than Yukteswar. The coldly analytical Yukteswar recognized that Mukunda’sexpressive devotional style and undisputed love for God would make him a “veryeffective tool to propagate his message in the Christian world.”102[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn102]So Mukunda’s spiritual father succeeded where his earthly father had failed.Bhagabati shared the sentiment of his bhadralok class that education was “themost important and marketable skill.”103 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn103] He hadpressured Mukunda into completing some college coursework before he went to theBenares Mahamandal. His prodding had modest success, as Mukunda grudginglyenrolled briefly in both agricultural college and medical college inCalcutta.104 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn104] Though he was undeniably bright, Mukundafound formal education extremely trying. But if his mentor now demanded it, hewould comply.The college system Mukunda entered in August 1910 was a relatively recentinstitution, a hybrid of Indian and Western traditions. Indian higher educationhad developed in a century-long process that culminated in the ostensiblevictory of a Western-based Anglicist approach over an earlier Orientalistapproach that emphasized the study of Sanskrit and Sanskrit religious texts,though the earlier model had not been fully vanquished.105[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn105] Efforts to Anglicize higher education began withParliament’s 1813 renewal of the East India Company charter, which requiredreauthorization every twenty years. Three distinct groups lobbied to enact aprovision for higher education in the new charter.106 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn106]First, the Bengali bhadralok viewed English-based higher education as a path tosecure occupations for their offspring in commerce or government service thatthey themselves had enjoyed.107 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn107]The other two groups were non-Indians seeking to reform Indian society throughenlightened higher education. Evangelical missionaries were eager to encouragereading of the Word among Indian elites. East India Company officials hadfervently—and, until 1813, successfully—resisted missionary efforts, fearingthat evangelical critiques of Indian beliefs and practices would be severelydisruptive to trade. Their fears were not misplaced. Almost immediately,missionaries began to rail against polytheism and the so-called barbaricpractices that went with it. Frenzied ceremonies, animal sacrifices, andhook-swinging, where devotees hung suspended from a rope attached to a pole,became regular fodder for reports home soliciting funds for continued work.Indian social practices also came under attack, particularly those involving thetreatment of women. Missionaries especially targeted sati, a widow’s ceremonialself-immolation on her husband’s funeral pyre as a display of marital devotion,and the marriage of young girls to adult men to ensure female sexual purity.Utilitarian thinkers easily rivaled evangelicals in their critique oftraditional Indian society. According to historian Michael Curtis, prominentutilitarian James Mill “criticized Hindu manners and behavior, attributing tothem many unpleasant characteristics such as indolence, avarice, lack ofcleanliness, ignorance, absence of rational thought, insincerity, mendacity,perfidy, and indifference to the feelings of others.”108[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn108]In 1835, lobbying by these three groups paid off when Governor-General of IndiaWilliam Bentinck began a halting effort to instruct “natives” in English andWestern subjects, which would “teach the natives of India the marvelous resultsof the employment of labour and capital, rouse them to emulate us in thedevelopment of the vast resource of their country, … confer upon them all theadvantages which accompany the healthy increase of wealth and commerce; and atthe same time, secure to us a larger and more certain supply of many articlesnecessary for our manufactures and extensively consumed by all classes of ourpopulation.”109 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn109] Another half-century passed, however,before sustained efforts were made to create a functional system of highereducation. In 1899, George Nathaniel Curzon, incoming viceroy to India,responded to nationalist agitation in India—which stemmed in part fromdissatisfaction with the existing education system—by appointing a commissionthat ultimately announced reforms to move instruction away from preparation forcivil service exams and toward a broader liberal arts education.110[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn110]Mukunda’s college experience reflected a very recent model, conducted inEnglish, that strove to move from rote memorization to a richer curriculum butretained vestiges of the older Orientalist tradition. Ample helpings of Westernhistory, literature, science, philosophy, and theology were complemented byequally generous servings of the Vedas, Sanskrit, and “various works in Bengaliand Hindustani.”111 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn111] This British education imparted asmuch knowledge about Indian religious texts as it did about Western humanitiesor the sciences.Given the central role evangelicals played in higher education, it is notsurprising that the two places Yogananda attended were both religiousinstitutions. Indian higher education was a two-part system: two years oflower-division instruction, which culminated in an exam, and two years ofupper-division instruction leading to the B.A. degree for those who passed theexam. First, Mukunda enrolled in Scottish Church College, an institution foundedby evangelical Alexander Duff in 1830 that David Kopf describes as “ahigh-powered institution destined to play a critical role in the educationalhistory of Bengal.”112 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn112] Mukunda completed hislower-division coursework in liberal arts, with areas of concentration inSanskrit, philosophy, and chemistry. In 1912, he fell violently ill beforematriculation exams, suffering severe dysentery.When he passed the exam the following year, he hoped that he was done withhigher education forever.113 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn113] But Yukteswar, whobrooked no disagreement, insisted that Mukunda complete his upper-divisioninstruction and obtain his B.A. So Mukunda enrolled at Yukteswar’s alma mater,Serampore College, founded by English evangelist William Carey in collaborationwith Dutch missionaries. The curriculum largely mirrored Scottish ChurchCollege, with attention to Western learning and the Bible, alongside Sanskritand Bengali texts.114 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn114] Thus, Mukunda’s collegeeducation deepened his understanding of Indian texts and traditions whileproviding extensive exposure to Western liberal arts, sciences, and religion.Awareness of a range of diverse intellectual and religious traditions, oftenseen as incompatible, prodded him to begin thinking about the importance of asingle system of universal knowledge.His education was not limited to the college campus. Mukunda and his friendMazumdar also regularly attended a Calcutta branch of the Brahmo Samaj, the mostinfluential reform organization of nineteenth-century Hinduism. The Brahmo Samajspread from Calcutta, where it originated, throughout the major urban areas ofIndia late in the century, but its presence remained strongest in Bengal.115[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn115] Founded by reformer Rammohan Roy, the Samaj became thekey organization in the Bengal Renaissance, an intellectual movement led by agroup of Bengali political leaders, theologians, writers, and artists whoproduced what one scholar has called a “revolutionary awakening of the Indianmind.”116 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn116] These intellectuals conceded the outerdomains of knowledge—science and technology—to European authorities, butasserted that in culture India remained superior and unconquered.117[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn117] The Samaj was the lead organization in the emergenceof a broader modern Hinduism. These intellectuals articulated a form of Hinduismas a universal religion, unmoored to the South Asian landscape and the Indianpeople, its eternal moral and spiritual truths transcending priestly rituals anddivine images.118 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn118] Vivekananda, whose views of Hinduismas an eternal religion were described above, derived this understanding from hisown involvement in the Samaj. Samaj members also sought to reform Indiansociety, reducing or removing caste distinctions, outlawing child marriage, andreforming religious rituals that suggested polytheism and image worship.119[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn119]Some scholars have offered surprisingly harsh judgments against the innovationsof the Brahmo Samaj and the larger Bengali Renaissance. German Indologist PaulHacker popularized the pejorative term neo-Hinduism in the 1950s to identifyIndian reformers’ inauthentic brand of religion.120 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn120]His disciple Wilhelm Halbfass softened his mentor’s tone a bit, but retained thesame basic judgment.121 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn121] More recently, Gerald JamesLarson has said that “rather than being authentic products of India’s ancientcultural heritage,” modern Hinduism is “really much closer in spirit totraditions of late-nineteenth-century European notions of universal religion orliberal Protestant religion.”122 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn122] In viewing theseintellectual changes as inauthentic, critics fail to recognize the organicnature of religion in general and the creativity of Indian responses to thechallenges of modernity. It is true that Bengali Renaissance leaders developedtheir new understanding of Hinduism in the face of British and AmericanChristianity and were inspired by Unitarian conceptions of divinity andspirituality. Still, it is better to see reformed Hinduism as a creativeresponse to pluralism that maintained the centrality of Indian texts andspirituality. “The challenge of orthodox Christianity in India,” as David Kopfexplains, “stimulated the Hindu intelligentsia to rediscover the sources oftheir own religious tradition and to reform their religion according to theirnew image of the remote past.”123 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn123] Historian Kenneth N.Jones strikes the right balance on this question, describing Hindu reformers asdrawing “symbol, concepts, and scriptural legitimization” from their “religiousheritage as well as limited elements of western civilization.”124[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn124] Just as Christianity changed in response to modernchallenges, some Indian leaders “produced a modernized religiosity in colonialIndia.”125 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn125]The Brahmo Samaj shaped Mukunda in key ways. Though the emotional austerity ofthe Samaj’s predominantly rationalistic theism left Mukunda cold, he fell inlove with the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore, the most famous Brahmo Samaj figurein the early twentieth century. More importantly, Samaj leaders and othermembers of the Bengali Renaissance provided Mukunda guidance in his efforts tointegrate Christianity into his worldview. As colonial subjects of a BritishEmpire often associated with Christianity, nationalist leaders were virtuallyrequired to grapple with Christianity’s central figure. Many Bengaliintellectuals felt some ambivalence toward institutional Christianity, but theyoften had warmer feelings about Jesus himself. Rammohan Roy, the earliestBengali Renaissance leader, assisted missionaries in translating the NewTestament and then edited his own edition, The Precepts of Jesus, while Samajleader Keshub Chandra Sen made a “careful distinction between ‘Christ’s messageof universal harmony’ and the institutional Christianity of the nineteenthcentury with its Europeanized, sectarian, and ‘muscular’ view of Christ.”126[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn126] Several other key Indian nationalist leaders wrote orspoke at length about Jesus, including P. C. Mozoomdar, Sri Ramakrishna, SwamiVivekananda, philosopher and Indian president Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, andGandhi.127 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn127]These individuals often found creative ways to make Jesus’s instructioncompatible with Indian teaching. The New Testament Gospels provide littleinformation about Jesus before his ministry around the age of thirty, leavingthe door ajar for any number of creative interventions. From the early Christiancenturies, several apocryphal texts had already exploited this gap in thecanonical Gospels to provide fantastic accounts of Jesus’s childhood.128[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn128] Giving Jesus an Indian childhood was, by comparison, atame innovation. Ironically, this conviction probably sprang originally not fromIndians but from Europeans fascinated, as religion scholar Simon Josephexplains, “with the ‘mystic east’ and the ‘ancient wisdom’ of India.” An Indianchildhood also helped explain the parallels many nineteenth-century Orientalistsperceived between Christianity and Buddhism.129 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn129]Following the lead of these Orientalists, several Indian intellectuals claimedthat Jesus spent the Gospels’ “missing years” in India, absorbing the wisdom ofthe East.130 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn130] Like Yukteswar’s Holy Science, thetreatment of Jesus and Christianity by Bengali Renaissance leaders and otherIndian intellectuals reflected a form of modern “inclusivist appropriation ofother traditions” that Richard King sees as “characteristic” of the movement.131[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn131] Confronting a Christian tradition whose contemporaryspokesmen often criticized Hinduism, Indian leaders refused to respond in kind.Instead, they subsumed Jesus and the religion he founded under Vedic truth.Properly understood, the teachings of Jesus dovetailed perfectly with theuniversal dharma.SWAMI YOGANANDA’S INDEPENDENT PATHMukunda Lal Ghosh joined the elite ranks of Indian college graduates when hereceived his A.B. in the spring of 1915. Though his education had introduced himto science and Western liberalism, while deepening his knowledge of Sanskrit andChristianity, the grudging student had learned more from his guru than he hadfrom formal coursework. Yukteswar’s instruction went beyond intellectualknowledge to include the spiritual disciplines that aided Mukunda’s personaldevelopment. Discipleship to Yukteswar was arduous. Mukunda’s surrogate father,nearly forty years his senior, was no more affectionate than his biological one.By all accounts, Yukteswar was an emotionally distant instructor whose rebukeswere severe and humiliating. Another disciple remembers Yukteswar’s words as“harsh and incisive.” “He would chastise any fault he would see of anyone whowas somewhat close to him. Sometimes his reproof was deprecating. There is nopoint in not admitting that from time to time, even if his reprimand was notphysically hard, the meaning of it would become unbearable to us.”132[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn132] But Mukunda remained convinced that spiritualrenunciation was his path and Yukteswar his appointed guide.Occasional moments of tenderness made Yukteswar’s severity more bearable.Mukunda later described these moments in strikingly erotic terms. Hisrecollection suggests the way that same-sex spiritual intimacy provided acelibate young man with some of the same kind of gratification that others foundin heterosexual romantic relationships. In one incident, Yukteswar grantedMukunda the rare privilege of sharing a bed with him. “I am pleased over yourcheerful labors today and during the past week of preparations,” Yukteswarannounced. “I want you with me; you may sleep in my bed tonight.” Mukunda wasthrilled by the offer. “This was a privilege I had never thought would fall tomy lot. We sat awhile in a state of intense divine tranquility.” The experiencewas akin to spiritual bliss. “I felt,” he recalled, “a tinge of unreality in theunexpected joy of sleeping beside my guru.”133 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn133]Mukunda’s persistence in following Yukteswar’s training kept him at odds withhis father, who still hoped to win him over to more conventional forms ofsatisfaction. Until Mukunda’s college graduation, Bhagabati had convincedhimself that Mukunda’s spiritual devotion was a childhood dalliance and not alifelong path. He kept steering his son toward middle-class security andrespectability. In the nepotistic tradition of the Indian civil service,Bhagabati planned to parlay his lifelong career into a comfortable railwayservice post for Mukunda. With his daughters’ assistance, Bhagabati also playedmatchmaker, looking for a suitable mate for his son. Mukunda rejected twoattempted matches before Bhagabati found the right woman. At this point, Mukundalost patience with his father’s refusal to accept the life course he had chosen.He exploded in rage. “What is the purpose of my marriage? To make you happy? Ifyou think that I will be happy, you are mistaken. I will never be happy inmarriage. No one knows this better than you.”134 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn134]Though Mukunda’s commitment to the spiritual path had long been clear, a vow ofcelibacy was not required. After all, Yukteswar, his guru Mahasaya, and his ownfather had all been householders who nevertheless pursued Kriya Yoga. But forMukunda, rejecting marriage seems to have been an easy decision. No survivingevidence suggests that he experienced any romantic interest in hischildhood—there is no hint of a crush, let alone a more seriousrelationship—apart from a few passing hints of deep intimacy between his twomale childhood friends Basu Kumar Bagchi and Mazumdar. “The trio,” as they wereknown by friends and family, were of “one body, one mind, and one soul.”135[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn135] Mukunda expressed a “deep affection” for Bagchi thatoften left him “entranced.”136 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn136] For his part, Mazumdarthought Mukunda quite handsome and felt an “attraction to him at firstsight.”137 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn137] Sananda confirms this view, indicating thatMazumdar and his brother “were attracted instantly” and “felt the magneticdrawing of the heart’s pure love.”138 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn138] The twoeventually grew “so close and intimate” that they could not bear to be apart forlong.139 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn139]Indeed, the intimate exploration of spiritual ecstasy with male companions,first his friend and later his mentor, proved undeniably blissful. Ananda, the“bliss” that devotees like Mukunda sought through meditation is etymologicallyrelated in Sanskrit to the sexual ecstasy of orgasm, suggesting that the twoexperiences are semantically linked. Mukunda’s yogic practice might havefunctioned as an alternative to—or sublimation of—sexual desire.140[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn140] Religion scholar Jeffrey Kripal made a case forRamakrishna’s homoerotic tendencies and suggested a link between the swami’ssexual desire and his mystical experiences.141 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn141] Whetherthe limited evidence reflects heterosexual discipline, repressed homoeroticdesire, or asexuality on Mukunda’s part is impossible to determine; what iscertain is that he was determined to remain celibate in order to pursuespiritual bliss more wholeheartedly than he thought family life would allow.When Mukunda bluntly rejected the third prospective bride, Bhagabati reluctantlyfaced defeat, offering both the job and the bride to Mukunda’s cousin. Mukundahad won a long and hard-fought victory in his quest to pursue his own spiritualpath.In July 1915, after his rejection of the third marriage proposal had forced hisfather to relent, Mukunda Lal Ghosh took his saṃnyāsin vows. He became anofficial member of the swami order, a monastic organization reputedlyestablished in the eighth century by the great Advaita Vedānta teacherŚankara.142 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn142] Taking vows necessitated assuming a newname, an apt symbol of this momentous step in his spiritual journey. Most swamisinclude the word ananda in their titles, as bliss is the highest plane ofspiritual experience achieved through meditation. Given the centrality of yogain his spiritual pathway to enlightenment, Mukunda wanted that word in his titleas well. His full title indicated “the bliss that one achieves through yoga.”Henceforth, he would be known as Swami Yogananda.The following year, in August 1916, the young swami decided to test his newfoundidentity and independence by traveling to Japan. This was the first voyageoutside India for a man who would ultimately spend more than half of his lifeabroad. The timing was not ideal. The Great War had been raging for two years.The Pacific was not a major theater of war, but both India (as a British colony)and Japan were belligerents, and there were some skirmishes over Germanpossessions in the Pacific. The timing was awkward for more personal reasons aswell. Yogananda’s oldest brother and surrogate father, Ananta, was ill inGorakhpur when Mukunda departed for Japan from Calcutta. Doctors wronglydiagnosed Ananta’s malady as malaria. After Bhagabati transported Ananta toCalcutta for treatment by specialists, Ananta was seen by the principal ofCalcutta Medical College, who became “furious” when he discovered that theGorakhpur doctors had misdiagnosed what was actually a case of typhoid. By thetime the illness was properly diagnosed, it was far advanced. Ananta soon died.Yogananda had insisted on traveling to Japan, despite knowing that his brotherwas ill and that he was ignoring his father’s express wishes. As his normallyadmiring brother Sananda recalled, Yogananda “could not be deterred.”Consequently, he was several thousand miles away when Ananta died.143[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn143]Given the opposition his travel aroused, Yogananda’s reasons for insisting onthe trip remain surprisingly murky. He offers the least compelling explanationin his Autobiography. Foreknowing his brother’s eventual death, he fled to Japanout of despair. Given that his trip required cash, a passport, and travel to abelligerent nation in wartime, this account is not too plausible. Yoganandafashioned a melodramatic account of the event:“Ananta cannot live; the sands of karma for this life have run out.”These inexorable words reached my inner consciousness as I sat one morning indeep meditation. Shortly after I had entered the Swami Order, I paid a visit tomy birthplace, Gorakhpur, as a guest of my elder brother Ananta. A suddenillness confined him to his bed; I nursed him lovingly.The solemn inward pronouncement filled me with grief. I felt that I could notbear to remain longer in Gorakhpur, only to see my brother removed before myhelpless gaze. Amidst uncomprehending criticism from my relatives, I left Indiaon the first available boat. It cruised along Burma and the China Sea to Japan.I disembarked at Kobe, where I spent only a few days. My heart was too heavy forsightseeing.144 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn144]Although this account acknowledges his family’s displeasure, it exonerates hischaracter by suggesting that their dumbfounded reaction stemmed from their lackof appreciation for the depth of his grief. He transforms a presumably selfishact into a sympathetic one undertaken out of extreme emotional sensitivity. Hisclaim that this was a spur-of-the-moment escape, however, is undermined by hishaving obtained a passport expressly for the Japan trip.145[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn145]If Mukunda’s explanation of emotional strain is not convincing, the real reasonremains unclear. Extant accounts offer varying explanations. Two sources seeJapan itself as the destination. Satyananda claims that Yogananda had beenselected to participate in a program whereby Bengalis learned about science andart in other countries. Apparently, he had been sent to Japan to learn aboutfarming. Given Yogananda’s lukewarm academic performance and, as a lifelongurban dweller and son of a professional civil servant, his utter ignorance offarming, this explanation is implausible. Still, it is possible that he may havetaken advantage of a relatively obscure program, however ill-suited he was forit, as an opportunity to travel.146 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn146]More convincing is Dasgupta’s explanation that Yogananda “wanted to follow inVivekananda’s footsteps,” and at that time “Japan was sort of a place ofpilgrimage for independence-hungry Indians.” Along with Vivekananda’s generalexample, Yogananda may have been inspired in his choice of Japan by Swami RamaTirtha, who just a few years earlier had traveled to Japan to teach Hinduism andhad gone on from there to teach in the United States for two years. Yoganandaadmired Tirtha and later set many of his spiritual poems to music.147[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn147]Sananda suggests that Yogananda viewed Japan as a stepping-stone to the UnitedStates. Yogananda hoped to get a visa to the United States to study for adoctorate. Since direct access to the United States was closed during the war,he thought it would be easier to obtain the visa in Japan. Again, Yogananda’sadversarial relationship with education, particularly higher education, makes itdifficult to imagine that he ever intended to pursue a doctorate.148[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn148]Ignoring the element about higher education, it is very likely that Yoganandaenvisioned the United States as a long-term objective. After using Japan as aninitial training ground, Yogananda may have intended to venture further afieldto the United States, as Sananda indicates. After all, after coming to Japanfrom Calcutta, his unofficial role model Vivekananda had eventually made his wayto the United States for his first visit in 1893. Whatever the case, it is clearthat traveling to Japan was no act of spontaneous grief but a calculated step inhis ministry plans. It is equally clear that the new swami was not yet ready formission work. Shortly after arriving, “highly disillusioned by the societalbehavior of the people,” Yogananda became “mentally distressed.” After only afew days in Japan, he boarded a ship to return home.149[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn149]By November, Yogananda was back in Calcutta, surprising his family and friendswith his hasty return. Always one to keep his own counsel, he made no apologyfor a failed expedition—one undertaken in the face of family censure—that kepthim from the bedside of his older brother and surrogate parent. Instead, hecrafted a memory in which his excessive sorrow masked the apparent callousnessof his behavior. His ex post facto prophecy of Ananta’s death converted theevent from a tragedy that caught him by surprise and revealed the foolishness ofthe entire trip into a foreknown eventuality that drove his departure. Byinvoking Ananta’s karma, Yogananda shifted any question of blame from him to hisdead brother. If Yogananda was now free to defy his father’s wishes and travelwhere he chose, he was equally free to cast the resulting conflict in the mannerhe chose.After his return from Japan, Sri Yukteswar—who is strangely absent from accountsof the debacle—encouraged Yogananda to devote himself fully to organizationalwork. His longtime friend Mazumdar, who also had taken vows and was now SwamiSatyananda, would join him. Before departing for Japan, Yogananda had set up amodest ashram in Calcutta as an extension of Yukteswar’s educational centers.Two boys resided at the ashram, while others came regularly for instruction.Inspired by the example of Rabindranath Tagore’s Shantiniketan Ashram,Yogananda, Satyananda, and their friend Bagchi envisioned launching abrahmacharya vidyalaya, a residential school that combined spiritual trainingand contemporary educational principles.Lacking the funding to activate their vision, they began a pattern thatYogananda would follow successfully the rest of his career: they sought outprospective wealthy patrons and marketed their vision. Bagchi eventually foundthe ideal potential benefactor. The maharaja of Kasim Bazar, Manindra ChandraNandi, had a reputation for supporting worthy causes.150[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn150] In response to a petition that Satyananda drafted inEnglish, Bagchi received a prompt, warm welcome from the maharaja. “You areGod-sent,” Nandi announced. “During the last few days, I had also been thinkingabout establishing just such an ashram-school.” At the maharaja’s request, thethree young men (chiefly Satyananda) drafted a lengthy document outlining theirvision for the school and the proposed curriculum. In March 1917, BrahmacharyaVidyalaya School was established in a house belonging to the maharaja in Dihika,roughly 150 miles west of Calcutta. The school quickly became successful andneeded a new location within a year. Nandi offered some property near his palacein Kasim Bazar, north of Calcutta about the same distance as Dihika. After anoutbreak of malaria, the school was relocated in 1918 to a twenty-five-acreproperty at the maharaja’s summer palace in Ranchi, where it has remained eversince.151 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn151]Things seemed to be going well with the Ranchi school. But the restlessYogananda had not given up the idea of an American ministry—a ministry Yukteswarhad also envisioned when he insisted on Yogananda’s college education. In 1920,the young swami’s opportunity to travel to the United States finallymaterialized. He was invited to be a delegate to an International Congress ofFree Christians and Other Religious Liberals in Boston. This meeting, sponsoredby a single Christian denomination, was no 1893 World’s Parliament of Religions.Still, Yogananda saw it as an opportunity to emulate Vivekananda’s earlier visitand chart his own course to fame as a spiritual leader. The Autobiographyrecounts the circumstances in typically dramatic, supernatural terms:“America! Surely these people are Americans!” This was my thought as a panoramaof Western faces passed before my inward view.Immersed in meditation, I was sitting behind some dusty boxes in the storeroomof the Ranchi school. …The vision continued; a vast multitude, gazing at me intently, swept actorlikeacross the stage of consciousness.The storeroom door opened; as usual, one of the young lads had discovered myhiding place.“Come here, Bimal,” I cried gaily. “I have news for you: the Lord is calling meto America!”“To America?” The boy echoed my words in a tone that implied I had said “to themoon.”“Yes! I am going forth to discover America, like Columbus. He thought he hadfound India; surely there is a karmic link between those two lands!”The following day, out of the blue, Yogananda received an invitation to serve asthe delegate from India.152 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn152] Again, the circumstancesof his invitation have a more prosaic explanation—one that reveals thecharacteristic way friends and colleagues were instrumental in advancingYogananda’s career. Heramba Chandra Maitra, who had been Satyananda’s teacher atCity College in Calcutta, was a leader of the Brahmo Samaj and an executivemember of the International Congress of Free Christians and Other ReligiousLiberals. At Satyananda’s urging, Maitra invited Yogananda to attend theconference.153 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn153] Bagchi, now known as Swami Dhirananda,helped Yogananda edit a manuscript that would form the basis of his talk inBoston and his first book, Science of Religion.154 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn154]Beyond the conference, Yogananda had no concrete plans. But he was confidentthat if he made it to the United States, he could find some way to stay andbegin a teaching ministry there.There remained the obstacle of money. When Bhagabati, still unresigned to hisson’s spiritual passions, asked Yogananda how he would fund his expedition,Yogananda assured him that “God will surely provide it.” “Let’s see which godgets you the money!” Bhagabati cynically grumbled.155 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn155]God works in mysterious ways. Ultimately, Yogananda persuaded his skepticalfather to fund the trip. The independent-minded Yogananda undoubtedly hated toask his father for funds, and the request could not have been any more pleasantfor Bhagabati. His son could have had a comfortable career by now, rather thanbegging him to fund an expedition with a very uncertain prospect of success. Thefunding issue resolved, however unpleasantly, in August 1920, Yogananda set sailfor the United States, traveling first class on the S.S. City of Sparta. Hewould not see Calcutta—or his family—for fifteen years. This would be the mostmomentous step in his life’s journey. The renunciant would not retire tosolitary meditation as swamis traditionally did, gathering a small group ofIndian disciples. Instead, he would take the message of yoga to the heart of theWestern world.A SWAMI FOR AMERICAAlthough the relationship Mukunda Lal Ghosh shared with Sri Yukteswar rarelymatched the Autobiography’s idyllic depiction of their first encounter, it wasprofoundly transformative. Yukteswar embodied the fulfilment of Mukunda’schildhood search for spiritual enlightenment, mentoring his protégé in themysteries of Kriya Yoga and many other metaphysical truths. But significant asYukteswar’s guidance was, he was not the sole influence on Yogananda’s spiritualand intellectual development.Life in metropolitan Calcutta offered the young swami the chance to swim withinthe larger currents of Indian modernity. The explosion in print culturefacilitated access to a wide variety of texts on sacred subjects. The cheappaperback copy of the Gospel of Ramakrishna that Yogananda carried around as ayoung man would not have been available to a previous generation. His mobility,particularly through his father’s contacts in the railroad, enabled him to visitvarious sacred sites and experiment with different organizations—such as theBharat Dharma Mahamandal, the Ramakrishna Mission, and the BrahmoSamaj—firsthand. His college education, a function of British colonialmodernity, aided his development of Sanskrit, which enabled him to formallystudy a range of Vedic texts. And the bhadralok public sphere, formed throughnewspapers, other periodicals, and informal discussions with college classmatesand in coffeehouses, reinforced a nationalist understanding of Indian traditionsthat had developed in response to Western critiques.As a result of this widespread exposure, Yogananda developed a worldview thatreflected the influence of several distinct Hindu intellectual traditions withcompeting ontologies.156 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn156] Yukteswar taught him KriyaYoga and he clearly read Patañjali’s Yoga Sūtras, the most influential treatiseon classical yoga. Yoga promotes a dualist ontology, where through meditationthe self comes to experience pure, inactive consciousness, a separation fromchangeable material reality. Saṃkhya, closely related to yoga, also embraces adualist ontology of consciousness and matter, asserting that the materialuniverse was created through a nonsentient process: a disturbance of the perfectbalance between the guṇas, the three elements of all reality.As a swami in the order of Śankara, Yogananda was also rooted in the monisticcosmology of Advaita Vedānta, which emphasizes that all reality is ultimatelyone, Brahman. The perception of duality is real only on the empirical level.Ultimately, however, this perception is māyā, or cosmic delusion. On theabsolute level, the individual is not different from Brahman, the one eternal,universal, and formless reality.Alongside the dualistic and monistic traditions, Yogananda also learned atheistic tradition from his exposure to the Bhagavad Gītā, the Purāṇas, andgoddess worship. Theistic traditions often envision a divinity who creates theworld as a conscious, intentional act. This personal savior god or goddessoffers devotees protection out of sheer grace and is thus worthy of bhakti, ordevotion, sometimes expressed with great emotion.Yogananda forged these disparate monist, dualist, and theistic traditions into aserviceable if fluid worldview. Hinduism has generally tolerated a high level offlexibility, and Yogananda never felt compelled to express his views in arigidly systematic way. Some have assumed that modern Hindu teachers inevitablyreconciled divergent beliefs by privileging Advaita’s monism. But the picture isnot so clear. Even Ramakrishna, the quintessential modern monist, frequentlytalked about God in theistic ways.157 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn157] Richard Kingwarns that accepting modern Advaitans’ claims “to represent all Hindus in totois to fail to grasp the heterogeneous nature of Indian (and indeed human)religiosity in general.”158 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn158]A number of recent scholars have challenged the notion that Advaita was thepredominant view throughout Indian history, pointing out much prominent theisticteaching throughout India’s past. Andrew Nicholson suggests that Advaita, farfrom being the sole authentic voice of Hindu philosophy, is a relative newcomerin the larger sweep of Indian intellectual history.159 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn159]Jeffery Long likewise argues that Advaita Vedānta “does not reflect the dominanthistorical consensus, or even the contemporary consensus, of the Hindu traditionwith regard to the ultimate nature of reality.”160 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn160]Instead, as David Ray Griffin concludes, “most Hindu piety is theistic, beingbhatkti (devotion) to a personal deity.”161 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn161] Thedualism of yoga makes Advaita’s absolute monism particularly problematic.162[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn162]Among the various strands of tradition that formed Yogananda’s worldview, heseemed most at home with the theistic cosmology expressed in bhakti and theempirical level of Advaita. He encouraged a devotional relationship with apersonal creator God while affirming that in some way the individual actuallyshared the divine nature.163 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn163] He captured this onenessin difference through metaphors relating the ocean to the wave, the flame to thespark, and the flower to the fragrance and through more personal examples. “Thouart the Father to the child,” he reflected, “and I am Thy Child; We are One.”164[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn164] Satyananda clearly distinguished his childhoodfriend’s devotion to a personal deity from his own absolute monism.165[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn165] Yukteswar thought Yogananda’s devotionalism made himespecially suited to an American ministry, as U.S. audiences largely hailed fromChristian backgrounds and typically thought of God in transcendent terms.166[18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn166]The most significant innovation of modern Hinduism that shaped Yogananda’sworldview was the radical reassessment of the faith’s possible adherents.Indians had traditionally neither sought nor accepted converts, viewing theirtraditions as inherent to South Asia and its people. Torkel Brekke identifiesthree stages in the nineteenth-century transformation of Indian traditions thatled to an embrace of audiences outside the subcontinent: the objectification ofreligion as a separate element of social organization; the individualization ofreligion that severed people from caste, life stage, and pilgrimages andregional festivals; and the universalization of Hinduism that “now was linked tohuman nature and could be applied to anyone, anywhere, any time.” UniversalizingHinduism as eternal truth for all people abstracted Indian belief from the land,culture, and people of the subcontinent and made them transportable to newlands. As a result, in the late nineteenth century, “Hinduism became amissionary religion.” This was a dramatic development. “The thought that a Hindushould travel abroad in order to preach Hinduism simply makes no sense beforethe transformation in religious perception that took place in the nineteenthcentury.”167 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn167] This radical development in modernHinduism was the sine qua non of Yogananda’s evangelistic efforts.As a missionary Hindu, Yogananda jettisoned the celebration of seasonalfestivals, eschewed building Indian-style temples, downplayed physicaldepictions of deities, and rejected the notion of caste as a hereditary socialsystem. He was also indebted to modern Hinduism’s inclusivism. He selectivelyincorporated elements of Christianity, New Thought, and physical culture whileinsisting on unique transcendence of the eternal dharma. His mission to theUnited States sprang from the conviction that India possessed a uniquely richspiritual tradition that was lacking in the West.His evangelistic career reflected a form of religious and cultural nationalismespecially prominent in Bengal. In embracing the Orientalist dichotomy between atechnologically advanced West and a spiritual East, he followed the path chartedby such Indian predecessors as Vivekananda, who engaged in “judo” by takingtropes about the spiritual East and adopting them as weapons to celebrate thesuperiority of Indian culture.168 [18_notes.xhtml#c1.fn168] In response toattacks on Hindu traditions and caricatures of India as a passive recipient ofsuperior Western knowledge, Yogananda offered India as the ultimate source ofspiritual truth, an eternal wisdom desperately needed in the decadent UnitedStates. This truth transcended human knowledge, remaining pure even as itabsorbed and reinterpreted Western categories of thought and Christian doctrine.By the time twenty-seven-year-old Swami Yogananda prepared to set sail for theUnited States, he had explored the rich diversity of Indian spiritual traditionsand formed his own distinctive understanding. In 1920, the young yogi preparedto begin his true vocation, offering Americans a spirituality of mentaldiscipline, bodily control, and ecstatic spiritual experiences rooted in ancientbeliefs and practices, but in tune with the fast-paced, urban pragmatism ofmiddle-class business people. The first stage in his life journey had ended, anda much longer one was about to begin."},{"pageContent":"TWOTHE FOUNDING OF A HOME FOR SCIENTIFIC RELIGIONSWAMI YOGANANDA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA’S SPIRITUAL FRONTIER, 1920–1925The young turbaned swami embarked for the United States in August 1920, a visualparagon to Western audiences of the exotic spirituality of the East.1[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn1] His physical journey from Calcutta to Boston—via theSuez Canal and then from Liverpool to the United States—also constituted asymbolic journey, a decisive “crossing” from the only spiritual and physicalhome he had known.2 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn2] Before embarking, his friends hadsuggested that, in deference to American audiences, he cut off the beard he worein keeping with saṃnyāsin practice. On board ship, he concluded that theunspoken hostility he sensed from fellow passengers stemmed from his appearance.So he decided to shave his beard.3 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn3] But he kept his hairlong and donned a turban for the first time, to gratify American expectationsand likely in imitation of Vivekananda’s earlier practice.4[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn4] He also continued to wear his ocher robes. Later, whenhe discovered that his cotton robes would make Americans think him“poverty-stricken” and thus reluctant to follow him, he traded cotton for silk.5[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn5]Yogananda’s sartorial compromise captures his nascent efforts to craft a personafor American audiences. Traveling from one world to another offered unparalleledfreedom to invent an image of himself. Understanding both the peril and thepromise of his exotic identity, he avoided extremes: he rejected the appearanceof a severe ascetic, which would have played into American fears of the Orientalprimitive, but he also avoided Western suits and American barbers, judiciouslyprotecting the cachet of his Indian identity. Yogananda’s management of hisappearance reflected a larger effort to calibrate his message to his audience’sframe of reference. His initial audience was a gathering of religious leaders,but he hoped to find a national audience for his Hindu message. A missionaryaims, as religious sociologist Lewis R. Rambo explains, “to communicate the newreligious message in a manner that is understandable,” which typically involves“the creativity of missionaries in finding comparisons and analogies withindigenous culture and customs that will familiarize the message, clothe the newstory in recognizable garb.”6 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn6] Humanities scholarSrinivas Aravamudan posits a uniquely Indian version of cross-culturalself-presentation called “Guru English,” an intentionally ambiguoustransnational discourse of translating “South Asian spiritual superiority insearch of hegemony.” Aravamudan includes Yogananda in his retinue of globalgurus, arguing that Yogananda counseled audiences to “abandon the bullock cartvehicle of Western theological paths to God for the Hindu equivalent of theaeroplane—surely a fitting ironic reversal of the perception of India as atechnically backward and historical underdeveloped culture.”7[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn7]So where does a Hindu swami fit into a narrative of 1920s America? In thisperiod, Protestants “still thought of themselves largely as guardians of themoral and spiritual treasure carefully cached away by ancestors centuriesbefore,” as religious historian Edwin Gaustad puts it,8 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn8]and major American periodicals like Harper’s, Scribner’s, and the AtlanticMonthly reflected Protestant establishment views not only in their editorialsbut often in their articles as well.9 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn9] Public and pressattention to religion focused on the fundamentalist-modernist debate withinProtestantism, the growing ethnoreligious diversity that prompted nativism, and,to a lesser extent, the growth of Pentecostalism. Given the continued hegemonyof Protestantism in American culture, it is no surprise that Hinduism and yogawere not incorporated into older narratives of this period in surveys ofAmerican religion.10 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn10] Yet newer surveys, written decadesafter the first calls to recast the dominant narrative of mainstream Protestantunity as a story of religious pluralism, continue to ignore South Asianspirituality before the 1960s.11 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn11] In contrast, scholarswho discuss metaphysical traditions and Eastern religious imports tend to treatthese faiths in isolation from the dominant Protestant religion, perhaps in aneffort to redress the neglect of nonmainstream traditions. In her magnum opus onAmerican metaphysical traditions, Republic of Mind and Spirit, CatherineAlbanese places Yogananda in the context of New Thought and other metaphysicalmovements of the late nineteenth century, without considering his relationshipto hegemonic Protestantism.12 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn12]Yogananda’s efforts to reach American audiences with the message of yoga can beproperly understood only through an examination of the intersection of hegemonicProtestantism and modern Hinduism. Viewed in this context, Yogananda’s use ofChristian terms and categories reflected an effort to articulate the superiorityof Hinduism as a universal religion, using his audience’s own universalisticdiscourse. Yogananda turned the conventional evangelism narrative on its head: asubject who hailed from a region long targeted by American missionaries, he hadbecome an evangelist to America. Having come of age in an India deeply enmeshedin modern conditions, he was well prepared to present scientific religion tointerested audiences. But such audiences were unevenly spread throughout anisolationist and xenophobic nation often deeply suspicious of Asians and Asianreligious practices. Finding a suitable base of operations in SouthernCalifornia proved a crucial step in his missionary endeavors.Images [../figures/f0067-08.jpg]Swami Yogananda as he looked at the time of his departure for the United Statesin 1920. This is one of the few extant photographs of Yogananda as a young swamibefore the start of his American ministry. He had donned a turban to look moreexotic and had not yet shaved the beard that made Europeans aboard ship with himthink he looked sinister.This chapter traces Yogananda’s early years in the United States in the contextof Protestant upheavals in the modern era. The first section examines his yearsin Boston, beginning with the religious conference that brought him to theUnited States and his relatively modest role in the proceedings. The intramuralProtestant debate of this period featured opponents who offered competinganswers to the epistemological challenges that modernity raised forChristianity’s universalistic claims. This section also explores hisrelationship with the Lewis family, his earliest devotees, who established thetemplate for all his later relationships. Given how challenging and exotic hisgospel was, he tended to draw spiritual seekers who found him personallycompelling as an authentic and authoritative teacher. This section concludeswith the cross-country road trip that took Yogananda to Los Angeles, whichquickly became his national headquarters.The second section shifts the focus of religious ferment to Los Angeles,unfolding in some detail the religious context of the city that became a muchmore congenial home base for Yogananda’s ministry than Boston. The nation’sspiritual frontier in the early twentieth century, Los Angeles lured a criticalmass of spiritual seekers. As religious diversity increased, Protestant elitesextended a grudging tolerance toward nonmainstream movements that providedsufficient space for Yogananda to set up shop. Southern California offeredanother kind of openness. Boston’s landscape had been claimed as sacred space byChristian groups for centuries—by seventeenth-century Puritans, thenTranscendentalists, and, more recently, the Christian Science movement. SouthernCalifornia’s landscape, in contrast, was still largely unmarked by religioussymbols and available for Yogananda to claim as sacred space.Finally, to account for the welcome Yogananda received in Los Angeles, thechapter draws on notions of Orientalism to explore the ambivalent position ofIndians in Southern California. Indians, in the eyes of many Americans, wereboth a pagan people with a predilection for lawlessness and simultaneously theembodiment of the exotic East’s opulence, mystery, and ancient traditions.Yogananda capitalized on the latter, building on the belief held by somecosmopolitan Angelenos that India possessed unique spiritual wisdom. The chapterends with Yogananda’s purchase of a hotel and property in Mount Washington ashis movement’s permanent home. In these crucial early years, Yoganandaexperimented with the persona he presented to audiences, challenged his firstdisciples to find their own true selves through his teachings and relationshipwith him, and found a headquarters in the nation’s new spiritual epicenter—aquintessentially American place where seekers could encounter God through yoga.YOGANANDA’S SCIENCE OF RELIGION AND PROTESTANT MODERNISMThe 1920s, contrary to stereotypes that emphasize the era’s secularity, were aboom decade for American religion.13 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn13] When Yoganandaarrived in Boston in September 1920, his Unitarian hosts and their fellowliberals were enmeshed in a long-running debate with conservative Protestantopponents about the fate of Christian universalism in a modern world—a world inwhich science provided a comprehensive worldview, “an account of the mysteriesof the world” that rivaled Christianity.14 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn14] ManyProtestant leaders attempted to steer a middle course, but the intenselypolarized debate left the less militant without a voice. Both camps wereresponding to the challenges of modernity, including “positivistic science,corporate and government bureaucracy, the research university, Darwinism,historical-critical study of the Bible, consumerism, [and] urbanization.”15[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn15] The fundamentalist-modernist debate representedcompeting answers to three major epistemological questions with far-reachingimplications: supernaturalism, including the divinity of Christ; the relationbetween contemporary science and religion, which held implications for views ofnature and human ontology; and the rise of higher criticism, which called intoquestion the Bible’s unique authority as divine revelation by subjecting it tothe same critical judgments as any other text.Leaders of the conservative faction called themselves fundamentalists for thefirst time in 1920, the year Yogananda arrived in Boston. Though often attackedby modernist critics as anti-intellectual, fundamentalism was an “intellectualmovement” committed to Scottish Common Sense Realism and Baconian inductiveempiricism. In fundamentalists’ minds, the emergence of “speculative”evolutionary theory had disrupted the earlier harmony between science andreligion.16 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn16] Their self-designation reflected thesignificance of The Fundamentals, a set of pamphlets with contributions fromscholars around the world, sponsored by oil baron Lyman Stewart, who also gotthe fledging Bible Institute of Los Angeles off the ground.17[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn17] The editors aimed to send the pamphlets to “everypastor, evangelist, missionary, theological professor, theological student,Sunday school superintendent, Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. secretary in the Englishspeaking world” because the “time has come when a new statement of thefundamentals of Christianity should be made.”18 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn18]Unsystematic and redundant, the articles in The Fundamentals circled backrepeatedly to several cardinal supernatural tenets, most notably the divinity ofJesus, the reality of a transcendent God who had intervened in human affairs inmiraculous ways, the immortality of the soul, and life after death. They alsoaffirmed the need for conversion, evangelism, and global missions.19[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn19]Unitarians and other religious liberals, typically labeled modernists, foundcommon ground in their willingness to reconsider traditional tenets in light ofscholarly and scientific discoveries. Preeminent modernist Reverend HarryFosdick argued that while fundamentalists were “driving in their stakes to markout the deadline of doctrine around the church, across which no one is to passexcept on terms of agreement,” Christian liberals refused to abandon intellect.Rather, to “really love the Lord their God, not only with all their heart andsoul and strength but with all their mind, they have been trying to see this newknowledge in terms of the Christian faith and to see the Christian faith interms of this new knowledge.”20 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn20] Liberals accepted apartly disenchanted world and, consequently, a shrunken role for the church inpublic life, particularly in the academic realm.21 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn21] Theybegan to think more in terms of divine immanence and this-worldly goals. Theyalso rethought the nature of missions, often concluding that serving the poorremained a legitimate goal but that calls for conversion smacked of culturalarrogance. Instead, Christians should be willing to learn from otherreligions.22 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn22]Boston Unitarians were the advance guard of liberal Christianity. They signaledtheir repudiation of evangelism and openness to other religions by invitingnon-Christians like Yogananda to the 1920 International Congress of FreeChristians and Other Religious Liberals. The congress commemorated thefour-hundredth anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing at Plymouth Rock, eloquentlyattesting to liberal Protestantism’s trajectory from Anglo-Puritan sectarianismin the seventeenth century to broad religious pluralism in the early twentieth.Since the late eighteenth century, Boston had been the hub of Unitarianism, anEnlightenment-inspired movement in Congregationalism that renounced thenarrowness of its Puritan heritage. The invitation to the conference expressedits conveners’ temperament: “All religious liberals of constructive temper anddisinterested purpose share the rich inheritance of the Pilgrim spirit. All areendeavoring to express in the terms that befit the twentieth century theprinciples and hopes that animated the Pilgrims at Plymouth. We believe, as theydid, in liberty under law, in religious toleration, in popular government, inindustrial cooperation, and we seek to make these principles vital in the lifeof modern commonwealths.”23 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn23] By the time of theconference, Unitarians had enjoyed a century-long relationship with Indianintellectuals. They had been especially influential in supporting the BrahmoSamaj, the flagship Hindu Renaissance organization described in chapter 1[12_chapter01.xhtml]. As the functional headquarters of Unitarianism, Boston washome to many of the Unitarians who established warm friendships with Samajmembers in the nineteenth century.24 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn24] Yogananda’s modernHinduism was quite congenial with early twentieth-century Unitarianism, and withAmerican religious liberalism more generally, and throughout his career he wouldfind allies among its ranks.The International Congress of Free Christians and Other Religious Liberals ranfrom October 3 through 7 and offered a relatively modest slate of presentations.And despite the hosts’ avowed commitment to inclusiveness, the conferenceremained a largely Christian affair. The keynote speakers were all Christianclergy, including one of the few nonwhites, Professor S. Uchigasaki, leader of aUnitarian church in Tokyo. Along with Uchigasaki and the Buddhist J. Rikumani,Yogananda was relegated to a special session on the relation between “Oriental”religions and liberal Christianity.25 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn25] Still, Yoganandaviewed the gathering as an august body, and his own participation as an honorand, in retrospect, a significant milestone in his career. In a commemorativeprogram photograph of several delegates, Yogananda stands conspicuously frontand center in turban and flowing robes, surrounded by pale, sternAnglo-Americans in suits; Uchigasaki, with short hair and a suit, peeks out frombehind the group. Yogananda serves as an eloquent prop for the organizers’message of broad-minded tolerance, as well as their implicit paternalism.26[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn26] The official program described Yogananda as the“delegate from the Brahmacharya Sanghasran of Ranchi, India,” and praised his“fluent English” and “forcible delivery.”27 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn27] As aforeshadow of many future occurrences, the local press presented a garbleddescription of Yogananda. A Boston news article described him, not inaccurately,as “principal of the Residential School of Religion for boys,” but added the odddescription that he was a representative of “an organization in India which isendeavoring to end religious strife and bigotry and develop broadmindedness.”28[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn28]The organizers’ summary of his talk expressed their evident approval of hisviews. “Religion, he maintained, is universal and it is one. We cannot possiblyuniversalize particular customs and convictions, but the common element inreligion can be universalized, and we can ask all alike to follow and obey it.As God is one, necessary for all, so religion is one, necessary and universal.It is only the limited human point of view that overlooks the underlying anduniversal element in the so-called different religions of the world.”29[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn29] Indeed, Yogananda’s presentation on rational universalreligion, which reflected the language of modern Indian elites, was perfectlycalibrated to appeal to the conference’s liberal audience.The title of his talk, “Science of Religion,” was a catchphrase among the BrahmoSamaj based on well-established Samaj ideas regarding the “discovery of naturallaws about religion” discerned through nonsectarian comparative religiousstudy.30 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn30] Joseph S. Alter argues that modern Indian yogaliterature frequently refers to yoga as a science, in the somewhat idiosyncraticsense of a “precise and special way of knowing” whose ultimate goal is “totranscend knowledge and realize absolute truth through direct experience.”31[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn31]Yogananda echoed this language of scientific religious truth. He explicated the“one truth” underlying all religions, “that unless you know yourself as spirit,as the fountain-head of Bliss—separate from Body and mind—your existence isdevoid of meaning, your life is akin to that of a brute. We can know God only byknowing ourselves, for our natures are similar to His. Man has been createdafter the image of God. If the methods suggested are practised in right earnestyou will know yourself to be Blissful spirit and in it you will feel God.”Yogananda offered a certain means for “the control, regulation and turning backof the life-force to transcend the body and mind and know the ‘Self’ in itsnative State.”32 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn32] God, he said, can be experiencedthrough “four fundamental methods”: intellect, devotion, meditation, andscience.Yogananda’s erudite presentation, which fit squarely within the liberal camp,provided eloquent testimony to the wisdom of non-Christian religion, challengingthe fundamentalist call to evangelize heathen India. He also emphasized thethis-worldly benefits of spiritual practice, spoke of the divine as immanent,and embraced a pragmatic, experiential approach to religion. In line with thelanguage of Advaita Vedānta monism, he suggested that God was equivalent toBliss. “God may be or become anything—Personal, Impersonal, All-merciful,Omnipotent, etc., etc. But what I say is that we do not require to take note ofthese. What conception we have put forth is just according to our purpose, ourhopes, aspirations and our perfection.”33 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn33] Indeed, it ishis lack of dogmatism about the conceptualization of God that harmonized bestwith liberal Christianity at this point in his career.Still, certain elements of Yogananda’s presentation seemed more in line with thefundamentalist-evangelical camp, in tone and even in content. The narrativetrajectory of his written text, The Science of Religion, echoed evangelicalChristianity. The book’s arc imitated a revival sermon or a gospel tract thatmoves from despair to hope. It began with the universal desire of humanity toknow God, unveiled the false and idolatrous substitutes humans find, andconcluded with the liberating transformation that comes when people discover thetruth. In matters of content, too, the text had affinities with fundamentalistprinciples. Religious liberals had retracted the sacred canopy, grantingreligious truth a narrower authority than in the previous century. Yogananda,however, like fundamentalists, viewed his truth claims as applicable to allareas of life, having direct implications for health, psychology, business,physics, and chemistry.34 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn34] And despite his protests ofagnosticism or indifference to depictions of God, he nevertheless simultaneouslyadvanced a view of God as transcendent and personal. Acknowledging that “ourspiritual hopes and aspirations … require the conception of God as a PersonalBeing,” Yogananda assured listeners that “He is a Person in the transcendentalsense. Our being, consciousness, feeling are limited, and empirical, thoseaspects of His are unlimited and transcendental. Nor should He be thought as anAbstract, Impersonal Being full of His own power and glory, beyond the reach ofall experience—even our internal one. He, as we remarked, comes within the calmexperience of men.”35 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn35] Though instruction on theabsolute monism of Advaita continued throughout his career, this devotional viewof a personal deity—a deity on whose loving concern humans depend and in whosenature they partake—remained a characteristic feature of Yogananda’s teaching.Paradoxically, it was in his very claim of broad-mindedness that he was mostlike fundamentalists. The Science of Religion assured readers that “as God isOne, necessary, so religion is one, necessary and universal,” and Yoganandadownplayed the “question of the variety of religions—that of Christ, of Mahomet,or of the Hindus.” But he presented “universal religion” from within adistinctly Indian cosmology.36 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn36] Though he used theEnglish word Bliss instead of the Sanskrit word ananda, he relied on Vedāntatheology throughout. He argued that Bliss was the goal of life (identical to theexperience of God), that the search for Bliss was stifled by the “delusion” ofconfusing the Self with the body, that Bliss could be achieved only bydestroying desire and attachment, that a “life current” animates humansphysically and spiritually, and that behavior is shaped by innate tendenciesknown as saṃskāras. Rather than celebrating the diversity of various worldreligions, Yogananda used scientific and Christian language to present aninclusivist vision of Hinduism through which all other religions found theirtrue meaning—a faith that in his view provided uniquely satisfying answers tothe anomie of a modern materialistic society.One central theme of Yogananda’s later writing is visible in nascent form in TheScience of Religion. Though Yogananda discusses Christ only once in the text,his outlook is already evident as he reinterprets Christian understanding of theCrucifixion in light of Hinduism. He begins by dismissing the Gospels’explanation of Jesus’s words that the Son of Man will be delivered to Gentilesto be crucified. It is “absurd” to think, Yogananda scoffed, that “Christ, theEternal Spirit was to be crucified by material nails and His Spirit destroyed.”But an alternative explanation made considerable sense: “unless we can transcendthe body and realise ourselves as spirit we can not enter into the kingdom orstate of that Universal Spirit.” Not surprisingly, Yogananda found “an echo ofthis in a Sanskrit couplet of the oriental scriptures. ‘If thou canst transcendthe body and perceive thyself as spirit thou shalt be eternally blissful andfree from all pain.’”37 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn37]The five-day congress, despite its grand rhetoric about the nation’s Pilgrimheritage, remained a modest affair. By contrast, the World’s Parliament ofReligions in 1893, the model for this gathering in Yogananda’s mind, hadincluded more than two hundred formal addresses, drew several thousandparticipants a day, and lasted more than two weeks.38 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn38]Consequently, Yogananda did not become an immediate sensation like Vivekananda.Instead, when the meeting ended, he was cast adrift in an unfamiliar country.The next few years after the conference proved challenging. In his laterAutobiography, he glossed over this period from the winter of 1920 through thesummer of 1924 with two short, upbeat sentences: “Four happy years were spent inhumble circumstances in Boston. I gave public lectures, taught classes, andwrote a book of poems, Songs of the Soul, with a preface by Dr. Frederick B.Robinson, president of the College of the City of New York.”39[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn39] But at the time, he viewed this period as one of “leanmonths,” “difficulties,” and “trials.”40 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn40] For two years,Yogananda could not meet his basic needs and leaned heavily on his father, whosent him 250 rupees a month (roughly $100), and continued to support himfinancially in some fashion for a decade.41 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn41] Britishgovernment officials, who were quite literally reading his mail, as they did forcolonial expatriates with the potential to foment nationalist rebellion,concluded that the swami’s American sojourn was temporary. Based on a letter toBhagabati, they concluded that Yogananda was in the United States “to make afortune” before returning to India for good.42 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn42]In November 1920, four weeks after the conference ended, Yogananda attended atalk on Rosicrucianism, a late nineteenth-century esoteric spirituality that, inits Christian form, emphasized secret inner teachings of Jesus. After the talk,one of the meeting’s organizers introduced Yogananda to Mildred Lewis, ablue-blooded Bostonian. She was captivated by his exotic appearance: “adark-skinned, Indian Swami whose long black hair flowed over his shoulders. Hewas wearing an orange turban, orange coat, puttees, and sort of orange-colored,high-laced shoes. I was not accustomed to seeing anyone dressed this way; I musthave been a strange-looking person to this Hindu Swami, as he was for me.” Shedescribed her meeting with Yogananda to her husband, Minott Lewis. He was notinitially interested in the exotic religious teacher. A graduate of Tufts’school of dentistry and an occasional instructor of clinical dentistry there, hehad been reared to be wary of “charlatans in the name of religion.”43[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn43] A short time later, Yogananda met Alice Hasey at WestSomerville Unitarian Church, who invited him to her home to meet several womenfriends and discuss metaphysics. Ironically, she also contacted her good friendDr. Lewis and encouraged him to meet Yogananda. After prodding from his wife andHasey, Lewis finally agreed to meet Yogananda.Yogananda’s first interaction with Minott Lewis illustrates the approach thatwon over many Americans, a facility with Christian teachings combined withinstruction in meditation based on an authoritative guru-disciple relationship.Despite his reluctant agreement to meet Yogananda, Lewis remained on guard. Hedecided to test Yogananda’s theological acumen by challenging him to explain acryptic apothegm from Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount: “It says in the Bible, ‘Ifthine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of Light.’ Can you tell meanything about this? … I have asked many, but no one seems to know about it.”Without missing a beat, Yogananda answered Lewis’s query with another NewTestament apothegm, “‘Can the blind lead the blind? They both fall into the sameditch.’” This sage reply prompted the doctor to exclaim, “For heaven ‘s sake,please show me.” Yogananda immediately looked into Lewis’s eyes and asked, “Willyou always love me as I love you?” Though Lewis had never received such anaudacious demand from a virtual stranger, he looked at Yogananda and “sawsomething that I had not seen before in anyone.” So he quickly responded, “Yes,I will.” Yogananda then proclaimed, “That’s fine. I take charge of your life.”He introduced Lewis to meditation, as both men sat cross-legged on a tiger skin.Yogananda showed Lewis the Light, “the star in the spiritual eye and thethousand-petaled lotus.”44 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn44] With this remarkableexchange, Yogananda’s first American guru-disciple relationship commenced.Mildred’s own much less dramatic conversion followed, but she always struggledto submit to Yogananda as her guru with the same abandon as her husband.Given Protestant American aversion to clerical authority and attraction toindividual autonomy in spiritual matters, the Lewises’ submission to the bolddemand of total allegiance from a new acquaintance is surprising.45[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn45] Throughout his career, disciples routinely attested toYogananda’s magnetism. He personified Max Weber’s as yet unpublished notion ofcharisma: “A certain quality of an individual personality, by virtue of which heis set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural,superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities. These aresuch as are not accessible to the ordinary person, but are regarded as of divineorigin or as exemplary, and on the basis of them the individual concerned istreated as a ‘leader.’”46 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn46] Minott, and to a lesserextent Mildred, were spiritual seekers when Yogananda appeared in their lives.He offered himself to them completely as the answer to their search, and hedemanded unqualified devotion in return. Seeking required openness to thepossibility that spiritual truth would manifest in unexpected, evenuncomfortable, ways. The very confidence of Yogananda’s invitation todiscipleship conveyed a self-authenticating spiritual authority. And it promisedprofound spiritual revelations the Lewises could only imagine.For Yogananda, this new relationship brought practical benefits. The dentist wasno maharaja, but he was as lavish in his financial support as his means allowed.From the outset, Dr. Lewis—who had been taken financial advantage of by anearlier acquaintance—pressed for assurances that Yogananda would not fleece him.Yogananda replied that “with a truly religious man, that is not possible.”47[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn47] Still, Yogananda stretched the Lewises’ faith. Heregularly challenged them to give more—sometimes substantially more—and insistedthat his spiritual work could not carry on without them. While Mildred andMinott both continued to wrestle with these demands, Mildred was by far the morereluctant. On one occasion, Yogananda abruptly announced, “Doctor, I will haveto have a thousand dollars.” The Lewises had two young children, a mortgage, anda new automobile. Mildred balked at this extraordinary entreaty but wasoverruled by her husband. “I was completely upset by this, but that was the wayit went. Master got it; and so he went off to New York with [Alice Hasey] andtwo or three other students who had been attending lectures in Boston,” whilethe Lewises stayed home.48 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn48] Frustrated by Yogananda’sdemands, she was occasionally aloof.Never entertaining the possibility that he had contributed to relationaltensions, Yogananda deemed Mildred’s conduct a form of spiritual weakness. Asthe essential mediator of the Lewises’ spiritual journey, he viewed any lack oftrust in him as tantamount to a lack of faith in God’s provision. He rebukedMildred directly, or in letters jointly written to the couple, or, moremanipulatively, as asides in letters written to Minott but sure to be read byMildred. “Please remember one thing,” he wrote to Mildred in 1923, “Sat-Sangadoes not depend on anyone’s mistakes, it is grounded in truth and its doctrinesshould be received as such. I invite constructive criticism, but ruthless publiccriticism simply for the love of it is against the laws of even simplefriendship.” He quoted Jesus to her, “Judge ye not others that ye be [not] [sic]judged.” Then he promised to visit her in Boston, commanding, “Let the virus,the inharmonious spirit that disturbs your own peace be removed, and letSat-Sanga be made alive with your newer expressions during my absence.”49[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn49] The following year, in a letter addressed to bothLewises, he expressed the tough love that motivated his reproof. “It sometimesbecomes very hard for me to rebuke Mildred, knowing what she feels within. Iknow and you know, how dearly God has grown our friendship.”50[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn50]Despite the rough patches in their relationship, the Lewises became the swami’sclosest friends, most admiring followers, and most generous early donors.Yogananda always expressed effusive gratitude for their support. “Words fail toexpress,” he wrote in one 1923 letter, “what you have done for Sat-Sanga. … Youhave been the golden instrument of God’s Touch—to manifest His Work. You haveshown to me again that God helps when everybody fails.” He also assured them ofthe spiritual—and perhaps material—benefits they would accrue as the ministrymatured. “May He give you unceasing faith and fulfill your desires and make youprosperous in every way.”51 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn51]Their trust in his authenticity and authority deepened as they witnessed himheal Minott, the couple’s son, and their daughter. In 1921, Yogananda’snaturopathic remedy rid their son, Bradford, of a persistent stomachache thatnever returned. Mildred viewed this as a “miracle of healing,” and “from thistime on, my faith was established in Master’s spiritual powers.” This incidentwas her “first realization of the supernatural powers of Swami Yogananda.”52[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn52] He interceded for their daughter, healing herpermanently from routine convulsions.53 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn53] Yogananda alsohealed the elder Minott from a “very depressing, serious condition with thebody, which caused me great pain and made the practice of my profession verydifficult.” Though Minott withheld details, he offered the tantalizing commentthat Yogananda had applied a “very peculiar, drastic remedy.” Again, the illnessleft never to return.54 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn54]Through the Lewises’ generosity, Yogananda founded his first “Sat-Sanga,” orspiritual community of truth, in Boston and an ashram at Hardy’s Pond inWaltham. Ten miles from Concord, birthplace of Transcendentalism, the modestcottage in Waltham was a tribute to Henry David Thoreau’s experiment thereseventy-five years earlier. Yogananda also visited Ralph Waldo Emerson’s Concordhome in 1921.55 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn55] He had an affinity for theTranscendentalists and their celebration of feeling, intuition, andself-discovery. The core faithful Yogananda disciples in the Boston areaamounted to about a dozen apart from the Lewises, Alice Hasey, and Minott’ssister, Laura Elliott. Yogananda’s reassurances to Dr. Lewis that the movementwould become nationwide must have sounded hollow.56 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn56]Yogananda was right that the number of followers would grow dramatically, buttheir demographic pattern would change very little. For starters, “His clientsappear to be mostly women,” the British officials keeping tabs on Yoganandaaccurately concluded.57 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn57] Educated, middle-class womenwere generally most responsive to his message, a gender pattern thatcharacterized Christian churches but was more pronounced among nonmainstreamspiritual movements.58 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn58] Also, Yogananda generally drewindividuals from liberal Protestant denominations or new religious movements,such as Theosophy and Rosicrucianism. His followers were in the forefront of theseekers who have been a prominent feature of American spirituality since the1960s—individuals engaged in the “universal search for human meaning” outsidethe constraints of traditional church structures.59 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn59]The Boston community of seekers struggled to survive. Yogananda tried toincrease membership by pitching his talks to a popular audience: “The InnerLife,” “Quickening the Right Prosperity,” and “Concentration.” The absence ofreligious language was a prominent element of his broadened appeal, especiallynotable given that “Science of Religion” was the talk that brought him toBoston. He experimented with different ways of presenting himself, oftensacrificing accuracy for the sake of presumed appeal. One newspaperadvertisement—which appeared in the Amusements section sandwiched betweenannouncements for vaudeville productions, casinos, Charlie Chaplin films, and anAl Jolson blackface performance—displayed a picture of the turbaned“psychologist” and his “sensational discovery of everlasting youth,” a topicoutside the purview of most psychologists.60 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn60] Despitehaving no formal training in psychology, Yogananda often labeled himself a“famous psychologist and educator of Calcutta.”61 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn61] Hisself-appointed title may stem from the fact that he viewed his meditationtraining and its attendant benefits as at least partly psychological. Therevised and enlarged 1925 edition of The Science of Religion was advertised as a“true psychological account of inner culture, concentration and religion.”62[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn62]Taking inspiration from the developing fields of psychology and personalityprofiling, Yogananda offered his Psychological Chart in 1925 as a tool to“greatly help all individuals, men, women and children … especially … mystudents in America.” He recommended that they “keep a record or at least amental diary of their changing tendencies, marking out their progress in thedevelopment of any good qualities which they may lack and which they are tryingto cultivate.” French psychologists Alfred Binet and Thomas Simon had introduceda standardized intelligence test in 1905 and refined it in 1908 and 1911.Meanwhile, Carl Jung’s Personality Types, which appeared in English in 1923,offered an eightfold typology based on combinations of sensation or intuition,thinking or feeling, and extraversion or introversion.63[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn63] Yogananda claimed that his own test was superior,because “methods like the Binet-Simons Intelligence Test [sic] emphasize theanalysis and development of the human intellect only, leaving the otherfaculties of man’s nature, such as feeling, moral consciousness, and will, outof consideration.”64 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn64] Yogananda’s “very comprehensive”inventory also assumed that personality was dynamic, where his contemporariesviewed individual personality as essentially fixed. His understanding was baseddirectly on the faculty psychology of ancient Saṃkhya, which interpreted humanpersonality as resulting from fluctuating combinations of the three guṇas, orprimordial evolutes. As Yogananda explained: “Sattwa, Raja and Tama are Sanskritwords denoting the three causative principles behind all creation. In humannature, Sattwa manifests as good and noble qualities; Raja produces the active,energetic and worldly qualities; Tama is evil and hateful, obstructing both thelight of Sattwa and the activity of Raja.”65 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn65]After an individual conducted an inventory that detailed general background,health, handwriting, attention, memory, reason, imagination, obedience, and“general nature,” Yogananda offered six overarching personality types—withcorresponding English translations—based on combinations of the three guṇas:Sattwa (Elevating), Sattwa-Raja (Elevating-Activating), Sattwa-Tama(Elevating-Obstructing), Raja (Activating), Rajas-Tama (Activating-Obstructing),and Tama (Obstructing). Each type included a list of qualities that individualscould use to measure themselves or their children. Rather than constituting anintellectual hierarchy or a neutral description of personality types,Yogananda’s taxonomy was largely moral. For example, Sattwa was characterized bylove toward neighbors, animals, and good qualities, while Tama included“attachment to objects of senses,” “hypocritical sympathy,” and people who were“stupid,” “morose,” and “lustful.” But where intelligence and personality werebasically fixed qualities in the better-known systems, Yogananda’s psychologicalchart featured personality profiles that could improve. He counseled readersthat their chart, “if read and studied daily or even weekly, will serve as areminding mirror for detecting and removing your psychological and materialshortcomings. By self-analysis and constant watching of all your actions andmoods, you will gradually learn your true nature and how to express itflawlessly.”66 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn66]Yogananda’s sluggish ministry acquired some vigor with a multicity tourfinancially backed by the Lewises and promoted by Mohammad Rashid, usuallyreferred to as M. Rashid, a “scion of a distinguished Mohammedan family” whomYogananda had met on his voyage to the United States. After joining Yogananda’sstaff, Rashid rented Carnegie Hall, charged a modest but respectable entrancefee, advertised aggressively, and made sure the press showed up to provide morefree publicity.67 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn67] Recounting this event to his friendDasgupta years later, Yogananda confessed that Rashid’s resourcefulnessinitially unnerved him. “Rashid! What have you done?” he asked. “There’s notenough money in the bank account to rent Carnegie Hall!” Then Yoganandareflected, “It seemed that Rashid believed in the efforts to cause a stir tobring people to Yogoda Satsanga even more than I did.” Rashid’s faith provedwell-founded, and the talks drew large crowds and plenty of press.68[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn68]Yogananda did his own part to promote his speaking tour. The novelty of hisdress provided free publicity from the press; the New York Tribune printed alarge photo of Yogananda strolling the streets of Manhattan, with a captionannouncing, “A famous Swami comes to town.” The content of his New York talk,which eschewed overt religious language, also stirred up interest. The “EastIndian mystic”—“wrapped in a salmon-pink robe, draped with sashes, well brushedblack locks cascading over his broad shoulders”—“assured his hearers they neednever grow old.” The article, more cheeky than respectful, informed readers thatYogananda “will establish his fountain of youth at a popular hotel.”69[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn69] But even derisive commentary was free press. Suddenly,a moribund ministry had been jolted to life.Yogananda’s successes in New York, followed by visits to other eastern cities,spurred him to more ambitious plans. He decided to take a cross-countryautomobile tour that would terminate in California. In the late nineteenthcentury, Southern California became, as historian Lawrence Culver terms it, a“frontier of leisure.” While other locations offered temporary escape, SouthernCalifornia promised “leisure as a permanent way of life.”70[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn70] By the early twentieth century, California had become apopular culture synecdoche for adventure and open-mindedness. In Main Street,Sinclair Lewis’s extremely popular 1920 novel about the provincialism of smallmidwestern towns, the narrator informs readers that the most intelligent andresourceful small-town residents “leave them in old age, if they can afford it,and go to live in California or in the cities,” refuges for theforward-thinking. Anthony and Gloria Patch, the glamorous protagonists of F.Scott Fitzgerald’s 1922 novel The Beautiful and Damned, honeymoon in Californiaas well. Yogananda had a similar restlessness to travel to California, thoughfor avowedly nobler reasons. Prompted by “an inner call to further extend thework,” he “saw in his mind’s eye the West of America and especially Los Angeles,swept by his teachings.” On his way to the West Coast, he hoped to find newaudiences and gain additional financial support for his ministry. He also wantedto learn more about his mission field by touring the nation from one end of thecontinent to the other.71 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn71]A cross-country road trip in the 1920s was a significant undertaking, onlybeginning to be eased by a national highway-building boom that was bringing a“slow, uneven, but steady improvement in roads and technology.”72[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn72] The Lewises enabled the five-thousand-mile trip byloaning Yogananda their car. In a letter he sent en route, he referred to “ourcar” as he told its owners back home, I “wish you both saw this wonderfulplace.”73 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn73] He occasionally wrote to them during thejourney, in part to thank them for their generosity. “God has been very kind tome,” he wrote, “so he will be kind to you. Never did you bring so much goodnessout of me as you have done. What spiritual help you want, that is yours.”74[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn74]Yogananda combined lectures and sightseeing as he toured the country. He spokeon concentration to a “cultured audience” of three thousand at DenverAuditorium. “Bedecked in a dazzling orange turban and golden gown,” Yoganandamet the mayor. Coloradans betrayed some ignorance about Indian customs, assumingthat his first name was Swami or that he was a prince. Yogananda contributed tothe confusion by unaccountably claiming that as “the owner of two large schoolsin India” he was in the United States to study its school system.75[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn75]As he explored the United States, Yogananda frequently expressed admiration forthe nation’s landscape. South of Denver, he drove to the fourteen-thousand-footsummit of Pike’s Peak, a journey that inspired one of many rhyming rhapsodies:“Ne’er did I expect to roam, On wheels four, Where thousand clouds do soar.” Buthis poetic praise of American beauty typically spurred a comparison with thelandscape of his beloved India. “Enthralled” by the beauty of Yellowstone’snatural wonders, he was “reminded of our Indian forests.” Later, on board a shipalong the Alaskan coast, he reflected, “If it were possible to hold a beautycontest of all Nature’s grandeurs and scenes of loveliness, it would bedifficult to choose between Alaska and her Hindu sister Kashmere for the Queen’sthrone.”76 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn76] In drawing parallels to the sublimelandscape of his homeland, Yogananda imbued the scenery of his adopted land witha sense of sacredness. Photos from the trip reinforce this link between theUnited States and India, juxtaposing the turban-clad Indian swami withquintessentially American images, such as feeding a black bear from his car inYellowstone. Returning to the continental United States from his Alaska trip, hespoke in Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco with financial and logisticalsupport from local organizers. Finally, he set his sights on Los Angeles.SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA—MODERN AMERICA’S SPIRITUAL FRONTIERWhen Yogananda arrived in Los Angeles in January 1925, he caught a glimpse ofthe nation’s future, a “metropolis in the making” that would offer the mostconducive environment for his message of any place he had experienced throughoutthe nation.77 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn77] Not just a frontier of leisure,California had long been a spiritual frontier for liberal Protestants as well;more recently it had become a haven for various non-Christian traditions,including a few Hindu teachers. Los Angeles grew from a small village of 11,000in 1880 to a metropolis of 1.2 million by 1930 and the nation’s fifth largestcity.78 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn78] In a region where municipal boundaries oftenblur, the county is a more helpful indicator of growth. During the 1920s LosAngeles County added “an average of 350 newcomers a day for ten years.”79[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn79]A vibrant and diversified economy stimulated this urban growth, foreshorteninginto a half-century developments that typically accompany urbanization:geographic expansion through municipal growth and annexation of surroundingcommunities, massive investment in infrastructure, real estate speculation, andthriving centers of finance and industry—including oil, airplanes andautomobiles, film, and tourism. Though its tourism and entertainment economiesdominate popular perceptions of early twentieth-century Los Angeles, the citywas also the nation’s second largest tire manufacturer and the center of oilproduction after “spectacular oil discoveries” in nearby Huntington Beach, LongBeach, and Santa Fe Springs turned the Port of Los Angeles into the secondbusiest port in the world behind New York.80 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn80] The LosAngeles Times, the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, the Los Angeles RealtyBoard, and the Automobile Club of Southern California tirelessly promoted theregion to a national audience.81 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn81] Real estate boomed andtourism flourished: a million and a half visitors came in 1923, and by the endof the decade, tourism accounted for 10 percent of the city’s economy. Thenascent Automobile Club of Southern California promoted road trips as the“vanguard of an era of mass leisure and recreation” and claimed that 125,000cars visited the region in 1926.82 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn82] Decaying Spanishmissions, the U.S. equivalent to ancient Mediterranean ruins, became populartourist destinations for motor enthusiasts.83 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn83] No otherregion embraced automobile culture—and mobility—like Southern California.84[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn84] Los Angeles was a city on the move, and thisrestlessness carried into the spiritual realm.Anglo Protestantism enjoyed unquestioned cultural hegemony in 1925.85[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn85] At the beginning of the century, Los Angeles was one ofthe “most homogeneous cities West of the Mississippi,” whose white midwesterntransplants had introduced a “staunch mainline Protestantism” that fashioned apious, abstemious culture.86 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn86] Protestant ministers spokeat all high school commencements, while Protestant lay people dominated thelocal press, city government, school boards, and community organizations,including the YMCA, Woman’s Club, and Chamber of Commerce.87[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn87] The scathing evaluation of former resident WillardHuntington Wright reflected the views of many critics: “These good folks broughtwith them a complete stock of rural beliefs, pieties, superstitions and habits”that explained the “Quakerish regulation of public dance halls” and the “stupidcensorship of the theaters.”88 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn88]Despite Protestant hegemony, migration was beginning to change the city’sreligious profile. “Religiously, something distinct from the rest of the nationwas happening in the City of Angels in the first decades” of the twentiethcentury, says Michael J. Engh. “During the 1920s in particular, the multiplicityof faiths and the variety of forms of worship aggravated the apprehension ofmany outside observers and the skepticism of many residents.”89[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn89] By 1941, the Works Progress Administration city guideto Los Angeles could comment, only a bit hyperbolically, that the “multiplicityand diversity of faiths that flourish in the aptly named City of the Angelsprobably cannot be duplicated in any other city on earth.” The section onreligion concluded with an attempt to keep marginal sects from tarring thecity’s reputation. “In Los Angeles today,” mainstream religious organizations,“together with the less eccentric unorthodox groups, form a dignified backgroundagainst which the fantastic stands out in garish high lights.”90[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn90] Catholicism grew in part from Mexican immigration intothe state following the Mexican Revolution of 1910–11. While some were convertsto evangelicalism as a result of American missionary work in Mexico, themajority remained faithful to Rome.By the 1920s, the Great Migration of black southerners had expanded beyondnorthern industrial cities like New York, Chicago, and Detroit to western citieslike Los Angeles. African American visitors described Southern California as anew Eden, convincing many southern blacks that the region was a haven from theSouth’s violence and discrimination.91 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn91] These mythicevocations overstated the case, as opportunity and prejudice expanded side byside. Still, the city afforded its black residents space to create a publicsphere.92 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn92] The black community quickly realized thelimits of toleration when Hollywood’s first blockbuster film, D. W. Griffith’sBirth of a Nation, celebrating masculine white Protestant resistance to blackrights, was screened in 1915. The film helped relaunch the Ku Klux Klan, thistime as a national organization devoted as much to nativism as to antiblackracism. Los Angeles’s fledging National Association for the Advancement ofColored People chapter was one of the first organizations to protest the filmnationwide.93 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn93]Innovative movements flourished in this dynamic global metropolis as well. NewProtestant sects with biblicist theologies established deep roots in theSouthland. These movements’ conservative theological beliefs should not obscuretheir spirit of innovation. Los Angeles was one key center of the nationalfundamentalist movement, and the region’s leaders “were obsessed withmodernism,” using “every available modern means—magazines and radio,especially—to voice their response to the transforming metropolis.”94[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn94] The early Bible Institute of Los Angeles was aquintessentially L.A. institution. Begun in 1909 with funding from Unocalfounder Lyman Stewart, the Bible Institute became a key fundamentalistinstitution nationwide. Bible institutes served as new educational institutions,unaccredited alternatives to theological seminaries and liberal artscolleges—and upstart challenges to them.95 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn95]Pentecostalism, currently the fastest-growing religious tradition worldwide, hadcrucial Los Angeles roots. The Azusa Street Revival, often celebrated as thebirth of Pentecostalism, broke out in 1906 with an interracial group of HolinessWesleyans who experienced the supernatural gift of speaking in tongues.96[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn96] On January 1, 1923, Aimee Semple McPherson, a Canadianconvert to Pentecostalism, officially opened the doors of Angelus Temple in EchoPark, the headquarters of her nascent Foursquare Church, eventually aninternational denomination. Though she upheld a literal interpretation of theBible, McPherson was an innovator in both theology and presentation. Sheproclaimed a brand of Christianity that integrated the physical, emotional, andspiritual. A dramatic performer who used radio effectively, she had many friendsin journalism and Hollywood. Even as she criticized modernism in religion, herown ministry was indisputably a modern product. Ministers and evangelists fromestablished denominations certainly recognized the innovative qualities of hertheology, as their frequent criticisms reveal.97 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn97]More importantly for Yogananda’s ministry, the region also drew spiritualseekers from metaphysical movements outside the Christian mainstream,disproportionate to their size in most of the rest of the country. The absolutenumbers of Christian Scientists and Theosophists remained small, though theirpresence fostered a sense of openness that provided a gateway to Yogananda’steaching on yoga and Hinduism.98 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn98]Christian Science founder Mary Baker Eddy, who came from pious New EnglandCongregational stock, sought a harmony between science and religion, mind andspirit—a message broadly congruent with Yogananda’s. Christian Science speakersin Los Angeles earnestly promoted their movement’s Christian identity inresponse to criticisms of heresy and dissociated themselves from suspectpractices like mesmerism, hypnotism, and mind cure. Church apologists explainedthat Eddy’s teachings aimed to restore primitive Christianity and closelyfollowed the teachings of Jesus, who conquered sin, banished evil, and healedthe sick.99 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn99] Despite its claims to biblical fidelity,core Christian Science tenets were at odds with traditional Christian cosmologyand ontology. Christian Scientists viewed God as the only reality and God’sfundamental identity as Mind. Humans were a product of God’s thought and thustruly themselves only in exercising thought. Matter was illusory, which meantthat evil—including sin and especially sickness—did not really exist and thatsensory perception was delusive. Salvation came from coming to understand thetruth and being liberated from the shackles of the body. Though many of thesetenets align with Advaita Vedānta, the similarities were likely coincidental,since Eddy knew little about South Asian spiritual traditions or their texts.Eddy generally distanced herself from Hinduism and Buddhism, emphaticallyrejected Theosophy, and insisted on her movement’s Christian identity.100[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn100]For a small new sect, Christian Science enjoyed a robust presence in earlytwentieth-century Los Angeles, receiving frequent and generally positivecoverage in the press. Speakers from around the country, certified through theMother Church’s Board of Lectureship, routinely filled public spaces like thePhilharmonic Auditorium. Reaching out to audiences using evangelical-stylerhetoric, they pointed out the elusiveness of the quest for liberty, comfort,contentment, and peace. They then explained how Christian Science could meettheir audience’s deepest needs.101 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn101] Despite theseefforts to connect with audiences, their outreach was not particularly engaging,and their talks never moved beyond rehearsing staple doctrines. Though Yoganandatook pains to highlight the differences between his movement and ChristianScience, some seekers were undoubtedly drawn to him by the similarities betweenthe two.Theosophy also had a minor but important presence in Southern California, andlike Christian Science it could function as a gateway to Yogoda. But unlike bothYogoda and Christian Science, Theosophy was overtly hostile to Christianity,which considerably limited its mainstream appeal. In 1875, two elites, HenrySteel Olcott, attorney, Civil War veteran, and member of New York’s“metropolitan gentry,” and Russian émigré aristocrat Helena Blavatsky met andformed an esoteric movement that aimed to reform popular spiritualism.102[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn102] Its most important early work, Isis Revealed, revealedthe rediscovery of an ancient tradition rooted in Egypt. One could contactancient Masters and access their power for one’s own growth and healing. Withina few years, Olcott and Blavatsky had explicitly embraced Indian ideas,including reincarnation, though they drew more from Buddhism than Hinduism.103[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn103] In 1880, they relocated to India.A split in the movement left Katherine Tingley, a Massachusetts woman of oldCongregational stock, head of the American branch. She eventually relocated thenational headquarters to Point Loma, a San Diego bluff overlooking the PacificOcean. “Lomaland” became a utopian community that experimented with equal genderroles and communal childrearing.104 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn104] It also created aRaja Yoga boarding school that occasionally came under suspicion for allegedlymistreating children.105 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn105] Los Angeles benefited fromthe proximity of the national headquarters, with Tingley herself regularlyproviding talks. But turning such a religion into a popular movement forevangelistic purposes was no easy matter. Even more than Christian Science,Theosophy earned criticism from Christian ministers. One Presbyterian ministerin L.A., for example, Dr. Herbert Booth Smith of Immanuel Presbyterian,complained that while the movement claimed to embrace universal truth, itactually showed “strong preferences for Hindu belief” while showing “scantappreciation for Christianity.” The result was to “make Jesus a debtor toEastern wisdom.”106 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn106]Tingley and others tried to strike a balance between highlighting the uniquenessof Theosophy’s arcane tenets and their compatibility with the mass culture ofthe 1920s. Leaders rooted the movement’s authority in the ancient past.“Theosophy is not modern,” Tingley claimed, “it is a restatement of the ancientwisdom—that religion adapted to recent conditions. It is as old as the ages, andif one will study it he will find that it was lived and practiced verybeautifully and altruistically centuries before time of Jesus.”107[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn107] Tingley’s assertions notwithstanding, Theosophy wasfundamentally a modern project of self-liberation, a syncretic product of aglobalized world. Though Theosophy drew more from Buddhism than Hinduism, peoplein the market for Eastern spirituality could easily have been drawn to bothTheosophy and Yogoda. And some undoubtedly preferred the authority of anIndian-born teacher to the eclecticism of Theosophy.Two other communities with spiritual connections flourished in SouthernCalifornia in this period; both contributed to making the region hospitable toYogananda. First, from the late nineteenth century, Southern California’sclimate lured health seekers, who often linked spirituality and physicalwell-being.108 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn108] Though the first wave peaked by 1900, asecond wave was cresting at the time Yogananda settled in the region.109[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn109] The quest for health often produced unorthodox medicalapproaches that gave Los Angeles a bad reputation. Writer Louis Adamic found “noend of chiropractors, osteopaths, ‘drugless physicians,’ faith healers, healthlecturers, manufacturers and salesmen of all sorts of health ‘stabilizers’ and‘normalizers,’ psychoanalysts, phynotists, mesmerists, the flow-of-life mystics,astro-therapeutists, miracle men and women.” With more technical expertise, theJournal of the American Medical Association’s editor claimed that the city wasknown “throughout the medical world as one of the richest stomping grounds inthe country for medical quackery and ‘cultism.’”110 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn110]Yogananda would capitalize on this interest in the spirituality of health,presenting a coherent interpretation of the relation between physical, mental,and spiritual well-being.Second, utopian communities began to flourish in Southern California’s openspaces and mild climate in the late nineteenth century. As historian Donald E.Pitzer concludes, “The focus of much of America’s communal utopianexperimentation shifted” to the West Coast, “where all manner of religious andsocial causes found a sympathetic hearing” around the turn of the century.111[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn111] These communities were by no means all religious, but“perfectionism lay at the heart of California utopianism,” according tohistorian Robert Hine. This spiritual ethos encouraged members to agree thathumans “can achieve in this life not only freedom from sin, but the highest ofthe virtues, truth, beauty, goodness. And society itself, like man, can beperfectly remolded. In this sense, utopians were also millenarians looking forthe coming of the ideal commonwealth and eternal happiness on this earth.”112[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn112] Elements of Yogananda’s teaching, including theidealized harmonious community he envisioned, resonated with these utopiantraditions.There was something in the soil—or maybe the air—of Southern California. Fromthe Gold Rush era, the opportunities and hazards of America’s furthest westernfrontier drew adventurers and nonconformists of all types. By the latenineteenth century, attention was beginning to shift from the San Francisco Bayarea to Southern California. The region’s real estate booms may not have beengold rushes, but they drew some of the same types of risk-takers.113[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn113] Where social geographers argue that high urban densityintensifies the sense of intrusion felt by long-term residents, forcing them toconfront difference—including religious difference—the opposite dynamic was atwork in Southern California.114 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn114] The lack of a singlepopulation center and the geographic openness of the Los Angeles Basin, hundredsof square miles in area, allowed diversity to flourish in spite of Protestantinstitutional hegemony. Groups had space to invent their own eclectictraditions, as open space fostered a live-and-let-live ethos.115[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn115] The landscape lured many who found the divine innature and converted many who came for other reasons. Sublime encounters withblue skies, golden sunlight, and the vast Pacific inspired evocations of Eden orthe exotic Orient at the ocean’s far shore: “California is a gilded state,”proclaimed poet Vachel Lindsay. “The gold of California is the color of theorange, the glitter of dawn in the Yosemite, the hue of the golden gate thatopens the sunset way to mystic and terrible Cathay and Hindustan.”116[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn116]Yogananda would not be the first to make explicit the attractions of landscapeand climate in supporting a spiritual quest. “In order to make our philosophy oflife and health of practical value in the world,” the founders of theRosicrucian Fellowship bought forty acres in Oceanside, about ninety miles southof Los Angeles, on “one of the sightliest spots in sunny Southern California.”Mount Ecclesia, as they named the headquarters, offered “an unobstructed view ofthe beautiful blue Pacific Ocean. Directly west lies the island of San Clemente,75 miles out, and ships are often silhouetted upon the skyline as they sail by.”Looking eastward, “we may behold a landscape equally glorious, varied, andwide”: “Immediately below Mount Ecclesia lies the smiling San Luis Rey valleywith its fertile green fields and its historic old mission; a little furtheraway are the rounded foothills with their wonderful play of light and shade,then the mountains with their rugged contours, and farthest to the east we see …snowcapped peaks.” Continuing with its boosterist tone, the fellowship toutedSouthern California’s climate, “as wonderful as the view, and asincomprehensible to all who have not lived here. One may wear a white shirtwaistoutdoors on every day in the winter,” and “we do not perspire on the warmest dayin summer on account of the sea breeze,” which fills “our lungs withinvigorating ozone fresh from the heaving bosom of the great Pacific Ocean.”This salubrious climate was a remedy for physical as well as spiritualwell-being, “a veritable elixir of Life” that “offers such rare physicalconditions for the attainment of health that it is probably without a peer.”117[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn117]For various reasons then, Southern California provided soil for new religiousmovements by the early twentieth century. One journalist called the region “themost celebrated incubator of new creeds, codes of ethics, philosophies and nearphilosophies and schools of thought, occult, new and old.”118[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn118] Los Angeles–area residents observed the bewilderingdiversity of the region’s spiritual landscape with a mixture of anxiety,bemusement, and an odd sense of local pride. A columnist proclaimed in 1900,“Los Angeles is the headquarters for scientific, socialistic, humanitarian,occult and other societies dealing with matters—or rather with ideas—that aremore or less beyond the ken of the average every-day mortal,” including“Harmonial Spiritualists, the Universal Brotherhood, the Cooperative SpiritualWorkers, the Theosophists, a School of Metaphysics, a school of‘sciento-philosophy and psycho-pneumic culture’ (God save us!) and a ‘home oftruth.’”119 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn119] In 1908, an editorial described the city’sethnoreligious diversity, where the “Swiss man and maid in costume … jostle theturbaned, swart Hindu from Calcutta or Benares. … The Brahmin from Bombay talksto the sun-worshiping Parsee from Teheran.” He encouraged readers to welcome allnewcomers and avoid the inconveniences of travel. “We can have the world in anutshell, so to speak, in this cosmopolitan city.”120 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn120]Paging through the weekend paper, Aldous Huxley witnessed the remarkablediversity of the city’s spiritual marketplace, where “a whole page was filledwith the announcements of rival religious sects, advertising the spiritual waresthat they would give away, or sell on the Sabbath.”121 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn121]More than a decade later, Huxley would be drawn deeply into the Vedāntamovement. Willard Huntington Wright noted the city’s taste for “spiritualists,mediums, astrologists, phrenologists, palmists and all other breeds of esotericwindjammers.”122 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn122] This journalistic trend reached itsapogee in the 1940s with Carey McWilliams’s assessment of L.A. as home to “theworld’s prize collection of cranks, semi-cranks, placid creatures whose bovineexpression shows that each of them is studying, without much hope of success, tobe a high-grade moron, angry or ecstatic exponents of food fads, sun-bathing,ancient Greek costumes, diaphragm breathing and the imminent second coming ofChrist.”123 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn123]Early twentieth-century Southern California epitomized the spiritual optionsavailable in the modern world. If Boston had historically served the nation’sspiritual anchor, a point the organizers of the International Congress of FreeChristians and Other Religious Liberals tried to remind delegates with a visitto Plymouth Rock, the city no longer played that role. By the early twentiethcentury, the focus of spiritual energy had shifted to Southern California, thenation’s “spiritual frontier.”124 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn124] Yogananda could nothave found a better place to call home.YOGANANDA, ORIENTALISM, AND HINDU SPIRITUAL LEADERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAObservers of the religious landscape of Los Angeles often gestured to thepresence of Indians and Hindus, which they viewed interchangeably as a keyindicator of the region’s spiritual diversity.125 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn125] As“America now looked at India through British eyes,”126 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn126]white Angelenos’ views of “Hindoos” mirrored British concerns about infanticide,child marriage, and widow suicide and the need to evangelize India to usher incivilizational—not just religious—transformation. Though the few Indians in theUnited States rarely registered on the national nativist radar, whites inSouthern California expressed occasional anxiety about a heathen Hindu invasion.In stoking their own racialized fears, whites drew on the region’s robustnativist tradition. Nativism included a history of ethnic violence againstMexicans and Chinese. In the 1920s, the region hosted a vibrant Ku Klux Klan,which focused on immigration restriction and often received strong support fromconservative Protestant churches.127 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn127] A mutation ofnineteenth-century Western fears of a yellow menace, white panic about Indianswas an amalgam of racial, cultural, and religious elements. In the earlytwentieth century, Los Angeles residents became concerned that Indians inVancouver might begin migrating to the city, particularly after a white mob’sattack on Indians in Bellingham, Washington, in 1907 prompted many Indians toleave the state.128 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn128]Anticipation of Indian immigrants proved more terrifying than their actualarrival. When the “first of their race to be employed so near here” began workon the Los Angeles–Pacific trolley in 1908, the event was greeted withremarkable equanimity. “They are a picturesque lot in their turbans,” adistinctive form of dress responsible for much of the hostility they faced.Because local law “protects all who behave themselves whatever their race,”these hardworking laborers who are content with low wages “may be but theadvance guard of many who will come this way when they find that there they willbe given a chance to labor peacefully without molestation.”129[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn129]Still, many whites assumed a link between racial and civic identities, and theydoubted that Indians could make good citizens. The Reverend Dana Bartlett, aCongregationalist minister who operated a settlement house in Los Angeles,warned local citizens that ten thousand Hindus—a great exaggeration of theactual total, which probably numbered a few hundred—were already in the city,and “this army is constantly being augmented.” Bartlett contended that Indianswere even more problematic than Mexicans, Chinese, and Japanese, who had allfailed to assimilate.130 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn130] Indians insisted onmaintaining caste and traditional food customs, refusing to “develop into goodcitizens.”131 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn131] Other critics thought Indians’unwillingness to doff their turbans in a courtroom symbolized their broaderinability to assimilate. This issue popped up intermittently for a decade, whenIndians finally won the right to wear their turbans in court, to the dismay ofmany white citizens. Ironically, the turban-wearing Indians were almostcertainly Sikhs, a religious tradition that began in northern India in the latefifteenth century and is often considered distinct from Hinduism, though thisdistinction was clearly lost on white observers.132 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn132]The civic critique of Indians intensified during the Great War, as Indiansagitating for home rule made their headquarters on the Pacific coast.Conservative middle-class Americans trained to fear political radicalism werehorrified by the self-rule movement in India, especially when armed rebellionbroke out.133 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn133]The landmark 1923 Supreme Court case United States v. Bhagat Singh Thindepitomized the intersection of racial identity, citizenship, and religion thatHindu teachers in Los Angeles and elsewhere were forced to combat. Thind, anAmerican World War I veteran, was denied the right to naturalize by theImmigration and Naturalization Service. The Immigration Act of 1917, the firstof several nativist federal immigration laws, broke with previous legislation byrestricting rather than regulating immigration. Among other provisions, itcreated an Asiatic Barred Zone, preventing immigration from most of that region.Immigration officials asserted that immigrants from the restricted zone whoarrived prior to the law’s enactment were disqualified from naturalizing.Because the Naturalization Act extended naturalization rights to “free whitepersons,” Thind based his right to citizenship on his identity as an Aryan andthus a white man. Thind’s argument reflected the prevalent theory that northernIndians descended from Caucasus migrants in the ancient period, based on thelinguistic scholarship of prominent Orientalist scholars William Jones and MaxMueller. The U.S. District Court ruled that Thind qualified for citizenship as awhite man, based on the majority of lower court rulings that Indians were white.The Supreme Court itself had recently affirmed two lower court rulings thathigh-caste whites were eligible for naturalization, only to reverse course threemonths later and overrule the lower court rulings.134 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn134]In appealing the district court’s ruling, the federal government argued that avast cultural and civilizational chasm separated Indians and whites—irrespectiveof racial origins—and cited Rudyard Kipling’s “White Man’s Burden” to buttressthis claim. Persuaded by such compelling scholarly evidence, a unanimous SupremeCourt dismissed Thind’s claim in favor of a definition of whiteness understoodby the average American on the street. As some critics immediately pointed out,there was evidence that during the era of both the original naturalization lawand its 1875 revision, popular American texts included Indians as part of thewhite population.135 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn135] In response to news of the case,Yogananda urged his followers to support a bill by New York senator Royal S.Copeland that would define Indians as whites eligible for naturalization. Heprodded “truth-loving, Christian Americans” to recognize that “their high andsacred duty is to uphold the beautiful standards of Christianity, whose Foundersaid, ‘All ye are brethren’ (Matthew 23:8). If Christianity is to remain a vitaland redeeming faith in the world, it must inspire its followers with courage tomaintain its principles. Mental sloth is spiritual stagnation. We must fight forthe right, and be willing to actively bestir ourselves in a spiritual causeagainst injustice.”136 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn136]The Thind ruling, a disaster for the region’s Indians, caused elation amongwhite Angelenos. The Times thought that the Court had displayed “considerableenlightenment” in reinforcing the boundary of white identity against Thind’scunning legal argument. The author expressed approval of the Court’s argumentthat recent congressional legislation barring admission to “all natives of Asia… including the whole of India, constituted conclusive evidence … of the‘Congressional attitude of opposition to Asiatic immigration generally.’”137[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn137] Apart from jurisprudential considerations, Singh’sagitation on behalf of Indian self-rule played a role in the Court’s finaldecision. As a founding member of the Ghadr Party, a radical nationalist groupthat advocated violence in the pursuit of self-rule for India (and instigatedthe violent 1916 uprising against British troops in India), Singh was ineligiblefor citizenship, U.S. government officials argued.138 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn138]While whites celebrated, California attorneys sued unsuccessfully to allow theirIndian clients to retain citizenship papers granted by state officials beforeThind. And because California’s 1913 Alien Land Law—which primarily targetedJapanese immigrants—prevented noncitizens from owning land or negotiatinglong-term leases, Indians’ landholding claims were annulled.139[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn139] Reaction to the Thind decision highlighted whitestereotypes about Indians. Critics often insinuated that Hindus displayed ageneral disposition toward crime, violence, and immorality. Many lumped togethervarious activities like hypnotism, superstition, astrology, and palm reading,often popularly linked to crimes of passion and sexual degeneracy.140[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn140] State and municipal government officials took thethreat of psychics and palm readers seriously enough to launch a major campaignin late 1924, aiming to “seriously cripple, if not eliminate, purported psychicand pseudospiritualist activities on the Pacific Coast.”141[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn141] Press coverage of a famous 1905 case highlighted thisamalgamation of racial, cultural, and religious perceptions. A “Hindu fakepalmist” named F. Rubel shot a white competitor during an altercation. On trial,“whatever powers of occultism” he possessed, “he utterly failed to hypnotize thejury,” which found the “long-haired Hindu with sensuous eyes” guilty of assaultwith a deadly weapon. In announcing his sentence Judge Smith betrayed his ownprejudices, commenting that the altercation had resulted from competitionbetween a Yankee faker and the defendant “with the flowing locks and robe, andwith the melodious voice.”142 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn142]Whites’ denunciations of Indian belief and practice often revealed their ownignorance. William T. Ellis thought Hinduism “foolish and futile” in teachingthat a practitioner could “sit and look at the end of one’s nose and think ofnothing” as a method for “escaping from sin and entering into bliss.”143[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn143] Another observer, adopting a more tongue-in-cheektone, described an open-air meditation meeting led by Swami Touryanda where thewhite devotees made clear that “the attempt to sit cross-legged, with handsclasped, spine on a perpendicular line, and eyes inclined toward the nose, is anaccomplishment not yet within the grasp of the western barbarism [sic].” Theymade a great effort “to pay no attention to things ordinarily called dangerous,such as chill winds, poison oak, and things that crawl.” During meditation, theswami occasionally “uttered a long, weird chant in Sans Krit, entirelyunintelligible.” Despite the lighter tone, the author still concluded that the“entire trend of the teaching is diametrically opposed to the Christianphilosophy of thought—no sin, no hell, no devil, but bliss absolute within thegrasp of all.”144 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn144]On their own, Indian practices might simply remain misguided heathen efforts toachieve salvation. But the greater concern was that Indian religious teachingswere spreading beyond their own communities and into the living rooms ofgullible white women. Los Angeles swami Baba Bharati, discussed below, became anational symbol of these fears through Mabel Potter Daggett’s “HeathenInvasion,” which placed photos of swamis alongside images of American women inVictorian dress, suggesting the inappropriate domestic intimacy that yogatraining fostered, where “dusky-hued Orientals sat on drawing-room sofas, thecenter of admiring attention, while fair hands passed them cakes and served themtea in Sevres china.” Viewing religious allegiance in military terms, Daggettwarned that while churches were busy sending out missionaries, the “pagans haveexecuted an amazing flank movement; they have sent their emissaries to us.”145[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn145] Though yoga ostensibly meant the path that leads towisdom, “it is proving the way that leads to domestic infelicity and insanityand death.” She excoriated the shallowness of women and the showmanship of guruswho come “silken clad and sandal shod” with their “gorgeous robes,” outcompetingplainly dressed American ministers. Yoga’s “promise of eternal youth” assuresAmerican women “health and long life and the power to stay the ravages oftime.”146 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn146] These xenophobic warnings were not confinedto the pages of middle-brow magazines. Elizabeth Reed, a reputable scholar ofHinduism and Buddhism and member of the Royal Asiatic Society, offered a moreacademic version of this argument. She warned about the dangers of modernmoneymaking gurus, who hypnotized hapless women and exploited them sexually.147[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn147] Popular religious survey texts assumed that the Hinduworldview was intrinsically problematic or associated Hinduism with the growthof cults.148 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn148]The occasional if malicious critiques of Indians and their spirituality do nottell the full story, however. American Orientalist tropes—like their Englishcounterparts—provided an alternative view of Hinduism. Though undeniablypatronizing, Orientalist discourse did reflect an open, affirming attitudetoward “Hindus” and “Hinduism.” As a result, Hindu became a polyvalent referenceto people and culture, sharing positive connotations related to fashion andculture, as well as negative connotations associated with dubious spiritualpractices. Americans tended to collapse high-caste Indian people, their culture,and their fashion items into a single exotic subcontinent of luxuriousprincedoms. When members of a “Hindu royal family” from Bombay visited LosAngeles, the wife “created quite a sensation.” Reflecting the vague geographythat amalgamated North Africa and Southwest Asia into a single “Orient,” thearticle explained, “She is traveling in the native Hindu sari, which resemblesthe gowns worn by Egyptians and residents of Palestine. … Another feature of herdress that attracted considerable attention … was that she wore a large diamondset on her right nostril.”149 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn149] Oriental cultureinspired fashions that prompted one author to proclaim that Kipling needed torecant his assertion that East and West would never meet. “The orient, alluring,beautiful and with a mysterious charm, contributes a fashion.”150[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn150] In addition to the turban as a women’s fashionaccessory, desirable fabrics included dresses in “Hindu crepe” and autumn frocksin “Hindoo brown.”151 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn151]The visual appeal of Indian dress carried over to the arts, which were likewisecaptivated by an exotic and undifferentiated Orient that represented fantasiesof lush scenery and erotic titillation.152 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn152] Los Angelesresidents encountered depictions of Indians through drama, dance, and poetry.The Hindu, an extremely popular Broadway play starring Maud Allan, showcased onerendering of Hindu culture.153 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn153] Ruth St. Denis, who hada background in Theosophy and Christian Science, founded the Los AngelesDenishawn School in 1915, providing interpretations of Eastern dance. The “KamaDance,” inspired by Laurence Hope’s poems of the Orient, ultimately derived froman Indian legend.154 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn154] Romantic poems and florid prosepieces by Calcutta-raised film director Surendra Guha were occasionallyreprinted in the newspaper as well.155 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn155] The famousBengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, gushingly branded the “Shakespeare of India”by affectionate Angelenos, drew large audiences during visits in 1916 and 1923.For one Angeleno, the opportunity to meet India’s famous poet was just one ofthe “many glories of California,” which included ethnic diversity, naturalscenery, and the film industry.156 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn156]Film provided a particularly attractive medium for depictions of Orientalistfantasy. Especially in the era before sound, film relied on spectacle, making anidealized India the perfect subject. Though negative stereotypes of lower-casteIndians occasionally appeared, they were overshadowed by admiring portraits ofwealthy elites.157 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn157] Sid Grauman staged an elaborateproduction called City of Dreams—which included nautch girls (royal courtesandancers) and a Hindu conjurer—as an introduction to screenings of The Thief ofBaghdad at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood.158 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn158] Filmslike 1922’s The Young Rajah invited audiences to sympathize with theprotagonist, silent screen heartthrob Rudolph Valentino, a likable characterraised in the American South who discovers that he is really an Indian princerobbed of his kingdom. The Young Rajah’s director, Phil Rosen, became“thoroughly familiar with Hindu lore” through making the film and decided toincorporate a “Rajah Dance” into the annual Hollywood directors’ ball the yearafter the film premiered.159 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn159]The region’s widespread interest in health and nontraditional medicine alsocreated some respect for Indian traditions. Los Angeles doctor Philip Lovellbecame a sort of 1920s public intellectual for health issues with his regularLos Angeles Times column, “Care of the Body.”160 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn160]Lovell was a naturopath deeply interested in all dimensions ofwell-being—environment, diet, mind, and exercise—and a cosmopolitan with atleast limited knowledge of many foreign traditions. His column frequently notedbeliefs held by “Hindoos,” including the importance of breath control and anAyurvedic diet. His tone could be patronizing, but his openness to Indiantraditions contributed a sense of tolerance to public discourse aboutIndians.161 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn161] Similarly, Barclay L. Severns ran a weeklycolumn beginning in November 1922 related to health and fitness thatparticularly emphasized diet, exercise, posture, and breathing. He showcased anexample of an Indian whose mental control contributed to his overall health:“Ram Murth Naider lives in India. He has proven his almost superhuman strengthbefore huge Hindu and European audiences.” Though short and stocky, “he can swimfor two hours continuously and run twelve miles at a stretch.” Incrediblystrong, Naider broke heavy iron chains placed around his shoulders in a test ofstrength. “Naider’s control of breath and power of concentration helped him tolocalize his energies in that part of his body where they are most needed.”162[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn162] Other cosmopolitan whites found Indians and theirculture intriguing. Like Severns and Lovell, these individuals largely hailedfrom middle-class educated backgrounds.Part of Angelenos’ interest stemmed from the fact that as residents of a diversemetropolis, they had the opportunity to encounter Hindus in person. As early as1901, one observer noted, “Hinduism has a no [sic] considerable following in LosAngeles.”163 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn163] Swami Vivekananda was one of the firstHindu teachers to gain notoriety in the city, though it proved fleeting. Touringwidely after the World’s Parliament of Religions, Vivekananda took “this countryby storm,” and his six-week visit to Los Angeles in 1900 during a second U.S.visit made a splash there.164 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn164] But local enthusiasmsoon waned, and his death two years later merited only a terse obituary in theLos Angeles Times.165 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn165] Nationwide, Vedanta groupsstruggled to survive for several decades after Vivekananda’s death. There wereonly four organized Vedanta centers in the early 1920s—in New York, Boston, SanFrancisco, and Los Angeles—claiming a total of roughly two hundred membersaltogether.166 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn166] In the decade before Yogananda’sarrival in the United States, two teachers, Swami Abhedananda and SwamiParamananda, attempted to reinvigorate the Vedanta movement. Both were Bengalisand direct disciples of Swami Ramakrishna and Vivekananda. Abhedanandaoriginally came to New York in 1897. Tensions grew as Paramananda, Abhedananda’smore charismatic young assistant, became a more popular speaker. In 1910, aftera number of difficulties with the New York leadership, Abhedananda was suspendedfrom the organization and began touring the country independently beforedeparting the United States for good in 1921.167 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn167]Abhedananda spoke regularly in Los Angeles between 1917 and 1921. He addressedvarious topics aimed at modern Western audiences: “The Secret of Success,”“Evolution and Religion,” “How to Gain Self-Mastery,” “What Is Perfection?” and“The Spiritual Needs of Today.”168 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn168] He also wrote aslew of publications emphasizing meditation and self-discovery. “Man’s greatestachievement,” Abhedananda explained, is to understand the mysteries of his ownbeing to know himself. No sage, whether a Buddha or a Christ, no saint, whetherof the past or of the present, has ever found peace without practisingmeditation.” Like Yogananda he embraced inclusivism, using Western language andquoting the Bible in the service of Hindu ideas. He incorporated frequentreferences to Jesus Christ and explicated the way Christianity was based onJesus’s recognition of his “divine nature,” that is his “God-consciousness.” Byattaining the “state of God-consciousness … the soul has now become a Christ, ora Buddha. Both these words signify the highest spiritual state ofGod-consciousness and not any particular person.”169 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn169]Abhedananda also defended Hindu ontology against its Christian counterpart. Hechallenged the common assumption that reincarnation was a purely Eastern tenet,adducing support from Greek, Muslim, and Jewish mystical traditions, as well asthe New Testament. “John the Baptist was according to the Jews a second Elijah;Jesus was believed by many to be the re-appearance of some other prophet.”170[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn170] He contended that this ancient belief held obviousappeal in the modern age of Darwin: “Vedanta accepts evolution and admits thelaws of variation and natural selection, but goes a step beyond modern scienceby explaining the cause of that ‘tendency to vary.’ It says, ‘there is nothingin the end which was not also in the beginning.’”171 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn171]Contrasting the scientific evidence for reincarnation with the “mythical” natureof Christian belief in resurrection, he traced the historical development ofresurrection belief, which, unlike reincarnation, must be a human invention. Heconcluded that resurrection could not be believed today because “modern sciencedenies miracles.”172 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn172]He also expressed passionate cultural nationalism. His polemical account ofIndia’s ancient and noble history provided a defense against common Westernmisunderstandings. He explained that India’s religion was not polytheistic andthat the modern caste system was a corruption of an original flexible systembased on aptitudes. He showed how, since the ancient period, the West hadcontinually benefited from Indian wisdom. Ancient Western authors respectedIndian math, science, and medicine. John the Baptist and Jesus had been trainedby Buddhist missionaries from India. More recent philosophers like ArthurSchopenhauer and Transcendentalist authors Emerson and Thoreau had also receivedinspiration from India.173 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn173] Then he turned hisattention to influences that flowed the other direction during the modern periodof Western dominance: “European civilization … has left moral and spiritualstandards in the background, and made material prosperity and intellectualculture the chief factors of civilization.”174 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn174] Crassmaterialism for spiritual enlightenment was hardly an equal exchange.In 1916, Swami Paramananda opened a Vedanta Center in Los Angeles, joining hisformer colleague and now rival in the city.175 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn175]Angelenos were struck by his “jet black hair and eyes,” “rich brown” skin,”“mellow and resonant” voice, and “irreproachable” command of English.176[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn176] His teaching was virtually indistinguishable fromAbhedananda’s—he sounded the same themes of personal growth, scientificmeditation, and Vedanta philosophy—and he enjoyed greater popularity as a resultof his charismatic personality.177 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn177] But his plan tobuild a retreat center for the national Vedanta movement in the warm SantaClarita hills, rather than frigid Boston, stoked fears that “a full-fledgedcolony of devotees” would be established just a few miles from the city.178[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn178]Paramananda’s devotees included a number of women who fit a remarkably similarpattern, one not unlike Yogananda’s disciples. They were typically well off,from prominent families in major cities like Boston, well educated, and oftensingle. Many had some background in Theosophy, New Thought, or othernonmainstream religious traditions. Katherine Sherwood descended from theSaltonstalls, a first family of Boston. Growing up Unitarian, she had driftedtoward Christian Science before exploring a number of other philosophies. ElizaKissim, a member of an old New York Dutch family, became Sister Saya Prana. Theunmarried Mary Lacy Staib, later Sister Shanta, grew up in an aristocraticsouthern family and had attended New Thought lectures. May Gladwell, raised aMormon, became a psychic before she heard Paramananda in Los Angeles andeventually became Sister Seva. Georgina Jones Walton, daughter of a U.S. senatorand millionaire miner father and a cosmopolitan mother reared in France, marrieda Theosophist and moved to Krotona, the Theosophy commune in Los Angeles. Sheeventually became Paramananda’s disciple, Sister Daya.179[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn179] Vassar graduate Laura Franklin Glenn took vows tobecame Sister Devamata, Paramananda’s first female devotee. Remarkably, she cameto view herself as her guru’s partner and equal. She became a prominent Vedantaspeaker in her own right and produced several books and booklets, including Daysin an Indian Monastery, an account of her experiences in India; Sri Ramakrishnaand His Disciples; Building of Character; What Is Death?; Health and Healing;Practice of Devotion; Development of the Will; and Sleep andSuper-Consciousness.180 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn180]Though Paramananda possessed the charisma that Abhedananda evidently lacked, aswell as an ability to make Vedanta philosophy intelligible to an Americanaudience, his movement ultimately failed to take deep root in Los Angeles oranywhere else. Like traditional gurus, he preferred a small group of devoteddisciples to large public presentations. As a strong critic of a materialisticsociety, he “recoiled from the carnival atmosphere of mass movements,” refusingto engage in the “Madison Avenue techniques” other swamis employed to spreadtheir message.181 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn181] Both his refusal to adapt to thelarge American audiences and his principled rejection of advertising kept hismovement from expanding beyond a small circle of devoted followers.The Hindu sage whose ministry in early twentieth-century Los Angeles mosteffectively paved the way for Yogananda’s own work, however, was not associatedwith the Vedanta movement. Like Yogananda, Baba Bharati forged his ownindependent movement. His biography remarkably paralleled Yogananda’s in manyways. Bharati was born into a well-off Calcutta family and received a collegeeducation that included English.182 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn182] Sponsored byIndian elites, Bharati came to the United States as a Hindu evangelist. Oneadvertisement called him the “Henry Ward Beecher of India,” comparing him to oneof the late nineteenth century’s most famous evangelical preachers,183[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn183] while a reviewer of one of his books labeled him a“self-identified missionary,” a “chosen instrument of God to carry the religionof the sages of India to western lands.”184 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn184] As withParamananda, audiences viewed Bharati through an Orientalist lens, noting hispiercing eyes, flowing locks, and command of English.185[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn185] He spent a few years in Boston and New York beforesettling in Los Angeles, since he felt most at home in the nation’s spiritualfrontier. As he put it, “Of all spots of Columbia, the most blessed is SouthernCalifornia: more warm-hearted than any other part of the Union; in her centerhere in Los Angeles, I have met the warmest American hearts.”186[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn186] After returning to India for a few years, he plannedto build a large temple in Los Angeles, the city with “the Greatest number ofBrahmin Hindoos in America.”187 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn187] His plans, however,never materialized. With no institutional infrastructure, he lacked the abilityto raise sufficient funds to make his dreams reality.Bharati’s inclusivist message was strikingly similar to Abhedananda’s andParamananda’s, while strongly anticipating Yogananda’s, suggesting that educatedBengali missionaries’ talking points rode a well-worn groove. Bharati routinelyasserted the superiority of Hindu spirituality over competing religioustraditions. And he regularly contrasted ancient Hindu spirituality with theemptiness of Western material progress and technology. Still, he explained thathis views did not conflict with Christianity. He insisted that “if I have talkedof Krishna and exposed you to the Hindoo Bible, it was only to illumine theteachings of your own Christ; to present him before you in the limelight of theVedas, with the X-Ray of our scientific philosophies.”188[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn188] With titles like “The Coming Christ” and “Christ:Proofs of His Divinity,” Bharati’s talks might be confused with those of afundamentalist minister. The substance of his teaching, however, offered littleto comfort orthodox Christians. For Bharati, Jesus was a “god-man” who fullyembraced the divinity within, just as previous religious prophets haddone—Zoroaster, Buddha, Confucius, and sixteenth-century Vaishnavite bhaktiteacher Caitanya.189 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn189]In addition to weekly sermons, Bharati conveyed his ideas through a regularmagazine, the Light of India, which mixed spiritual articles with devotionalpoetry and commentary on current events. His most notable text was Sree Krishna:Lord of Love, a five-hundred-page exposition of Indian belief detailing the lawsof karma and saṃsāra, the necessity of the four varṇas, and the role of dharma.Following Caitanya’s lead, he revealed a vision of personal deity thatcontrasted starkly with the abstractness of Advaita Vedānta’s monistic vision ofBrahman as ultimate reality. Bharati talked about the gracious love Krishna—apopular āvatara of Vishnu whom Bharati presented as the one God—had for hiswhole creation. Humans owed him loving devotion in response. In contrast topopular American understandings of Indian religion as inherently monistic,Bharati cast an essentially monotheistic vision.Bharati found support among many Christian liberals, including severalbroad-minded Protestant clergy. B. Fay Mills is typical of this group. Mills“threaded his way in and out of Congregational, Unitarian, Presbyterian, andFree Religious Association folds. He was successively an advocate of revivalism,the social gospel, Unitarianism, and free religion.”190[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn190] Mills brought Bharati to Los Angeles from Boston, andBharati came to think of him as a brother.191 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn191] As withParamananda, a number of educated, cosmopolitan, upper-middle-class women alsobacked Bharati. Three female supporters were particularly prominent, writingabout Indian spiritual traditions in his magazine and in other venues. RoseAnton, a professional Broadway actress, became a passionate devotee and movedfrom New York to Los Angeles in 1906 to be near her guru. She regularly providedpoems for Bharati’s magazine and wrote a collection of folk stories called Talesof India. Like many other native-born Americans, she made a point of rejectingany contradiction between her Vedic learning and Christian tradition.192[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn192] Similarly, Christina Albers wrote poems about Hinduand Buddhist traditions, as well as stories about India. Her books include Palmsand Temple Bells (1915), Himalayan Whispers (1923), and Ancient Tales ofHindustan (1923). Elizabeth Delvine King was the most deeply influenced byBharati. After his departure from Los Angeles, she forged her own eclecticmetaphysical tradition, publishing a number of works on spirituality. Moreboldly than Anton, she also integrated Christian theology with Indian cosmology.In such works as The Lotus Path, Sayings of Jehovah, and The Higher Metaphysics,she cited the Bible and talked regularly about Christ, Christ Consciousness, andthe spiritual process of being “Christed.”193 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn193]Bharati got a mixed reception from Angelenos. Not surprisingly, evangelicalsattacked him for his unorthodox views of Jesus. In one case, defending himselfagainst an evangelist who called him “an audacious pagan” and “an ass,” Bharatidenounced the man for “speaking from his holy place in the pulpit, in the holyChurch of Christ, the Preacher of Meekness, calling the preacher of anotherreligion who is perhaps a more enthusiastic preacher of Christ than he …language fit for the lips of a swaggering saloon rough.”194[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn194] More remarkably, he gained the respect of L.A.’sProtestant civic leadership. The Los Angeles Times granted him lengthy space onseveral occasions to explain important geopolitical issues, including the Treatyof Portsmouth, which ended the Russo-Japanese War; the disastrous effects ofLord Curzon’s viceroyalty of India; and the emergence of the swadeshi, orself-rule, movement in India. Most intriguingly, Bharati was called as an experton Eastern languages to unmask the claims of prominent area doctor Henry S.Keyes, an Azusa Street convert to Pentecostalism. Keyes claimed that when hespoke in tongues, he was speaking a north Indian language. After examining textthat Keyes wrote under the Spirit’s influence, Bharati testified that the wordswere “neither Hindoo or Persian or Arabic or Chinese or Japanese or Sanskrit.Neither do they look like the characters of any Asiastic Language I know of.”195[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn195] The credibility of Bharati’s conclusion hinged on bothhis linguistic expertise and his veracity, qualities whites were often unwillingto grant to any Indian. Despite his remarkable cachet, Bharati was ultimatelyunable to sustain his momentum, and his movement expired with him when he diedin Calcutta in 1914.196 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn196]Diverse Indian teachers and their followers in early twentieth-century LosAngeles shared a number of common features that facilitated Yogananda’s ownevangelistic efforts. These teachers understood their audience well and couchedtheir message in the language of modernity, emphasizing realization of the self,the integration of science and religion, and an optimistic portrayal ofreincarnation. They promoted the attractiveness—indeed, the superiority—of theirspiritual product while attempting to maintain the equanimity appropriate to apluralistic setting. They recognized that they were addressing culturallyChristian audiences and routinely quoted the New Testament and lauded theexample of Jesus. They all faced mixed responses to their racial identity:interest, prejudice, condescension, and some affection. And theydisproportionately drew well-educated women from wealthy families, who had someexperience in metaphysical or nonmainstream religious traditions. Despite theseteachers’ prospects, each leader had significant liabilities, whether personal,organizational, or promotional. Their movements were declining or dead by thetime Yogananda arrived in Los Angeles. Yogananda would succeed where they failedby cultivating their individual strengths—deep learning, charisma, warmspiritual devotionalism—and adding savvy marketing and an institutionalstructure to sustain his movement.When Yogananda arrived in Los Angeles in early 1925, he received an enthusiasticwelcome. “The Great Divine Power seemed to have roused the whole city to receivethe message of Yogoda. … Clubs, colleges, societies, educational centers,churches and newspapers extended him every courtesy and Swami’s days were filledto overflowing with engagements to speak write and be interviewedeverywhere.”197 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn197] The Los Angeles Times reported thatYogananda drew “immense crowds” to his free talks at the PhilharmonicAuditorium.198 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn198] He filled the three-thousand-seat venueto capacity, and thousands more were turned away. One observer commented on theseeming incongruity of a “Hindu invading the United States to bring God in themidst of a Christian community. A so-called heathen from a so-called heathenland preaching the essence of Christian doctrine to the millions who contributeto foreign-mission boards in order to enlighten the benighted Asiatics!” Despitethe sardonic tone, the author noted the “absorbing attention and acclamation” ofthe audience, “which is the highest tribute to the eager reception of hismessage.” Yogananda’s Yogoda teaching, he thought, “is a practical message whichChristian preachers might well adopt to teach self-made happiness.”199[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn199]Key local figures became admirers and supporters. They included former navalcaptain Richmond Pearson, the Anti-Saloon League’s most prominent speaker;Elisabeth von Kleinsmid, wife of the University of Southern California’spresident; Isidore Dockweiler, a member of the Democratic National Committee;Harry Haldeman, business leader and president of the probusiness Better AmericaFederation, headquartered in Los Angeles; and Church of Divine Science ministerWalter W. Raymond.Inspired in part by the favorable response he had received from Los Angelesaudiences, Yogananda made the momentous decision to establish the headquartersof his ministry in the city. Shortly thereafter, he explained how he found theappropriate site:One day during his Los Angeles stay, one of his students casually mentionedMount Washington. Swami’s soul was strangely stirred at the mention of thisplace and suggested that they drive up there on the following day. When heentered the grounds of the Mount Washington Hotel site, he strolled about, andthen touching the bars surrounding the tennis court, he exclaimed to hiscompanions, This place feels like ours! Today it is “ours,” for thru the kindand willing cooperation and donations of his thousands of students throughoutAmerica, this property was purchased for the American Headquarters of Sat-Sangaand Yogoda.200 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn200]The Mount Washington property was less than four miles from the home whereVivekananda had lived for six weeks in 1899 during his second visit to theUnited States. It strains credulity to imagine that with hundreds of squaremiles from which to choose, by mere coincidence he established his headquartersa short walk from the former home of the man he most sought to emulate.Whatever the reason for his decision, divine providence worked throughhardheaded legal maneuvering to secure the property. The site on MountWashington had been a resort hotel of eighteen guest rooms between 1910 and1922. An incline rail system carried visitors and hotel guests up the steephillside, though a road quickly supplemented the incline.201[18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn201] By the early 1920s, improved cars with strongerengines could more easily navigate the steep road. After some financialstruggle, the hotel closed and vagrants began to occupy the grounds. The swamiwas blessed with legal agents with shrewd skills. Operating separately, theysurreptitiously bought up nine separate parcels in quick succession so as not toarouse suspicion.202 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn202] The opening of the MountWashington Educational Center in late October 1925 was, Yogananda insisted, a“memorable day for Los Angeles.”203 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn203]Despite the site’s inaccessibility, the 940-foot-high crest was hardly amountain. But Yogananda was eager to dramatize the site for two reasons. First,its aesthetic virtues made it a potential tourist destination. Early promotionalliterature made the location sound as if it were still a luxury resort. “Thegrounds are seven and half acres in extent, and are planted with camphor, date,palm, pepper and other beautiful trees, as well as plants, shrubs and wonderfulflower-beds, making it one of the most beautiful spots in Southern California.”The site offered great scenery. “The Center commands an unsurpassed view of thecity below, as well as of other nearby cities, including Pasadena, the ‘City ofRoses.’ The Pacific Ocean sparkles in the distance, and at night the milliontwinkling lights of Los Angeles and distant cities may be seen below, averitable fairyland.”204 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn204]Images [../figures/f0103-09.jpg]Self-Realization Fellowship’s Mount Washington Center in Los Angeles. Formerly aresort in the northeastern part of the city reached only by incline rail, itbecame Yogananda’s international headquarters in the metropolis that was thenemerging as the nation’s spiritual frontier. This beautiful spot in a primelocation became sacred space for Yogananda and his disciples.More important than attracting tourism, however, Yogananda sensed that MountWashington had the potential to convey a sense of sacred space for his spiritualmovement’s headquarters. Most white Americans were not accustomed to imbuingtheir country’s landscape with sacred meaning, though for some the nation’scapital or historic battlefields might be hallowed ground. The emergence oftourism in the late nineteenth century had also introduced sightseers toYellowstone, Yosemite, and the Grand Canyon, often stimulating sublimeexperiences in more naturalistic settings.205 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn205]Yogananda hoped to capitalize on such sentiments as he sought to turn MountWashington into a holy pilgrimage site that reflected both the Americanlandscape and sacred sites in India. Invoking one of the holiest pilgrimagesites in India, he later said, “I have always considered Los Angeles to be theBenares of America.”206 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn206] In 1925, he composed a poemcalled “Life’s Dream” that celebrated the place—named for the nation’s firstpresident—that he saw as the embodiment of his longing to draw the spiritualEast and freedom-loving West together:The summer-EastAnd the wintry WestThey say—but Mount WashingtonNamed rightly after that pioneerOf Freedom’s great career,Thou dost stand, the snowless guardian HimalayaOf the angel land in perpetual green regalia.Nippon’s camphor trees and perfumed wisteria and smiling rosesPalm, date and well-beloved spicy bay leaves of Hind stand close,With endless scenic beautiesOf ocean, canyon, setting sun, moon-studded skyAnd nightly twinkling citiesTo declareThy ever-changing beauty.On thy crown thou shalt newly wearA priceless starry-school which in all future nearShall draw the lost travelers of the East and West.To find their goal and one place of rest.Here one pathShall merge with all other paths.Here the love of earthly Freedom’s paradise, America,Shall blend forever with spiritual Freedom’s paradise, India.Here church in deepest friendliness shall all other churches meet,Here the temple the mosque shall greet.Here the long-divorced matter-lawsWill wed again in peace the spirit laws.Here all minds will learn that true ArtOf living life and the way to startStraight to the One great placeWhere all must meet at last.Jehovah! This is the land of solaceWhere my life’s dream in truth reappears!207 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn207]In Yogananda’s vision, Mount Washington’s sacredness ultimately stemmed lessfrom the inherent beauty of the location or the symbolism of the name than fromanticipation of the spiritual work that would be done there through theadvancement of Yogoda. On a later occasion, he linked the humble L.A. peak tothe great Himalayas, explicitly evoking a sense of Mount Washington’ssacredness. In his autobiography, he recounted a prophecy he was given during apilgrimage with Sri Yukteswar to a temple devoted to Śankara, the founder of theswami order. When they arrived, Yogananda had a profound experience.As I gazed upon the mountain-peak hermitage, bold against the sky, I fell intoan ecstatic trance. A vision appeared of a hilltop mansion in a distant land;the lofty Śankara temple in Srinagar became transformed into the edifice where,years later, I established Self-Realization Fellowship headquarters in America.When I first visited Los Angeles, and saw the large building on the crest ofMount Washington, I recognized it at once from my long-past visions in Kashmirand elsewhere.208 [18_notes.xhtml#c2.fn208]In comparing Mount Washington to Srinagar, Yogananda also implicitly comparedhimself to the great Śankara, whose presence made the hermitage holy. MountWashington was sacred because the swami who had settled there had consecrated itas a base to promulgate the divine Yogoda message to countless thousands ofAmericans.SCIENTIFIC RELIGION ON THE NATION’S SPIRITUAL FRONTIERBy 1925, more than four eventful years had passed since the young swami arrivedin the United States on the S.S. City of Sparta. His understanding of thechallenge of self-invention had matured considerably since he had shaved off hisbeard aboard the ship in an effort to present himself appropriately to Americanaudiences. This was no mean feat in a postwar nation where many were deeplysuspicious of foreigners, heathens, and the darker races. After stumbling a bitfollowing the International Conference of Free Christians and Other ReligiousLiberals, Yogananda had found his stride. Southern California, the nation’sspiritual frontier, proved essential to his success. Home to nonmainstreamreligions of various kinds, it boasted a long history of Indian religiousteachers who paved the way for his own ministry. The Mount WashingtonEducational Center, perched on a prominent hill overlooking Los Angeles, becamethe practical and symbolic center of his ministry, a sacred Hindu site in abooming American metropolis. Yogananda proved himself skilled in translating hisyoga message to middle-class white Americans as he established a firm foundationfor scientific religion in a nation that was deeply shaped by Protestantbeliefs, ethics, and practices. Building on his own Indian training—through hismentorship under Yukteswar, his college education, and his exposure to broaderBengali ideas—Yogananda had constructed a sophisticated understanding ofmodernity, its challenges, and the way his spiritual message could resonate withthe transcendent longings of modern Americans. He had established a loyal ifmodest base of followers and financial supporters among spiritual seekers andkey civic leaders. Now he could settle down to the task of refining andcommunicating his message of self-realization in powerful, engaging ways—andhoning his unique product to compete in the marketplace of American religion.Meditation promised a practical, systematic, guaranteed method for God-contact,a deeply profound, devotional experience of the divine."},{"pageContent":"THREETHE CREATION OF A YOGI GURU PERSONAMARKETING SWAMI YOGANANDA AND HIS YOGA INSTRUCTION, 1925–1935The business man hurries to his office, rushes in, sits in his chair, and beginsto concentrate upon some difficult problem. The din of his secretary’stypewriter annoys him. He shouts at her to stop. A moment later, he realizesthere is need for hurry on the letter she is typing, so he shouts at her to goon again. Then he begins smoking his after-breakfast cigar. Every day heresolves to quit smoking some time, as he knows that it is a useless, expensive,and unnecessary habit, but he never does quit. After a little more deep thoughton the problem, ragged nerves tug at the shirts of his concentration, andfinally, hardly able to bear himself any longer, he madly dashes the cigar intothe cuspidor, stops the typewriter, and dismisses his secretary because shebrought him some bills that needed to be paid. He shouts at theinwardly-laughing, outwardly-respectful secretary, and pleads: “Have pity on me.Be considerate. Don’t you see that I am trying to put over a big deal?” Hedecides to try to concentrate once more, and dozes off in disgust at hisinability to work out his problem, and he quietly drifts into deeper slumber,while his secretaries happily and quietly steal off to lunch. He wakes up tofind that he has missed his train, lost his appointment, and with it his bigdeal falls through. This business man does not know the real art ofconcentration.1 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn1]It was this kind of harried businessman who most needed Yogananda’s teachings.Had that businessman stopped at a corner newsstand on his way to the train, hemight have been drawn to the exotic-looking cover of East-West magazine. Openingthe front cover, he would have found an advertisement promising to solve aproblem he didn’t know he had. Large, bold letters announced a “YogodaCorrespondence Course,” providing instruction in a technique to “recharge thebody batteries with fresh life current by increasing dynamic power of will.”Improved “beauty of form,” “grace of expression,” and “power of mentalreceptivity” were just a few of the benefits he would receive. The techniquealso guaranteed him all-around health, the ability to take off (or put on!) fat“as desired,” and power over his spiritual destiny. All of this was availablethrough a correspondence course for a nominal fee.2 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn2]Staring back from the page was Swami Yogananda, clad in a silk robe, long hairflowing over his shoulders, his confident expression assuring readers of themessage’s authenticity. Couched in modern scientific language, the advertisementlargely eschewed religious terminology as it offered techniques perfected by an“eminent Hindu master of metaphysics and psychology.” Yogananda began hisministry at the height of an early twentieth-century boom in consumer capitalismaided by a revolution in manufacturing, mass communication, increased disposableincome, and easy credit.3 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn3] Advertisements became morepervasive and more persuasive. Besides newspapers and magazines, peopleencountered ads on roadside billboards, at bus stops, and on the radio. Relyingheavily on the new field of psychology, ads guaranteed the fulfillment ofdesires and self-transformation. For some, consumption’s promise oftranscendence threatened to displace religion. Spiritual leaders like Yoganandahad to assure audiences that their product was uniquely able to deliverhappiness and personal development in ways that consumer goods never could.Scholars have long investigated intersections between American religion and themarket.4 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn4] The nation’s early religious disestablishmenthas long provided a religious marketplace that allows for a wide range ofreligions to compete. Though this analytical framework has typically beenapplied to competition among Protestant denominations, the market context isessential for making sense of Yogananda’s efforts to expand his ministry.Although Yogananda’s frequent references to Christianity and metaphysicalmovements expressed ecumenical concern, they simultaneously and paradoxicallyreflected an effort to draw comparisons to inferior products in a competitivereligious market. American religious leaders have often disregarded Jesus’swarning that the faithful cannot serve both God and mammon, demonstrating greatskill in marketing both literal and metaphorical spiritual products.5[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn5]A growing body of scholarship applies this type of capitalist analysis to Indianyogis, such as Mumbai-area guru Muktananda, who launched Siddha Yoga in 1956,and Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, who started teaching in India in the 1960s beforebecoming infamous in the United States as sex-guru Osho in the 1980s. Yoganandawas never as blunt or provocative as Osho, who acknowledged that he was part ofa “marketplace” and claimed to “sell enlightenment.” But Yogananda was asignificant forerunner of many later figures, successfully commodifying Indianspirituality in early twentieth-century America—and, from there, around theworld—charting a path for entrepreneurial spirituality in which “every form ofexotic cultural knowledge, every yogic posture, and every spiritual techniquehas become a commodity.”6 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn6] If there was irony in ayogi—whose ascetic tradition represented a fundamental rejection of“materialistic religiosity,” in Edwin Bryant’s words—peddling a line ofspiritual products that he promised would liberate Americans from the deceptionthat happiness could be achieved through the “acquisition of an infinite numberof material things,” Yogananda failed to see it.7 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn7]The three sections that comprise this chapter explore Yogananda’s early ministryin a marketplace context. The first section addresses the way the yogi promotedhis message to modern Americans steeped in a culture of consumption. In the1920s, advertisers “relentlessly tried to persuade Americans to buy a particularmanufacturer’s brands and, above all, to accept no substitutes.”8[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn8] Ads used authority and expertise to gain the audience’strust. Ironically, evangelical preachers, whose theology differed from Yoganandamore than any other Christian group, offer the closest parallel to his ownpersonality-based style of religious branding. Like them, Yogananda embodiedsacred authority through his image—both his literal appearance and hispersona—and his religious expertise. He evoked and subverted Orientalist tropesto manage his message and his image as an exotic, authoritative, sacred teacher.The second section investigates the religious products he touted, most centrallythe course he created to teach yoga, a systematic, practical method forGod-realization, through the thoroughly modern medium of a correspondencecourse. His East-West magazine helped to reestablish the personal link betweenguru and disciple severed by his distance-learning strategy while highlightingYogoda’s distinctiveness as a religious brand. His magazine was also a vehiclefor Indian cultural and religious nationalism, reflecting his desire to protectthe reputation of his homeland and its treasured teachings. His final productwas a community, both real and virtual, of shared values and practices.The final section considers the risks of the religious market. Staying solventin a competitive market presented numerous challenges. In the decade betweenestablishing the center at Mount Washington in 1925 and departing for India in1935, Yogananda rode a wild financial roller coaster. Though savvy in some ways,Yogananda was surprisingly naive in others, unaware of how different thesouthern market was until he riled white southern men who drove him out of town.He faced several lawsuits that threatened his brand image and his bank account.And, like many churches during the Depression, his center suffered financially.But just when things looked bleakest, he was rescued from his distress by hisbiggest customer of all.MARKETING YOGODA RELIGIONPaging through any Southern California newspaper’s religious advertisementsection in the 1920s would illustrate the region’s vibrant spiritualmarketplace. Announcements for dozens of established denominations, newermovements like Theosophy and Christian Science, and permutations within eachgroup all jostled for space. Canny religious leaders like Yogananda usedadvertising, an intrinsic element of the nation’s new consumer economy, to sellreligion, from literal newspaper advertisements to personal testimonials fromrespected figures in science, the arts, and Hollywood. Ultimately, a religiousfigure’s persona—personality, appearance, and delivery style—was both a productand a sales tool. Yogananda bore many similarities to the flamboyant evangelistsof the era, though his product and audience differed from theirs in crucialways.As advertising executives came to understand how needs, desires, andinsecurities shaped behavior, their techniques became modern. According tohistorian of advertising Roland Marchand, “As it came to accept the paradox ofits role as both apostle of modernity and buffer against the effects of modernimpersonalities of scale, and as it developed strategies for accommodating thepublic to modern complexities, American advertising in the 1920s and 1930s tookon what we now recognize as a distinctly modern cast.”9 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn9]“Just as the manufacturing world has been compelled to turn its attention tophysics and chemistry and as the manufacturer’s vocabulary is composed of manyterms which were but recently technical terms used only by scientists,”explained Walter Dill Scott in his 1908 book The Psychology of Advertising, “sothe advertising world has turned its attention to the subject of psychology, andmany words formerly used only by professional psychologists are to-daycommonplaces with advertisers.”10 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn10] Advertisers seekingto elevate the desirability of their products often subtly evoked familiarsacred imagery to convey the transcendent possibilities of consumption.11[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn11] Modern advertising increasingly blurred consumer goodsand the sacred in the early twentieth century.Some observers in the 1920s characterized advertising itself as a kind ofreligion. Advertisers, who were often former ministers or their offspring,aspired to evoke the sublime. The “attention engineers” of mass culture, theywere seen as “spiritual and cultural redeemers.” President Calvin Coolidgecongratulated advertisers for their work in “the regeneration and redemption ofmankind,” through “inspiring and ennobling the commercial world.”12[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn12] A contemporary proclaimed that “advertising probably isour greatest agency for spreading an understanding and love of beauty in allthings,” praising its “peculiar power as an educative force.”13[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn13]Even within the religious fold, some embraced the creative possibilities of thenew consumer culture. Advertising executive Bruce Barton, the son of aCongregational minister, penned The Man Nobody Knows, an immediate best sellerthat revealed Jesus as a worldly man who displayed remarkable commercial acumen.“The founder of modern business,” “Jesus picked up twelve men from the bottomranks of business and forged them into an organization that conquered theworld.” Barton sketched a portrait of Jesus as an executive and advertiser witha clear method. Barton appreciated that Jesus was “successful in masteringpublic attention,” “because he recognized the basic principle that all goodadvertising is news. … Reporters would have followed him every single hour, forit was impossible to predict what he would say or do; every action and word werenews.14 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn14] Barton’s interpretation of Jesus healing“shattered nerves,” “divided minds,” and “complexes” reflected a modern fusionof religion and psychology.15 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn15] As religious historianMatthew Hedstrom comments, The Man Nobody Knows “perfectly encapsulated theconfluence of consumer cult, religious publishing, theological liberalism, andgender anxiety in the 1920s. Barton’s book received intense scorn from bothconserve and liberal critics, mostly for its indisputable theologicalshallowness and naked celebration of American capitalism.”16[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn16]Yogananda was much more sanguine about The Man Nobody Knows. He favorablyreviewed Barton’s book in 1926, proclaiming it “original, gripping, alive! Itsucceeds in actually conveying the personality of Jesus. It takes a greathistorical figure, somewhat vague from the mist of centuries, and sharpens Hisoutline … until the reader can see, feel and understand His compelling charm andpower. Jesus as an executive, and the founder of modern business! His methodsand advertising! These chapter headings hint at the contents. Every Yogodastudent should read it!”17 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn17] In his admiration forBarton’s effort to link pragmatism, advertising, and business organization withthe West’s greatest spiritual figure, Yogananda discloses his own assessment ofthe relation between spirituality and commerce.Yogananda’s newspaper advertisements for the benefits of Yogoda illustrate hismarketing acumen. The ads benefited early on from his promoter, Mohammad Rashid,who recognized that deep spiritual matters and amusement were not inherentantagonists. Yogananda decided to advertise in both the religion andentertainment sections of local newspapers. This strategy embraced commonAmerican perceptions of Hindu-speakers as novelty acts rather than as spiritualleaders. At the same time, the uniqueness of a Yogananda ad sandwiched betweenpromotions for vaudeville productions, casinos, and Al Jolson blackfaceperformances gave him an advantage over his competitors who advertised only inthe religion section.18 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn18] The ads themselves, whileterse, arrested readers’ attention with a headshot of Yogananda wearing aturban. He adopted the turban almost as a prop in conformity with Americanexpectations. Judging by extant photos, he never wore one in India and donnedone for the first time in 1920 when he attended the Boston conference. In thereligious advertisement section, his portrait was often the only image on thepage. He also relied heavily on volume. He barraged audiences with ads, offeringreaders multiple opportunities to learn about his talks. This was a riskycalculation, a gamble that his extensive up-front advertising costs would payfor themselves with a larger volume of audience donations.In various ways, Yogananda sought to convey a sense of personal authority thatmade his message compelling and trustworthy. From the time of his arrival in theUnited States, he had experimented with different ways of presenting himself.The frontispiece to his 1923 work Songs of the Soul showcased one approach. Init, he established his bona fides with a cascade of titles: founder of “Ranchiand Puri Brahmacharya Residential Schools in India, Sat Sanga (Fellowship withTruth), Boston; Sat Sanga Summer School, Waltham; Vice-President: SADHU SABHA,India; Delegate from India to International Congress of Religions, Boston1920.”19 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn19] “India’s foremost educator” often embellishedhis credentials.20 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn20] He called himself a “distinguishedHindu psychologist,” though he had not studied psychology.21[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn21] He donned the title “Swami from University ofCalcutta,” implying that he was formally associated with that institution,though his sole connection there was the bachelor’s degree he received yearsearlier from Serampore College, which was affiliated with the university.22[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn22] He claimed that as “the owner of two large schools inIndia” he was in the United States to study the school system. The Denver pressunderstood him to be a prince.23 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn23] He described himselfas the personal representative of the maharaja of Kasim Bazar, a “powerfulreigning prince of India,”24 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn24] though the prince—who didfinance Yogananda’s schools in India—neither underwrote Yogananda’s Americanministry nor saw Yogananda as his agent. Exploiting the glamour of Orientalrulers and Americans’ ignorance of Indian governance structure—India had severalhundred princely states, each with its own maharaja—Yogananda suggested aprestigious, formally sponsored mission.Endorsements by famous Americans also provided significant cachet for Yoganandaand his work. Renowned horticulturalist and liberal Christian Luther Burbankinvoked his own scientific authority to provide a vigorous testimonial aboutYogananda and his teaching:I have examined the Yogoda system of Swami Yogananda and in my opinion it isideal for training and harmonizing man’s physical, mental and spiritual natures.… Through the Yogoda system of physical, mental and spiritual unfoldment bysimple and scientific methods of concentration and meditation, most of thecomplex problems of life may be solved, and peace and good-will come upon earth.The Swami’s idea of right education is plain common-sense, free from allmysticism or non-practicality, otherwise it would not have my approval. … I amglad to have this opportunity of heartily joining with the Swami in his appealfor international schools on the art of living, which, if established, will comeas near to bringing the millennium as anything with which I am acquainted.25[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn25]Burbank contributed an article to the first issue of Yogananda’s magazine,discussing science and civilization. Yogananda expressed his admiration for“Beatific Burbank” in verse a few pages later in the same issue, calling him“the great reformer Luther … of living plants and flowers.” His admiration forBurbank extended beyond his scientific expertise to his reverence for “theMighty Invisible Sun … that lights little plants, distant stars, the burstingbubble, thee and me and man.” Burbank, whose experiments with plant hybrids madehim a perfect example of the practical application of science that Yoganandaprized, authoritatively confirmed the harmony between science and religion.Opera singer Madame Amelita Galli-Curci’s endorsement won Yogananda his firstreference in a national publication, when Time described their relationship in1928.Amelita Galli-Curci (coloratura soprano) gave her name for advertising purposesto Swami Yogananda of India and Los Angeles, Calif., a man who looks like aplump woman. She was quoted in copy in Manhattan theatre programs as saying:“YOGODA gives Health, Strength, Power to Accomplish, Peace and Poise.” Amongother things, YOGODA claims to teach people “to Recharge their body, mind andsoul Batteries from Inner Cosmic Energy … to meditate, to know Divine truths.”26[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn26]Time’s snide tone notwithstanding, the article provided free advertising on anational scale. Galli-Curci later wrote the dedication to Yogananda’s Whispersfrom Eternity, celebrating a scientific approach to a relationship with God thatwould reap great rewards:Images [../figures/f0114-10.jpg]In this 1925 advertisement for a talk in Los Angeles, Yogananda highlightsIndia’s ancient wisdom as a source of revolutionary change. He hints at yoga’stranscendent possibilities with religious language of revelation, inspiration,miracles, and “a higher destiny.” Though the teaching is free, thesalesmanship—with testimonials, evidence of Yogananda’s expertise, and thepromise of attaining every desire—is hard to miss.The prayers in this book serve to bring God closer, by describing the feelingswhich directly arise from actual God-contact. God is expressed here as somethingdefinite and tangible. The Cosmic Idol is the grand conception of the Infiniteand Invisible made finite and visible. Nature, man, mind, and every visibleobject are all taken as materials to build a colossal Divine Idol, on which wecan easily concentrate.Followers of all religions may drink from this fountain of universal prayers.These prayers are an answer to the modern scientific mind, seeking Godintelligently. This book gives us a great variety of prayers, which enables oneto choose that prayer most suited and helpful to his particular need.My humble request to the reader, I express in the following lines:Pass not by, with hurried intellectual reading, the mines of realization hiddenbeneath the soil of words in this sacred book. But, as the Swami says, daily andrepeatedly dig deep into them with the pickax of your attentive, reverential andmeditative study, when you will find the priceless gem of self-realization.27[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn27]Yogananda forged relationships with other entertainers, taking advantage of hisproximity to Hollywood to cultivate friendships with key figures in the filmindustry. In 1928, Sid Grauman invited Yogananda to a Hollywood Association ofForeign Correspondents dinner in honor of filmmaker Carl Laemmle. SamuelGoldwyn, D. W. Griffith, William C. DeMille (the older brother of Cecil B.DeMille), actress Delores Del Rio, and “dozens of other screen luminaries” werein attendance.28 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn28] Yogananda delivered a talk on India tothese guests who frequently purveyed images of the exotic East on the screen.Orientalism became a “staple of American popular culture during the 1920s”through film, books, and magazines.29 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn29] This wasparticularly true of film, which was born at the height of Europeanimperialism.30 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn30] Clearly smitten by the film industry,Yogananda began to describe life as a “Paramount picture, shown in serials andby installments, infinitely interesting, ever-fresh, ever-stirring,ever-complex.” Everyone could play his part but need not fear that the movieplot would end in tragedy, since the “great Director of the Motion PictureCompany of Life is made of Joy.”31 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn31] Yogananda could bequite voluble with his life-as-film metaphor. In the “cosmic cinema,” “the boxoffice is open; the house is full, and we are on the screen and have shown someof our work. The climax has to be reached, and then the audience will bethrilled with our everlasting picture. Then we will disappear during theintermission of earthly departure. But even though we would be gone, our workwill be repeated; in the continuous film we will work for all time to come.”32[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn32]His infatuation with filmmaking also played a part in his theatricality. Hedisplayed an intuitive understanding of the principle that “religions that lendthemselves to visual intensity and symbolism have greater appeal in consumerculture.”33 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn33] Besides playing up his visualappearance—his long hair, turban, and robes—he developed the aural impact of hisdramatic performance, controlling the tone, volume, and pitch of his voice, ashe undulated dramatically. Audiences noted how his resonant “God power-drivenvoice” complemented his eyes, face, and gestures.34 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn34] Asone disciple appreciatively explained, “Master’s voice—well modulated—rose andfell in pitch and decibels to express the internal feelings he projected. Tocapture the full attention of his listeners, his voice ranged from whisperedphrases to a great booming volume. It always commanded attention and, no doubt,kept the listeners interested.”35 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn35] Even his Indianaccent—which occasionally made him difficult for Americans tounderstand—conveyed a charming, exotic wisdom. In effect, he presented himselfas if constantly aware that he was on screen, or at least in front of thecamera.As all of these advertising techniques suggest, Yogananda intuitively understoodthat marketing his message was indissolubly linked to marketing himself. Thecentrality of self-promotion reflected a key transformation in the individual’sidentity in the modern era: the development of what cultural historian WarrenSusman has called personality. The nineteenth-century vision of a personcommitted to duty, work, honor, and reputation began to give way to an ideologythat stressed the attractive, magnetic, forceful, and creative qualities of eachindividual. By the early twentieth century, “the development of consciousness ofself” emerged in conjunction with a consumer economy, mass culture, and theexpansion of leisure time, emphasizing “individual idiosyncrasies, personalneeds and interests.”36 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn36] According to Susman, the newtechnologies of radio and film gave birth to celebrity culture, in whichaudiences paid attention to athletes, performers, and film actors at all times,not just when they performed. “Stars” were famous simply for being themselves orat least the selves projected in their personas.Yogananda found himself in a crowded field of religious stars promoting theirown personality-driven brands in the 1920s. Given evangelical preachers’ longtradition of theatrical performance, from George Whitefield, “the divinedramatist” and “pedlar in divinity” in the eighteenth century, through CharlesFinney and Lorenzo Dow in the nineteenth, their adept marketing is nosurprise.37 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn37] It was often the evangelists’ personas,including their endearing personal idiosyncrasies, that enabled them toentertain large audiences through public addresses, modern print, and radioministries. Their flamboyance, self-promotion, and attention to rhetoricalflourish over oratorical substance inspired Sinclair Lewis’s novel Elmer Gantryin 1927.38 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn38] However fervently these preachers may haverailed against materialism, their approach inevitably turned them into purveyorsof a commodified religion.39 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn39] Evangelist Billy Sunday isa prime example of this phenomenon. An Iowa native and former professionalbaseball player, Sunday possessed more passion than intellect, along with acanny knack for drawing large audiences. While not all Americans loved thisflashy showman, he became a household name in the 1910s and 1920s and gained anumber of friends in Hollywood.40 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn40] He marketedeverything he could think of: his biography, his sermons, hymn books, andpostcards of himself, his family, and his evangelical team.41[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn41] “Fighting Bob” Shuler was one of several fundamentalistpreachers whose nickname hinted at his unwillingness to compromisetheologically, as well as his pugnacious style of communication. A Tennesseenative, Shuler relocated to Los Angeles in 1920, where he continued to pastoruntil his retirement in 1953, though a once robust radio ministry had been deadsince the FCC revoked his license in 1931 for libel. He directed his militancyas much toward internal enemies like Aimee Semple McPherson as he did towardpolitical targets he accused of misdeeds.42 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn42] SisterAimee, whose ministry was described briefly in chapter 2 [13_chapter02.xhtml],claims pride of place as a Southern California personality-driven minister. Inher 1927 autobiography, she explained, “Religion, to thrive in the present day,must utilize present-day methods.” Sister Aimee, who became friends withHollywood celebrities like Charlie Chaplin, was an extremely innovativepresenter who appeared on stage on a motorcycle for one sermon, stagedtheatrical productions, and dramatically displayed the crutches of thosephysically healed through her ministry.43 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn43]Yogananda shared much in common with these popular evangelists. He could holdhis own with the best of them as an entertainer. He offered a compelling messageof sublime encounter with the divine. Most importantly, like these evangelists,he recognized that his persona was his most potent weapon and labored to developa distinctive cult of personality. As one researcher of the movementperceptively noted at the time:Swami Yogananda himself is the biggest advertisement for the Society, in spiteof a newspaper announcement that “Swami Yogananda keeps himself in thebackground.” His face appears in newspapers and on billboards, in some of hisbooks, and several times in his magazine. Every Yogoda class has its photograph;the class-members are seated while the swami stands well in the foreground. Onone Fourth of July a large notice board at the entrance of the Mount Washingtongrounds displayed a life sized picture of the swami beside his message toAmerica. The organization arranges for photographs of the swami playing one ofhis four musical instruments or conversing with some American notable such asGovernor Fuller of Massachusetts or President Coolidge.44[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn44]Understanding that he was part of a crowded marketplace, the yogi shouted tomake himself heard over the din of competitors.The competition between rival religious stars was sometimes quite apparent. Inone case, an ad for Sister Aimee appeared directly above one for Yogananda.Other than his foreign-sounding name and exotic image, Yogananda’s ad wasscarcely distinguishable from one she might have placed: the ad described aSunday devotional service and Sunday school, announced the upcoming talk,“Healing by Christ Power,” and explained how the previous week’s “HealingPrayer” service had led to a woman being healed and throwing away her crutch.45[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn45] He even stole a page from Sister Aimee’s playbook. Areport in 1926 announced that a “Los Angeles student, Mrs. Otto Crimman,” hadthrown away her crutch “in the presence of a large number of students.” Her nameand address were offered as verifiable proof of the effectiveness of hiscures.46 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn46]But he differed from these evangelists in equally crucial ways apart fromtheology. First, for many evangelists, their lack of formal educationunderscored the divine nature of their calling: God chose to work through weakinstruments to increase his glory. At best, these preachers were ambivalenttoward intellect and education, and at worst they were overtly hostile.Yogananda had been reluctant to attend college. Yukteswar, however, had beenprescient in his conviction that a college degree would be an asset inYogananda’s self-promotion as an authoritative religious personality. Hisadvertisements always mentioned his bachelor’s degree. A number of hispublications included technical illustrations and official-sounding jargon, frommedical terms to anatomical labels and to health and exercise techniques. In allof these ways, Yogananda demonstrated his expertise in addressing health issuesthrough scientific religion.Second and related, Yogananda targeted a very different audience—both inreligious identity and in class. He calculated that he would never windoctrinaire Christians, so he never really tried. Neither was he a populist.Though the masses often crowded to his meetings seeking entertainment, few wouldbecome faithful disciples of his esoteric message. Yogananda’s typical targetaudience was liberal Christians and followers of metaphysical traditions whodisdained evangelists’ brand of showmanship and preferred a dignifiedintellectual approach more suitable to a club meeting or lyceum.Yogananda particularly reached out to this striving professional middle class,open to his self-improvement message as a path toward advancement. The 1920sconsumer and service revolution catalyzed the emergence of a new “white collar”middle class composed of civil servants, salesmen, managers, and advertisingagents.47 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn47] In Los Angeles, the booming economy in themanufacturing, real estate, film production, and leisure industries increasedthe region’s white-collar pool.48 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn48] Yogananda appealed tosuch workers, assuming that they felt a spiritual void in striving only afterearthly reward. He routinely used businessmen as examples in his illustrations.The “ordinary successful business man uses his powers of concentration onlyabout twenty-five per cent,” while “the student of Self-Realization can develophis power of concentration one hundred per cent and can use it scientifically tobring him success.”49 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn49] In one provocative essay, “Who Isa Yogi?” Yogananda confronted stereotypes of the yogi as “a sword-swallower,crystal gazer or snake charmer” and reappropriated the label as a dignified termthat applied to his followers. In contrast to popular misconceptions, realyogis—or at least aspiring ones—hailed from respectable middle-classbackgrounds. Though anyone could follow yoga, the nation’s “business man,literary man, artist, musician” were particularly drawn to the path. These kindsof seekers understood “the scientific psycho-physical technique of uniting thematter-bound body and soul with their source of origin, the Blessed Spirit.”50[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn50]Given how inseparable Yogananda’s personality was from Yogoda’s authenticity,there was no better way to promote his ministry than to travel the country andpresent himself to live audiences. In 1925, Yogananda took to the road—and therails. A large photo in the Los Angeles Times that year announcing “Swami BuysSwanky Car” showed Yogananda, who apparently needed to replace the Lewis’sworn-out roadster, posing next to a new automobile. Rehashing hackneyed clichésabout ancient India, the paper commented that the modern Packard was “a far cryfrom the crude transportation of India.”51 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn51] Though theTimes thought the incongruity of the enrobed swami standing next to anautomobile amusing, the photo captured the indispensable role moderntransportation played in the success of Yogananda’s ministry.For the next decade he was an indefatigable traveler, rarely spending more thana few nights at a time at Mount Washington, and not more than a few weeksaltogether. It was fortunate that he had learned to charge his body battery,because he kept up a grueling pace that would have exhausted anyone relying onhis or her own strength. He racked up thousands of miles and hundreds ofspeaking presentations in cities big and small across the United States.Yogananda’s childhood in India, particularly his regular use of trains, servedhim in good stead in his U.S. ministry. From the beginning of 1926 through theend of 1928, for example, Yogananda traveled to the following locations inorder, staying anywhere from a few days to several months: Cleveland, LosAngeles, Pittsburgh, New York, Detroit, Pittsburgh, New York, Los Angeles,Cincinnati, Cleveland, Washington, D.C., Pittsburgh, Detroit, Buffalo,Washington, D.C., Cleveland, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis–Saint Paul,Cleveland, Washington, D.C., Detroit, Ann Arbor, Battle Creek, Miami,Philadelphia, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Detroit, Philadelphia, Buffalo,Los Angeles, Boston, Washington, D.C., New York, and Philadelphia.This relentless travel spawned the growth of new Yogoda centers around thecountry. Though a few, such as Philadelphia, failed to thrive, the networkgenerally grew in this period. By mid-1932, the Boston and Los Angeles centershad been joined by centers in Oakland, Salt Lake City, Denver, Minneapolis,Saint Louis, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, andWashington, D.C. Organizations were heavily concentrated in the urban, diverse,and densely populated Northeast. There were also notable gaps. The lack of anysignificant presence in the Pacific Northwest is surprising, since Yoganandamade many trips early on to Seattle, Tacoma, and Portland. Perhaps he could notget local support, the sine qua non for getting a center established. Yogodacenters were absent from the South, from Texas to Florida and Georgia toVirginia. Protestant hegemony in the Bible Belt culture encouraged deepsuspicion of Eastern traditions, and he never penetrated further south thanSaint Louis and Washington, D.C., relatively atypical Southern cities. Thenation’s cultural boundaries limited the expansion of even the most innovativespiritual entrepreneur. Around this time, the Vedanta Society began to make acomeback, from four societies to more than a dozen by the late 1930s, inHollywood, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Washington,D.C., Providence, and Boston. Still, even with its weak points, the dramaticoverall growth of his ministry in little more than a decade eclipsed what theVedanta Society had been able to accomplish in the same timeframe a few decadesearlier.52 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn52]YOGANANDA’S RELIGIOUS PRODUCTSLike more recent popular Christian leaders, Yogananda succeeded in a competitivereligious marketplace by being “quick, decisive, and flexible in reacting tochanging conditions, savvy at packaging and marketing” his ministry, and“resourceful at offering spiritual rewards that resonate with the existentialneeds and cultural tastes of the public.”53 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn53] He offeredthree types of religious products. First, he promised the personal goods ofspiritual liberation and physical and emotional well-being through yoga, a setof scientific disciplines that allowed God-contact. Second, he offered communalgoods through Yogoda Sat-Sanga groups. Founded throughout the country, theselocal centers created communities of like-minded individuals who shared the samerituals and values. Finally, he offered consumer goods that linked disciples totheir religious tradition.54 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn54] His bimonthly magazine,East-West, and a flood of books helped to sustain a sense of community throughYogananda’s spiritual teachings and news about sister groups around the country.As material objects, books and especially the subscription-based magazine wereliteral products that provided a tangible reminder of community identity.As with every product associated with the restless ad man, Yogananda gavevarious names to his yoga method, hoping to achieve the proper resonance. In theearly years, he commonly labeled it Yogoda, a neologism designed todifferentiate his product from the other forms of yoga practice customers mighthave learned about from the Vedanta Society or elsewhere. According toSatyeswarananda, a disciple of Yogananda’s former colleague and childhood friendSatyananda, Yogananda coined the word Yogoda while still in India. Inspired bySatyananda’s Yogad Sat Sanga Sova meetings in India, Yogananda apparentlyplanned to create his own Yogoda Sat-Sanga, or Yogoda Community, in the UnitedStates. When informed that Yogoda was a grammatically incorrect rendition of theSanskrit—and inappropriate because it sounded too much like Yogananda’s ownname, and would thus confuse a large organization of many teachers with onerepresentative—Yogananda reputedly brushed off the objections: “Oh! For us it isokay.”55 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn55] For his first fifteen years in the UnitedStates, his organization was officially labeled Yogoda Sat-Sanga until herenamed it Self-Realization Fellowship in 1935.He published his first teachings in the 1923 Yogoda or Muscle-Will System ofPhysical Perfection, a series of physical and breathing exercises designed toprovide healing and wholeness through prāṇāyāma, control of the life force, orprāṇa. At the beginning of Yogoda, Yogananda directs the practitioner to invokethe Eternal Energy, introducing a larger discourse about the body as a mechanismthat needs electricity to run. Yogananda may have borrowed his terminology frommetaphysical thinkers, who were often fascinated by the relation betweenspirituality and electricity, but it would have also sparked interest broadlyamong audience members.56 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn56] Electricity fascinated modernAmericans, who viewed it as “an energy flowing between mind and body,” which“merged with new therapeutic conceptions of the psyche and the self. … Americansmade electricity a metaphor for mental power, psychological energy, and sexualattraction.” By the late nineteenth century, a number of commercial devicespromised to restore health, strength, or sexual potency through electricity.57[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn57] Beyond its spiritual and psychological implications,electricity captivated early twentieth-century Americans in more material ways.Electricity generated new forms of transportation, amusement parks, laborsavingappliances, and artificial lighting that turned nighttime cities into day.58[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn58]Yogananda seized on this fascination with electricity, energy, and spiritualityand developed it into a coherent explanation of his program’s efficacy. Hecompared the conventional yogic notion of prāṇāyāma to the most powerful sourceof energy the modern world knew. And he regularly employed the trope of the bodyas an engine. “An automobile battery needs to be recharged once in a while whenrun down. So the battery of the body parts, exhausted by physical work and brainlabor, requires to be recharged by fresh nerve current sent down by Will.”59[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn59]To attract modern audiences who might be more concerned with health and energythan with spiritual benefits, Yogananda emphasized the temporal benefits ofYogoda. Beginning with proper posture, Yogananda guided practitioners through aset of exercises to concentrate on muscles and then systematically tense andrelax them. Like a physician, he provided a prescription, a frequency, andexpected outcomes of Yogoda exercises: fifteen minutes of practice a day wouldlead to remarkable results. These brief routines appealed to busy working peoplewho might only have pockets of free time throughout the day. Yogananda seems tohave borrowed the exercises in large part from a nineteenth-century Danishphysical culturalist named J. P. Muller, who made a similar pitch about theability to practice these exercises in the midst of a hectic life in the modernworld.60 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn60] Satyeswarananda, often critical of Yogananda,saw the energization techniques as a concession designed to “inspire andmotivate his Western devotees who love exercises.”61 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn61]But the physical exercises were only the entrée to the more important goal ofGod-contact, which required a specific set of more rigorous meditationaltechniques. A small booklet that employed relatively little Sanskritterminology, Yogoda eschewed detailed discussion of metaphysics, cosmology, ortheology. It was essentially a teaser for those interested in more comprehensiveinstruction. Yogananda soon launched a yoga correspondence course, anelaboration of the Yogoda outline that delved more deeply into yoga proper. Overa ten-year period, the lessons developed into increasingly advanced techniques:1923: Yogoda or Muscle-Will System of Physical Perfection (three lessons)1924: Highest Technique of Concentration (two lessons)1925: Yogoda System of Physical, Mental and Spiritual Perfection—the first fivelessons from 1923 and 1924, and seven new lessons (twelve lessons)1926: Advanced Course on Practical Metaphysics (twelve lessons)1930: Super-Advanced Course Number 1 (twelve lessons) and The Art of SuperRealization (one lesson introducing Kriya, Maha Mudra, and Yoti Mudra)1934: Advanced Super Cosmic Science Course (six lessons) and New Super CosmicScience Course (seven lessons)62 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn62]As Yogananda revised the materials in the early 1930s, the correspondence coursegrew to include 182 lessons consisting of seven “Steps” of 26 lessons each. Each26-lesson Step ended with an “intermediate exam”; a successful exam scoreenabled the disciple to receive the next set of lessons. If lessons werecompleted at the prescribed “fortnightly” rate, the entire sequence would takeseven years, though some eager aspirants undoubtedly completed them morequickly.The course began with the Yogoda energization exercises, enhanced withadditional practices. Yogananda then introduced two additional stages,concentration and meditation. Reflecting a division in Patañjali’s Yoga Sūtrasbetween dhyāna and dhāraṇā, Yogananda distinguished between concentrationtechniques that taught disciplined focus on any subject and meditation proper,which allowed one to engage in single-minded contemplation of God. Instructionin practical techniques included improving memory, curing nervousness—whichincluded the suggestion to “avoid jazz and loud music for some time at least”and instead listen to violin music—and learning to heal oneself. Cross-promotionwas imbedded in Yogananda’s instruction. To deepen one’s skills, he recommendedbuying his writings, such as Songs of the Soul, Scientific Healing Affirmations,and articles in back issues of East-West.The original lessons began without much preamble, often ran no more than a pageand a half or two, and included syntax errors common to nonnative Englishspeakers. By the early 1930s, the format had become more elaborate. The lessonsfollowed a consistent sequence that Yogananda explained as “the ScientificTheory to a Technique, the concise Technique itself, invigorating healthrecipes, a highly enlightening Apologue for you and your family, a vibrantaffirmation, and an inspirational poem.”63 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn63] The lessonbegan with an inspirational poem, or an affirmation, and a prayer. The bulk ofthe lesson consisted of detailed instruction on one technique of concentrationor meditation, which included a philosophical introduction and practicalimplementation, often with sequential steps. The lesson concluded with an“apologue”—a fable or allegory that provided some moral truth about yoga—andanother affirmation.Despite Yogananda’s routine insistence on the importance of practical religion,his lessons contained more than techniques for concentration and meditation.Yoga practice made sense only within a larger cosmology, and he used the lessonsto provide this instruction. He taught that the universe is a vibration causedby the primordial sound “Om,” and meditating on this sound allows a practitionerto “develop Soul and Spiritual vibratory magnetism.”64 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn64]All material reality consists of five koshas, or sheaths, “stages of evolutionthrough which all matter has to pass in order to become spiritualized andemancipated.”65 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn65] Creation, while real, is also in aprofound sense māyā, or delusion, “which makes the Indivisible spirit seemfinite and divisible to all appearances. Matter has existence in the samedelusive way as the mirage in the desert.”66 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn66] Humanexperience is fundamentally shaped by the endless cycles of reincarnation thatresult from one’s karma, the “natural law of cause and effect and law ofaction.”67 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn67] Only the teachings of the ancient yogis canliberate humans from the limitations and confusions of human existence,providing both guidance for living successfully on earth—health, prosperity,work success, and happy relationships—and ultimate wisdom and spiritualliberation.After completing the first two Steps (the first fifty-two lessons), the devoteewas invited to apply for Kriya Yoga, “a special technique for quickening yourevolution.”68 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn68] But only the patient practitioner wasrewarded, persevering through one hundred additional lessons as the coursemeandered, ambled, and wandered through anecdotes and advice before finallyintroducing “the Higher Initiation” in Praeceptum 150 with the announcement that“Words are inadequate to express to you the Self-Realization-producing vitalityof this Kriya (Kree-ya) Instruction.”69 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn69] But thetechnique of “Kriya Proper” actually began another four lessons later inPraeceptum 154. And it was anticlimactic after all the buildup. First, in onepage of instruction, disciples were taught prāṇāyāma, how to move the breath andlife current through a hollow spinal canal from the coccyx to the SpiritualEye.70 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn70] The other two Kriya techniques, “Maha Mudra” and“Yoti Mudra,” were taught in Praeceptum 157. The former is a standard haṭha yogatechnique that adds specific leg positions to the prāṇāyāma described in KriyaProper, and the latter, Yogananda’s idiosyncratic label for yoni mudra, involvesusing the hands to seal the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose so that, as heexplained, “the Third Eye reveals God and Spirit.”71 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn71]Images [../figures/f0125-11.jpg]An early advertisement for Yogoda, the proprietary name for Yogananda’s yogacorrespondence course, which teaches “spiritualization of the body” by“literally” recharging the “body battery” to ensure everlasting youth. A numberof famous Yogoda students, many professional musicians, testify to its practicalresults. But beyond its physical health benefits, this course also offerscontrol over “spiritual destiny.”Despite the promise that initiates would learn proprietary techniquesreintroduced to Lahiri Mahasaya by special revelation after having disappearedmillennia ago, Yogananda’s yoga instruction basically reflected classical yogaas exposited in Patañjali’s Yoga Sūtras. Yogananda echoed Patañjali’s guidanceon breath control, concentration, meditation, and the repetition of mantras torealize that the true self must not be confused with the individual body. Healso included Tantra-inspired haṭha yoga elements, teaching, for example thatkuṇḍalinī was a “creative nerve force which flows through a coiled passage inthe coccyx.”72 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn72] “It takes very high development,” theinitiate was assured, “to see the ray-petaled lotus stars or chakras,” and thatbegan in the coccyx and continued upward to the “Spiritual Eye or ChristCenter.”73 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn73] Eventually, the practitioner could reachsamādhi at will, the state “in which the devotee, meditation, and God becomeone.”74 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn74] Yogananda obliquely acknowledged theavailability of similar teachings, commenting that “any Yoga book or Scripture,or the Christian Bible, can be bought for a few cents and intellectuallyswallowed.”75 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn75] Proper spiritual digestion, however,required the aid of a guru.If these techniques all replicated stock yoga instruction, what was remarkablewas the affectionate devotional language Yogananda used to present samādhi. Hislessons defined samādhi as “when the student becomes one with God,” and definedSelf-Realization, a common way of describing the outcome of samādhi, in terms ofdivine intimacy: “Self-Realization is the KNOWING, in all parts of the body,mind, and Soul, that we are now in possession of the Omnipresence of God; thatwe do not have to pray that it come to us; that we are not merely near It at alltimes, but that God’s Omnipresence is our Omnipresence; that He is just as mucha part of us now as He will ever be, and that all we have to do is to improveour KNOWING.”76 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn76] His language routinely encouraged adevotional understanding of divine reality. When he explained that “God loves todrink devotion from the secret wine-press of the devotee’s heart,” he soundedlike many a medieval bhakti poet.77 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn77] Yogananda’sthousands of references to God—buttressed by routine quotations from the Bible,whose God has traditionally been understood as emphatically transcendent—portraya personal deity with consciousness and volition. This is a God who thinks,creates, reveals himself, sends gurus, responds to prayer, gives direction,loves, and offers strength and energy. In turn, humans should love God, bedevoted to Him, and be intoxicated by Him. In Advaita nondualism, “devotion mustoccupy a lower position than pure knowledge,” and the advanced devotee abandonsnotions of a personal deity after achieving the realization of Brahman asultimately “devoid of qualities.”78 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn78] But thoughYogananda regularly used the language of absolute monism, he never abandoned hisaffection for depictions of a personal deity. In the very last correspondencelesson for his most advanced disciples, he was still counseling disciples to askGod, “May Thy love shine forever on the sanctuary of devotion, and may I be ableto awaken Thy love in Truth-thirsty hearts.”79 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn79]Though Yogananda’s theistic impulse stemmed from a number of sources, hisreading of yoga texts may have encouraged him to express a more theisticoutlook. Indic religion scholar Stuart Sarbacker argues that alongside thefamiliar “cessative” yoga tradition emphasizing the goal of kaivalya, or pureconsciousness, resides a second “numinous” strand that celebrates supernaturalpowers the devotee enjoys when through mastery of practice he or she “becomeslike a deity.”80 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn80] David Gordon White describeshistorical yoga as a “soteriological system that culminates in union or identitywith a supreme being.”81 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn81] Indologist Edwin Bryant arguesthat the Yoga Sūtras, often considered the foundational text for yoga practice,can only be understood in the “greater theistic landscape of Patañjali’s day.”Parts of his yoga system “requir[e] a theistic practice.” Significantly, it isprecisely in the section on “kriyā yoga”—the name Yogananda gave his ownpractice—that Patañjali’s theism is most direct and insistent. Kriyā yoga, inBryant’s translation, “consists of self-discipline, study, and dedication to theLord.” “Surrender to God,” Bryant concludes, “is a mandatory part of thispractice.”82 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn82] Andrew Nicholson argues that followingPatañjali, “belief in God was widespread” among authors of Saṃkhya, thephilosophical tradition closely associated with yoga, “throughout most of thehistory of Indian philosophy.”83 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn83] Whether such anapproach to reading yoga texts informed Yogananda’s understanding, his theistictendencies were deeply rooted.But it was the format of Yogananda’s yoga instruction that was most notable.Yoga by distance learning was a radical invention—and viable only in the contextof modern mass marketing and a vibrant consumer culture. Correspondence coursesfit with the United States’ spirit of self-improvement, its belief in equalityof opportunity, the growing importance of education in an industrializedsociety, and a pragmatic business model of efficiency and profit maximizing. Asthe consumer economy blossomed in the early twentieth century, correspondencecourses flourished.84 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn84] Although offerings includedcultural and liberal arts courses, 80 percent of correspondence courses providedtraining in technical, vocational, and business fields. Lack of accreditation oraccountability led to wildly varying levels of quality, but despiteshortcomings, distance learning offered a practical instrument for meetingdemonstrable educational needs.While practical courses predominated, many religious courses were alsoavailable. A religious reference book from the time explained the “great value”correspondence courses provided: an educational opportunity that was otherwiseunavailable, an incentive to study that an individual usually could not musteron his or her own, training by a specialist, and the suitability of a particularcourse to the individual’s needs. There was a biblical precedent for suchlearning: the text argued that the “first correspondence school was conducted bythe Apostle Paul, and his pupils included private individuals and wholechurches.” Moody Bible Institute, the premier turn-of-the-century fundamentalistBible school, began correspondence courses in 1901. And William Rainey Harper,often credited with launching university-based correspondence courses aspresident of the University of Chicago in 1891, began a course in biblicalHebrew that had expanded by the early twentieth century to more than thirtyadvanced courses in Hebrew, Greek, theology, and church history.85[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn85]Yogananda’s yoga course did have precedents in biblical instruction, but theclosest parallels were courses offered by two New Thought leaders. Born inBaltimore in 1862, William Walker Atkinson converted to New Thought after aphysical and mental breakdown in the 1880s. Thereafter, the sometime businessmanand lawyer moved to Chicago, a major center for the movement. By 1900, he beganediting a New Thought journal and, as Carl Jackson puts it, “churning out aseemingly endless series of volumes” under his own name and several pseudonyms,including Theron Q. Dumont, Swami Panchadasi, and Yogi Ramacharaka. In hisRamacharaka persona, he commented, “For anyone to write intelligently upon thesubject of Hindu Philosophy or Religion, it is necessary that he must be insympathy with the Hindu mind and soul—not necessarily a believer in theirreligions, or a follower of their philosophy, but most certainly possessed of amind in sympathy with the fundamental conceptions.”86 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn86]His knowledge of Hinduism and yoga was sufficient to deceive many in the NewThought movement, who remained convinced that Atkinson and Ramacharaka were twodifferent people.In late 1903, Ramacharaka began to offer lessons by correspondence coursethrough the Yogi Publication Society, endorsing himself in an anonymousthird-person advertisement as “a student and writer who is renowned for theprofundity of his thought, the clearness of his mental vision, the depth of hisspiritual knowledge and his remarkable simplicity and plainness of style.”Originally four monthly lessons, the series quickly grew to fourteen, eachproviding philosophical instruction, a topic for meditation, a mantra, and“Class Notes,” which provided an opportunity to connect subscribers to a largercommunity—and to advertise more books. Despite the “deep Indian influence on histhinking,” which fooled many colleagues in the New Thought movement, hisinstruction represented a synthesis of Theosophy and New Thought occultteachings on mesmerism, magnetism, auras, and ether.87 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn87]The lessons offered very little instruction in practical meditation techniques.Whether Yogananda knew of Ramacharaka’s courses is uncertain, but given theabundance of Ramacharaka’s writings it is certainly possible.Another predecessor to Yogananda’s correspondence course was created by fellowSouthern Californian Max Heindel. In 1910, he converted his twenty “RosicrucianChristian Lectures” into talks available by mail. The following year, as letterswere “coming in from students all over the world asking for a deeper and moreexplicit teaching on certain points of the Higher Life,” Heindel “decided thatin order to meet such a demand it would be necessary to start a CorrespondenceSchool.” So he abandoned the lecture circuit and established his internationalheadquarters in Oceanside, California, offering “the fruitage of true esotericresearch” through a series of nearly one hundred monthly lessons on topics thatincluded “Spiritual Research,” “Etheric Sight,” “The Dangers of ExcessiveBathing,” and “The Color Effects of Emotion in Assemblages of People.”88[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn88] The first service held in Mount Ecclesia’s newlydedicated temple took place on Christmas Day, 1920, at precisely the timeYogananda was beginning his ministry in Boston. Some of Yogananda’s earliestBoston followers had Rosicrucian connections, so it is possible that theysuggested the correspondence course model to Yogananda.If there were antecedents to Yogananda’s correspondence course, there would alsobe successors. In the 1930s, Los Angeles resident Ivah Bergh Whitten launchedwhat author Kurt Leland calls “an esoteric correspondence school with studygroups and privately published lessons” explicating an esoteric Westernelaboration of the cakra system.89 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn89] It is difficult todetermine whether Whitten’s instructional format was inspired by her Los Angelesneighbor Yogananda. In the 1950s Indian Swami Sivananda also used coursework,but only in response to his inability to keep up with actual correspondence fromdevotees and not as a primary strategy, as with Yogananda. Sivananda’sbiographer Sarah Strauss explains that the “ideal situation was for them tovisit the ashram at some point,” so “books, tapes, and photographs remain onlysupplements.”90 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn90]Yogananda’s correspondence course shared some broad similarities with his twopredecessors. The courses all taught metaphysical knowledge about unseen realms,spiritual truth, and health that their guides claimed revealed “true”Christianity. As esoteric knowledge, both proceeded though a sequence ofinstruction in which mastery of lower mysteries was a prerequisite for advancedunderstanding. And they had a similar fee structure; as autonomous ministriesoutside the framework of an existing church or other institution, theseself-published efforts relied on initiates’ donations, as the founders feltambivalent about charging for spiritual instruction. Ramacharaka emphasizeddisciples’ freedom to pay when they were able. “Do not trouble yourselves, dearstudents, about the small sum you owe us, and do not send us money which isreally needed for other purposes. But when the sum comes into your hand in anunexpected manner, in such a way that it seems to have been sent you for justthis purpose, then send it to us, and it will be used in paying the cost ofprinting and mailing these lessons. And don’t feel uneasy about theindebtedness, for we are not afraid to ‘trust’ those who feel hungry for thatwhich we have to offer.”91 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn91]Despite these similarities, one difference was crucial. Heindel’s andRamacharaka’s courses were designed largely to teach intellectual content, whichwas quite different from offering to mentor devotees in a complex sequence ofphysical, mental, and spiritual practices. This was an extremely novel approachwithin the Hindu tradition as well, a dramatic departure from the face-to-facemodel of transmission from guru to disciple that swamis consideredindispensable. Yogananda’s approach was extremely controversial among swamistrained by his mentor Sri Yukteswar. Decades after Yogananda established hisAmerican practice, his spiritual siblings continued to grouse that “the learningof any spiritual discipline through easily available materials, such as,lessons, books, literature, lectures, seminars, and through organizations, isnot the righteous way. Learning through these means could never solve the subtleproblems of the seeker.”92 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn92] Throughout the lessons,Yogananda continued to emphasize that advancement was possible only through hisguidance as “Guru-Preceptor.”93 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn93] But Yogananda’smentorship was at best virtual, not the flesh-and-blood presence he had receivedfrom his own guru. Yogananda showed flexibility in other matters that he deemedunessential to the core of yoga practice. He allowed practitioners to sit inchairs while meditating rather than sitting in the lotus position, cross-leggedon the ground. A fellow disciple in India called accommodation to Americansunused to sitting on the ground a “fundamental modification and deviation fromthe original” tradition, while another doubted that yoga could be “taughtproperly by letters and circulars.”94 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn94]Yogananda’s adaptability had several beneficial consequences. Distance-educationyoga allowed Yogananda to enroll a much larger number of followers than he couldever have trained personally, and thus also provided a steady source of income.The restriction of the lessons for “private and personal use only” also served anumber of purposes. “This pledge is necessary, to prevent misunderstanding andincorrect teaching of the Yogoda exercises.”95 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn95] Everylesson began with the reminder that it was “To be Confidentially Reserved forMEMBER’S USE ONLY.” This echoed the traditional stricture that disciples notreveal their guru’s training to anyone except their own future disciples. As onelesson warned, “Any violation will disturb the inner harmony of your Spirituallife due to casting Spiritual pearls before unappreciative eyes.”96[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn96] Pragmatically, secrecy affirmed the value of thelessons, creating a mystique about instruction that, as discussed above, wasoften available in some form from other sources. And secrecy protected animportant proprietary source of revenue.97 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn97]The lessons played a crucial role in Yogananda’s developing programmatic vision.Enrollment in the lessons essentially constituted membership in Yogoda Satsanga.As explained by a later disciple: “Yogananda saw the individual students firstreceiving the [Yogoda] lessons, and practicing Kriya Yoga in their own homes;then, in time, forming spiritual centers where they could meet once or twiceweekly for group study and meditation. In areas where there was enough interestto warrant it, he wanted … churches, perhaps with full- or part-timeministers.”98 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn98] Those who expressed interest in beginningthe course but did not follow through received aggressive follow-up messages.“Delay in taking up this valuable course of study … may lead to serious lossesin your all-round material and spiritual development and your life’s happiness.”They also received an offer of discounted prices on the lessons and free copiesof the magazine.99 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn99]After the Yogoda lessons, the bimonthly East-West magazine was Yogananda’s mostimportant published religious product. Launched at the end of 1925, themagazine’s terse hyphenated title elegantly captured both the distinctionbetween the two regions, the spiritual East and the technologically advanced,materialistic West, and the potential to build a bridge between them. East-Westwas “devoted to Spiritual Realization, Development of Body, Mind and Soul;Practical Metaphysics, and Hindu Psychology” and aimed “to inspire, toenlighten, and to encourage all to live the Practical Spiritual Life.”100[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn100] The magazine supplemented the yoga lessons byproviding instruction in Hinduism. It also gave readers a sense of personalconnection with their guru-from-a-distance, as Yogananda was executive editorand the magazine’s most prolific contributor. In providing regular news aboutYogoda centers nationwide, East-West fostered a sense that readers belonged to alarger spiritual community.From the beginning, the magazine signaled a commitment to ecumenicalspirituality by including contributions from a variety of religious traditions.Stories, images, poetic tributes, and texts by and about Buddha were prolific,including an early poem by Buddhist leader Dharmapala. Yogananda also featuredSufism, a popular, nondoctrinaire form of Islam prominent in parts of India,which shared bhakti’s devotional impulse. An early East-West issue included astory about Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism, a monotheistic northern Indianmovement with roots in devotional bhakti Hinduism and Sufism. Yogananda evenexpressed his concern for fellow performer-evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. Hedefended her after the press widely reported that her brief disappearance—whichshe claimed resulted from being kidnapped—stemmed from a romantic rendezvous inMexico. “If Mrs. McPherson has done no wrong, then what untold injustice andpersecution is being heaped upon her! And if she has committed any error thenthat error should be balanced against the great works she has done by inspiringthousands of people.”101 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn101] McPherson might have beenless than enthused by such a cautious defense, but Yogananda was more graciousto her than most Christian leaders.A closer look at Yogananda’s references to other religions reveals the limits ofhis ecumenical generosity. He essentially ignored his fellow Vedanta and yogateachers, whether authentic gurus from India such as Swami Paramananda andBhagwan Bissessar or American-born pretenders such as William Walker Atkinsonand Perry Baker, aka Pierre Bernard, dubbed “the Omnipotent Oom” by the era’spress.102 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn102] This was true even if Yogananda was teachingin the same city at the same time as the teachers, which suggests that he sawthem more as rivals than as fellow envoys of a common spiritual message.103[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn103] And his inclusivism extended beyond Christianity(addressed at length in the following chapter) to include various other groups.Yogananda likely developed elements of his teachings about mind, energy, andmagnetism from metaphysical traditions, and he showed some openness to prominentNew Thought figure Ralph Waldo Trine. He even invited Trine to be a specialguest of honor at the fourth anniversary celebration of Mount Washington in1929. But conclusions about Yogananda’s borrowing from New Thought are lessclear-cut than scholars sometimes assume.104 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn104] His overtinterest in New Thought never developed from a respectful cordiality into adeeper exchange of views. More often, he placed metaphysical traditions on thescale of his own universalistic Hinduism and found them wanting. He acknowledgedTheosophy’s contributions to the West’s understanding of reincarnation butcriticized its confused and misleading teaching. Theosophist CharlesLeadbetter’s 1927 introductory text, The Chakras, had offered a stern warningabout the dangers of arousing kuṇḍalinī prematurely: “I should like mostsolemnly to warn all students against making any effort whatever in thedirection of awakening these tremendous forces, except under such qualifiedtuition, for I have myself seen many cases of the terrible effects which followfrom ignorant and ill-advised meddling with these very serious matters.”105[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn105] Yogananda complained that Theosophical teaching hadmade American audiences unnecessarily anxious about the potential dangers ofkuṇḍalinī. Conceding that “our Theosophical brothers have done a great deal ofgood in the world,” he grumbled that some “thru their utter ignorance or verypartial knowledge of Sanskrit, have created much panic and wrong ideas in theminds of Westerners by giving the impression, through their entirely wrongtranslations of certain Sanskrit passages, that danger results from suchpractices as rousing of the kuṇḍalinī, meditation and other forms of innerdevelopment.” These ideas, which have “spread like wild-fire,” “mislead them andhamper their evolutionary progress.” Frightening people out of the path tosalvation was nothing less than a “spiritual crime.”106[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn106]A piece comparing Christian Science and Hinduism was equally critical. Yoganandabegan on a positive note, praising the “great triumphant power of ChristianScience over disease and distress.” He acknowledged that both traditions werebased on “the same universal truths” and claimed that the first edition of MaryBaker Eddy’s Science and Health included quotations from the Bhagavad Gītā,though he was quick to point out that Eddy’s doctrine “had been worked out bythe Hindus prior to the birth of Christian Science.” As with Theosophy, hedenounced wrongheaded Christian Science teaching. Christian Science unwiselyrejected medicine and fasting and attempted to heal the body through imaginationrather than will, “the great inner generator of energy.” Though the movement“intellectually grasped” the impermanence of the material world, it failed toperceive that this truth “cannot be realized until one has learned the consciousmethod of converting matter into conscious energy and conscious energy intoCosmic Consciousness.” In short, those who embraced the tenets of ChristianScience were “still under the delusion of the dream-world.”107[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn107] Yogananda’s approach toward other religions wasconsistent: he began with broad-minded commendation and ended with harshcritique. In a crowded religious market, he remained convinced of the superiorvalue of his own brand.One place this superior Hindu wisdom was most evident was in his teaching onmind, body, and spirit and the relation between them. Yogananda discussed thebody’s importance in the early pages of East-West. A column called “HealthHints,” which appeared in the magazine’s second issue, recommended pineapple,raisins, and carrots ground in a meat chopper (“good for teeth and bones”),mixed with pistachios and cream, and served on lettuce. The column alsosuggested that “business men and women” fast on Sunday to “eliminate unwelcomemeals” and clean their teeth after lunch—rinsing ten times is “what the Hindupundits prescribe.”108 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn108] Two issues later, a column onhealthy recipes began to evolve into a more coherent recommendation forself-improvement based on an integrated view of mind, body, and spirit. Entitled“Three Recipes,” the column offered helpful tips on “Spiritual,” “Intellectual,”and “Health” issues. By labeling all three sets of suggestions “recipes,”Yogananda conveyed a cozy domestic tenor while nodding to the burgeoning homeeconomics movement’s notion of applied science: if the reader followed the stepscarefully, the desired outcome was assured.109 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn109]In a magazine devoted primarily to religious issues, “Spiritual Recipes”represented the most conventional component of the “Three Recipes” column. Inthe first column, Yogananda offered this rather bland exhortation: “Try toconsciously contact God. Will to know Him, persevere in the effort to know Him,and be dissatisfied until you do know him.”110 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn110] Otherearly issues urged regular meditation, concentration and effort on the spiritualpath, finding times to pray whenever possible in the midst of a busy day, andthe value of meditation on Scripture like the Bhagavad Gītā. For reading, herecommended “only spiritual books which contain self-realization.”111[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn111] The staleness of the “Spiritual Recipes,” whichinitially seems counterintuitive, reflects Yogananda’s effort to avoiddetracting from the yoga lessons.“Intellectual Recipes” was also a half-baked feature, essentially amounting toshort book recommendations. Occasionally, he endorsed new spiritual works. BruceBarton’s The Man Nobody Knows earned his praise as “the best modern book onJesus.”112 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn112] Yogananda also praised contemporarydevotional books by Sister Nivedita, praising her reputation while remainingstrangely silent about the fact that her fame derived from being SwamiVivekananda’s disciple. His suggestions were often vague or redundant, and somemonths absent altogether. These defects likely reflect his own inability to keepup with reading new material amid an unrelenting work schedule. Hisrecommendations often returned to established texts like Shakespeare and Thomasà Kempis’s spiritual classic, Imitation of Christ. He also suggested readingtexts that were not explicitly spiritual, such as science books and magazines.More often, he simply commended “great books” because “books are your bestfriends.” Still, his regular exhortation to read broadly implied that deepeningone’s knowledge was an inherently spiritual task.For a short time, Yogananda inserted “Prosperity Recipes” into the column. Thistopic proved an awkward fourth guest at the “Three Recipes” table. Unlike theother components, which were all dimensions of the self, “prosperity” wasinstead a goal or attitude. Yogananda’s advice in this section consisted ofbromides such as these:The one who creates does not wait for opportunity, blaming the fates,circumstances and the gods. He seizes opportunities or creates them with themagic wand of his will, effort and searching discrimination.113[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn113]Never turn back. … Make up your mind you will succeed.114[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn114]Money-making is the next greatest art after the art of realizing God.115[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn115]This trite feature suggests the pressure Yogananda routinely felt to offerpractical hints to businesspeople and other middle-class professionals. Butoffering new tips in each issue apparently proved even more challenging for“Prosperity Recipes” than for “Intellectual Recipes,” and the column departed asabruptly as it had arrived.By far the longest and most consistent member of the “Three Recipes” concernedphysical well-being. Variously entitled “Health,” “Food,” and “Health and Food,”this topic preceded the formal launch of the “Three Recipes,” and lingered oninto the 1930s as the “Prosperity,” “Intellectual,” and even “Spiritual Recipes”trailed off. Topics in this category included a variety of tips on physicalhealth. The column cautioned against overeating and exhorted fasting regularlyto give “needed rest to the body-machine which overworks incessantly thruover-eating or wrong eating.” Chewing food thoroughly was necessary for properdigestion. In warning against alcohol, Yogananda matched the fervor ofcontemporary temperance advocates: “Awake! Young men and women! Fight the liquorhabit!”116 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn116]But physical health required more than proper food and drink. “Oversex” andgluttony were both dangers to avoid. Daily bathing “cleans the body pores andkeeps the sweat glands working properly, eliminating impurities.” This spiritualpractice was recommended by “the Hindu savants,” who taught that “the person whobathes daily and keeps the pores of his body open, helps his increased body heatto escape through these pores.”117 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn117] Adequate exercise,including routine walking, maintained health. And Yogananda repeatedlyrecommended bathing daily in the sunshine, “God’s Ocean of X-Ray,” which hadproven scientific benefits:Sunlight and ultra violet ray baths are also necessary to fill the tissues andpores with life-giving energy from without. They redden the hemoglobin of theblood, recharging it and making it richer and healthier. As an ordinary bathwashes away and clears the bacteria and dirt from the human body, so also theultra violet rays in the sunlight not only cleanse the body of bacteria but alsodestroy them. The ultra violet rays are the death rays which penetrate the homesof enemy bacteria hiding in the finger nails and body pores, and scorch themout.Yogananda acknowledged that a walk outdoors might not always be practical. Inthat case, “open your glass windows and let your life-giving, soliciting friend,Sunlight, fall on you and bathe you all over. Keep on jumping up and down, ifyou are afraid of catching cold, but each morning do bathe in the ocean of X-Raywhich God has created for you. Without a daily bath in God’s sea of X-Ray, youcannot be healthy. And remember, only healthy persons are happy.”118[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn118]Most of the column space in the “Food and Health Recipes” was given over toliteral recipes. Though the recipes ran the gamut from snacks to main courses,side dishes to desserts, they all reflected Yogananda’s commitment tovegetarianism. Ideas relied heavily on the use of fruit, nuts, and a surprisingfondness for Thousand Island dressing, a relatively new condiment at the time. Anumber of recipes offered meat substitutes, including curd curry, nut steak,mock lamb, and vegetable hamburger. Yogananda also emphasized the value of wholeraw foods, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. He warned about the dangersof white flour and advocated consuming brown rice (“the Father of all Cereals”),green-leaf vegetables, and almond milk. Occasionally, he attempted to glorifybasic recipes with spiritual-sounding names—Swami Salad and Swami Pudding,Yogoda Curry Sauce and Yogoda Strawberry Ice Cream, and Hermitage Avocado. Apartfrom their health benefits, several of Yogananda’s recipes served a culturalpurpose, introducing South Asian foods like “Hindu curry” to a white Americanaudience largely unfamiliar with such delicacies.As often happened, Yogananda eventually found a way to commodify his instructionabout a healthful diet. He developed a small line of vegetarian health foodsthat could be purchased from his Mount Washington headquarters in SouthernCalifornia and shipped across the country. Advertisements for these productsbegan to appear in East-West in 1934—sometimes immediately adjacent to the“Health Recipes”—and continued in some fashion for the next half dozen years.Beginning a new product line during the Great Depression is a surprisingstrategy. This timing may reflect a desperation born of the organization’s direfinancial straits, as well as an effort to capitalize on families’ need toeconomize at a time when meat was often the meal’s central and most expensiveportion. The six-year duration of the product line suggests that it met withsome success. The timing of its departure—the end of the Depression with theonset of America’s role as “the arsenal of democracy”—reinforces the contentionthat product appeal was tied to tightened Depression era food budgets.In touting these products, Yogananda characteristically reinforced the linkbetween mind, body, and spirit. He employed medical-sounding language to explaintheir physical and mental effects and sprinkled in a few spiritual words aswell. “This food is good,” proclaimed one ad, “not only from the chemicalstandpoint, but from the intuitive standpoint as well.” “Intuitive analysis”conducted by “India’s Masters,” “finds the effect of food on the constitution ofthe cells, and on the entire Spiritual life, which chemical analysis revealsonly superficial results of food on the human system. This intuitive food buildsbrain, muscle, and mind. It is also a Soul Food. It will help to invigorate thebody, make youth lasting, increase the beauty of body and skin, and create aserene mind and temper.”119 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn119] Clearly, it was difficultto overestimate the value of these products.Self-Realization Fellowship’s first food product and the one that enjoyed thegreatest longevity was a mysterious one. Nutritive nuggets were “pleasant andnourishing” for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The ingredients were neverdisclosed, but because nutritive nuggets were rich in oil, they benefited “thedigestive tract, liver, and gall bladder.” And “although mildly laxative,” adsreassured readers, they “are not habit-forming.” And for good measure, “childrenlove them.”120 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn120]“India nut steak,” another popular long-term product, was “undoubtedly the mostperfect meat substitute ever offered to the public,” an ideal product for“spiritually minded people.” “Just as nourishing as a large steak, but … freefrom meat poisons,” nut steak allowed vegetarians to “have the same enjoyment asthey would eating steak.” In fact, it was “more delicious that real meat loaf.”Because nut steak was made from “choice, carefully selected nuts,” it contained“the high nutritional value found in such great abundance in nuts.” Prepared“under the most exacting conditions, in clean, spotless kitchens,” nut steak was“unsurpassed in purity.” Why not “order a few cans and surprise the family”?After all, nut steak “will be enjoyed by the entire family,” and was “especiallygood for growing boys and girls, as it gives them the proper nourishment soessential to growth in childhood.”121 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn121]A few other products were offered from time to time, but with much less fanfare.Many were advertised as both tasty and beneficial, like the “delightfullydifferent” cactus candy, which possessed “a medicinal and spiritual value.”122[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn122] Yogananda often described the health virtues of hisproducts using scientific terminology. Organic, mint-flavored alfalfa tea, forexample, was “recommended by authorities everywhere on account of its highalkalinity, vitamins, and rich organic content.” It was made from “young alfalfaleaves only harvested at bud to insure maximum chlorophyll content andaromatized with the lasting fragrance of orange blossoms and mint.” Since onlythe moisture was removed, “maximum food values” were maintained. The tea was“produced from seeds and packaged under scientifically controlled” conditions.But not every product received a rousing endorsement for its scientificallyverifiable health benefits. Some products were attractive because they tastedgood. Though “nutritious and healthful” honey-dipped Mount Washington prunesshould be consumed for “your health’s sake,” their primary benefit seemed to betheir “delightful flavor.”123 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn123]Yogananda’s dietary advice and food products point to the role a vegetarian dietplayed in his form of Hinduism. Though the majority of Hindus are notvegetarian, vegetarianism has been an important tradition among some castes andreligious traditions for millennia. For devotees of yoga, the clearest directivecomes from the yamas in Patañjali’s Yoga Sūtras. The first of Patañjali’s eight“limbs,” the yamas are “great vows” that constrain the ethical behavior of ayogi aspirant. Ahimsa—or nonharm—is especially weighty, as it is the first yama,and traditional exegesis grants extra interpretive authority to introductorystatements. Nonharm to other living things has often been understood to includenot killing animals for food. More than an ethical imperative, this restrictionsafeguards the purity of the yogi’s body. In the Saṃkhya philosophy undergirdingyoga practice, the balance between the three guṇas that constitute all mattershould be tipped against rajasic foods that make one both physically andspiritually dull. Consumption of pollutants—coffee, tea, alcohol, and especiallymeat—should be avoided altogether.124 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn124] Thus,Yogananda’s recommendations for healthy food extended beyond a practical concernfor health, physical comfort, and happiness. The body was ultimately a divinelyordained spiritual vessel. “Remember,” he counseled, “that this bodily machineryhas been given to you to enable you to accomplish certain works on this materialplane, and that you should guard it and take care of it as your most preciouspossession.”125 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn125] In his attention to the body’sindispensable spiritual function, Yogananda underscored the crucial integrationbetween spirit and matter.Yogananda was not alone as a spiritual teacher touting the benefits ofvegetarianism in early twentieth-century America. Some Protestant movements hadbegun to devote more attention to the body and its spiritual role around theturn of the century. Muscular Christianity focused on physical strength andmasculinity.126 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn126] Pentecostals embraced physical healingas central to promise of the gospel. In fact, divine healing was one of the coretenets of Aimee Semple McPherson’s Foursquare Gospel.127[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn127] And as the title of Mary Baker Eddy’s essential work,Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, indicates, Christian Scientistswere deeply concerned about the relation between health, body, and spirituality.And though vegetarianism had been comparatively rare in American Christianity, avegetarian thread running along the edge of the Protestant tradition had formeda more pronounced pattern by 1900. Seventh-Day Adventists embraced diet reformerSylvester Graham’s aversion to stimulants such as coffee, tea, alcohol, andtobacco; after visions from God, cofounder Ellen White began encouragingfollowers to avoid meat as well. John Kellogg’s Adventist-inspired water curesanitarium in Battle Creek, Michigan, represented the culmination ofnineteenth-century Christian vegetarianism. Kellogg’s experiments with flakedcereals stemmed from a desire to find a “satisfactory substitute” for breakfaststhat “had been built and around meats,” since “to most people a meal withoutmeat as its center was unthinkable.”128 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn128] Outside of theChristian tradition, the Vegetarian Society of America was founded in 1886.129[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn129] Consequently, by the time Yogananda began his series,vegetarianism had become a hot topic in the United States. Beginning around theturn of the century, periodicals including Good Housekeeping, American LiteraryDigest, Harper’s Bazaar, the New York Times, and many other large-circulationpublications began to run articles on vegetarianism.130[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn130] Yogananda’s attention to the integration of mind,body, and spirit—particularly his affirmation of physical health’s spiritualvalue—offered a compelling vision based in ancient yoga wisdom but attuned tothe concerns of modern Americans.Apart from mail-order health foods, the magazine offered a variety of objectsfor sale. Mount Washington sold mounted photographs of Yogananda, which helpeddisciples maintain connection with their guru from a distance and create a senseof sacred space within their homes. Leather binders, stamped “EAST-WEST” in goldon the cover, allowed readers to preserve magazines. Though of clearly lowerstatus than the yoga lessons, the magazines were repositories of wisdom worthpreserving and consulting in the future. Other items were of more symbolicvalue. “Gold-plated, in orange and blue enamel,” Yogoda pins and lapel buttons“proclaim to the world your adherence to Yogoda principles” while deepeningtheir wearers’ sense of identity with the organization at the same time.Christmas proved an especially fruitful opportunity for sales: Whispers fromEternity, “his first new book in years,” was available in cloth binding“exquisitely gotten up”; a “special Christmas offer” of “a set of Swami’s 6books,” and “beautiful Christmas greeting cards with Yogoda sentiments anddesigns” could be purchased “at the various Yogoda centers throughout thecountry.” And no list of products was complete without the correspondencecourse.131 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn131] Taking a cue from the widespread sales ofChristian trinkets—from candles and decorative Bibles to rosary beads andartwork—Yogananda used material goods to deepen his followers’ daily connectionto their spiritual leader.East-West supported the ministry financially in other ways as well. It soldadvertising space to third parties, mostly promoting books on healthy diets andthe occult. Key sections of the magazine also served as advertorials for Yogoda,where practical information was wholly entangled with boosterist reports oflarge audiences, impressive venues, and new converts. Yogoda advertisements andnews updates frequently profiled professionals—business people, artists, andperformers—whose occupations made them especially concerned about physicalhealth and energy. Yogananda coveted the testimony of such upwardly mobileindividuals for the prestige they brought to his organization and work. He alsotook a page from the playbook of Protestant churches that followed thebusiness-savvy ethos of a consumer age in their approach to finance. Ashistorian of American religion James Hudnut-Beumler indicates, “Ritualizing adefinite pledge for the coming year was becoming increasingly prevalent inProtestant churches that were embracing business methods such as annualbudgeting, accounting for gift receipts to donors quarterly, and urging weeklygifts on the analogy of an installment plan of credit.”132[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn132] Yogananda emulated this model well:MONTHLY DONATION PLEDGES. We hope that every Yogoda student will see his wayclear to donate a regular monthly sum to the upkeep of the Mount WashingtonEducational Center, so that its energies may be free to devote to educationalactivities of a world-wide nature. We want to feel that every Yogoda student istaking an active interest in our work, and is willing to do his share inmaintaining it and helping to spread its message of peace and a fullerunderstanding of life.133 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn133]Finally, East-West functioned as a commercial product itself. Currentsubscribers were urged to renew their subscriptions, and casual readers wereroutinely encouraged to subscribe so that they could reread important articles.Magazine subscriptions provided consistent, reliable revenue for the ministry.Yogananda even got swept up momentarily in the fervor for corporations thattypified the era. He made plans to form the Yogoda Publishing Company to sellall of his texts and gave SRF members exclusive right to his initial stockoffering. But his timing—five months before the Black Tuesday stock market crashof 1929—proved inauspicious.134 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn134]WEATHERING THE RISKS OF THE SPIRITUAL MARKETPLACEAll of these efforts to find predictable streams of revenue reflected thereality that religious markets could be as risky as traditional consumermarkets. Competition creates opportunities, but it also creates uncertainty.Ventures into new regional markets can be flops, negative publicity can damagethe brand, and economic downturns can harm religious organizations as much ascorporations. The first decade at Mount Washington brought great successes, aswell as some serious difficulties.As Yogananda’s movement spread across the country, so did his fame. In 1927,Yogananda was President Calvin Coolidge’s guest at the White House. Whilelecturing in D.C., Yogananda had offered advice on the president’s diet in theWashington Post, including suggestions for “meatless Mondays,” a ban on drinkingice water, and a regimen of fasting, exercise, and meditation.135[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn135] Though a Post columnist pronounced that “as adietitian Swami Yogananda doesn’t know beans,” Coolidge was more impressed withthe swami and his novel vegetarian recipes.136 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn136]Brokering a meeting through British ambassador Sir John Balfour, Coolidgeinvited a Hindu to the White House for the first time. The two met for a fewminutes, as Yogananda informed the president that it was only “spiritualunderstanding between all nations that can bring lasting peace.” Eveninternational disarmament, he said, likely referring to the 1922 WashingtonNaval Treaty, would make no difference, “for the people still would fight iftheir weapons were but stones.” The president agreed with Yogananda’s sentimentand the brief meeting was over, since Coolidge declined to pose for a photo.137[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn137] However lackluster, Yogananda played up this privatemeeting with the president as a sign that his renown was catching up with hisspiritual stature.138 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn138]His growing fame was also evident in coverage in surveys of contemporaryAmerican religion. Charles Ferguson devoted a few pages to the “ineffable” swamiwho sold “Hindu philosophy to Americans by American methods and upon the basisof Yankee desire and ambition.”139 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn139] Much morethorough—and generally positive—was the profile offered in Wendell Thomas’s 1930book Hinduism Invades America.140 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn140] Despite its alarmisttitle, Thomas claimed to strive for neutrality, as he explained in the foreword.“This work is not an attack on Hinduism. It is not meant to inflame Americancitizens by pointing to a foreign menace. Nor is it a defense of Hinduism. Noris it a defense of Christianity or anything else. It is simply a study of theamazing adventure of an Eastern faith in a Western land.” He included “Hindufriends” in his acknowledgments.141 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn141] After historicalchapters devoted to Vedanta, Ramakrishna, and Vivekananda, Thomas turned tocontemporary American movements. The Vedanta Society and Yogoda Sat-Sanga werethe only two organizations to which he devoted individual chapters; he lumpedindividual speakers, smaller movements, and hybrid groups like Theosophy intoone chapter. Thomas devoted more than forty pages to Yogananda’s biography, asynopsis of his writings and teachings, and a profile of members based on fiftysurveys. He exaggerated the yoga evangelist’s willingness to adapt the contentof his message to his audience’s interests, and he erroneously attributedYogananda’s emphasis on “healing” to the influence of Christian Science and NewThought. He also raised philosophical objections to the conception of Bliss. Butall in all, though probing, Thomas was hardly hostile. He generally viewedYogananda, not as a charlatan, but as a fundamentally sincere leader. Thomasreported a membership of “twenty-five thousand Yogodans scattered over theUnited States in groups and as individuals.” This number, which may have beensupplied by the organization itself, suggests a vibrant, if modest, nationalmovement.142 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn142]Even as astute an observer as Thomas viewed the ministry as a one-man show,which is not a surprise, given how hard Yogananda worked to cultivate hispersona as a wise, omnicompetent spiritual leader. In reality, he could notmanage the ministry workload on his own. He tapped three gifted friends fromIndia to be his associates. Basu Kumar Bagchi was Yogananda’s colleague fromRanchi who was initiated into the swami order in Ranchi, taking the title SwamiDhirananda. Yogananda eventually invited Dhirananda to join him in the UnitedStates, confessing that although he was good at publicity and attractingfollowers, “I cannot manage things properly and I cannot writesystematically.”143 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn143] Dhirananda accepted the call andcame to Boston in 1922. In 1925, Yogananda appointed him head of the MountWashington Educational Center, overseeing operations there while Yoganandatraveled.In 1928, Yogananda sent for Brahmachari Jotin, a friend of the Ghosh family whomYogananda had ordained before he left India in 1920. On his way to the trainstation, Jotin visited Yogananda’s father, to offer his “reverential salutationat his hallowed feet.” Bhagabati blessed him, saying, “Jotin, now go to Americaand spread my Guru’s (Lahiri’s) message.” Jotin “promised him with my soul thatI would do my very best to fulfill his wish.”144 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn144] Jotintook over the challenging task of running the Washington, D.C., center, locatedin a poor section of the city, an assignment that caused him physical andemotional suffering. He persevered with the thought that one day India would bean independent nation, and his ministry in the nation’s capital—indeed, theworld’s capital—would uniquely position him to offer the world “something of thebest, the highest and the noblest that India has to offer.”145[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn145]Nirod R. Choudhuri, who came to be known as Brahmachari Nerode, was a youngBengali whose family was friendly with both Mohandas Gandhi and RabindranathTagore. He graduated from the University of Calcutta with a degree in Sanskritand traveled throughout India, Burma, and China before coming to the UnitedStates to attend graduate school at Harvard University. In 1927, Yoganandaappointed him to take charge of the Detroit Yogoda Center.146[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn146]These bright, knowledgeable friends contributed to Yogananda’s success insignificant ways. Dhirananda helped edit Science of Religion and was listed onthe title page as its “publisher.” Yogananda’s friend Satyananda, who remainedin India, was also “able to help somewhat in the publication of the book.”147[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn147] In a brief preface, Yogananda offered his thanks toDhirananda, Satyananda, and others “for the help I received from them in variousways.”148 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn148] Satyeswarananda claims that Dhirananda wassubstantially responsible for rewriting and editing the revised edition of TheScience of Religion in Boston as well.149 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn149] Dhiranandabecame indispensable in preparing Yogananda’s course materials and books,beginning with the first Yogoda correspondence course booklet. The Yogoda titlepage credits the techniques to “SWAMI YOGANANDA, A.B. OF INDIA.” In much smallerfont, after a list of Yogananda’s titles, the title page lists “SwamiDhirananda, M.A., Associate.” In later editions, after a falling out betweenDhirananda and Yogananda, Dhirananda’s name was dropped from the title page andreplaced with “Brahmachari Nerode, A.B., Honorary Associate.”An advanced yoga teacher, Nerode also provided substantial support toYogananda’s work. However, Yogananda and Nerode later also had a falling out.Both Dhirananda and Nerode published works—most, though not all, after breakingwith Yogananda—on topics such as the Bhagavad Gītā, Patañjali’s Yoga Sūtras, theunity of world religions, symbolism in religious texts, and “divine powerscience” that bear a strong resemblance to Yogananda’s publications. Nerode’sson, Anil Nerode, says that the teachings of his father and Dhirananda representthe “genesis of the Kriya Movement in America,” as “each played an essentialrole in the development of Kriya.”150 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn150] It is difficultto determine the scope and form of Dhirananda’s and Nerode’s contributions toYogananda’s teaching and writing. Yogananda’s general pattern with hispublications, Satyeswarananda argues, was “to make the first rough draft of themanuscript,” and “the rest would be taken care of by his trusted editors.”151[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn151] In any case, it is clear that Yogananda was not thesole, undisputed authority of Kriya Yoga he sought to project.Even with the support of gifted colleagues, Yogananda faced a number of dauntingchallenges. The first was the harsh stereotypes about India, Indians, andHinduism that implicitly impugned his ministry’s integrity. Yogananda went togreat lengths to defend India, its people, and its spiritual traditions througharticles in East-West. At times, he endorsed Indian political nationalism.Gandhi was a favorite magazine subject, and Yogananda’s adulatory articles oftencompared him to Jesus. “Gandhi! Politically crucified, Thou art not only thesaviour of a race, of India, but also of all the selfish, hatred-stricken racesof the world.” But this Jesus promised not spiritual but political salvation.“Gandhi! Thy saintliness, and the fragrance of the unfading flower of Thydetermination, will charm the menacing fire of cannon, until they sing insteadthe Freedom of India through Peace.”152 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn152] The magazinealso expressed support for Indian self-rule with a tribute to Sarojini Naidu,president of the Indian National Congress, calling her an “eminent daughter ofIndia” and urging Yogodans to hear her speak during an upcoming U.S. visit.153[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn153]Yogananda, a British subject by virtue of his Indian birth, came to theattention of British officials from Los Angeles to New York, San Francisco toWashington, D.C. British officials were concerned about radical politicalactivities, having already concluded that “the majority of the Indian lecturersnow in the United States would seem to be of doubtful tendencies.”154[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn154] In several cases, they secretly tracked and reportedon Yogananda’s activities. Yogananda’s May 1926 passport renewal requestreceived extra scrutiny, even though he had not “openly preached anyrevolutionary doctrines, his notoriety being mainly due to the way in which heobtains money from audiences attracted by his mysticism.155[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn155] The British ambassador sent underlings to attendYogananda’s talks in New York and Washington, who determined that “it did notappear that he touched upon any political subjects,”156[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn156] but instead “the usual type of psychologicalplatitudes that emanate from the Hindu apostles of new religious who derivelucrative incomes by imposing upon certain elements of the American public.”157[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn157]British officials may not have accurately captured Yogananda’s message, but itis true that he was not fundamentally political. Indian cultural nationalism wasmore germane to his organizational concerns. Displays of the richness of Indianprovided incontrovertible evidence that India was a great civilization, alogical prerequisite to Americans’ acceptance of Indian beliefs and theirmessenger. East-West articles about Indian pageants, folk tales, dance, and thesacred nature of Indian music complemented frequent discussions of sacred Indiantexts. When the 1932 summer Olympics were held in Los Angeles, the MountWashington Educational Center hosted a celebration for the Indiancompetitors.158 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn158] Yogananda often expressed his love forIndia in verse. “My Native Land,” for example, celebrates the natural landscape,the “inviting shades of banian [sic] tree” and “the holy Ganges flowing by,”before turning to its spiritual gift: India taught him “first to love … the Godabove.” He concluded with the maternal personification familiar to Indiannationalists: “I bow to thee, my native land / The Mother of my love sogrand.”159 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn159]Defense of Indian culture became pressing after publication of Katherine Mayo’sMother India in 1927, a scathing indictment of India’s animal sacrifices, genderrelations, sexual practices, and hygiene.160 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn160] Designedfor a popular audience, published by a reputable press, and filled withsuperficially plausible documentary evidence, the book clearly presented anexistential challenge to Indian civilization—and to anyone whose ministry hingedon the legitimacy of that heritage. A number of Indians and Indophiles took upthe gauntlet. The editor of the Indian Social Reformer, K. Natarajan, offered apoint-by-point rebuttal of Mayo by challenging her evidentiary base(particularly her use of a century-old French Christian source), critiquing thedistortions she produced through selective citing of the worst examples, andpointing out the ongoing efforts of reformers such as his own organization toroot out Indian social evils.161 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn161] Journalist C. S.Ranga Iyer concentrated on Mayo’s charges of sexual misbehavior and turned thetables by systematically highlighting the sexual depravity of Americansociety.162 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn162] Englishman Ernest Wood, former principalof Sind National College in Hyderabad, offered a defense of Indian culture evenlonger than Mayo’s original.163 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn163]East-West joined this chorus of rebuttals in early 1928. One article explainedhow Mayo’s book had unleashed an Indian backlash against Americans, warningabout harm to the delicate relations between East and West. The magazineincluded a reprint of a reply by one Professor Cornelius, former professor ofphilosophy at Lucknow, who said that criticisms were welcome as long as theywere fair but that Mayo “packs her book full of half-truths and no-truths. Sheoverstates, suppresses, misinterprets facts and distorts evidence to support herprejudices; she uncompromisingly condemns the moral and religious life of awhole people.”164 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn164] East-West provided evidence thatIndia’s rich spiritual character had long influenced American culture. ArthurChristy contributed an article based on his doctoral dissertation demonstratingthat Ralph Waldo Emerson borrowed from the Hindu scriptures, particularly in his“Song of the Soul (Brahma)” and in the notion of the Over-Soul. Moreprovocatively, he argued that the quintessentially American ideal ofSelf-Reliance derived, at least in part, from Indian sources.165[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn165] East-West also published an on-the-nose rebuttal thatdisplayed more sympathy than skill:Oh India! Country of Divine discontent,Grieve thou not, at the cruel commentIn a recent book;Having eyes the author seeth not at all.Having ears she heareth not the callOf thy soul. She’s swayed by things external,As most of us are.She hitched not her vehicle to a star—She loveth “brass tacks.”She heweth down here and scattereth thereShe forgetteth her anscestors [sic] bowed in prayerFor the truths which she lacks.166 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn166]Vicious anti-Indian and anti-Hindu stereotypes were sometimes aimed directly atYogananda and his ministry. An anticult hysteria reached a peak in the 1920s,with fears that secretive groups, particularly those led by mediums, andesoteric groups like Theosophy engaged in deceptive practices that lured peopleinto sexual misdeeds and eventual insanity.167 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn167] Echoingprevious warnings about inappropriate domestic intimacy between swarthy swamisand delicate white women, in January 1928 the Los Angeles district attorney’soffice investigated accusations that Mount Washington was maintaining a“love-cult” “under the cloak of the Vedantic religion of India.”168[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn168] The investigation was driven by a review ofYogananda’s “various books and pamphlets in which an unusual philosophy of loveand sex control” were expounded. The British consul in Los Angeles was alertedto the controversy by a visit from Dhirananda, who was anxious about immigrationofficials’ efforts to expel him and Yogananda as a result of the rumors. Theconsul privately concluded that since no woman came forward, that “probablyconfirms the suggestion already made that the sole basis for the accusationconsists of vague unfounded statements.”169 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn169]Investigators reached the same conclusion, and the inquiry fizzled. In anothercase that came to the consul’s attention, a married couple who worked at MountWashington for a time—the wife as a secretary who saw a lot of Yogananda’scorrespondence—quit when they concluded that Yogananda was “a swindler” whomisled women. They did not know what he did with his money, but they wereconcerned enough to bring the matter to the British consulate in Los Angeles.170[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn170]The month following the Mount Washington investigation, a similar accusation washurled at Yogananda during one of his few trips to the American South. In Miami,outraged husbands threatened to lynch Yogananda when they heard aboutinstruction taking place inside women’s homes without men present. Breathlessnewspaper accounts included salacious reports: “The Hindu, it was alleged byindignant husbands, charged $35 a head for approximately 200 Women to hear hisprivate lectures entitled ‘Sex Consciousness.’ He said the money was going to beused to start a love cult school over which he would preside.”171[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn171] City Manager Welton A. Snow and Chief of Police LeslieQuigg approached the British vice consul in Miami for advice on how to handlethe situation without stirring up trouble unnecessarily. Presenting themselvesas voices of moderation, they insisted that although they recognized thatYogananda was “an educated man,” given the “strong public commitment against acoloured person acting in the capacity of teacher to white women,” he was “ingreat danger of suffering bodily harm from the populace” if he insisted onlecturing.172 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn172] Snow issued an injunction preventingYogananda from speaking, while Quigg pressured the yogi to leave the city “forhis own good.”173 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn173] Police wielding tear gas surroundedthe hall where Yogananda had been slated to speak to quell the anger thatremained even after his lecture had been canceled.174 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn174]Despite routine brushes with American prejudice, Yogananda underestimated theSouth’s deep racial divide and penchant for mob violence. The British viceconsul paid Yogananda a visit, explaining that “his colour, while not negro, wassuch as might cause high feeling in the community,” and urged him not to tryspeaking again. Yogananda agreed not to lecture further but refused to leavewithout fighting the injunction to clear his name.175 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn175]In court, witnesses against Yogananda claimed that two followers had gone insanefrom his teaching, one of whom was at that moment in an asylum refusing to eatuntil reassured that Yogananda had “contacted” her food.176[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn176] The flood of outrage that ensued drowned outYogananda’s defense.177 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn177] He claimed that the mentallyill woman had suffered from her condition for twenty years, that he had receivedher husband’s permission to treat her, and that the husband was not angry withhim. Former U.S. district attorney James McLachlan in L.A. testified by telegramthat he had known Yogananda well for four years and found him one of thegodliest men he had ever met.178 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn178] This testimony—absentfrom many press reports of the case—failed to persuade the Miami circuit to liftthe injunction.Because wire news stories were syndicated, Yogananda’s ouster from Florida wasrecounted in papers across the nation, often preserving intact the presumptionof guilt offered by southern reporters who covered the story directly. Thefollowing year, a book on American religious cults made two gleeful referencesto Yogananda’s ignominious treatment in Miami.179 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn179]Yogananda had a few defenders. One man wrote a lengthy letter to the editor ofthe Washington Post describing his experiences with the Yogoda center in D.C.and attempting to clarify misunderstandings about Yogananda’s teachings.180[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn180] In another letter, a woman echoed this sentiment withher own positive story about her experiences with Yogananda.181[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn181] But these few voices could not be heard over the dinof denunciation.Clearly shaken by the incident, Yogananda wrote in East-West about the press’sability to destroy a person’s reputation through slanderous accusations. Whilegranting the importance of ethical reportage, he excoriated “yellow journalism”for catering “to a depraved public taste that lacks sufficient moral andintellectual background to enable it to detect truth from falsehood;” its “onlyaim was sensationalism and ‘thrills.’”182 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn182] To avoidgiving the accusations raised against him more notoriety, he only alludedobliquely to the specific situation that prompted his article. The magazine alsonoted when, a few months later, Quigg was charged with first-degree murder forthe death of a black prisoner in his custody. Without mentioning the incidentwith Yogananda, the article explained how Quigg was known “throughout Americathru his race and color prejudice against non-whites and his high-handed methodsof dealing with them.” It might have seemed that his crimes would go unpunished.“However, the day of reckoning comes in its own good time.”183[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn183]Yogananda also attracted, whether from duplicity or naïveté, a number oflawsuits that militated against his efforts to craft an impressive persona. Thefirst occurred in 1925, within months of establishing his Mount Washingtonheadquarters. Emma S. Mitchell sued Yogananda for the return of a piece ofproperty in Mar Vista, an upscale L.A. neighborhood near the coast, estimated tobe worth thirteen thousand dollars. She claimed that she had donated the land tohis organization on the understanding that he would be opening a school forchildren. Feeling deceived that the land was not to be used for this purpose,she wanted it back. Yogananda addressed the charges head on, both through hisattorney and in person after one of his talks at the Philharmonic Auditorium. Hetold the audience that he possessed title to the property free and clear andthat he had never deceived anyone. Still, he magnanimously offered to return theproperty. In an aside, he lamented that he understood how Jesus felt beingpersecuted, offering an early glimpse of his penchant for seeing himself as alatter-day Christ. The case was shortly settled out of court. In the meantime,Walter Carr, a local immigration official, promised to look into Yogananda’simmigration status. This question had no direct bearing on the case, whichsuggests a presumption of Yogananda’s guilt and a desire to rid the city of astereotypical Hindu fraud.184 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn184]About the same time, Yogananda’s partner Mohammad Rashid, who had mastermindedhis successful advertising campaign, sued for 25 percent of the “net proceeds ofall lectures, fees, contributions or other monies received” by Yogananda. Rashidobtained a writ of attachment on two of Yogananda’s bank accounts, effectivelyfreezing the funds. The two ultimately settled out of court, and the controversystayed out of the press.185 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn185]The lawsuit that most threatened Yogananda’s image and the organization’sfinances was filed by his longtime friend and associate Swami Dhirananda. InApril 1929, Dhirananda suddenly traveled from Los Angeles to New York to meetYogananda on tour. The two, who had clashed as far back as their Dihika ashramdays, had a heated exchange.186 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn186] Yogananda signed apromissory note for the sizable sum of eight thousand dollars, to be paid inmonthly installments, for Dhirananda’s seven years of unpaid service to theorganization. Returning to Mount Washington, Dhirananda unceremoniously packedhis bags and departed, leaving the national headquarters rudderless.187[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn187]Yogananda was so depressed by the bitter rupture with his longtime friend thathe departed for Mexico in late May to recover. The day he sailed from New York,he wrote to Minott Lewis, “With a heavy heart I am starting for Mexico. When thesword of so many responsibilities hangs on my head, Dear Doctor we must fightthe battle to the end. … We all have to bear our crosses, the few who love tolive for God and God’s work.” Lewis’s cross continued to be financing theministry. “I would never have taxed you further,” Yogananda continued, “if Goddid not already respond. Without your cooperation we will be soon in the sametrial we were before. So please do not fail God at this hour. It may be veryhard but please do it. Without your help great danger is in sight. We will fightour way to freedom.”188 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn188]In Mexico, Yogananda was able to lay down his own cross for a time. Guadalajaraespecially captivated him.From the balcony, I gazed westward. On wings of fancy I was carried far. I stoodon the shores of the horizon. To the left and right were two mountain rangeswhich turned mystic violet. When I looked again some fairy hand had alreadydressed them in intense blue. Behind me lay the twilight-bathed man-made mysticcity of Guadalajara. … This sunset city of dream-isles is the long-past, hiddendream of my fairy fancy come true to-day. I beheld the long-buried treasure ofmy Soul brought out to dazzle my longing gaze.189 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn189]While in Mexico, he also founded a Yogoda center and was received at thepresidential palace by President Emilio Portes Gil. He returned home in the latesummer. On September 1, he gave a talk at Mount Washington on “The SpiritualVibrations of Unique Mexican Sceneries” and showed film he had taken inMexico.190 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn190]Dhirananda was gone but not forgotten. Nearly six years later, he sued Yoganandafor failure to pay the promissory note. Privately, Yogananda fumed about hisformer colleague, calling him a renegade, deserter, liar, fiend, and Judas.191[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn191] Yogananda had paid one hundred-dollar installment inlate 1929 and then reneged on his legal responsibility. Yogananda countersued,claiming that Dhirananda had agreed to waive any right to remuneration afterbeing named a swami. He also asserted that Dhirananda had blackmailed him intosigning the promissory note, threatening to destroy Yogananda’s reputationthrough slanderous accusations if Yogananda failed to pay.192[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn192] The judge ruled against Yogananda on all counts.Having failed to pay the promissory note, he owed the original balance (minusthe hundred-dollar payment) plus 7 percent interest per year on all payments inarrears. The judge further found that Yogananda’s countersuit had no merit andthat his accusations against Dhirananda had no basis in fact.193[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn193] This unseemly legal squabble and the judge’s rulingfed into the stereotype of the untrustworthy trickster yogi, implying thatYogananda had lied in his countersuit and was motivated by base pecuniarymotives.The final challenge of this period came from the financial juggernaut of theGreat Depression. From the maharaja of Kasim Bazar to the Lewises, Yogananda hadalways proved effective at finding financial backers for his ministry. At somepoint in 1925, Yogananda had met Mary E. Foster and quickly charmed her intosupporting his new magazine venture. Foster had a storied life. The offspring ofa white shipwrecked captain and a Hawaiian princess, she had established aTheosophical branch in Hawaii before converting to Buddhism and becoming agenerous patron of Dharmapala, a Buddhist Indian who had attended the World’sParliament of Religions in 1893.194 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn194] In fact, Yoganandaand Dharmapala apparently met at Dharmapala’s recently founded Mahabodhi CollegeBhavan in 1913, when Yogananda, Satyananda, and two other companions journeyedacross south India and over to the island of Ceylon, now Sri Lanka.195[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn195] Despite such supporters, the ministry’s finances werealways tenuous. The magazine had already missed one issue in September–October1928. The following year, only half of the year’s issues would be published, andin 1930 the number dropped to two.As the Depression set in, things got worse. After July 1930, the magazine ceasedpublication altogether for nearly two years as financial support dried up.Yogananda fell behind on Mount Washington’s mortgage payment and had to beg foran extension.196 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn196] Yogoda Sat-Sanga was not the onlyreligious organization in this situation. Mainline churches particularly“experienced an institutional ‘religious depression’ to match the nation’seconomic depression.”197 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn197] Church leaders made specialpleas for continued giving. As one minister explained, “If the person givescheerfully; … if his gift really represents his ability to support the Kingdomand is consequently sacrificial; if he really feels that his is giving unto theLord”; then the gift would inevitably result in spiritual growth.198[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn198] Yogananda made similar entreaties, but still came upshort.His desperation for funds overrode concern for his reputation. In 1930, hedecided to tour with his friend Hamid Bey. A vaudeville performer who said thathe had originally traveled from Egypt to the United States to compete with HarryHoudini before the magician’s unexpected death, Bey—who was really theItalian-born Naldino Bombacci—masterfully exploited American Orientalisttropes.199 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn199] Claiming to be a Coptic Christian, henevertheless introduced himself as a Hindu yogi and “the youngest of theEgyptian fakirs,” or Muslim ascetics.200 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn200] Yoganandahelped Bey burnish his mysterious identity, describing him as an Egyptian fromthe Sudan, “famous land of sheiks,” “reared under an austere mystical training,and the feats he performs are a part of the religious rites of his sect.”201[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn201] In their tag team act, Yogananda lectured onsuperconsciousness and breath control before introducing “Master Teacher ofYoga” Bey’s “astounding demonstrations of the art of MENTAL TELEPATHY (mindreading), COMPLETE CONTROL OVER CIRCULATION, and the PAINLESSNESS OF THE FLESH,”which culminated in a stock routine of his being buried alive.202[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn202]Fortunately, Yogananda did not have to keep up this act for long. In January1932, near the Depression’s nadir, a providential encounter proved his abilityto direct God’s will to his own ends. During a rare tour in Kansas City—hetraveled to the midwestern plains states only infrequently—he met James Lynn, abusinessman with a restless heart and an astounding fortune. Lynn had aremarkable rags-to-riches tale. The child of sharecroppers, his intuitivebusiness acumen, hard work, and good luck allowed him to acquire a range ofcompanies that included a citrus farm, an insurance firm, railroads, and oilbusinesses. But by his own reckoning, when he met Yogananda, “my soul was sickand my body was decaying and my mind was disturbed.” In short, “I was a totallyfrustrated man.”203 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn203]The two met each other’s needs perfectly. Lynn found salvation in Yogananda, whoimmediately became the millionaire’s guru. Yogananda offered him a sense ofpurpose and routinely affirmed his rapid spiritual development, calling himSaint Lynn. Yogananda, in turn, found financial salvation in Lynn. He could nothave found a more loyal customer, deeply committed to the ministry and withboundless buying power. Lynn quickly got Mount Washington’s finances in orderand underwrote East-West. Within a few weeks of their initial meeting, Yoganandathanked Lynn for “saving the work at a very critical period of itsexistence.”204 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn204] In April 1932, publication of East-Westresumed, “under Divine guidance.” Yogananda had “refused to burden the NationalYogoda Organization with debts by publishing the magazine duringdepression-tortured times, so he waited until the-great Power destroyeddifficulties which stood in the way of publishing the magazine regularly.” Nowit would be published “through the great spiritual cooperation of a very dearYogoda student, who has undertaken to have it printed every month. May God blesshim in every way. We rejoice that God and the great Masters of India have chosenthis very noble spiritual instrument to spread the message of Yogoda.”205[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn205]The two immediately formed an intimate bond. Yogananda told Lynn, “You are theHindu yogi of Himalayan hermitages of the past who was sent in this life as anAmerican prince, a Western maharaja-yogi, to light the lamp of Yogoda in manygroping hearts.”206 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn206] In one case, Yogananda converted aletter explaining his delay in communication into an erotically tingedaffirmation of their friendship. “I have been so intoxicated with the God inyou, and with the remembrance of the pillar of light that we saw enveloping usduring the meditation in Chicago, that I did not realize I have been so long inwriting you. You have never before been so strongly present in me. (You arealways with me now, so I can’t miss you). So vividly have I seen your soul, likea glimmering jewel and an ornament in God’s omnipresence.”207[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn207] His bond with Lynn quickly supplanted the relationshiphe had enjoyed with the Lewises for more than a decade.Circumstances had taken an unexpected turn for the better. Even the Dhiranandatrial had a silver lining, despite the bruising Yogananda suffered. Yogananda’sattorneys assisted him in turning Yogoda Sat-Sanga into a nonprofit corporationto protect Mount Washington and any other assets from seizure in the case of alegal defeat.208 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn208] Beyond this pragmatic legal aim,incorporation compelled Yogananda to articulate clearly his organization’spurpose and identity. He had experimented with a number of names in the yearsleading up to the incorporation, such as Christian Yogoda in the early 1930s.But he had also used “self-realization” language for some time, both inEast-West and in the Yogoda lessons. The 1935 articles of incorporation listedthe official name as Self-Realization Fellowship Church.Images [../figures/f0153-12.jpg]James Lynn was a retired Kansas City millionaire looking for greater lifepurpose when he met Yogananda in January 1932. The two quickly became intimatefriends. Lynn’s generous donations assured the financial survival ofSelf-Realization Fellowship. Yogananda nicknamed him Saint Lynn and, when Lynntook monastic orders, bestowed the title Rajarsi Janakananda on him. He becameSRF’s first president after Yogananda’s mahasamādhi.The redundant use of both fellowship and church emphatically underscored thatthe organization was a religious body just like other American (Christian)bodies. There was certainly nothing innovative about the use of the label“self-realization,” which was in widespread usage as an English translation forthe salvific goal articulated in various Hindu traditions.209[18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn209] But bestowing the title on his organization capturedthe essence of the ministry, an essence very much in tune with modern audiences’interests in their own self-realization.210 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn210] Thestatement of the organization’s purpose was a verbatim reprint of the “Aims andPurposes of the Movement” first published in East-West in March–April 1928,which outlined the “development of men’s physical, mental and spiritual natures”by “Contacting Cosmic Consciousness, the ever-new, ever-existing, ever-consciousBliss-God” through scientific concentration and meditation. But the newstatement added two ambitious points: “Temples of Self Realization Fellowshipfor collective worship” and “development of a world spiritual University … wherean universal technique of salvation, art of self-realization, art ofsuper-living and super-technique of body, mind and soul perfection would betaught.”211 [18_notes.xhtml#c3.fn211] He envisaged all of these aims asliterally global in scale. Though his reach well exceeded his grasp, even whileunder assault by multiple lawsuits and the world’s worst recession he continuedambitiously to envision new products.SUCCESSFUL YOGA SALESMANMany harried businessmen such as the fictitious one Yogananda depicted in thecorrespondence course anecdote did find relaxation, energy, and enlightenmentfrom his teachings. And some were content with that benefit. But others pressedon to pursue the deeper promises of yoga, a profound understanding of one’s selfand a transcendent encounter with God. They found that even without a directpersonal relationship with their guru, they could still make some progress inthe spiritual path—yoga distance learning worked. In fact, Yogananda could wellhave been describing himself in the anecdote, a successful and often beleagueredbusinessman who needed to make a conscious effort to relax. With shrewdmarketing and a clear understanding that his brand appeal hinged on his ownpersona, Yogananda convinced thousands of Americans to consider his spiritualproduct. And he created a number of tangible material products that assisteddisciples along the spiritual path while helping to fill the organization’scoffers. He deftly navigated the religious marketplace’s tricky waters, firstduring a raging economic boom and later as a treacherous financial stormthreatened to engulf him. Along the way, he had to steer clear of opponents whosought to damage his reputation or sink his ministry. But his ministry survived,even thrived, as his own prominence grew. In 1935, his prestige would becomeglobal. Through Lynn’s generous financial support, Yogananda undertook anextensive tour of England, continental Europe, and his own beloved Indianhomeland in the comfort of a brand-new luxury car. When he returned to Calcuttafor the first time since departing on the S.S. City of Sparta fifteen yearsearlier, he was not the same young man. After a triumphant tour in India, hewould return to the United States as a “global guru,” a spiritual leader ofinternational stature and with increasing hints of divine power."},{"pageContent":"FOURTHE APOTHEOSIS OF A GLOBAL GURUPARAMAHANSA YOGANANDA AND HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY, 1933–1946Near the end of Autobiography of a Yogi, the five-hundred-page epic thatestablished Yogananda’s global spiritual reputation, he includes a seeminglyminor event from late 1936. Playing Santa Claus at Mount Washington’s Christmasparty, Yogananda handed Self-Realization Fellowship member E. E. Dickinson a boxcontaining a silver cup he had bought in Calcutta during his recent return tripto his homeland. According to Yogananda, Dickinson opened the box and exclaimed,“For forty-three years I have been waiting for that silver cup! It is a longstory, one I have kept hidden within me.” Dickinson proceeded to relate that asa five-year-old, he had almost drowned in a Nebraska pond. Just before he sankto his death, he had a vision of a man in a “dazzling flash of light.” He wasrescued immediately thereafter. Twelve years later, he was in Chicago during theWorld’s Parliament of Religions when he spotted Swami Vivekananda and recognizedhim immediately as the man who had appeared when he was drowning. AfterVivekananda’s lecture, Dickinson approached the Hindu master.He smiled on me graciously, as though we were old friends. I was so young that Idid not know how to give expression to my feelings, but in my heart I was hopingthat he would offer to be my teacher. He read my thought.“No, my son, I am not your guru.” Vivekananda gazed with his beautiful, piercingeyes deep into my own. “Your teacher will come later. He will give you a silvercup.” After a little pause, he added, smiling, “He will pour out to you moreblessings than you are now able to hold.”When Yogananda gave Dickinson the silver cup that Christmas, Dickinson saw thesame flash of light he had seen at moment of his rescue nearly a half-centuryearlier.1 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn1]At first glance, Yogananda’s inclusion of this anecdote about an otherwiseinsignificant SRF member is puzzling. The mystery deepens when the readerrecognizes that this story, placed in the Autobiography’s penultimate chapter,is the only event he chose to recount from the entire decade between his returnfrom India and the time he began writing his life story. This apparentpostscript was in fact a carefully crafted finale that placed Yogananda in thecompany of Swami Vivekananda, the great teacher of Hindu truth to Americanseekers a generation earlier. The resolution to Dickinson’s story revealed thatthe torch—or the silver cup—had been passed from Vivekananda to his spiritualheir. Passionate seekers like Dickinson had yearned for their guru, a uniquelyvenerable personal spiritual instructor, and he had finally appeared. The swamifrom India had become a guru to Americans, and to seekers further afield.By the mid-1930s, Yogananda was emerging as a global guru, a transnationalfigure with a following in the United States, India, and, increasingly, aroundthe world. Gurus with international followings have typically been distinguishedby their tremendous personal charisma and often have reputations as divineavatāras with supernatural powers. Global gurus have generally emerged in thelater twentieth century. Bolstered by Indian audiences, diaspora communities,and other supporters, they have availed themselves of modern transportation andcommunication to sustain their communities. But long before a vibrant Indiandiaspora had formed in the United States, Yogananda achieved the same statuswith largely white followers. From his American base of operations, he began hisoutreach to the rest of the world.This chapter explores Yogananda’s apotheosis in three parts. The first partplaces Yogananda in the context of religious internationalism, a subset of thecultural internationalism that emerged in the interwar period driven by thequest for global peace. He participated in international religious conferences.He also made an extravagant worldwide journey from California to England, theContinent, the Middle East, and across India. The young man who left for theUnited States in 1920 with slight prospects of success returned triumphantly, amature spiritual leader who spent time with Mahatma Gandhi and drew crowdswherever he went. He arrived back in the United States both a world figure and aparamahansa, having been granted this exalted title by his guru, Sri Yukteswar.The second part explores how he solidified his reputation as a global guru inthe pages of East-West. He used the magazine as a vehicle for cosmopolitansentiments, commenting on international trends from a religious perspective.More significantly, he introduced long-running columns that offered hisauthoritative interpretations of the sacred texts of Hinduism and Christianity,the two great world religions he sought to bring together. This chapter partexamines his lengthy exegesis of both the Bhagavad Gītā and the New TestamentGospels, both of which he viewed as revelations of yogic truth. As he explicatedboth texts, he hinted at his own exalted identity as a yogi guru.The third section analyzes the 1946 Autobiography of a Yogi, which firmlyestablished Yogananda’s reputation as a guru to the world. While following manytropes of Indian hagiography, the Autobiography also diverged from tradition inimportant ways. Most hagiographic accounts of supernatural feats graduallyaccrete over centuries, as later disciples embellish their master’s feats. ButYogananda took charge of fashioning his own dramatic life story, masterfullypresenting a fully formed narrative of his spiritual journey in an enchantedworld. As a rhetorical analysis of this text’s structural features reveals, theAutobiography functioned as a new scripture. Designed to inculcate belief in aworld of supernatural possibilities, the Autobiography simultaneously sought toreveal its author, the narrative’s protagonist, as a self-realized yogi, theembodiment of divinity in human form.YOGANANDA AND RELIGIOUS INTERNATIONALISMSince the 1960s, Indian gurus have often achieved global status by acquiringlarge numbers of followers in multiple international locations, a consequence ofclever advertising, widespread international travel and, more recently, the useof modern media like video to close the distance between teacher and disciple.2[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn2] Much of the technology that has facilitated such aninternational presence was not available to Yogananda in the 1930s, but heresourcefully used the means available to him to address international concerns.Internationalism enjoyed a vogue in the decades following World War I, asvarious groups forged “world citizenship” identities based on political,cultural, scientific, or gender ideals, spurred by both the hopes anddisappointments of the Treaty of Versailles’ “Wilsonian Moment.”3[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn3] Aided by advances in transportation and communication,many forms of internationalism sprang up in the early twentieth-century world.“Cultural internationalism,” according to historian of diplomacy Akira Iriye,sprang up alongside political and economic internationalism.4[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn4] The Great War’s devastation led many to conclude thatmore meaningful connections could prevent future large-scale tragedies, aconviction that drove efforts to ensure world peace through global community. By1932, the League of Nations counted well over five hundred internationalorganizations, more than 90 percent of which were private or nongovernmental.5[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn5] Many organizations sought to promote global peace.6[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn6] While many forms of cultural internationalism went intodecline as the global depression worsened in the 1930s, religious dialogueremained one hope for peace through internationalism.7 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn7]Yogananda made a presentation at the Fellowship of Faiths’ Inter-ReligiousSymposium in Washington, D.C., in 1929, attended a world religion gathering inLondon in 1936, and spoke at a local branch meeting in Los Angeles the followingyear, but his participation in the 1933 event was the most high-profile andsignificant.8 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn8]That year, the worst year of the Great Depression, Yogananda joined two hundredother invited speakers to the World Fellowship of Faiths, an interfaithconference held in Chicago to coincide with the fortieth anniversary of the 1893World’s Parliament of Religions. Yogananda’s invitation to address thisgathering cemented his reputation as a guru on the world religion scene. Themeeting took seriously a vision of religion as a worldwide force for peace.Bishop Francis J. McConnell, national chairman of the World Fellowship ofFaiths, parsed the organization’s name as a way of explaining the purpose of thegathering. The meeting was “world-wide in its scope,” as “no part of the worldis outside its reach.” It promoted genuine communion because, despite the manydifferences of the various faiths, “fellowship between these religions as theyare and as they aspire to be, in the common attempt to solves man’s deepestproblems, is the very heart of the movement.” Finally, rather than use therestrictive word religion, the organization invited into its fold people,wherever they “are to be found dominated by a great faith or conviction by whichthey are impelled to seek a more abundant life for men individually orsocially.”9 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn9] In his aptly titled “Fellowship with theUniverse,” conference coorganizer Francis Younghusband endorsed McConnell’soutlook, stressing that a spiritual worldview facilitated genuine humanconnection. “The really significant thing about the universe,” he explained, “isits coherence. It is a real whole in which all parts are interrelated,interconnected and united together.”10 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn10]In the wake of Japan’s invasion of China and Adolf Hitler’s rise to power, anumber of speakers addressed religion as a significant tool for the preventionof war. Nepalese prince Rajah Jai Prithvi Bahadur Singh called the WorldFellowship meeting “the most outstanding event of the century,” noting thatnever “before have the representatives of all faiths, races and countries cometogether to seek for spiritual solutions to the urgent present problems whichimpede human progress.”11 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn11] Former secretary of stateFrank B. Kellogg—coauthor of a 1928 international treaty binding signatories to“condemn recourse to war for the solution of internationalcontroversies”—telegraphed that there “never was a time when the peoples of theworld needed to exercise their influence on governments for world peace.”12[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn12] Gandhi, social reformer Jane Addams, and otherdisarmament advocates echoed Kellogg’s sentiments.Yogananda’s conference address, “What Nineteen Faiths Contribute to SpiritualTechnique,” was very much in this pacific vein. He ultimately envisioned aspirituality that promoted unity by transcending specific religious doctrines.He called on all religious groups—“Protestants, Catholics, Christian Scientists,Jews, Quakers, followers of Unity, Rosicrucians, Theosophists, Buddhists,Shintoists, Mohammadens, Jains, Mormons, Zoroastrians and Hindus”—to end theirconflicts over the “infallibility of their individual dogmas” and instead tocooperate in finding “the real meaning of life.” Having defined religion’sessence as practical, experiential “spiritual technique,” he undertook anevaluation of each tradition’s strengths and weaknesses. He commended Catholicdevotion to God, Jewish “hygienic teachings,” and the Islamic “spirit ofresignation.” Then he turned to the flaw of each tradition, which invariably ledback to some form of exclusivism, whether “sect exclusiveness,” “clannishness,”or a “clannish spirit.”But Yogananda’s talk reflected his own inclusivism. While placing himself on thehigh road of tolerance, he dismissed religious paths he deemed unacceptablewhile commending only religions very much like his own. His “Nineteen Faiths”reflected his core assumption that all pure religion derived from India, asfourteen of the groups had roots there. His list began with Hinduism andBuddhism and moved from there to several numerically small and relativelyinsignificant groups, including the Brahmo Samaj, Arya Samaj, and Bharat Dharma.Gandhi merited his own “faith” since he has “outdone all the saints and prophetswho preceded him.”13 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn13] Rather immodestly, Yoganandacounted “The Self-Realization Fellowship (Yogoda Sat-Sanga)” as one of thefaiths as well. Apart from Gandhi, the only organization that escaped criticismof any kind was the Self-Realization Fellowship, a group that, he assuredlisteners, “is not a sect.” Even in the august interfaith gathering, theentrepreneurial yogi could not stop promoting his brand.His participation in world religion conferences helped to establish aninternational reputation, but a major return voyage to India in 1935 wasultimately much more significant in this regard. He envisioned the trip as areverse pilgrimage to his spiritual and physical home that would allow him torevisit the formative places of his childhood and enjoy tearful reunions withfamily members both literal and spiritual—his brother disciples and his yogafather, Sri Yukteswar. A decade earlier, Yogananda had driven west to Californiafrom New York in a car belonging to well-off supporters. Now, amid the nation’sworst recession, he began a mirror-image road trip from California to New Yorkin a car donated by a devotee. But unlike 1925, this trip did not end in NorthAmerica. Lynn financed the purchase of an elegant touring car, as well as thecosts to fuel and maintain it and to ship it all over the world. As Dasgupta,Yogananda’s personal secretary in India, put it, “Thus Swamiji’s return trip tohome was arranged to be in royal fashion.”14 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn14]On June 9, 1935, he and his retinue boarded the S.S. Europa in New York boundfor London. Yogananda toured England and Scotland by car during the second halfof June. Departing England, he took a ferry to Calais to journey throughoutFrance, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, and Greece. The highlightof his European trip was his visit to Nazi Germany. There he met Catholic sisterTherese Neumann, who experienced ecstatic states, visions, clairvoyance, andstigmatization—which he took to be a true indication of the Holy Spirit’spresence. He also confirmed that all of the carefully accumulated evidencepointed to the reality that she had neither eaten nor drunk anything sinceSeptember 1927, save the Eucharist, which was the only nourishment that stirredhunger pangs in her. After departing Germany, he lectured in Rome and touredEgypt and the Holy Land, rhapsodizing over the opportunity to walk where Jesuslived and taught. Finally, he boarded the S.S. Rajputana to cross the IndianOcean, landing at Mumbai (then Bombay) on India’s northwest coast inmid-September 1935.For fifteen years, Yogananda had carefully packaged his Indian background forAmerican consumption. Now back in India, he employed this strategy in reverse ashe treated Indian audiences to an inflated account of his activities in theUnited States. Yogananda described the modest, aging guesthouse on MountWashington as an “immense” and “enormous” hotel, and the “magnificent”Self-Realization Fellowship center there as one of the three main touristattractions in Los Angeles, the other two being Hollywood and GriffithObservatory.15 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn15] He told his childhood friend Satyanandathat Mount Washington had become “one of the sights to see in America.”16[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn16] Though Mount Washington was the organization’s onlydeveloped property at the time, advertisements for Yogananda’s Indian talks alsoannounced that he had “established Hindu Temples in America.” In 1930, Yoganandahad reported twenty-five thousand Yogoda students, but an Indian advertisementfive years later bragged that he had “initiated more than One Hundred FiftyThousand AMERICANS.”17 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn17] Yogananda inexplicably claimedofficial status for Self-Realization Fellowship, presenting it as “the onlyinstitution of its kind recognised by the American Government.”18[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn18] Reversing Western missionary tropes about thechallenges of working in heathen India, he reassured listeners that the dangershe faced as an evangelist in the American missionary field wereoverblown—“despite all that one hears of gangsters and kidnapping, the countryhas a big quota of spiritual men.”19 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn19]Yogananda also reimagined his disastrous 1928 Miami trip. Rather than anignominious ejection by police over rumors of inappropriate contact with women,the visit became a triumphant vindication. Instead of Yogananda’s attorneyappearing in court on his behalf, Yogananda himself arrived “radiant,magnetically attractive in form, with beautiful yet incisive eyes brimming withvirtue. When those eyes cast their gaze on the judge, the magistrate could notwithstand its power. … Swamiji was cleared of all charges and walked away indignity with the highest respect of the court. The next day, most newspapers andjournals had their headlines boldly announcing the verdict, and Swamiji’smessage of practical spirituality went on to gain even more fame.” In Satyanandawords, Yogananda’s attackers “failed because of Swamiji’s firmness ofstrength.”20 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn20]En route to his Ranchi ashram, Yogananda stopped at Wardha and met privatelywith Gandhi, which helped legitimate his standing as an American representativeof Indian nationalism and as a world leader. Yogananda’s account of his meetingwith one of the twentieth century’s greatest leaders portrays an encounter inwhich Gandhi submitted to Yogananda’s superior wisdom. The only extant accountof dialogue between the two actually suggests Gandhi as the sage and Yoganandahis conversation partner. Yogananda offered few independent thoughts, and Gandhieither rejected or reframed those he did propose:GANDHIJI Why is there evil in the world, is a difficult question to answer. Ican only give what I may call a villager’s answer. If there is good there mustalso be evil, just as where there is light there is also darkness, but it istrue only so far as we human mortals are concerned. Before God there is nothinggood, nothing evil. … I therefore say that I am not going to bother my headabout it. Even if I was allowed to peep into the innermost recess of God’schamber I should not care to do it. For I should not know what to do there. Itis enough for our spiritual growth to know that God is always with the doer ofgood. …YOGANANDA But if He is All-mighty, as unquestionably He is, why does he not freeus from evil?GANDHIJI I would rule out this question, too. God and we are not equals. Equalsmay put such questions to one another, but not unequals. Villagers do not askwhy town-dwellers do things which if they did would mean certain destruction.YOGANANDA I quite see what you mean. It is a strong point you have made. But whomade God?GANDHIJI If He is All-powerful, He must have made Himself.YOGANANDA Do you think He is an autocrat or a democrat?GANDHIJI I do not think these things at all. I do not want to want to dividepower with Him and hence I am absolved from having to consider these questions.I am content with the doing of the task in front of me. I do not worry about thewhy and wherefore of things.21 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn21]Shortly after the visit, Yogananda reported to James Lynn that Gandhi hadreceived Kriya Yoga instruction from him.22 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn22] This claimraises questions. The earliest reference to the meeting between Yogananda andGandhi in Inner Culture (as East-West was renamed in 1934) makes no mention ofthis yoga training, and major biographies of Gandhi do not report it.23[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn23] If the induction took place as Yogananda described, itapparently did not have a significant impact on Gandhi. Whatever transpiredbetween the two, Yogananda thought it crucial to present the encounter as Gandhisubmitting himself to Yogananda’s authority in a “childlike” manner.24[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn24]In late September, Yogananda arrived at the Calcutta train station to afantastic welcome reception whose hosts included the current maharaja of KasimBazar, successor of his longtime Ranchi supporter who had died several yearsearlier. The young man who had departed Calcutta for an uncertain fate in theUnited States was returning in triumph, a hero to his physical father and hisspiritual one. His reunion with Yukteswar was much more important to Yoganandathan his encounter with his own father. Yogananda recounted that when he andYukteswar saw each other, “We flew into each other’s arms and remained there insobs for long.” He mentioned his own father quite literally as a parentheticalafterthought.25 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn25] Yogananda’s American companion, RichardWright, offered a dramatic rendition of Yogananda’s momentous meeting withYukteswar:Before us, near the head of the stairs, quietly appeared the Great One, SwamiSri Yukteswarji, standing in the noble pose of a sage.My heart heaved and swelled as I felt myself blessed by the privilege of beingin his sublime presence. Tears blurred my eager sight when Yoganandaji droppedto his knees, and with bowed head offered his soul’s gratitude and greeting,touching with his hand his guru’s feet and then, in humble obeisance, his ownhead. He rose then and was embraced on both sides of the bosom by SriYukteswarji.No words passed at the beginning, but the most intense feeling was expressed inthe mute phrases of the soul. How their eyes sparkled and were fired with thewarmth of renewed soul-union! A tender vibration surged through the quiet patio,and even the sun eluded the clouds to add a sudden blaze of glory.26[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn26]Yogananda’s most important interaction with Yukteswar occurred when his mentorformally initiated him as a paramahansa. This took place on Christmas Day,auspicious timing for a yogi with Christ Consciousness. Yogananda initially madelittle of the event. In a letter to Lynn shortly after the bestowal, he brieflyshared news of the title almost offhandedly after a discussion of prosaicadministrative duties.27 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn27] The account in Autobiographyis likewise terse, especially given the immense later significance of thisdesignation: “The next afternoon, with a few simple words of blessing, SriYukteswar bestowed on me the further monastic title of Paramhansa. ‘It nowformally supersedes your former title of swami,’ he said as I knelt before him.With a silent chuckle I thought of the struggle which my American students wouldundergo over the pronunciation of Paramhansaji.”28 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn28]Dasgupta, Yogananda’s personal secretary, who was present at the event andgenerally spoke of Yogananda with great deference, reported that he and othersclose to him were unaware of any bestowal of title. Instead, he offered anearthy account of how Yukteswar (referred to here as “Gurudev”) jokinglyconferred the title.It was almost nightfall. Maharajaji was standing on the upstairs veranda andsomeone was standing next to him. Ananda-da and the writer were downstairs.Before going upstairs, Yoganandaji went to a drainage spot, a bit apart from thearea, and began to urinate into the drainage passage. This caught Gurudev’sattention and he cryptically joked, “Yogananda has become a ‘paramhansa’ [greatswan or great soul]!” After urinating, Yoganandaji saw Ananda-da standing at thefront door and quietly said, “Ananda-da! Did you hear? Swamiji [Sriyukteshvarji]called me a ‘paramhansa!’” Later, Ananda-da laughed and said to the writer,“You’ll see. Yogananda will one day use this title!”29 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn29]If accurate, this account would explain why Yogananda did not immediately sharethe news of the new title with American devotees. But however Yogananda acquiredthe honorific from his guru, he came to embrace it as a mark of his own exaltedguru status.The bliss Yogananda shared with his guru was short-lived, as his desire toacquire property in India led to a clash between them. Yogananda wasparticularly interested in establishing a presence near the famous DakshineswarKali Temple, Ramakrishna’s former longtime residence, and Vivekananda’s BelurMath. His childhood friend Satyananda remembers Yogananda standing “on the bankof Ganges, at Dakshineswar, pointing to the Belur Math, … he said to me, ‘Bama!I will make mine bigger than theirs.’ It seemed to me as if Swamiji was caughtup with some kind of competetion [sic] game with Swami Vivekananda.” Satyanandathought that Yukteswar saw Yogananda as “envious of the image of SwamiVivekananda, because of Yogananda’s ambition of wanting to be great.”30[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn30] Yogananda and Yukteswar met with an attorney so thatYukteswar could will all his property to Yogananda at his death. The attorneydrew up a legal deed describing Yukteswar as founder of “Yogoda Sat SangaSociety of India and America” and Yogananda as president. When it came time tosign, Yogananda, unable to contain his resentment at these labels, burst out, “Iwas really the one who did everything.” Yukteswar stared at Yoganandamomentarily before collecting his walking stick and stalking out, leavingeveryone in the attorney’s office “absolutely dumbstruck.” In the car, anenraged Yukteswar exploded, “That is not self will; that is unlawful conduct.”31[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn31] Yogananda’s brother Sananda, witness to Yukteswar’soutburst in the car, quietly passed over any conflict between the two in histerse account of their time together.32 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn32]Still smarting from their argument, Yogananda decided to attend the Allahabadkumbha mela, the great religious pilgrimage that drew millions from all overIndia. Yogananda persisted with his plans, even when Yukteswar ridiculed him byasking what he would gain by witnessing a throng of naked sadhus.33[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn33] As a result, Yogananda was hundreds of miles fromYukteswar’s Puri ashram when his mentor fell gravely ill. Receiving the urgenttelegram, “Come to Puri at once,” Yogananda chose not to leave on the nighttrain. Instead, he waited until the next day to depart, a delay his brotherSananda found inexplicable.34 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn34] Yogananda later explainedthat he stayed away because he had a presentiment of Yukteswar’s impendingdeath, and had he been present, “there would have been a great battle” as hesought to keep his master from giving up his body.35 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn35]Whatever the reason, having traveled halfway around the world at Yukteswar’sbehest for one last visit, Yogananda missed his guru’s final moments on earth.Yogananda found Yukteswar’s death “unbearable.” “If I could weep, I would feelrelieved. If I would cry, the gods would cry with me. If I had a thousandmouths, I would say India lost one of the greatest in wisdom.” Though absentfrom the physical plane, however, Yukteswar “is divinely haunting me day andnight. I see him in every direction I turn my eyes.”36 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn36]He soon experienced a supernatural vision of Yukteswar “resurrected in a strangenew way” that provided great comfort. Yukteswar unfolded cosmological mysteriesabout the astral world and more mundane instructions about Yogananda’s authorityto inherit and administer his master’s property.37 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn37] Likethe earlier premonitions of his mother’s and brother’s deaths, his vision ofYukteswar provided reassurance that seemingly tragic events fit within a largercosmic scheme. “He answered all my questions,” Yogananda reflected simply.38[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn38] A hint of eroticism accompanied their reunion.Yogananda “advanced to gather him hungrily in my arms.” Embracing his master, he“could detect the same faint, fragrant, natural odor which had beencharacteristic of his body before. The thrilling touch of his divine flesh stillpersists around the inner sides of my arms and in my palms whenever I recallthose glorious hours.” The resurrected Yukteswar promised his ongoing presenceand expressed his unconditional love as he never had in his earthly form. He hadwaited sixteen years for his pupil’s return, “but no more—I love thee—I willever be with thee.”39 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn39]The resurrection appearance also functioned as a transfer of power. Yukteswar’sdeath created a leadership vacuum in the swami lineage, a vacuum naturallyfilled by his handpicked successor, their previous disagreementsnotwithstanding. Yogananda became an important channel for Yukteswar’s messages.“Henceforth, my Master shall speak through me,” he declared.40[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn40] Yogananda passed one such message to Lewis inYukteswar’s voice. “Beloved son, your life and actions have glorified us. Youare a celestial instrument. Expand fearlessly in the realm of renunciation forthe cause of Self-Realization, India, and humanity. India’s spiritual habitsmark your forehead. Your actions are joyfully recognized and witnessed by theAll-Supreme and by the Gurus.”41 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn41]Throughout the trip, Yogananda never lost sight of James Lynn’s resources as theindispensable foundation for his growing role as an international guru. He wroteLynn several dozen letters during the trip. Typically much longer than the tersenotes he dashed off to others, they were also effusively affectionate and, likehis reminiscences of Yukteswar, tinged with eroticism:I am with you always, ever going deeper, ever feeling deeper bliss in you and inyour devoted group and in me and all.You have satisfied all my desires for an ideal beloved one who has carried outall the demands of divine discipline. What more could I want?Dreams about our divine communion often flit by my mind, and I have caught oneof those dreams of happiness and painted it in words as it comes straight fromthe chamber of my heart.42 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn42]He signed off with some variation of “With deepest love and blessings to you, mybeloved one of many lives. Ever yours.”43 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn43] As withYogananda’s relationship with his own mentor, divine communion and homosocialintimacy were closely entwined in his relationship with his most cherisheddisciple.Along with these reassurances of affection, Yogananda boldly pressed Lynn formore funds, assuring him that he wanted nothing for himself and thought onlyabout SRF’s well-being. He warned Lynn “not to give Satan opportunity to causeus and our work trouble.” He flattered and pressured Lynn simultaneously whiledescribing Mount Washington as the childless millionaire’s true offspring.44[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn44] Lynn’s reluctance to provide the required fundingstemmed partly from concern that his financial resources were being used tocommercialize religious work. In countering this concern, Yogananda offered rareinsight into his thinking about the role of religious promotion:About commercializing our work, I really do hate to see anyone commercializingreligion. By commercializing it means “using religion for individual benefit orbenefit of the business.” Are we doing that? No. Then what are we doing? We arenot using religion for business, but we are using business methods in religion,which we must do. Sincere seekers won’t be found in a hundred years unless theyknow our work and me. The quicker they know through advertisements, the betterit is. Some may turn away because of advertisements, but careful wording wouldnot turn sincere seekers away; they would be increasingly found. Aren’t Biblessold? Somebody has to pay for them. What sin in selling to-the-point benefittinginstructions and using the money to print more of such. You must know ofhundreds of others who hungrily wait for the weekly Lessons. Sincere seekers aresatisfied with truth, and they never mind helping the cause of spreading same bypaying.45 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn45]In asking for greater financial support, Yogananda appealed to Lynn’s altruismand self-interest, reminding him of “my spontaneous gift of my deepest love toyou.” He had given Lynn half of his spiritual realization. “I have taken almostall of your karma on myself—and I will work the sufferance out in this body—thatyou may be free from the subtle traps of desires and attachments and have aclear sailing, like a shooting star in the distant heavens.”46[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn46] Lynn’s spiritual credit was reserved for him “manifoldin heaven, to be used in any incarnation you want.”47 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn47]Yogananda’s lobbying eventually paid off, as Lynn agreed to retire MountWashington’s mortgage. “What freedom,” he told Lynn, “you have given to theinstitution; may that freedom be yours in spirit and in material things.”48[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn48] Lynn topped off his generosity by paying for the Ranchiashram as well.49 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn49]On his return voyage to the United States, Yogananda stopped in London to attendthe 1936 World Congress of Faiths. Yogananda had decided to attend while inRanchi in February, too late to be a presenter as he had hoped.50[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn50] But he took advantage of the large gathering ofreligious seekers to host a number of Yogoda classes, which proved a bigsuccess.51 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn51] En route home from England, Yogananda wasdetained briefly at Ellis Island for a board of special inquiry hearing, aprocess that flagged passengers whose answers to detailed questions posed byimmigration officials either did not align with information on the ship manifestor was questionable in some other way.52 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn52] Given previousscrutiny of Yogananda as a possible nationalist, perhaps his visit to Gandhi hadraised a flag that British officials passed on to American immigration agents.Whatever the reason, Yogananda would not have been subject to this treatment—aclosed hearing conducted without counsel—had he been an American citizen. Butmore than fifteen years after settling in the United States, he remained aresident alien, prevented by federal law from naturalizing. This humiliatingdetention was undoubtedly especially embittering on the heels of his celebratoryglobal trip. When at long last he arrived at Mount Washington in December 1936,eighteen months after his departure, he received a more fitting welcome from hisown community.He was greeted with a huge celebration banquet filled with adoring speeches.Nerode characterized Yogananda as the one who had “washed away” the “manysorrows” in his life, and a “great flame” from which he had “tried to gatherlight.” Jotin compared Yogananda’s physical presence to the sacredness ofpilgrimage places. “Being here at my Master’s feet, I have visited all the holyplaces on earth.” Sri Ranendra Kumar Das offered the boldest tribute: “There isonly one parallel that can be given to the life of Swami Yogananda. As nineteenhundred years ago in the streets of Galilee Jesus used to walk, his long robeflowing, his benign countenance lightened with the consciousness and realizationof God, his mouth uttering the divine message to bring the wayward souls back toGod, so similarly Swamiji goes on unselfishly, pursuing the ideal of service toall the children of God.” Lynn’s speech, though less stirring, was equallyreverential. Reflecting on common stereotypes about India, he noted, “What ablessing it has been for us that India, a country that many people think of as aland of snake-charmers, did send one to our shores who could bring us Godconsciousness that our souls might be revealed and bring us Divine Joy andDivine Happiness.”53 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn53]While his close disciples offered proper adulation of Yogananda, rank-and-fileSRF members needed training to understand the grandeur of their teacher as aparamahansa. Yogananda exacerbated this confusion by continuing to use the swamititle for himself for at least a year after his return from India.54[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn54] Richard Wright launched a campaign to educate SRFmembers about the significance of the new title, so that Yogananda would nothave to trumpet his own swan title directly:During Swami Yogananda’s visit to India in 1936, after fifteen years’ spiritualwork in America at the command of his great master, Swami Sri Yukteswarji ofPuri, the latter honored him with the title of Paramhansa. Param means “supreme”and hamsa means “soul.” It is the highest spiritual title which a divineguru-preceptor can bestow on his disciple. It is never merely a title, givenwithout reason or just in recognition of material service to others. The guruonly bestows it on his disciple when the latter has reached a very high state ofCosmic Consciousness, Divine Joy, Wisdom-Bliss, and God-contact inSelf-Realization.THE DIVINE SWANAnother meaning of hams in the word Paramhansa, is “swan.” The ancientscriptures speak of a fabled swan which when drinking can separate the milk fromthe water if the two are mixed. In this sense, the title Paramhansa means thedivine swan or he who is able to extract the milk of spiritual bliss from thewaters of material life. The swan also floats in water without drowning orgetting its feathers wet. So the royal divine swan or Paramhansa is he who canfloat on the waters of material life without getting attached to it or drownedin it.55 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn55]This message was slow to catch on. Five years later, Inner Culture was stillposting announcements in each issue explaining the term.56[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn56] Disciples eventually took to calling Yogananda“Master,” an English substitute for the tongue-twisting paramahansa.The December banquet also included a major announcement. Lynn had purchased landfor an ashram on a beautiful bluff in Encinitas, near San Diego. Yoganandareacted with “astonishment” and “delight” to this surprise welcome home gift.“Not a word of the hermitage construction had been allowed to reach me during mystay in India and Europe.”57 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn57] The real surprise was thatLynn had finally purchased this tract of land, which Yogananda had been urginghim to acquire for two years. In 1934, he had written, “Some day I know God willfree you from your business life and then you could come there, free from theentanglements of an organization, and meditate on that sacred hill in completeecstasy with God.”58 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn58] During the trip, Yoganandadirected SRF staff member Merna Brown, “Positively show Mr. Lynn the place onthe beach hill in Encinitas. When he acquires that land, my last wish will befulfilled. There is no place like it. Try your utmost.”59[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn59]This breathtaking spot overlooking the Pacific Ocean was prime SouthernCalifornia real estate. Self-Realization Fellowship described the Encinitas siteas “one of the garden spots of the world,” providing “the finest beauty of sky,mountain, ocean, trees and caves offered by Nature.”60 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn60]The four-hundred-thousand-dollar project on seventeen acres, “conspicuous by itsoriental design and striking decorative features,” as the Los Angeles Timesdescribed it, soon became a landmark for drivers along Pacific Coast Highway.61[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn61] Prominent Los Angeles architect Charles C. Frye, firstCivil Works Administration director in Los Angeles County and creator of the SanFrancisco Palace Hotel, designed the buildings.62 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn62]Encinitas quickly became the soul of SRF. Southern California had been SRF’sheadquarters for a decade, and Yogananda viewed it as the part of the UnitedStates most like India—a uniquely sacred place.63 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn63]Encinitas became the center of that sacred space, surpassing Mount Washington asSRF’s most crucial location and the place where Yogananda spent most of hisremaining years.When he was there, Yogananda was often in the company of his benefactor andintimate friend, James Lynn. Their overt displays of same-sex affection wouldnot have been easily tolerated in mainstream American religious organizations ofthe time. Every evening, Master and his “most blessed beloved little one” “couldbe seen walking hand in hand like two small children, up and down the flagstonepath on the lawn in front of the Hermitage. Their eyes would be shining with thelove and friendship they shared with God and with each other.” Yoganandareportedly claimed regularly that Lynn “fulfilled one-hundred percent the wishesof his heart.” They kissed each other multiple times on the forehead and cheekas a greeting. Disciples thought their behavior epitomized spiritualcompanionship. “I’d never seen such affection,” devotee Leo Cocks commented,“such unconditional love in my life.” Daya Mata thought their relationship was“the perfect divine friendship.” Brother Premonoy viewed the bond as more like afather-son relationship, with Yogananda, almost the same age as his disciple,playing the paternal role.64 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn64]INTERPRETER OF THE SACRED TEXTS OF HINDUISM AND CHRISTIANITYApart from his international travels, Yogananda promoted his religiously basedvision of peace through the pages of East-West and then Inner Culture. He heldSelf-Realization Fellowship out as an organization capable of tangibly advancingglobal peace efforts. A 1937 article entitled “The Spread of Self-RealizationFellowship … over the Earth” narrated Yogananda’s ministry as the creation of aglobal fellowship. The article then shared his vision for the formation of a“World Brotherhood City” that aimed to “make each man an ideal world-citizen” byspeaking one universal language, adhering to universal laws of hygiene and diet,recognizing the unity of all races, and teaching “one religion ofSelf-Realization.”65 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn65] Although this plan never moved offthe drafting table, it conveyed his hope for peace grounded in Hindu unity andhis understanding of himself as a central agent in this reconciliation.From the first rumblings of renewed war to its cataclysmic nuclear end,Yogananda spoke repeatedly on themes of world peace and cooperation, presentingspiritual unity as the solution to global turmoil.66 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn66] Asthe threat of war intensified in the 1930s, he advocated “success throughunity.” “It seems as if God is trying to evolve the art of right living byexpressing His Truth through a combination of particular civilizations,mentalities, and nationalities. No nation is complete in itself.”67[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn67] He warned that the Spanish Civil War and Italy’sinvasion of Ethiopia, both wars of aggression, had created “vibrations ofinjustice … moving through the ether waves” that were “causing floods inAmerica, storms in England and Portugal, and earthquakes in India.”68[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn68] And on the eve of armed conflict in Europe, heproclaimed, “Amidst the prevailing confusion of so many ideas and ideologies,here and abroad, what we need most is the materialization of that for whichJesus lived and died, peace on earth and good will to mankind.”69[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn69] Later, while war raged across the globe, Inner Culturebucked the nationalist trend with a poem invoking global community. Entitled“The United States of the World,” it beganOh, poets and singers,Oh, preachers, statesmen, teachers and seers,In Asia, Africa, North America, South AmericaEurope and AustraliaTake up this chant and sing a song of songs:The Song of the United States of the World.70 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn70]As the war wound down in 1945, Yogananda published a poem entitled “Wreath ofUnity,” which envisioned the motherly image of deity as the healer of theworld.71 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn71] The same year, a local minister predicting theworld’s impending end earned a rebuke from Yogananda for his “hallucinaryvision”: “When the Creator of the Universe does destroy this little earth itwill be millions of years hence—after all His children have learned to use Hisgift of free choice wisely and have evolved beyond this earth.”72[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn72] Initially an admirer of atomic power—his cosmologicalemphasis on energy made fission alluring—he was horrified by the unleashing ofatomic weapons on Japan.73 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn73] As World War II gave way tothe Cold War, Yogananda spoke on issues like “Averting the Coming Atomic War.”74[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn74] One article argued that lack of understanding, literaland metaphorical, was the root of global conflict and advocated “Mondi Linguo,”a new global language on the model of Esperanto.75 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn75]Yogananda also attempted to present Inner Culture as a cosmopolitan periodical,a forum for universalism built on pluralism, curiosity, engagement, andconversation.76 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn76] Though cosmopolitanism and religion arenot often linked, they belonged together intuitively in Yogananda’s thinking.The predominant image of cosmopolitanism derives from Enlightenment visions thattake for granted “the privatization of religion, and indeed, disenchantment withthe world.” But, as Srivinas Aravamudan argues, the transnational language ofHindu spirituality has provided one “amongst several alternative and popularforms of cosmopolitanism.”77 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn77] Some magazine articleswere essentially travel writing pieces that gave audiences a window into exoticplaces they might never visit themselves, such as a Cleveland Yogoda member’sdetailed Holy Land travelogue. But from its first issue in 1925, the magazinehad aspired to unite Orient and Occident. Yogananda hoped that the magazinewould appeal to discerning upper-middle-class readers who could appreciate bothbroad global trends and spirituality. Defining “spirituality” broadly, Yoganandamade generous space in the magazine’s pages over the years for an assortment ofdiscussions—diet and health, landscape and beauty, mind and spirit.When the magazine ventured beyond international cultural trends into the realmof politics, it often revealed the ignorance and political naïveté of itsauthors, particularly Yogananda, its executive editor and most prolificcontributor. Some articles, like his assessment of the League of Nations’prospects for achieving world peace, were thoughtful and informed. But otherswere more troubling. Long before Italy’s invasion of Ethiopia caused him toreconsider his views, Yogananda showed great admiration for Italy’s fascistleader, Benito Mussolini. Yogananda reprinted a 1927 Mussolini speech, laudedMussolini’s plans for a brown rice–based diet, his reintroduction of brownbread, and “other sensible and health-giving ideas on diet,” and proclaimed thata “master brain like that of Mussolini does more good than millions of socialorganizations of group intelligence. … Great individuals are sent on earth as apattern after which ordinary members of society must model themselves.”78[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn78] He also praised Hitler and his policies. The yearHitler came to power, Yogananda offered his sanguine assessment thatHitler is to be admired for leaving the League of Nations because peace cannever be attained by the victor and vanquished attitude, but only on a basis ofequality and brotherhood. Instead of preventing Hitler from having equalarmament with other nations, the other nations should reduce armaments to thelevel of Germany, then the millions of dollars that are thrown away on idlebattleships could be used for national or international prosperity. … Aninsulted, snubbed Germany, if it gets away from the uplifting guidance ofHitler, may join Russia and make her a more powerful enemy of France, and so on.The Allies must reduce their own armaments first, and then they will find outthat example speaks louder than words.79 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn79]The month after the Nazi government announced the Nuremberg Laws, which strippedJews of citizenship and prevented them from marrying ethnic Germans, Yoganandaexpressed enthusiasm for “the German awakening—a new Germany.”80[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn80] Yogananda’s colleague Dasgupta recalled that Yoganandaadmired the “new state of uniformity and rules” Hitler enacted. “He used to saythat the entire German nation was alive, and that it was absolutely mesmerizingto see groups of young men marching together with the ‘clack, clack’ sounds oftheir boots resonating in unison.”81 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn81]THE BHAGAVAD GĪTĀ AS A METAPHOR FOR SPIRITUAL STRUGGLEYogananda’s contributions to Inner Culture were much more compelling when hestayed within his métier as an expositor of religious truth. In the 1930s hedemonstrated his interpretive skills through an exposition of the Bhagavad Gītā.Given the Gītā’s elevated status in modern Hinduism, especially its role ininterfaith dialogue with Christianity, Yogananda’s attention to this text was nosurprise. The model had already been provided by his de facto mentor, SwamiVivekananda, who called the Gītā the “only commentary, the authoritativecommentary on the Vedas” and routinely taught on it at home as well as duringhis American visits. Just as Vivekananda’s universalizing of the Gītā’s Hinduism“authenticated his own deep missionary imperative,”82 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn82]Yogananda’s commentary in Inner Culture conveyed his message of modern Hinduismto American devotees.He identified the Gītā as “the Hindu Bible,” employing a familiar term amongeducated Indians of the time.83 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn83] The Gītā’s biblicalstatus was of relatively recent vintage, due in part to the nineteenth-centuryencounter between Hinduism and Christianity.84 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn84] From theperspective of traditional orthodox teaching, the Gītā fell into thelower-ranking category of Smṛti, or “remembered,” texts. The higher-statussacred texts, Śruti, that which is “heard” or divinely revealed and thuseternal, consisted solely of the four Vedas and the Upaniṣads.85[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn85] Access to Śruti texts was traditionally reserved formale members of the three twice-born castes, who learned them secretly throughoral transmission from a guru. Ironically, the very secondary status of the Gītāamong Brahmins made it an ideal candidate to become Hinduism’s Bible. Becauseits access was not restricted as the Vedas and Upaniṣads were, the Gītā was morewidely known. Its greater popularity aided its accession to prominence as aspiritual text for Hindus.By the time Yogananda came of age, the Gītā’s position was firmly fixed, and hisown views reflected its status. “The Bhagavad Gita,” Yogananda pronounced, “isthe greatest metaphysical, psychological treatise that was ever given to theworld. It describes definitely, in detail, all the experiences of the Spiritualtraveller in the path of emancipation.” This trail, as always for Yogananda, ledto communion with God. “The true devotee not only trusts in God, but worshipsHim through understanding and wisdom. Blind worship may be meagerly accepted byGod, but we, being gifted with the greatest Divine gift of human intelligence,that of reason and free choice, must worship God in Truth and Understanding. Itpleases God to see His human children, who are made in His image, employ Hishighest gift, the searchlight of Intelligence, in quest of Him.”86[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn86]Composed a century or so before the Common Era,87 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn87] theBhagavad Gītā functions as a stand-alone narrative within the much larger epic,the Mahābhārata.88 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn88] The main character, Arjuna, is awarrior on a great battlefield who carries on an extensive dialogue with hischarioteer, Krishna, later revealed to be the great god Vishnu in disguise. Asrecent translator and interpreter Laurie L. Patton explains, essentially theGītā “is about a decision”:89 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn89] should Arjuna fulfill hisduty to slaughter his foes, who are also his kin? Krishna urges him to do so. Inthe extensive philosophical and metaphysical discussion dialogue that ensues,the Gītā addresses the key ideas in Hinduism as it emerged in the Common Era,including karma, saṃsāra, dharma, yoga, the nature of divinity, and bhakti, orproper devotion to God.The Gītā has long been read allegorically. Its battlefield setting has sometimesproved a challenge for readers. The narrative also reveals Vishnu as a fearsomedivine warrior, not a gentle master.90 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn90] And the Gītā’sconceptually dense, tersely worded sutras are capable of bearing many meanings.Gandhi, who adopted it as his central devotional text, is one of the Gītā’s mostfamous allegorical interpreters.91 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn91] He viewed themilitary setting as an extended metaphor for mental and spiritual struggleagainst evil.92 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn92] Yogananda likewise sought to interpretthe Gītā nonviolently and to unfold the full meaning of the densely packed textfor lay audiences.Premiering in 1932 under the banner of “Spiritual Interpretation of Scripture,”Yogananda’s Gītā commentary series went through several modifications instructure before taking stable form nearly a year later. Some features provedshort-lived. In January 1933, Yogananda began introducing each article with aselection from the Sanskrit text transliterated from Brahmi script into Romanletters. The result was a sequence of seeming gibberish to a readership who knewno Sanskrit:Dristawa tu Pandavaneekam BudhamDurjodhana Acharyam upusangmyaRaja Bachanamabaraheet, stada.93 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn93]Yogananda’s transliteration conveyed his skill as a translator of India’sancient sacred text, reminding readers of his formal swami training in India andof his spiritual and intellectual authority to mediate the text to students.Transliteration may have also offered readers direct exposure to thepronunciation of Sanskrit words, whose very sound was often thought to bespiritually efficacious. Whatever the case, this feature was more confusing thanhelpful, and he dropped it after mid-1934 in favor of simply providing theEnglish translation.Irrespective of adjustments to the exegetical structure, his interpretiveapproach remained fundamentally allegorical. Despite the familiarity of thisinterpretive strategy, he claimed that this interpretation of the text “asreceived from within” was being offered “for the first time.”94[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn94] Allegory allowed him wide latitude to talk aboutspiritual and philosophical issues. A passage describing how one warrior “roaredaloud like a lion and blew his conchshell,” for example, was glossed as “KingMaterial Desire had called upon the Preceptor Past Habit to protect General Egowith all the soldiers of the senses, but when the Preceptor Habit did not giveinner support, General Ego himself roared with the vibration of pride.”95[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn95] Like Gandhi, he used allegory to portray spiritualityas a vital internal fight against evil thoughts and behaviors. “Every night,”Yogananda counseled, “the student of the Bhagavad Gita should … ask King Souland his children what they accomplished as they gathered together, eager forbattle of proper management against untoward circumstances which affect thebody.”96 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn96]Allegory often shaded into metaphor, allowing Yogananda to indulge his penchantfor poetry. “Desires,” he reflected, “are silken threads of material pleasureswhich the spider of habit continuously spins around the Soul, to form theshrouding cocoon of ignorance.”97 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn97] These metaphorssometimes became more elaborate, taking on local color. In explaining howcontrol of desire might lead to anger, Yogananda relied on popular SouthernCalifornia stereotypes about the automobile and the beach. “If the average man,who is not free from anger, is driving a car joyfully from Los Angeles to SantaMonica for a picnic, and then is forcefully asked by his wife to stop at herrelatives’ place against his will, he may suddenly be blinded by wrath,” whichmight in turn lead to a car wreck. The story illustrated how “the car of one’slife may be smashed by insurmountable difficulties or run into the ditch offailure.”98 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn98]The flexibility afforded by allegorizing led to a potentially limitlesscommentary. He lingered on the first of the Gītā’s eighteen chapters for twoyears. By the time of his death, twenty years after he began the series, InnerCulture had only reached the middle of chapter 5 [16_chapter05.xhtml]. Hisproductivity dramatically outpaced available magazine space, however, and theseries continued under his name posthumously for nearly two decades.Yogananda’s allegorizing analysis of the Gītā underscored self-mastery,bolstering the contrast he had drawn since his 1920 Science of Religion betweenuseless theological doctrine and pragmatic spirituality. An early subtitle ofthe Gītā series made this point clear, as it promised “practical application ofthe teaching” of the text. He elucidated five related and overlapping pointsabout practical religion. The first and most foundational was the commonplacenotion shared by many spiritual traditions that the physical body was the locusof a spiritual battle. In his first article on the Gītā, Yogananda quoted,“Fight the battle of life, or you will acquire sin,” which he glossed as “unlessthe soul battles continuously to overcome the consciousness of the flesh byexperiencing soul-consciousness in meditation, that soul acquires sin.”99[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn99] Yogananda explicated the notion that the human bodyrecapitulates the universe in microcosm, a common tenet in yoga traditions.100[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn100] Spiritual battles taking place between divine entitiesin the unseen realm paralleled dramatic struggles occurring within the self:“Life is a series of battles between spirit and matter, knowledge and ignorance,soul and body, life and death” and “the scene of battle is the body.”101[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn101]Yogananda’s second point was that bodily desires were temptations that must bemastered for growth in divine communion. Every physical longing threatened aperilous debilitation of both body and soul. “Over-indulgence in sex,over-eating, lack of exercise, lack of fresh air, and lack of sunshine, alldestroy the red blood corpuscles and especially affect the fighting power of thewhite corpuscles.”102 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn102] Sexual desire topped Yogananda’slist of dangers. While his admonition was common among celibate renunciants, hiscall to sexual restraint even within marriage presented a daunting challenge tohis many “householder” followers, particularly given the increasing culturalemphasis on marital sexual satisfaction in twentieth-century America. Heunapologetically warned against the danger a modern “young person” faced inpursuing a family first, “thinking he will seek God afterwards.” “Husbands andwives who think that the ‘holy bonds of matrimony’ permit them to indulge inoversexuality, greed, anger, or displays of ‘temperament’ are ignorant of thetrue laws of life.”103 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn103] His uncompromising stancestemmed from a desire to provide everyday Americans with practical tools toovercome the forceful tug of natural human cravings that could not be controlledby mere will.Sexual desire was not the only powerful temptation. The businessman who isstriving to be honest and observes his dishonest peers growing wealthy “is oftenso strongly tempted to partake of gain attained by graft that he says he is‘forced’ to do so.”104 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn104] The spiritual stakes were high,and spiritual victory was by no means assured—it required a genuine subjugationof evil. Yogananda warned that “when one begins to be restless, the Spiritualbow of spinal energy and perception, which can kill sense attachments witharrows of super-happiness, is destroyed and the Ego’s surrounding thoughts beginto be scorched with restlessness, even as the skin is scorched with over-heatedrays.”105 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn105]Third, to master desires effectively, a devotee had to recognize the power ofmāyā, the spiritual delusion that life and the desires that came with earthlyexistence were real. Human existence is merely a motion picture, and a yogi,like the “operator in the booth, knows that talking pictures are unreal,combinations of light and sound.”106 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn106] There was aneffective weapon against bodily temptation and māyā. “Meditation,” Yoganandaexplained, “is the inner war-drum which rouses the good and bad habits from theslumber of indifference and makes them willing to increase their forces in orderto attain victory over the consciousness of the devotee.”107[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn107] As elsewhere, Yogananda offered extensive guidance ontechnique, often with accompanying illustrations. A proper understanding of thebody’s microcosmic composition was essential to self-mastery. Yoganandaexplained how the body’s six cakra centers were associated with the fourelements, ether, and the combination of the five.108 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn108]One article provided diagrams contrasting views of the human body and its cakrasunder the rule of “the Soul” and in bondage to “Rebel, King Delusive Desire.”109[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn109]In the battle against spiritual weakness, novice devotees were not alone.Yogananda’s fourth theme was the example of successful yogis who had conqueredthese struggles already. The yogi, “awake in spiritual pursuits and asleep inthe bazaar of worldly desires,” provided an instructive model to “the worldlyman.”110 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn110] Among other achievements, advanced yogisovercame physical bodily decay; Yogananda’s “Supreme Master, Babaji, has a youngbody, preserved for several centuries.”111 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn111] Heroutinely insisted that all disciples needed a master who would train them tocontemplate “the soul as a wonder.”112 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn112] While mostyogis avoided entanglement with the world and were therefore unavailable toassist wayward seekers, a few “live and teach in the world” “to show mortals theway to free their souls from this prison of flesh.”113 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn113]Their stern guidance was essential. Unlike American ministers, who “spoil theirchurch members by too much coaxing and by lack of administering discipline,”Indian masters who “admonish” their disciples achieve far greater spiritualresults.114 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn114]Fifth, Yogananda used the Gītā commentary to uphold himself as the kind of gurudisciples needed, even hinting at his own divine identity. He never shied awayfrom offering himself as a role model to aspiring yogis. In one case, herecounted how he counseled happy newlyweds to follow his example. “My love formy Eternal Beloved has deepened and ripened. My eyes are more filled with joythan yours ever were. Wake up, without God’s love, your love, which is Hisreflection will fade away. Feed your love with everflowing power of His love, orit will wither into nothingness.”115 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn115] More than a rolemodel, though, he was the guru devotees needed to achieve liberationsuccessfully. Yogananda did not directly equate himself to Krishna, theall-powerful divinity disguised as Arjuna’s human companion. But throughout theseries Arjuna functioned as the role model for readers, while his mentor,Krishna, and Yogananda were both routinely described as model gurus, thusinviting implicit comparison between the two without asserting deityoutright.116 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn116]JESUS CHRIST AS PERFECT YOGIDespite Yogananda’s long efforts on behalf of “the Hindu Bible,” it was not hismost remarkable project as a leader of the global interfaith movement. Thathonor belongs instead to a regular column entitled The Second Coming of Christ.The series began in May 1932, ran through July 1942, and included 118installments.117 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn117] A commentary on the life andteachings of Jesus as presented in the New Testament, this series clearly showedYogananda’s deep interest in Jesus and his desire to draw connections betweenChristianity’s founder and yogic truth.The Second Coming epitomized Yogananda’s version of Hindu-Christian syncretism,a thoroughly inclusivist effort to interpret Jesus and Christianity in light ofuniversal Hindu truth. The title of the series already hinted at Yogananda’slegerdemain. In Christian parlance, the Second Coming traditionally identifiedthe apocalyptic return of the resurrected Jesus to earth in the last days.Christian liberals had generally spiritualized Jesus’s return and often avoidedSecond Coming language, but fundamentalists, evangelicals, and Pentecostalsgenerally continued to anticipate Christ’s literal return. But Yogananda meantsomething quite different by his use of the term: the yoga disciple’s fullexperience of self-realization, which he often termed Christ Consciousness. Thiswas a “Second Coming” in which the believer no longer expected to encounterJesus but aspired to eventually become Jesus. Through his commentary, Yoganandasought to reach a wide group of Americans, some only loosely tied to theChristian tradition but who retained a sense of reverence for Jesus and theBible. He wanted to show that Yogoda was not antithetical to Christianity butrather the substance of which Christianity was merely the shadow. In seeking tounderstand Jesus in light of Hinduism, Yogananda was following the well-trodpath taken by many modern Hindu thinkers. Contemporaries such as Vivekananda,Ramakrishna, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, and Sri Aurobindo devoted some attentionto evaluating Christianity and Jesus. Though their approaches and the level ofattention they devoted varied, they all basically distinguished between Jesus,whom they viewed favorably, and Christianity, which they uniformlycriticized.118 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn118]A commentary on the Gospels was a bolder strategy than his exegesis of the Gītā.There, Yogananda delved deeply into an ancient Hindu text to explain esoterictruths. Here, he aggressively reinterpreted the core of the Christian Bible asHindu truth. The closest parallel to The Second Coming is P. C. Mozoomdar’s 1883The Oriental Christ, which follows Jesus’s career from baptism through theCrucifixion and Resurrection, drawing connections to Indian traditions. ButMozoomdar’s Jesus is still recognizable as the figure from the Gospels.119[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn119] How did Yogananda defend this hermeneutical move? Hewarned about the danger of literal biblical interpretation, which had “causedgreat havoc,” and instead advocated “intuitional perception of truth.”120[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn120] As one SRF monk, Brother Bernard, explained to anunconvinced newcomer, through meditation, Jesus is “becoming a living realityfor people—a being with whom they can commune, instead of one whom they merelyread about in the Bible. This was what Jesus meant when he said that he wouldcome again. Master often speaks of this work as the Second Coming of Jesus—notto return again outwardly, but in the souls of those who loved him and communedwith him.” When the newcomer objected that this understanding was not what mostChristians believed, Bernard replied that Jesus himself rebuked his disciples“for taking his words literally, when he meant them metaphorically.” Thatnewcomer, Donald Walters (later Swami Kriyananda), eventually came to deeplyrespect his master’s exegetical flexibility, but his conversion was gradual. Fora long time, Yogananda would write, “‘This means so and so,’ then turnaround—almost, to my mind, as though correcting himself—and say, ‘But on theother hand, it also means …’ and go on to suggest an interpretation which—again,to my way of thinking—bore little relation to the first one. ‘Can’t he make uphis mind?’ I marveled. ‘How is it possible for the same passage to have bothmeanings?’”121 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn121] The intuitively perceived meaning ofScripture required a spiritual master.Yogananda preempted potential criticism of his understanding of Jesus by takingthe offensive. He accused Christians of allowing petty denominationalism anddogmatism to destroy genuine Christianity, of which he was the legitimaterepresentative. He denounced Christian doctrinal minutiae and used the derisiveterm “Churchianity” to deplore the “hackneyed repetition and revamping of thesame sermon every Sunday.”122 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn122]Rather than adopting the simple strategy of using a passage from the Gospels asa point of departure for a broad thematic teaching, Yogananda took on the muchmore daunting challenge of detailed exegesis. Given how far his interpretationsdiverged from the surface sense of the text, this required him to provideelaborate explanations of symbols, codes, and spiritualized interpretation. Johnthe Baptist’s prophecy that Jesus was the “Lamb of God, who takes away the sinsof the world” referred not to the Passover sacrifice but to the deeperallegorical truth that “Jesus came as the lamb of spirituality, humble, loyal toGod, ready to offer Himself as a sacrifice before the Temple of Truth, so thatby His supreme example of purity, humbleness, and meekness He might act as thegreatest spiritual light to drive away the dark sins of the world.” Hisexpectation of finding yoga meditation techniques in the Gospels led to evenmore imaginative constructions. When John announced that first-century Jewsshould “make straight the way of the Lord,” Yogananda clarified John’s meaningthat Christ Consciousness could only be experienced by meditating with astraight spine.123 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn123] Christian exegetes would doubtlesshave disagreed with Yogananda’s interpretation on nearly every point, but acentury-long democratization of American Protestantism had fashioned “every manhis own interpreter” of the Bible, making idiosyncratic interpretations fairgame.124 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn124]As Yogananda unfolded Jesus’s identity, he made it clear that Christ could onlybe understood in light of India. Yogananda began with a review of Jesus’sbaptism by John the Baptist, as recorded in the Gospels. The reader soon learnedthat baptism was originally an Indian practice; the contemporary Christiansacrament preserved only a faint remnant of that ancient tradition. The nameJesus was not a Greco-Latin modification of the Hebrew name Yeshua, as biblicalscholars supposed. According to Yogananda, it was a corruption of the SanskritIsa, Lord of Creation. Through circuitous argument, Yogananda identified Christwith Krishna. He labeled the state one achieved through meditation ChristConsciousness, which was first achieved by Jadava, a great Indian prophet from1500 B.C.E. who became the āvatara Krishna. Yogananda often spelled the nameChristna to heighten the parallel between the two figures. Thus, the Hindumanifestation of Christ preceded the earthly Jesus by more than a millennium.Though Jesus was a divine figure, Yogananda was emphatic that he was not Godincarnate, as Trinitarian Christians assumed, because “God never created Himselfinto a human being, subject to the weakness of flesh and mental limitations.”125[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn125] Rather, Christ was the fullness of the divinepresence—and awareness of that presence—within a human being.The appearance of the Holy Spirit, which descended on Jesus at his baptism,allowed Yogananda to introduce his understanding of the Trinity directly. Helabored valiantly to stuff this Christian tenet into a Hindu Procrustean bed.The Father represented Cosmic Consciousness residing outside the vibratorycreation, the Spirit was the “creator of creative vibration,” and Christ waspresent in creation as the manifestation of the Father—divine intelligence “tocreate, recreate, preserve, and mould it according to its divine purpose.”126[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn126] If the real Christ was Krishna, the true Trinityresided in a Hindu universe.Apart from the Trinity, readers of The Second Coming of Christ encountered anumber of doctrines they might have heard in more conservative churches,including the historicity of Jesus’s miracles and the existence of angelicbeings. Though these doctrines had been transformed by Yogananda’s interpretiveskills, they were nonetheless precisely the tenets that liberal Christiansattracted to Yogananda had banished from their creeds.Yogananda’s teaching on Satan fits into this category. Satan was an importantfigure for Yogananda, who mentioned him nearly three hundred times throughoutthe series. Yogananda insisted on the reality of metaphysical evil, calling“childish” those who denied its existence and asserting that belief in an“objective Satan,” a fallen archangel, explained “the origin of all evil.127[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn127] Demonic spirits were real, and exorcism had long beenone key yogic power.128 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn128] In defending this view, heshrilly denounced “modern” theologians in terms that sounded trulyfundamentalist. “No amount of skin-deep liberal thinking can explain away theseworks of Jesus of casting out the devils. Because most modern theologians do notknow anything about healing or casting out devils, that does not mean that thephysical and mental and spiritual healing of man is impossible or that castingout of devils is superstition.”129 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn129] Satan tempted Adamand Eve, whose sin was not disobeying God by eating of the Tree of the Knowledgeof Good and Evil, but, in a manner much more in line with Yogananda’s own sexualethic, procreating through sex instead of through willpower.130[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn130] Through a convoluted explanation, Yogananda revealedthat Satan created the mechanism of karma and the cycles of death and rebirth.He also created māyā, the delusion that keeps humans from seeing their truespiritual identity.131 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn131]Yogananda’s discourse about Satan represents a particularly striking example ofhis complex syncretism, placing a distinctively Christian tenet within a Hinducosmos. But his demonology required less of a departure from Hinduism than afirst glance reveals. There is no direct counterpart to Satan, but evilspiritual forces are part and parcel of Hindu cosmology. Hindu writtentraditions—including the Vedas, Epics, and Purāṇas—and oral folk traditionsinclude a host of ghosts, spirits, and demons. Ghosts attack victims and causeillness, functioning as one means of implementing karmic justice.132[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn132] The most powerful harmful forces are essentially evildeities, an “inverted pantheon” that regularly battles the gods. Evil forcespossess humans and harm them in a variety of ways, causing disease, death, andother misfortunes.133 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn133] Prayer, mantras, and variousother remedies can repel such forces. But while Yogananda fought zealously toaffirm the ontological existence of evil forces and the efficacy of yogic powersin defeating them, elsewhere he expressed ambivalence about their existence ashe strove to reconcile this teaching with the conviction that all reality isultimately a manifestation of God.134 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn134]To face Satan’s challenges successfully, Jesus had to fast. Great yogis likeJesus had long practiced this physical discipline, tapping into the stored-upenergy of their “body battery” (a diagram accompanied this description, showinga large, wired-up battery) to demonstrate their victory over physical bodilyneeds. Deep meditation must accompany such physical austerity. When Satantempted Jesus in the desert, Jesus famously retorted, “Man shall not live bybread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.” Yogananda’selaborate paraphrase of this retort brought out Jesus’s underlying meaning:The battery of man’s wisdom, intelligence, life, and body shall not live (besustained) by bread (outer material, solids, liquids, and so forth) alone, butby every word (unit of intelligent living vibration) that proceedeth out of themouth of God. The Cosmic Energy or Life Energy, as it proceedeth out of medulla,through which mouth or opening, God breathes His breath of life (Cosmic Energy)into the soul, mind, and body battery of man.135 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn135]When Jesus went up on a mountainside to pray before selecting his apostles, healso took advantage of “the pure oxygen” there and engaged in breathingexercises “calculated to burn the carbon in the system, quiet the heart andswitch off the life current from the five sense telephones so that thesensations cannot bother the brain and attention directed to God.” He came downthe mountain, picked his twelve disciples, and commissioned them to heal thesick and cast out demons.136 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn136]Jesus’s admonition that his disciples be “wise as serpents, and harmless asdoves” gave Yogananda an opportunity to introduce kuṇḍalinī, the “serpent power”lying coiled at the base of the spine. Yogananda also slipped a discussion ofkuṇḍalinī into one of the central Gospel texts, where Jesus cryptically informedNicodemus that a person must be “born again”—that is, from the Holy Spirit—toenter the Kingdom of God. In Yogananda’s hands, being “born again” became anendorsement of yoga meditation as the mean of lifting the sleeping śakti power.“Jesus said that each Son of Man, or each bodily consciousness, must be liftedfrom the plane of the senses to the Astral Kingdom by reversing the Life Forcethrough the serpent-like coiled passage at the base of the spine. Every time youmediate deeply, you automatically reverse the Life Force and consciousness frommatter to God. This helps to loosen the Astral and physical knot at the base ofthe spine.”137 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn137] As the dialogue between Jesus andNicodemus continued, it moved to Jesus’s climactic statement that “whosoeverbelieves in me shall not perish, but inherit eternal life.” Through Yogananda’salchemy this became, “Whosever believes in the doctrine of lifting the bodilyconsciousness (Son of Man) from the physical to the Astral body reversing theLife Force through the coiled passage at the base of the spine, will not perish,that is, be subject to mortal changes of life and death, but will graduallyacquire the changeless Eternal State.”138 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn138] Jesus’scrucifixion also became a great karmic event, where the “seeds of actions areburned up in the fires of wisdom,” leading him to find immortality beyonddeath.139 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn139]Yogananda routinely used The Second Coming to explore the crucial guru-disciplebond, and hints of Yogananda’s own authority were never far from the surface ofsuch texts. The guru best exemplified Jesus’s own advanced consciousness, andthus held the greatest likelihood of transmitting that knowledge to eagerdisciples. As Yogananda explained, “God uses only about-to-be-perfect souls toserve as examples and teachers to deluded humans.”140 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn140]A guru was thus essential for one’s spiritual journey, someone “who willdiscipline you and take a personal interest in your spiritual welfare and leadyou as far along the spiritual path as you wish to go.” Only in obeying himcould disciples attain their ultimate goal.141 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn141] Therelationship between John and Jesus represented just such a relationship, theonly way in which “complete satisfaction, comfort, and God-consciousness” couldbe found.142 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn142] Conversely, Yogananda warned about thedangers of avoiding transparency before one’s guru, the only person who couldheal a disciple’s illness. “In this way an error-stricken disciple makes hismoral transgression grow upon him. To hide the moral disease from the Spiritualdoctor is extremely dangerous to Spiritual health.”143 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn143]Though Yogananda held out the theoretical possibility that anyone could be “aJesus Christ in one life by proper meditation,” the harsh reality was that eventhough disciples could make spiritual progress, achieving Christ consciousnesswas a truly rare phenomenon.144 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn144] But they could enjoythis achievement vicariously through their affectionate submission to a belovedChristlike guru. Yogananda made abundantly clear that he was one of the raregurus who possessed Christ Consciousness. Thus, beyond Brother Bernard’sexplanation of the “Second Coming of Christ,” this label very likely boreanother meaning. Yogananda, a guru who fully manifested Christ Consciousness,was the Christ who had returned. The veiled character of this assertion bluntedits audacity; more direct revelation awaited a more autobiographical vehicle.AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A DIVINE GLOBAL YOGIOf all the texts that established Yogananda’s vision of himself and his role inthe world, none is more crucial than Autobiography of a Yogi. It does not followconventions familiar to the autobiography genre. Yogananda left out much of hischildhood, including games, likes and dislikes, early schooling, and romanticattractions. He was also largely silent about his twenty-five-year ministry inthe United States, which constituted nearly half of his life at the time ofwriting. The narrative concentrates almost exclusively on his quest to become ayogi. Along that path, he enjoyed many fantastic encounters, and these accountsfill most of the book. This is how one chapter begins:“I saw a yogi remain in the air, several feet above the ground, last night at agroup meeting.” My friend, Upendra Mohun Chowdhury, spoke impressively.I gave him an enthusiastic smile. “Perhaps I can guess his name. Was it BhaduriMahasaya, of Upper Circular Road?”Upendra nodded, a little crestfallen not to be a news-bearer. My inquisitivenessabout saints was well-known among my friends; they delighted in setting me on afresh track.“The yogi lives so close to my home that I often visit him.” My words broughtkeen interest to Upendra’s face, and I made a further confidence.“I have seen him in remarkable feats. He has expertly mastered the variouspranayamas of the ancient eightfold yoga outlined by Patanjali. Once BhaduriMahasaya performed the Bhastrika Pranayama before me with such amazing forcethat it seemed an actual storm had arisen in the room! Then he extinguished thethundering breath and remained motionless in a high state of superconsciousness.The aura of peace after the storm was vivid beyond forgetting.”“I heard that the saint never leaves his home.” Upendra’s tone was a trifleincredulous.“Indeed it is true! He has lived indoors for the past twenty years. He slightlyrelaxes his self-imposed rule at the times of our holy festivals, when he goesas far as his front sidewalk! The beggars gather there, because Saint Bhaduri isknown for his tender heart.”“How does he remain in the air, defying the law of gravitation?”“A yogi’s body loses its grossness after use of certain pranayamas. Then it willlevitate or hop about like a leaping frog. Even saints who do not practice aformal yoga have been known to levitate during a state of intense devotion toGod.”“I would like to know more of this sage. Do you attend his evening meetings?”Upendra’s eyes were sparkling with curiosity.“Yes, I go often. I am vastly entertained by the wit in his wisdom. Occasionallymy prolonged laughter mars the solemnity of his gatherings. The saint is notdispleased, but his disciples look daggers!”145 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn145]Historians have often wondered how to make sense of such a text. Polly Troutcanvases the options:1) The miracles Yogananda describes are veridically, literally true.2) They did not “really” happen as Yogananda perceived them, but he is genuinelyconvinced that they did, and is therefore entirely honest in his account ofthem.3) They did not “really” happen, and Yogananda knows this, but he is using thesestories as metaphorical pedagogical devices. In other words, he is engaging in amode of discourse in which literalist definitions of truth and falsity areirrelevant.4) Yogananda was a liar.146 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn146]While Trout opts for either the second or the third option, some might find herfirst choice attractive. Similar claims have been made in other historicalcontexts. Independent scholar Michael Grosso recounts that whenseventeenth-century Catholic friar Joseph of Cupertino was ordained, he began tolevitate regularly, and “his life was never the same again.”147[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn147] Equally bizarre occurrences have been reported in thecenturies since. Based on these reports, Grosso makes a case for a“parapsychology of religion” that is open to nonrational phenomena, experiencesthat have traditionally been explained as the existence of higher beings, thepower of belief and prayer, out-of-body experiences, mediums, reincarnation,ghosts and apparitions, and even miracles.148 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn148] Herecounts numerous stories from anthropologists and ethnographers—many skepticalof the supramundane by disposition and training—of inexplicable phenomena theyencountered in the field in various parts of the world.149[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn149]Whatever one thinks about the possibility of such phenomena, Yogananda clearlybelieved them to be literally possible—not mere metaphors, as Trout suggests inher third option. His followers, including his first converts, the Lewises,routinely attributed to him the ability to heal, to intervene for their physicalsafety, to read their thoughts, and to predict the future. “Miracles,” SwamiKriyananda explained, “were part of Yogananda’s service to others. He seldomspoke of them, but among those whose lives were associated with his, miracleswere common.”150 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn150]Apart from ontological doubts about supramundane deeds, there are more routinereasons for skepticism about at least some of Yogananda’s claims. Asdemonstrated in chapter 1 [12_chapter01.xhtml], on the rare occasions where hisaccount can be corroborated—his “chance” meeting with Yukteswar and hispresentiments of the death of his mother, brother, and guru—the other source,typically written by a colleague or relative sympathetic to Yogananda, oftenprovides a more mundane explanation. Responding to such divergent accounts,Satyeswarananda cast a jaundiced eye at the Autobiography’s miraculous accounts,blaming the book’s editors for “mystifying” events to appeal to “Christianseekers” who would be drawn to a more devotional understanding of yoga. TheAutobiography bore “the character of a spiritual fiction from the standpoint ofconservative, serious, seekers of truth of Vedic culture.”151[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn151]Trout’s fourth option, the blunt assertion that Yogananda was simply a liar,echoes old tropes about the yogi as charlatan. While anticult myth busters anddisgruntled former SRF members have sometimes made precisely this claim, asdiscussed in the Epilogue, this explanation assumes that Yogananda knowinglyperpetrated a fraud for more than three decades and deceived thousands,including his closest disciples, many of whom have continued to keep SRF alivefor nearly seventy years since his death. This explanation fails to capture theearnestness, conviction, and consistency Yogananda and his successors haveshown.This leaves Trout’s second option, but one that requires some nuance. ForYogananda, the boundary between imagination and reality was fluid. He narratedevents from his childhood, not necessarily as they actually happened, but asthey might have happened or ought to have happened, in order to bring out thepossibilities of an enchanted world. As one scholar of Indian folklore comments,“A story’s lifelikeness … allows events to become believable within it, even ifthey should never occur in everyday life. For though the world created by astory is often similar to lived cultural reality, it is also full of boundlesspossibilities. Within a story, received categories can be combined intofantastic new shapes, and time can jump backward, sideways, or far ahead. … Bystretching conceptions of the possible, narrative … [points] toward transcendentmeanings instead.”152 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn152]The Autobiography was fundamentally designed to persuade readers to accept hisvision of a cosmos suffused with the miraculous—and to reveal himself as a yogiwho could perform such deeds. Believing deeply in the power of the word tocreate reality, he sought to create a shared reality with his readers. Inessence, the text functions as a performative speech act, creating through itsutterance the reality that it asserts.153 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn153] TheAutobiography, then, is best understood as a new scripture for the modern worldin which Yogananda casts himself as the divine savior sent by God to proclaimself-realization through yoga.To exegete the Autobiography as scripture, this section will begin by applying adrastically simplified model of semiotician A. J. Greimas’s structural semanticsthat focuses on how narratives function within their own self-enclosed universesof meaning. Greimas argued that most stories share a few stock features. A storyinvolves a sender commissioning a subject to accomplish some object (sometimes,as in this case, the delivery of a message) for a receiver. Along the way, thesubject faces both obstruction from opponents and assistance from helpers. Thestory’s outcome depends on its genre, a function of the setting in which thenarrative transpires.154 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn154]Analysis of the Autobiography will begin with a consideration of the setting.Yogananda set the story in an imagined India he reappropriated from WesternOrientalists. The pure, spiritual India he constructed was untainted by theWest, which explains the near total absence of the British Empire in hisaccount. And because the quaint India of Orientalist fantasy was rural andpremodern, Yogananda avoided depictions of teeming cities and modern technologyas much as possible. India was thus more than an actual place; it was a parallelreality, an alternative to the disenchanted Western world. Readers couldexperience this alternative reality—wherever they lived—if they sought constantawareness of the spiritual realm. American audiences undoubtedly found it easierto embrace an enchanted universe where astounding miracles transpired every daywhen it was located in the mystical Orient, far from their own workaday lives.Yogananda employed an arsenal of strategies to reenchant the world. First, hegave the Autobiography the texture of sacred writ. He routinely cited sacredtexts in his copious footnotes—the Vedas, Upaniṣads, Bhagavad Gītā, Rāmāyaṇa,and Patañjali’s Yoga Sūtras, as well as the Bible, especially the Gospels—asauthoritative sources. His writing style imitated Scripture with intentionallyarchaic language that evoked the English Bible. In 1946, the proliferation ofEnglish translations of the Bible had not yet begun; the vast majority ofAmerican Protestants knew the Bible through the Authorized, or King James,Version of 1611; Catholics were familiar with the similarly archaic-soundingDouay-Rheims translation. Autobiography readers would have been reminded of theBible because it was the only place they might routinely encounter such datedlanguage. The Autobiography’s first chapter, for example, includes the followingarchaic words found in the King James Bible: “verities,” “dwell,” “blessings,”“bulwarked,” and “beguiling.” As an English speaker for well over two decades,adept in the use of vernacular English, Yogananda’s archaizing seems to be aclearly intentional strategy.He also imitated common Indian storytelling traditions. The narrative quality ofthe Autobiography, like Yogananda’s face-to-face teaching, reflected thehortatory, folkloric character of India’s oral tales. Smaller narrativesgradually accreted around the main narrative, creating a meandering, nonlinearstructure in which one fantastic account segued into another. In this genre,supernatural occurrences routinely take place and historical verifiability isnot the point.155 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn155] Yogananda structured his narrativethrough a series of dialogues with the many strange figures he encountered onhis spiritual path. While making his narrative more lifelike and exciting,dialogues created a story-within-a-story or “frame story” pattern familiar toIndians from the great epics, such as the Mahābhārata and Ramayaṇa, and thePurāṇas.156 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn156]The Autobiography’s narrative trajectory also follows established stages ofIndian hagiography:1) miraculous origins: a child is born under unusual circumstances into awell-off family and grows up demonstrating precocious abilities;2) spiritual search: the individual begins a search for spiritual truth,experiencing humiliation or loss as the trigger for the search or as aconsequence of it;3) initiation by a guru: after many adventures, journeys, and guidance by holymen, the individual finds his guru, who initiates him into a formal spiritualpath;4) growing ministry: the individual, who displays a commanding personality,grows in independent spiritual authority—usually defying some norm orruler—founding his own ashram or sect, confounding spiritual rivals, andgathering an increasing number of followers; and5) approaching the end: often near the end of life (which may be supernaturallyforeknown), the individual achieves spiritual enlightenment, merging with orbecoming God.157 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn157]The one partial exception is step 5. Yogananda certainly depicted his ownspiritual enlightenment, but since he was writing his own hagiography, he couldnot narrate his own death, though he clearly intimated his own divine spiritualenlightenment. This partial exception points to a unique feature of Yogananda’shagiography. Hagiography is rarely autobiographical. Like the epics,hagiographic accounts typically develop over centuries, becoming moreelaborate—and often more fantastic—as later disciples invent new details.Yogananda created a numinous hagiography about himself de novo.He filled this hagiographic narrative world with miraculous events performed byadvanced yogis. Though a great many such events fill the book, they fall into ahalf-dozen different formulaic categories, all of which fit within theexpectations of siddhi powers described in the Yoga Sūtras.158[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn158] Regardless of type, each miracle follows a stockformula:• The narrative begins with an account of the miracle itself.• Next, characters who witness the miracle, including Yogananda, expresssurprise or amazement.• Finally, expressions of surprise provide an opening for an enlightened figureto utter a divine revelation ultimately designed for the reader’s edification.In some cases, the narrative makes clear how the miracle provides practical aidfor a certain character; in others, the miracle serves to evoke awe and aconcomitant explanation of cosmological truth.Exploring exemplary accounts of the different miracle types provides anopportunity to examine the spiritual enlightenment the text provides at thenarrative climax. The first miracle type, levitation, has already beendescribed. In that account, the spiritual revelation was that all physicalreality—including human beings—is composed of energy and the realized yogi cancommand energy to do whatever it wishes. Yogananda’s second miraculous type wasmind reading. As the narrator, Yogananda revealed to the reader something acharacter (often he himself) was thinking. A yogi would vocalize the secretthought accurately and respond authoritatively to it. Not long after Yoganandaand Yukteswar met, for example, the Master provided divinely intuited guidanceabout Yogananda’s life at the Bharat Dharma Mahamandal ashram: “It is time for achange, inasmuch as you are unhappily situated in the hermitage.” Thisannouncement surprised Yogananda, since he had shared nothing about hisunhappiness with Yukteswar. “By his natural, unemphatic manner, I understoodthat he wished no astonished ejaculations” about his insight. Yukteswar’sauthoritative guidance that Yogananda go back to Calcutta to live with hisfamily resolved his dilemma and relieved his secret anguish.159[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn159]Clairvoyance was the third type of miracle. A spiritual authority would announcesome future event in detail, advising an appropriate response or explaining howthe person’s fate could not be avoided. In one case, for example, Yukteswarannounced, “The stars are about to take an unfriendly interest in you, Mukunda.Fear not; you shall be protected. In about a month your liver will cause youmuch trouble. The illness is scheduled to last for six months, but your use ofan astrological armlet will shorten the period to twenty-four days.” Yukteswardirected Yogananda to purchase a silver bangle to lessen the severity of themalady. Because of Yogananda’s excellent health, however, “Master’s predictionslipped from my mind. He left Serampore to visit Benares. Thirty days after ourconversation, I felt a sudden pain in the region of my liver.” Yukteswar’sclairvoyance communicated that fate could be foreknown and, to an extentcounteracted, if one responded with the appropriate faith.160[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn160]The fourth type of miraculous feat was bilocation. A spiritual figure wasexpected to be in one location, but a trustworthy eyewitness met himsimultaneously in a completely different location. The witness remembered somespecific detail that irrefutably proved that the saint really had been in twoplaces at the same time. Swami Pranabananda was meeting with Yogananda at hishome even while he met Yogananda’s friend Kedar Nath Bubu down by the river.When the dual appearances were discovered, Kedar Nath pointed out, “Look, thoseare the very sandals he was wearing at the ghat.” Pranabananda turned toYogananda “with a quizzical smile.” He asked, “Why are you stupefied at allthis? The subtle unity of the phenomenal world is not hidden from true yogis. Iinstantly see and converse with my disciples in distant Calcutta. They cansimilarly transcend at will every obstacle of gross matter.” Rather than being asimple parlor trick, bilocation revealed, like levitation, profound truth aboutmastery over physical matter.161 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn161]Finally, there were the feats of strength: going without food, demonstratingsuperhuman might, or living without breathing for extended periods of time. TheTiger Swami, a man who subdued wild tigers with his own brute strength, mostcolorfully illustrates the Autobiography’s accounts of superhuman power.Challenged by a maharaja to fight his newly captured tiger, the Tiger Swamiprevailed, using uncommon strength. Yogananda vividly relayed the tale as afirst-person account in the Tiger Swami’s own words. After being injured by thetiger, “I swung my left arm in a bone-cracking blow. The beast reeled back,swirled around the rear of the cage, and sprang forward convulsively. My famousfistic punishment rained on his head.” The fight continued as the rivalsexchanged blows. “The cage was pandemonium, as blood splashed in all directions,and blasts of pain and lethal lust came from the bestial throat.” Finally, “Imustered all my will force, bellowed fiercely, and landed a final concussiveblow. The tiger collapsed and lay quietly.”162 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn162] WhileYogananda did not provide parallels to all the abilities Patañjali attributed tosiddhis in the Yoga Sūtras, the narratives he did offer were clearly designed toevoke their supernatural powers.Yogananda recognized that canny modern audiences might be skeptical of theveracity of such amazing claims. He created verisimilitude using a variety ofsubtle, creative strategies, addressing readers’ doubts obliquely rather thanthrough blunt assertions of metaphysical fact. Dialogue was an ally in thisstrategy. Robert Alter’s observation about the Hebrew scriptures’ penchant foravoiding narration in favor of dialogue applies well to the Autobiography: “Theprimacy of dialogue is so pronounced that many pieces of third-person narrationprove on inspection to be dialogue-bound, verbally mirroring elements ofdialogue that precede them or that they introduce. Narration is thus oftenrelegated to the role of confirming assertions made in dialogue.”163[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn163] Yogananda frequently placed himself into dialoguesthat allowed him to play the vicarious role of the reader, portraying himself asopen but needing confirmation. He disarmed skeptics by putting their putativeobjections into his own mouth. Conversely, he put important expressions of truthinto other people’s mouths, allowing them to articulate spiritual truth withoutbeing forced to adopt a didactic role directly himself. For example, whenYogananda’s friend encountered the bilocating swami, he exclaimed, “Are weliving in this material age, or are we dreaming? I never expected to witnesssuch a miracle in my life!”164 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn164] Though Yogananda didnot utter this comment, his ventriloquism subtly won readers to his perspective.Another strategy of verisimilitude was the frequent depiction ofprophecy-fulfillment sequences. The content of prophetic announcements was notalways intrinsically remarkable. Precise forecasting of even mundane futureoccurrences, however, underscored the yogi power of clairvoyance. Since all theprophecies Yogananda recounted had found fulfillment by the time he narratedthem for the Autobiography, a skeptical reader would find it impossible not towonder whether they were all vaticinium ex eventu pronouncements. As Yogananda’sIndian antagonist Swami Satyeswarananda comments, “Ideas were interjected tolook as if some divine hands were working behind the scenes. Mystifications werewell thought out during the ten long years period [sic] of editing theforty-nine chapters from the materials Yogananda had collected. It was writtenwith mystic vibrations which would be attractive to Christians.”165[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn165] Yogananda addressed this problem by creating longnarrative gaps between the announcement of a prophecy and its fulfillment,claiming through the book’s dialogue to have forgotten a specific prophecy untilafter its fulfillment.Having established the setting, it is time to turn to the subject or, better,the protagonist. It will be no surprise that Yogananda is the hero of hisautobiography, though his full identity does not become clear until the end ofthe narrative. The early chapters establish his spiritual precocity, includingthe siddhi feat of remembering his previous existence, a memory that faded ashis soul awakened in the body of the newborn Mukunda. He also describes beingfrustrated with his infant body for refusing to cooperate with his mind’sknowledge and abilities. He wanted to walk, wanted to speak, but could not makehis thoughts coalesce into language until Bengali settled in his mind.Yogananda’s frequent descriptions of his unquenchable spiritual thirst wouldsuggest that he was his own sender—his yearning for spiritual truth propelledhim on his quest. But there are hints throughout, including a prophecy given tohis pregnant mother that she would give birth to a great yogi, that his lifepath was foreordained. This suggests that the narrative’s ultimate sender isGod.Along the way, Yogananda encountered many spiritual figures who functioned ashelpers in his spiritual quest. Most of the yogis who performed the miraculousfeats described above, for example, guided him into deeper understanding. ButSri Yukteswar, as Yogananda’s personal guru, played the most significant role inhis spiritual development. Yogananda labored to show the worthiness of hismentor, a wise and powerful yogi. Then he demonstrated the uniquely intimateguru-disciple relationship he shared with this great master. Beyond theirdramatic first encounter, Yogananda recounted unusual instances of physicalintimacy: touching Yukteswar’s feet, being tenderly cared for while ill, and,most strikingly, sharing his master’s bed as a rare privilege. When Yukteswarappeared to Yogananda after his death, Yogananda recognized him in part by hisdistinctive bodily odor. He also related a number of private revelations ofprivileged information that intimated Yukteswar’s trust and his transmission ofauthority to Yogananda, as the principle vehicle for Yukteswar’s message to theWest.Because plot exists only where there is conflict, the Autobiography is suffusedwith opponents. From his earliest years, opponents at every level conspired tothwart Yogananda’s spiritual journey. But he ultimately prevailed against allodds. Remarkably, his opponents were often his own family members, rather thanmore sinister figures. Nearly every story he recounted from his childhoodinvolved opposition, skepticism, or doubt from a family member regardingappropriate behavior or underlying spiritual reality. These stories were alwaysresolved through Yogananda’s complete vindication, though sometimes only after adelay. For example, when his sister mocked his devotion to the Mother Goddess,Yogananda predicted that the deity would give him victory in a kite battle whereIndian children smeared glass fragments on their kite strings and attempt to cutrivals’ strings. Needless to say, Yogananda got precisely what he foretold,forcing his sister to confess, “Indeed, Divine Mother listens to you! This isall too uncanny for me!” After this remark, she “bolted away like a frightenedfawn.”166 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn166]Yogananda related a number of incidents of opposition from his oldest brother,Ananta, most notably his attempt to keep Yogananda and his friends from escapingto the Himalayas. But there are less dramatic examples. A fortune-tellerpredicted that Yogananda would marry three times. Ananta accepted this prophecyand teased his brother, whose fate was clearly sealed. But Yogananda rejectedthe legitimacy of this prediction; although he did receive three marriagearrangements, he turned them all down—and turned the tables on his brother’smockery.Yogananda even clashed with his father, particularly over the decision whetherto depart immediately when news of his mother’s illness arrived. Yogananda’sprophecy of her death proved prescient, despite his father’s dismissal of hisfears. Yogananda’s conflict with his father is especially surprising, given thathis father was not a religious skeptic but a devoted yoga practitioner whofollowed the same lineage that Yogananda joined.All of these accounts—a very small sampling of a much larger collection—followthe same pattern: through spiritual immaturity, blindness, or mean-spiritedness,Yogananda’s family members all doubted or challenged him. All were eventuallycompelled to admit their error. And Yogananda was never intellectually ormorally in error. The only person free from the taint of opposition was hisbeloved mother, whose death left him so bereft that he never desired to cast heras a stumbling block on his spiritual path. Although Yogananda undoubtedlyexperienced real grievances with family members, he also magnified relativelyminor tensions to make his life—which was not especially difficult—conform tothe hagiographic pattern of struggle.As the story’s subject or hero, Yogananda succeeds in his goal of proclaimingthe message of yoga not only to spiritually hungry America but also to the worldat large. The final chapter finds Yogananda in his beautiful Encinitas ashram,overlooking the great Pacific Ocean, writing the very volume that readers holdin their hand. After surveying his rapid institutional expansion—with newtemples in Washington, D.C., Hollywood, and San Diego—he hinted at plans he hadhatched with Minott Lewis for a new global venture, a World Colony of AllNations.“‘World’ is a large term, but man must enlarge his allegiance, consideringhimself in the light of a world citizen,” I continued. “A person who trulyfeels: ‘The world is my homeland; it is my America, my India, my Philippines, myEngland, my Africa,’ will never lack scope for a useful and happy life. Hisnatural local pride will know limitless expansion; he will be in touch withcreative universal currents.”Dr. Lewis and I halted above the lotus pool near the hermitage. Below us lay theillimitable Pacific.“These same waters break equally on the coasts of West and East, in Californiaand China.” My companion threw a little stone into the first of the oceanicseventy million square miles. “Encinitas is a symbolic spot for a world colony.”The Autobiography closes with Yogananda’s reflection, “Lord, … Thou hast giventhis monk a large family!”167 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn167] The celibate guru fromIndia had adopted many American children, and he looked forward to adopting manymore from all over the world.A structural reading of the Autobiography thus suggests a scriptural account ofthe divine messenger’s successful quest to share yoga with the world. But theAutobiography, like the Bhagavad Gītā commentary and The Second Coming ofChrist, points beyond Yogananda’s role as a mere missionary of yoga to somethingmore profound. Throughout the book, Yogananda routinely rehearsed his spiritualpedigree through an unbroken line of yogis from the mysterious Babaji, a“deathless” guru in the remote Himalayas; to Babaji’s disciple Lahiri Mahasaya,whose devotees included Yogananda’s own parents; and to Yukteswar, Yogananda’spersonal guru. Those great self-realized yogis merited titles like Yogi-Christ,divine guru, Savior, Divinity Itself in the form of flesh. In the preface W. Y.Evans-Wentz proclaimed the link between Yogananda and these other yogis. “Thevalue of Yogananda’s AUTOBIOGRAPHY is greatly enhanced by the fact that it isone of the few books in English about the wise men of India which has beenwritten, not by a journalist or foreigner, but by one of their own race andtraining—in short, a book ABOUT yogis BY a yogi.”168 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn168]As a yogi like his illustrious forebears, Yogananda was at least their equal.But since his global ministry far exceeded theirs, arguably he surpassed them.Given their already exalted status, this could only mean that he was presentinghimself as a new Christ figure.Yogananda mentions Jesus Christ roughly three dozen times in the Autobiography.Mostly he presents Jesus as a yogi and describe yoga’s goal as the production of“Yogi Christs.” Thus, Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, and Yukteswar are all describedas “Christ-like,” as is Ramakrishna, unofficial mentor to Yogananda and officialmentor to Vivekananda.169 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn169] Other references implyparallels between events in Jesus’s life and Yogananda’s. Jesus left his familybehind to conduct a ministry of teaching, healing, and discipleship. Jesussuffered in his body as a “ransom for the sins of many,” just as Yogananda, whohad experienced physical difficulties by the time he wrote the Autobiography,suffered in bearing the karmic burdens of his disciples. And when Yoganandaclaimed, “If Christ returned to earth and walked the streets of New York,displaying his divine powers, it would cause the same excitement,” the thinlyveiled reference to his own early ministry in America is unmistakable.170[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn170]Yogananda, then, was not simply the subject or protagonist of the Autobiographycommissioned by God to carry out the object of spreading the word about yoga tohis receivers in America. In the final analysis, the narrative reveals that hewas to offer himself—as an exemplar, a faultless guide, and even more a divinepresence—to the world. He thus became both subject and object of his own story.And in revealing this truth about Yogananda, the scripturelike Autobiographybecame the most important medium for disseminating this message.Given such grand claims by a relatively unknown swami, it is little surprisethat critical reception of the Autobiography was generally dismissive. Therewere exceptions, to be sure. Newsweek called Yogananda “an authentic Hindu yogi”and praised his efforts to provide an “autobiography of the soul” rather “thanof the body,” giving him the final word as he expounded on the “consciousness ofa perfected yogi.”171 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn171] But Time was more typical. In abackhanded compliment, its reviewer thought the book showed “exceedingly wellhow an alien culture may change when transplanted by a businesslike nurserymanfrom the tough soil of religious asceticism into hothouses of financial wealthand spiritual despair.”172 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn172] The book merited only acapsule review in the New York Times, which read in its entirety: “A rareaccount of the Indian cult from within, by one who practices it, with manyphotographs. An incident is contact with Luther Burbank and his talks with theplants which responded to his conversation.”173 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn173] Areview in the Chicago Daily Tribune Review entitled “Study of Yogi Mysticism andSwami Tricks” described the book as a series of miracles the author attempted toexplain in the language of modern science. “Whether he succeeds in this, ormerely wraps one mysticism up in another, you will have to judge foryourself.”174 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn174] The peer-reviewed Philosophy East andWest offered the most denunciatory review. “The book, widely advertised andread,” University of Hawaii professor S. K. Sachsen commented, “will no doubtacquaint the reader with India, yoga, and Swami Yogananda, but whether it willportray them truly is quite doubtful. Truth never suffers so much from itsopponent as from its over-zealous devotee.” Sachsen was impatient with thebook’s frequent descriptions of miracles, but more with Yogananda’sself-identification as a yogi, as “it is not traditional for a yogi in India tospeak of himself as such; nor does a spiritual man style himself by the highesttitle ‘Paramhansa,’ which is reserved for only those rare souls who haveattained their liberation from the bondage of earthly life and activity and livein complete equanimity of mind.”175 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn175]International reviews showed only slightly more enthusiasm. A China WeeklyReview began by noting, “The contents of this book are unusual, to say theleast.” Yogananda’s miracle accounts “arouse curiosity rather than conviction,”including his account of passing his university exams without studying, whichthe reviewer thought “faintly ludicrous.” But the reviewer enjoyed thephilosophical passages and ultimately found that the book was worth reading.Given recent Western interest in the Orient, “some idea of Eastern spiritualdevelopment is essential.”176 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn176] A 1950 review of theDutch translation damned the Autobiography with faint praise. Apart from someesoteric content, the book was most interesting “as an intimate description oflife in India,” and some passages, as when “the young boys set out on their ownto become hermits in the Himalayas, are not devoid of humor.”177[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn177] Only the Times of India provided a gushing, if brief,endorsement: “The autobiography of this sage makes captivating reading, and itsvalue lies in the portrait of saints he has presented to the reader, spiritualgiants portrayed with remarkable fidelity to truth.”178[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn178]But professional reviews fail to capture the full picture. Popular interest inthe Autobiography, both in the United States and abroad, belied these negativeassessments. Within eighteen months of its American publication, theAutobiography had been translated into Bengali, Hindi, Spanish, French, Dutch,and Swedish, and a British edition had been prepared. Global interest was due inno small part to SRF’s aggressive promotion of “the book that is awakeningthousands.” As SRF beamed, “This is the first time that an authentic Hindu yogihas written his life experiences for a Western audience. India’s great masterslive in these unforgettable stories told by Paramhansa Yogananda, chosen tobring their message to all. Entertaining from cover to cover.”179[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn179] Enthusiastic responses poured in from all overEngland, Australia, Germany, Sweden, Austria, Canada, Argentina, Kenya, andItaly thanking SRF for publishing a “wonderful,” “marvelous,” “fascinating”book, “the greatest reading experience of my life.” Some readers wrote in to saythat the Autobiography provided spiritual truth they had been seeking theirwhole lives, and others confessed that they did not even know such truth existedbefore reading the book. Most, however, recognized that the book went beyondrevealing truth, whether esoteric or practical. They understood that theAutobiography’s central message was about the yogi who told his story within itspages. As one Viennese reader implored Yogananda, “I ask you for help, DivineMaster! Don’t refuse my request! Teach me Kriya Yoga. Give me a sign of yourgrace which makes me an accepted disciple of your group. Grant my supplication!Sitting at your sacred feet, I am waiting for a word of response from you.”180[18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn180]PARAMAHANSA, GLOBAL GURU AND GURUDEVBy the late 1940s, thanks in no small part to the Autobiography, Yogananda wasat the height of his influence. In 1949, feeling confident and ambitious,Yogananda launched another spiritual business venture. He opened SRF Café alongCalifornia’s Pacific Coast Highway in Encinitas. The prime location along theroute from L.A. to San Diego and Mexico provided plenty of free advertising.Travelers’ eyes were drawn to the thirty-foot gold-domed facade of Golden LotusGateway and then to the sign announcing in bold capital letters,“MUSHROOMBURGERS.”181 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn181] A more ambitious venture thanNutritive Nuggets, SRF Café offered a variety of vegetarian items—someunfamiliar to most Americans—in an effort to turn a profit offering healthy foodchoices. An advertisement announcing the café’s opening sounded trulyevangelical as it proclaimed, “HERE’S GOOD NEWS!”182 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn182]“You’ll be very much pleased,” readers were reassured, “with the home cookedfoods served here, and with the atmosphere of peace and cheer which pervadesthis unique establishment.”183 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn183] The café’s menu offered“the finest foods and juices.” The most prominent item was the mushroomburgeritself. Other unusual menu options for the era included carrot juice made from“garden-fresh carrots grown in the Colony” and omelets with “special currysauce.” Some foods, though, were much more familiar fare, such as fresh-bakedpies and homemade ice cream. Customers could purchase frozen mangoes andcoconuts. In short, SRF Café offered a combination of exotic and familiar foods,all of which were flavorful while also being ostensibly healthy. If thatcombination was not inducement enough, Yogananda resorted to the familiar tacticof testimonial: “Distinguished world-traveled guests have proclaimed our foodunexcelled anywhere.”184 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn184] The world café seemed afitting gesture from a global guru.The growth and expansion of SRF by the late 1940s largely matched Yogananda’sglobal vision. En route to this position, SRF had experienced expansion,contraction, and relocation. At the onset of World War II, there werethirty-four SRF centers, including overseas centers in London, Latvia,Johannesburg, and seven in India. By the late 1940s, at least a dozen centershad closed, including some in prominent cities—many of which had beenestablished for a number of years. Santa Barbara, Fresno, San Francisco, NewYork, Chicago, Saint Louis, Cincinnati, Dayton, Saint Paul, Milwaukee, and SaltLake City centers present in 1940 had disappeared by 1948. Some shrinkage likelyresulted from negative press surrounding another lawsuit by a former partner.Sri Nerode claimed that Yogananda had been “conducting himself in a matterrepugnant to the organization and been teaching doctrines opposed to those ofthe Hindu self-realization philosophy.” Among other things, Yogananda’s allegedmisconduct included holding himself up as “a sort of deity.’” Nerode alsoclaimed that Yogananda lived in luxurious conditions and was “visited at alltimes of night by young women.” As a coauthor of many SRF materials, Nerode wasalso upset by being cut out of the ministry’s profits, which he calculated at amillion dollars. Nerode lost the suit when Yogananda’s attorney produced lettersproving that no partnership existed between the two. Having learned his lessonfrom the earlier Dhirananda lawsuit, Yogananda had required Nerode to sign arelease indicating that he would never claim “any part of the proceeds derivedfrom Swami Yogananda’s Correspondence Course, or his books, magazine, or anyincome of his whatsoever.” He would receive only “free minimum board and lodgingfor his services,” and could be let go at any time.185 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn185]Whatever the reasons for earlier center closures, SRF experienced consistentpost–World War II growth with several notable features. First, SouthernCalifornia remained the organization’s spiritual center, with a new church inLong Beach and a temple in San Diego. The Lake Shrine, a Pacific Palisadesmeditation site, was dedicated in a public ceremony attended by the Californialieutenant governor.186 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn186] Most significantly, Yoganandaoversaw construction of a temple in Hollywood, on the prominent thoroughfare ofSunset Boulevard. Lined by palm trees, it conveyed his aspiration to be at thesymbolic center of Southern Californian culture. An “India Center” auditoriumwas added to the site in 1951. Second, the earlier broad national dispersion ofSRF centers disappeared, as major eastern and midwestern cities no longer hostedgroups, perhaps as a consequence of lingering patriotism stirred by the war thatmade a religion with foreign roots less attractive.187 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn187]If nothing else, the closures indicate the tenuous hold many of these centershad. The establishment of new centers offset these losses, with the number offacilities at thirty-five by 1948. Finally, the growth of international centerswas quite remarkable. Eight centers in India were complemented by a dozenothers: two in England, one in Germany, four in West Africa, two in Mexico, andtwo in Canada. The importance of the British Dominion is clear, as all but threeof the international centers were in current or former British territories. Morethan half of all Self-Realization Fellowship centers were now located overseas,symbolizing an important international shift in membership and outlook.Images [../figures/f0199-13.jpg]The Lake Shrine in Pacific Palisades (bottom) and the Encinitas Hermitage, twoquintessential SRF sites in prime Southern California locations.

The pedestrian crosswalk is called“Swami’s Ped Xing” in reference to nearby Swami’s Beach, named in honor ofYogananda.E. E. Dickinson, whose receipt of a silver cup confirmed the identity ofYogananda as his true guru, became an exemplar of the many followers around theworld who had a similar epiphany in the 1940s. The Autobiography clearly did itswork well, enlightening readers and drawing seekers from across the country toprostrate themselves at their guru’s feet, whether literally or onlymetaphorically. The book’s hints about the author’s divine status representedthe culmination of a tradition that had been under way for more than a decade.By the time his revised correspondence course was published in the late 1930s,he was already informing disciples that God “can fully manifest through the bodyof your Guru (preceptor)” and directing them to include him in the pantheon ofdivine figures they evoked in prayer:O Spirit, Sri Krishna, Sri Christ, Saints of All Religions,Supreme Master Babaji, Great Master Lahiri Mahasaya, MasterSwami Sriyukteswarji, Guru-Preceptor Paramhansaji, I bow to youall. Free my life from all obstacles and give me material, mental, andSpiritual development.188 [18_notes.xhtml#c4.fn188]"},{"pageContent":"FIVETHE DEATH OF AN IMMORTAL GURUCHARISMA, SUCCESSION, AND PARAMAHANSA YOGANANDA’S LEGACY, 1946–1952By 1952, Brahmachari Jotin had enjoyed the longest relationship with Yoganandaof any remaining disciple. One of three Self-Realization Fellowship leaders bornin India, he had been an ashram student at Ranchi when Yogananda left for theUnited States in 1920. Summoned by Yogananda, he joined the American ministry in1928. The other two Indian colleagues, Dhirananda and Nerode, had long ago leftafter acrimonious disputes with Yogananda about his authority and unwillingnessto share ministry proceeds. Jotin served the Washington, D.C., centerfaithfully, enduring many hardships and ultimately earning Yogananda’s admiringacknowledgment: “Jotin, what you have accomplished in Washington, I could nothave done.”1 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn1] In 1941, during one of the many summers hespent with his guru at Encinitas, Jotin was ordained by Yogananda and took thetitle Swami Premananda.Given the long, affectionate relationship the two shared, Yogananda’s death onMarch 5, 1952, came as a heavy blow to Premananda. He wrote in the second personwhen recounting his final viewing of Yogananda’s physical body, a reflection ofhis belief in his master’s continued spiritual presence. “Immersed in ethericradiance your earthly form laid still—still as the summit of the Everest Mountbeneath the star-lit heaven of midnight blue. Even in death your countenance wasshining in a heavenly glow.” Praying for one more encounter with his guru, he“placed my right hand upon your heart and motioned to my fellow sister disciplesto do the same. … I felt your presence.” Then a miracle occurred. “To assure usof your presence among us and the joyousness of your soul you shed tears. Tearsof love and joy trickled down the corners of both of your closed eyes. Thedisciples stood transfixed observing this unbelievable occurrence.” Premanandacommanded those present not to share what they had witnessed. Shortlythereafter, he witnessed Yogananda’s soul departing its body.2[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn2]The leaders present deliberated over what to do with their master’s body,ultimately deciding for local burial. James Lynn asked Premananda to performYogananda’s funeral, “the holy rite of liberation.” This made Premananda “thelast hand to touch your sacred body.” As he touched Yogananda’s shoulders,heart, and forehead, he chanted a mantra,By the touch of this fire, this body is purified,By the touch of this water, this body is returned to its immortal nature,By the touch of this sandalwood paste, this body is returned to God withdevotion.But however great the honor of conducting his master’s funeral rites, theearlier bedside scene held greater significance. Premananda sensed thatYogananda had called him immediately after his dehatyag, or renunciation of thebody, “that I may receive a small portion of your deathless life to my life. Inyour death you gave the affirmation of the transitory nature of the body and theimmortality of the soul. What greater blessing can a disciple receive from hisGurudeva?”3 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn3] Premananda interpreted the “small portion”of Yogananda’s “deathless life” as a unique transfer of charisma from his guruthat authorized him to minister with Yogananda’s blessing, authority, andprestige.Premananda would not be the only disciple to make this claim. In the wake ofYogananda’s death, many disciples would make similar assertions, both those whoremained within SRF and those, like Jotin, who went their separate ways. Whetherthey had enjoyed lengthy relationships with Yogananda or much shorter trainingperiods, these personal disciples continued to feel equally close to theMaster—and equally qualified to wear his spiritual mantle.Who were the people who chose to follow this Indian guru? They were spiritualseekers who embraced not only Yogananda’s instruction in Kriya Yoga but also hiscall for total surrender to his authority. They became members of a distinctivereligious community and, in most cases, abandoned their prior religiouscommitments in order to follow Yogananda. Given America’s continued Christiancultural ethos, discipleship often represented a significant sacrifice.The first section of this chapter identifies common patterns among those whochose to follow Yogananda, by applying a model of conversion to the profiles ofmore than a dozen disciples. It concludes with an examination of disciples’experiences, particularly the ways they responded to the intense demandsYogananda placed on their spiritual apprenticeship amid a culture of permissivebehavior and exalted individualism.The circumstances surrounding Yogananda’s death are considered in the secondsection. Yogananda had suffered from poor health for years, so those closest tohim may have expected his death. But to most of the community, his passing was ashock—sixty-year-old Yogananda had taught for years about a yogi’s ability toincrease human longevity through overall health and the destruction of karmicseed, as described in Yoga Sūtra II.13—that needed to be explainedtheologically. This section also examines the way core disciples began toremember Yogananda and his teachings almost immediately after his departure.The third section explores the crisis in leadership that Yogananda’s deathproduced. Max Weber’s model of the routinization of charisma and subsequentmodifications offer insight into how SRF coped with the death of theircharismatic leader. Yogananda, anticipating the leadership vacuum his deathwould create, had provided a partial solution by indicating that his writingswere to become the “guru.” Still, the sprawling international organizationrequired a leader, and finding the right one proved difficult. After a briefperiod under Lynn’s leadership, SRF enjoyed stability and growth through DayaMata’s decades-long presidency.But this represents the response only within SRF itself. A number of disciplesleft SRF to form their own organizations, out of dissatisfaction with SRF’sleadership or simply a desire to become independent spiritual leaders. Thechapter concludes by exploring the organizations formed by a half-dozendifferent individuals who represented a range of positions on a spectrum—somevery faithful to Yogananda and his teachings, others quite different—while allclaiming direct authority from their former guru. Some of these organizationsdied quickly, but those that survived became part of the communal phenomenon ofthe baby boomer counterculture, thus providing a bridge between Yogananda andlater New Age expressions of Hindu-inspired spirituality and yoga.CONVERTING TO YOGANANDA’S RELIGIOUS VISIONYogananda’s ministry in the United States began in the Roaring Twenties,survived the cataclysms of the Great Depression and World War II, and continuedinto the dawn of the Cold War. During these three decades, he drew thousands offollowers, who ranged widely in their level of commitment. Many individuals wereonly mildly curious, enrolling in the correspondence course and dropping outafter a few lessons. After 1946, some read the Autobiography and felt inspiredto live according to its insights, becoming followers in a loose sense. Morecommitted devotees persisted in the lessons until they reached the stage ofKriya Yoga initiation. In some cases, they relied entirely on the lessons astheir form of instruction, but those fortunate enough to live near a local SRFcenter strengthened their faith by attending weekend services.Those who embraced Yogananda completely often jettisoned their previousreligious practices. Though he expressed religious tolerance rather thanexclusivism, he also positioned his instruction, not as a supplementalmeditative routine one might occasionally practice in an otherwise full life,but as an all-encompassing spiritual vision for life.Self-Realization Fellowship advertised in newspapers’ religion section, andlocal centers functioned more like churches than local yoga studios or YMCAs,instructing attendees in a range of theological, ethical, and cosmologicaldoctrine. Yogananda went out of his way to emphasize SRF’s churchlike features.Unlike Hindu ritual, which was mostly home and family based, Yoganandainstituted a strong culture of weekly worship. Services took place on Sundaymornings and featured Scripture-based sermons, singing, and Sunday schoolclasses. Some centers were explicitly named churches, like the Hollywood center,which was dedicated as the Self-Realization Church of All Religions.4[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn4] Christmas and Easter were the most important services ofthe year, and Yogananda always printed special season-themed talks about thebirth of the Christ Child and the Resurrection in his magazine. In hisinclusivist vision, Yogananda seems to have seen SRF as a replacement fortraditional Christian churches, whose outmoded focus on doctrinal details leftthem spiritually dead.Even if that was not Yogananda’s intention, in practical terms deep involvementin SRF precluded commitment to another church. Thus, it is instructive to viewfollowers’ embrace of Yogananda as a form of conversion. This conversion couldincur higher social costs than membership in a more conventional religion, as aHindu-based movement fell well outside the mainstream of American tradition. AsAndrea Jain says in a related context, a “global market for spiritual goodsrequired marketers to calculate the costs for products associated with unpopularideas or practices.”5 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn5] Disciples committed to more than aset of cosmological tenets or spiritual practices. Devotion to Yoganandarequired deep dedication, as he made extravagant claims about his personalidentity and expected exceptional personal loyalty.Remaining in the religious tradition in which one is raised—or one’s lack oftradition, in the rare case of an SRF follower who came from a spirituallyuninvolved background—is the default option, and “most people” exposed to a newreligion, Lewis R. Rambo points out, “say no to conversion.”6[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn6] To understand Yogananda’s ministry, therefore, it iscrucial to determine what drew people to him and his teachings. A number ofdisciples from the earliest days through the late period of his ministry leftrecollections of their relationship with their guru. Nearly twenty such accountsare considered in this chapter. This does not include the stories of conversionsthat have already been described, such as Minott and Mildred Lewis and JamesLynn. Nor does the chapter explore the biographies of Yogananda’s Indian friendsDhirananda and Nerode, who are best understood not as disciples but ascolleagues. The accounts explored here include written spiritual biographies andautobiographies, both formally and personally published, and recorded oralrecollections. Self-Realization Fellowship sponsored some, others were producedby SRF members independently of the organization, and still others were producedcompletely independently—without SRF’s blessing or approbation. Most werewritten decades after the events they record; some are hagiographic, othersself-serving. Those who took the effort to provide accounts of their experienceswith Yogananda were often the most fervent disciples, and this passionateperspective should be kept in mind. Despite these accounts’ limitations,together they constitute a group profile of the type of spiritual seeker drawnto Yogananda. Though varying in length of time with the master, gender, orprevious station of life, together they attest to his captivating presence, deepwisdom, miraculous power, and spiritual authority. This magnetic guru invitedthem to swear total devotion, and they obeyed him in matters great and small,submitting to tasks that were a joy to carry out as well as demands that theyfound hard to accept.Based on an adaptation of religious sociologists Lewis R. Rambo and Charles E.Farhadian’s model of conversion, this chapter traces the typical path ofYogananda’s disciples in three stages:7 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn7]• The first stage includes the backgrounds of disciples and the crisis thatfrequently led to their spiritual quest.• The next analyses the disciples’ first encounter with Yogananda, often atranscendent experience that became the moment of conversion, ending their questand launching them on the path of discipleship.• The final stage explores the relationship the disciples had with their guru, arelationship marked by deep intimacy, profound spiritual experiences, and evensome playfulness. But discipleship fundamentally demanded “attunement,” totalsubjection to Yogananda as a father figure and to his sometimes ruthless“scolding.” These disciples recognized both at the time and much later that suchrebuke was unpleasant and often ran counter to their own perceptions aboutappropriate behavior. Their willingness to submit to such treatment neverthelesstestifies powerfully to the trust they accorded their guru and his ability totransform their character.Scholars of conversion suggest that a crisis—religious, political,psychological, or cultural—often catalyzes a spiritual quest. Although Rambo andFarhadian present crisis and quest as two separate stages, the two cannot beeasily separated. These two stages typically happen simultaneously, and seekers’perception of crisis is often retrospective—that is, people do not recognizethemselves to have been in crisis until they begin or even complete their quest.Common crises include illness, a “growing sense of dissatisfaction with life asit is,” and a restless desire for transcendence.8 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn8]The seekers whose quest eventually led them to Yogananda fit this pattern. Manyexperienced at least one substantial hardship early in their lives that couldreasonably be seen as a crisis. Several, for example, suffered from a severechildhood illness. Mary Buchanan was ravaged by scarlet fever as a child, andEdith Anne Ruth D’Evelyn suffered a number of serious physical ailmentsthroughout her childhood.9 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn9] These physical maladies oftencontributed to feelings of emotional distress. Faye Wright, a shy, earnestsixteen-year old the year she met Yogananda, suffered from a disease that caused“blood poisoning,” which left her face bandaged and her self-esteem battered.10[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn10] Roy Eugene Davis grew up in the 1930s on an Ohio farm,where he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis as a teen. He was bed-bound forfive long, lonely months.11 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn11]Others suffered the loss of a parent, which created both financial and emotionalstrain. John Laurence, for example, came of age on a Wyoming Indian reservation,the son of a U.S. Army Medical Corps father and a devoutly Catholic mother.Following his mother’s prodding, Laurence went to seminary to prepare for thepriesthood. But his father’s sudden death in the Great Depression created familyhavoc and forced a career change.12 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn12] Mary Peck sufferedthe loss of her father in a different way. An often-absent navy man, he was araging alcoholic who routinely threatened to kill his family when he was athome.13 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn13]Several later disciples experienced both a serious illness and the loss of aparent, often in quick succession. Florina Darling was born sickly after anoutbreak of diphtheria among her family claimed her sixteen-year-old sister’slife. Her father left to find a job in Detroit, so she grew up functionallyfatherless.14 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn14] D’Evelyn also lost her father when shewas young, and her family remained poor after her mother remarried and moved toMinnesota.15 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn15] After Davis recovered from rheumatoidarthritis, his mother died and he became the meal preparer for his father andyounger sister.16 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn16]A few suffered various less severe hardships. Buchanan’s parents separated whenshe was twelve, and she grew up with her mother in an era before divorce waswidespread.17 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn17] Mildred Hamilton, a bright girl and goodstudent, had to leave school in eighth grade to help her family survivefinancially.18 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn18] Like those who suffered harsheradversities, these milder experiences created a sense of restlessness, a searchfor meaning, and often a hope of healing that eventually led them to Yogananda.Finding Yogananda was often the end of a spiritual quest that had begun longbefore. Many of his closest disciples were from Catholic or liberal Protestantfamilies, representing the nation’s majority religious tradition. But adisproportionate number relative to their extremely small populations came fromsuch nonmainstream religious traditions as Mormonism, Christian Science, andTheosophy. Many converts were, like Americans who embraced Buddhism around thistime, “intellectual nonconformists or cultural dissenters” disillusioned withmainstream Christianity but still drawn to spirituality. But Yogananda’sdevotees were much less likely to be coastal or urban than Buddhist converts—andmuch more likely to be female.19 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn19] Yogananda’s Americanfollowers also parallel the Indians drawn to divine gurus in the pasthalf-century: uprooted individuals, often urban dwellers, disillusioned bymodern materialism and longing for reenchantment.20 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn20]Several later devotees had already developed an interest in Indian spiritualitythat served as a stepping-stone toward Yogananda’s particular brand of Hinduism.Some ventured out from deeply religious nonmainstream spiritual traditions toseek Hindu wisdom. Faye Wright and her sister Virginia descended from the firstMormon families that had settled in Utah in the 1840s. Restless with Mormonism,Faye spent her teen years as a deep seeker after spiritual truth. She had beenreading the Bhagavad Gītā for at least two years when she heard Yoganandaspeak.21 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn21] Leo Cocks grew up in San Jose in the 1930s,part of a family that practiced Vedānta.22 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn22] During hisconvalescence, Davis read extensively about psychology and religion, feelingdrawn especially to the Transcendentalists and Indian texts.23[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn23] Donald Walters eagerly consumed books about India—theUpaniṣads, the Bhagavad Gītā, the Mahābhārata, texts on yoga—before he learnedabout Yogananda through the Autobiography.24 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn24]By contrast, a few found Hinduism from backgrounds that epitomized Americanestablishment Christianity. D’Evelyn married Clark Prescott Bissett, anEpiscopal divinity student who left the clergy for law and, eventually,university teaching. A woman with deep spiritual curiosity, D’Evelyn read Indiantexts as a young woman and had the opportunity to meet the poet RabindranathTagore when he visited the West Coast. Encountering her “first definite teachingof Hindu truth in 1909,” she reflected, “I will never be the same again.”25[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn25]For some, the journey was literal as well as metaphorical. As a young teen,Swiss-born Henry Schaufelberger spent a summer in the mid-1930s with his uncle,who delivered discourses to him on “karma, reincarnation, the astral and causalplanes, and particularly on saints.” Schaufelberger pressed his uncle on how toachieve bliss, but his uncle could provide no clear direction. “He said that onehas to have a guru who could teach everything. When I expressed my great desireto meet one, he just shook his head and smiled. ‘My poor boy, there are no gurusin Switzerland!’”26 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn26] When he moved from Switzerland tothe United States in 1948 to study architecture under Frank Lloyd Wright,Schaufelberger made a point of tracking Yogananda down at the Hollywood temple.What transpired when converts first encountered their future guru? Like mostAmericans, they were struck first by his appearance. In 1931, when Mary Peck wasseven years old, she and her mother met Yogananda in San Diego. Young Mary wasintrigued by his robe, his brown skin, and his long, dark, wavy hair that hebrushed back “with a graceful sweep of his hand.”27 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn27] Butthis first glimpse was no mere novelty. It was an epiphany. Faye Wright thoughthe glowed in a golden light, dressed in his ocher robe.28[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn28] Most were struck by Yogananda’s face and particularlyhis eyes, which offered a window into his soul. Schaufelberger was transfixedwhen he “looked into those deep luminous tender eyes” for the first time.29[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn29] At her first encounter with Yogananda, “those browneyes” mesmerized Corinne Forshee. Photos, she thought, never adequately capturedhis most perfect face.30 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn30] When Darling saw him inDetroit in December 1927, she was “riveted to the beautiful face,” her soul“sensing the God-like soul within the outward form.” He was the “most beautifulman I had ever seen, in his orange robe and long black flowing hair on hisshoulders, and his large lotus, dark, expressive eyes.”31[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn31] Yogananda’s physical appearance provided thesedevotees, men and women, with their first transcendent experience of theirMaster, which they could describe only in the intimate language of grace,beauty, and attraction.When they met Yogananda or first heard him speak, future disciples frequentlyexperienced an immediate emotional bond. This phenomenon typically includedintense physical symptoms that signaled a transcendent encounter. MeetingYogananda after a Sunday service, Henry Schaufelberger became spirituallyintoxicated. “The moment he touched me, I was drunk, and completely drunk. Nothat was the real stuff. That was the stuff of the mystics.” Leaving theservice, he was unable to contain his “unbelievable bliss.” He staggered downthe street, laughing out loud.32 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn32] The moment Faye Wrightheard Yogananda speak, she knew that her spiritual search had ended. All thereligious speakers she had heard before faded into insignificance. “He knowsGod,” she thought for the first time about any person, instantly transportedinto a higher state of consciousness. When she approached Yogananda a few dayslater, asking to join his ashram, and he replied, “and you shall,” a “bolt oflightning” went through her.33 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn33]This description was not unique. In recounting the moment of transcendentencounter with Yogananda, disciples often evoked the language of power orelectricity he often used in his teachings. An “electric wave” went intoDarling’s arm and through her body when she took Yogananda’s hand.34[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn34] Hamilton recalled the “electric shock” she felt whenshe first looked into his eyes, which followed her from “stem to stern.” Afterthat, she belonged to him completely.35 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn35] The first timeCocks met Yogananda, he knew nothing about him. As Yogananda began teachingbefore a meditation session, Cocks felt profoundly empowered. “It was just likeeverything opened up! I became my heart, my chest opened up, my heart had wingsand I flew up out of my body about eight or ten feet. I could see him, and Iinstantly just felt, ‘Oh, He is my guru! He is my guru!’”36[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn36]Those whose quest had been launched by their physical suffering often foundwholeness in Yogananda’s presence. Disciples routinely testified to his abilityto heal. This included the physical healing Minott Lewis and his children hadexperienced and the emotional restoration a world-weary James Lynn had found.Faye Wright’s younger brother was delivered from fainting spells. And she washealed of her “blood poisoning” illness within a week of being touched byYogananda during a class on divine healing. Her illness never returned.37[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn37]Even when he did not relieve the physical symptoms, Yogananda’s detailedexplanation of the intricacies of karma provided a coherent meaning tosuffering. At times, however, understanding the karmic mechanics of sufferingproved inadequate. Edith Bissett continued to experience an agony so severe andunrelenting that on at least one occasion she conveyed to Yogananda her wish todie. In response, he encouraged her to view her suffering as a test from God.“You are an example to all; so do not be overpowered by suffering or haveself-pity, but smile away all your troubles.” She lived for another eight yearsafter this letter, finally dying in 1951. At her memorial service, Yoganandaaddressed head on the philosophical challenge her unremitting anguish caused. Heexplained that Bissett assumed the karmic burden of others and suffered “becauseof the sins of many others who became saintly through her life. There was not asin of her own I could find. Such is the mystery of God.”38[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn38] Though Bissett was denied physical relief, SRFcommunity members may have found emotional comfort in learning that this kindwoman suffered for a reason.The wisdom of a teacher who understood the great mysteries of life, howeverdifficult to accept, proved irresistible. Those who knew Yogananda personallyuniformly attested to his charisma. Max Weber’s classic definition istailor-made for Yogananda: “The charismatic leader may be seen as having specialaccess to the divine realm or special abilities of healing, prophecy. … Theleader … embodies the virtues and powers that are articulated by the religiousideology, or has accomplished particular feats, or has extraordinary powers ofdiscernment and persuasion.”39 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn39] Yogananda’s charisma wasnot some serendipitous attribute but a sense of presence he cultivated, acapacity to “elicit from a following deference, devotion and awe toward himselfas the source of authority.”40 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn40]Understanding Yogananda’s charismatic authority requires moving beyond thedemand side of the conversion equation, the motivations of potential converts,to consider the supply side. Yogananda diverged dramatically from conventionalHindu instructors, who rarely sought out disciples, though they often receivedwould-be followers who came unbidden. He did not simply wait passively fordisciples to come to him, but like Jesus summoning the apostles, he pursued themactively. In his relentless touring, advertising, publishing, and commodifyingof goods, Yogananda was much more like a typical evangelist who “assesses thepotential target audience and formulates persuasive tactics to bring convertsinto the religious community.”41 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn41] Yogananda effectivelydeployed standard evangelistic strategies that emphasized the cognitive,affective, and volitional benefits of his movements, as well as his charismaticleadership.42 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn42]His charismatic persuasiveness overcame the reluctance of several individualswho chose to follow him despite themselves, making their eventual surrender allthe more dramatic. The exoticism of a Hindu movement intrigued many who foundChristian traditions unsatisfying, but the deeply unfamiliar elements of histeaching could still be a hurdle. San Diego resident Merna Brown describedherself as “very orthodox in the church she was raised in.” So when her mother,sister, and sister’s friend became interested in Yogananda and began attendingthe local temple, she remained suspicious and refused to attend. Her mothereventually persuaded Merna to come, encouraging her to bring her Bible with hersince Yogananda often taught from it. When Merna attended the first time, shecarried her Bible to ward off Yogananda’s charm. In the event, her talismanproved ineffective and she yielded to Yogananda.43 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn43]Although conversion models often privilege individual experience, theinfluential role of Merna’s mother and sister highlight the importance of socialnetworks of family and friends, particularly in the case of reluctant converts.For example, when Edith Bissett first heard about Yogananda in 1925, she washesitant to attend a talk, fearing that any interest in “the teachings of along-haired Hindu” would jeopardize her husband’s university position. So shefirst came in contact with Yogananda’s teachings through her adult son beforeshe finally met him at her home in July 1925 and discovered that the “Hinduswami in the ochre robe of renunciation” incarnated “the answer to all myprayers and longing.”44 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn44] Faye Wright’s parents wereinitially resistant to her interest in a “foreign faith,” but after she won themover, her mother and three siblings converted—her sister Virginia and brotherRichard both became important leaders in the organization.45[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn45]Some first encountered their guru not face to face but through hisAutobiography, a testament to his ability to embody charismatic authority in hisspiritual masterpiece. The resulting conversions were as immediate and profoundas those who first met Yogananda in person. “Autobiography of a Yogi is thegreatest book I have ever read,” Walters concluded simply in his own spiritualautobiography. “One perusal of it was enough to change my entire life. From thattime on my break with the past was complete. I resolved in the smallest detailof my life to follow Paramahansa Yogananda’s teaching.”46[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn46] Converts often felt a personal devotion to a teacherthey had never met. Davis came across an advertisement for Autobiography of aYogi in a health magazine and ordered the book by mail. Reading it multipletimes, “I knew that Paramahansa Yogananda was my guru.”47[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn47] Some were convinced that divine providence placed theAutobiography in their hands to bring them to the Master. Peggy Dietz, aPasadena native who had had metaphysical experiences from childhood, was prayingone day as she crumpled up a piece of paper. Something prompted her to unrollthe wad, which turned out to be an advertisement for the Autobiography. Shepromptly got a copy and began reading it. Her reading was interrupted by a callfrom a friend inviting her to hear a talk: “The speaker’s name is something likeParam … Paramhansa Yogananda.”48 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn48] Santa Barbara nativeNorman Paulsen did not even need to read the Autobiography to convert. Workingat a job site, he saw the book’s cover and recognized the man with long hair andlarge, dark eyes who had haunted him for years. He asked the owner of the housewho the person was. Informed that Yogananda lived a few miles away, Paulsenimmediately dropped his work and departed for Mount Washington.49[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn49]The spiritual journey that led these seekers to the Autobiography often became aliteral journey as well. Many physically traveled to SRF headquarters, toEncinitas, or to one of the centers in what functioned as a pilgrimageexperience, the geographical journey a manifestation of the internal one. Giventhat SRF sites were imbued with a sense of sacredness—especially MountWashington and Encinitas—approaching the guru’s abode could be a powerful partof the experience. And like traditional pilgrimage, the greater the distance orthe difficulty of the ordeal, the more heightened the sense of arrival.Donald Walters’s pilgrimage illustrates this pattern, though Roy Eugene Davisand Norman Paulsen had remarkably similar experiences. When Walters finished theAutobiography, he immediately decided to travel to Los Angeles to follow inperson the one who had already become his guru on the page. He left a note forhis godfather, “I’m going to California to join a group of people who, Ibelieve, can teach me what I want to know about God and about religion.” Then heboarded a bus for California. When Walters arrived in Encinitas, he discoveredthat Yogananda was not there. He would be preaching at the Hollywood temple thatSunday, but unfortunately there was a two-and-a-half-month waiting period beforeYogananda would be available to meet with him. Fighting despair, Waltersdetermined to remain hopeful as he went to the Hollywood service. Having beeninformed of Walters’s request, Yogananda arranged to meet with him afterservice. His first encounter with Yogananda echoed the intimate language ofthose struck by Yogananda’s grace and beauty. “What large, lustrous eyes nowgreeted me! What a compassionate smile! Never before had I seen such divinebeauty in a human face.” Yogananda seemed reluctant to take Walters in, as hewas accepting fewer disciples at the time. At last he relented, “All right. Youhave good karma. You may join us.” Then came the call to total devotionYogananda had routinely made for more than a quarter century, since he firstasked Minott Lewis to always love him. “Will you do as I ask?” he asked Walters.When Walters was bold enough to ask if he had to obey even when he disagreedwith Yogananda, Yogananda replied, “I will never ask anything of you, that Goddoes not tell me to ask.”50 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn50] And that settled thematter.After their quest had led them to an encounter with Yogananda, what was thenature of the relationship they shared with their guru? As Rambo indicates, areligious community envelops new converts in relationships that consolidateemotional bonds, rituals that integrate them into their new way of life,rhetoric that provides guidance and meaning, and roles that give converts ameaningful mission.51 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn51] Those who chose to followYogananda as monastics entered into a relationship with him as well as the fewdozen other members of the Mount Washington community. Daily meditationpractices created a rhythm and reinforced the sense of community. Personalinstruction from Yogananda—both formal and ad hoc—provided the organization’score rhetoric. And as both a ministry and a functioning community, everyindividual had an identifiable role that contributed to the larger sense ofmission they shared with their guru—from shopping and preparing food toproducing publications to providing for their master’s needs. Yogananda was thecommunity’s center of gravity, the reason the community existed. Disciples drewinspiration from simply observing Yogananda wandering the grounds and wereblessed by being in their guru’s presence, as promised in Yoga Sūtra II.35.For many, his supernatural powers authenticated his ministry, authorizing him totake extreme measures. He performed a number of miracles that restored physicalhealth and demonstrated control over the natural world—many strikingly similarto those reported of Jesus in the Gospels. On his trip to India in 1935–36, heraised a sinking steamship at the mouth of the Ganges, then healed theconstriction in the throat of the vessel’s captain that had prevented him fromshouting a warning. At Mount Washington, he caused a freak windstorm to ceasesuddenly, and at Encinitas he drove away rain so that a monk could take a sunnydrive with him. Rather than wine, he multiplied a small amount of freshlysqueezed carrot juice to fill the cups of all present. He prevented major caraccidents that would have killed Minott Lewis and, years later, Norman Paulsenand Leo Cocks. He rescued a hitchhiking monk from peril. Monks working onconstruction projects at various SRF sites were saved from serious bodily injuryby Yogananda’s intervention. In one case, he even restored to life a womanthought to be dead.52 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn52]But life with Yogananda was not all numinous experiences. As members of thecommunity, monastics had the opportunity to see Yogananda’s playful, almostchildlike side. Though such behavior can be viewed as a temporary pressure valvefor the challenges of an ascetic lifestyle, devotees understood the Master’schildlike playfulness through the lens of līlā. Often translated as “sport” or“play,” līlā is an expansive concept that often refers to the spontaneity ofdivine behavior. The deity’s freedom to create or destroy can seem capricious,but it may also suggest a joyful lightheartedness—an example devotees shouldadopt.53 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn53] Yogananda often exhibited such bliss-filledplayfulness.54 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn54] He had a healthy appetite forrecreation. The leader who often used motion pictures as a metaphor for thespiritual life enjoyed going to the movies for recreation. He was particularlyfond of westerns, horror films, and war films. Disciples frequently witnessedhim fall asleep watching them, though perhaps he was meditating as he claimed.Though he never learned how to drive, he enjoyed being taken out for an eveningdrive, on picnics, and especially for visits to the beach. He loved to “treathis large family” by buying a box of Eskimo pies and passing them around.Yogananda also had a lively, mischievous sense of humor. He loved to tell jokesand play pranks on the devotees. In the darkened movie theater, he would pokepeople with his cane and then feign innocence or place pieces of bunched-uptissue on the heads of those sitting in front of him. He would call to disciplesfrom his upstairs window and pour a pan of water on them as they stood below.Once he used a water gun to shoot water onto the ceiling above James Lynn whenhe was not paying attention. Lynn was surprised and puzzled when the waterdripped onto his bald head. In retelling this prank to another disciple,Yogananda “started laughing so hard that I could scarcely understand hiswords.”55 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn55]The rhythms of life in community—the sublime, the humorous, thequotidian—birthed a surrogate family. In committing to Yogananda and hisfellowship, disciples had forsaken family and marriage. They had a deep desire,even a need, for his approval and acceptance. Though Edith Bissett was ageneration older than Yogananda, the majority of the monastics were singlewomen, who sometimes related to Yogananda as a sort of surrogate spouse. Despitea number of accusations over the years, there is no credible evidence of sexualimpropriety in Yogananda’s relationships with these women. But they undoubtedlyshared a level of physical intimacy that would have been unacceptable in theoutside world. Florina Darling recounted, with pride rather than embarrassment,how she sat patiently for nearly two hours while Yogananda plucked her gray hairout.56 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn56] Such physical interactions were routine, asdevotees regularly touched their guru’s feet in a sign of deference while hetouched their head or body to impart a blessing. Disciples eagerly soughtopportunities for one-on-one encounters with Yogananda, where they would laytheir souls bare, sharing their most personal thoughts and submitting to hisguidance.More often, however, Yogananda’s relationship with his disciples was lessspousal than parental, replicating a pattern rooted in Hindu tradition.57[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn57] Disciples openly embraced this relational pattern.Henry Schaufelberger was pleased when Yogananda referred to the male monasticsas “my little boys” and vowed to himself that “to my last day, I am one ofMaster’s little boys.” Richard Wright, who was his close daily companionthroughout the entire 1935–36 overseas journey, referred to him as “Holy Dad.”58[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn58] As a father figure, Yogananda was often duty-bound todiscipline his children for their own good. Once, when resisting one ofYogananda’s many “scoldings,” Darling protested, “After all, Sir, I am a grownwoman.” “His face became crestfallen and he answered, ‘I wish you hadn’t saidthat, because I never see you all as grown women but as children of God.’”59[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn59] The editor of Leo Cocks’s memoir reflects this paternaloutlook in a comment on Cocks’s need for discipline, “Leo was utterly devoted tohis guru and like a parent who must guide a willful child so it will grow andfulfill its destiny, Yogananda guided Leo with love and discipline.”60[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn60]Yogananda was an authoritarian father, determining his spiritual children’s lifechoices, from the consequential to the mundane. One young devotee shared withYogananda her plans to enroll in art school. He immediately rejected the idea.Knowing all of her previous lives, he discerned that this career path would notbe a good fit for her. She surrendered to his guidance. “He was everything tous,” she reflected later after many years as an SRF monastic.61[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn61] Yogananda’s veto power ranged from career choices topersonal appearance. His decisions often seemed capricious. Male disciples, forexample, had to receive express approval to grow facial hair. Yogananda refusedto allow Cocks to grow a beard with the terse reply, “Not you, Leo. You’d looklike a baboon!”62 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn62] But he actively encouraged Walters togrow one—which greatly surprised Walters, since Yogananda had often warned, “Idon’t want my boys looking like wild men!”63 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn63] Disciplesinterpreted his apparent caprice as serving an undisclosed purpose. Facial hairwas neither right nor wrong per se; the question was whether it was tailored toa particular disciple’s unique spiritual development. For Cocks, Yogananda’sinsult was an “opportunity to deflate my ego.”64 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn64]As their spiritual father, Yogananda also determined their devotionalactivities. Yogananda made Cocks, who had grown up in the Vedanta movement, takedown a shrine to Ramakrishna and Vivekananda that he had placed alongside ashrine to the SRF masters. This is especially surprising in light of Yogananda’srespect for both swamis. Davis was likewise instructed to read only SRFmaterials, an admonition he ignored to his own detriment. On a whim in aScottsdale bookstore he bought a spiritual book, probably Gospel of Ramakrishna,the collection of Ramakrishna sayings Yogananda had carried around as anadolescent. A fellow disciple reported Davis’s misconduct. The following day,Yogananda was gathered with a group of disciples when Davis walked into theroom. Davis was greeted by his guru’s announcement, “Roy is a spiritualprostitute.” Yogananda went on to explain that in a couple of years Davis mightbe ready for reading from other spiritual masters, when his spiritualdiscernment was more developed.65 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn65] Devotion to otherHindu masters, which Yogananda regularly endorsed in East-West, might seeminnocuous. But it could hamper the spiritual development of those committed tothe Kriya Yoga path. It was Yogananda’s responsibility to provide training thatremained firmly within the paramparā, or lineage, that ran from Babaji throughYukteswar to himself.Yogananda reserved his harshest scolding for disciples who failed to displayutter subjection to him. Faye Wright experienced several rebukes that left adeep impression on her. Her spiritual father once fashioned a dunce cap andcommanded her to put it on in front of the other disciples. She refused, and abattle of wills ensued. Eventually, when everyone had left the room, he calledher back to talk. The shy young woman asked him, “Is it really right to makefun, to tease me in front of everyone?” Ignoring her query, he commanded her tostand in a corner with his back to her, where she promptly burst into tears. Sheturned to him, confessed her gratitude for his discipline, and begged him to putthe cap on her. After her submission to his authority, he relented from placingthe cap on her.66 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn66] One scholar’s evaluation of theVedanta movement also aptly describes SRF: “Probably few other Americanreligious (or political) movements of the past century have been based solargely upon the notion of willing, steadfast obedience to another person.”67[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn67]Obedience under such conditions could exact a heavy toll, which disciples oftendescribed as experiences of dismemberment. These events mirror “degradationceremonies” in conversion theory, where insulting disciples is a common strategy“designed to break a person down so that the spirit is more malleable by the newgroup, and/or to break old patterns of behavior considered destructive orcounterproductive to the person.”68 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn68] Merna Brown bluntlyreflected, “You have no idea how difficult sometimes it was to be in thatexacting personality, in the presence of that exacting personality. Could you betaken apart, literally, in front of your peers, and still feel not sensitive,but take it with the right attitude, not be critical of the Guru?”69[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn69] Leo Cocks experienced unbearable distress at beingsubjected to “harsh words like a scalpel, cutting sharply through the layers ofmy consciousness. … Master went on and on. It was so painful that I couldn’ttake it any more.”70 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn70] Apart from the severity ofpunishment, its arbitrariness was also puzzling. Yogananda yelled at Brown oncebecause she forgot to deliver a phone message; but she experienced his fullwrath only when she tried to justify her lapse in memory. “Very often, what wemight be scolded or disciplined for was totally insignificant and that’s why itwas difficult to understand at the moment. But there was an aspect of histraining … he never explained. He never explained, we never asked.”71[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn71]Convinced that Yogananda’s harshness always served a beneficial purpose,disciples became skilled interpreters of his mercurial behavior. He oftendismissed them curtly, “Go! Leave my room!”72 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn72]Peremptorily cast from his presence, they went off to meditate until they coulddiscover the secret lesson he doubtless wanted them to learn. This could beconfounding when they perceived nothing culpable in their conduct. ButYogananda’s self-realized perfection was a basic tenet that trumped their ownperceptions. His faultlessness left their error as the only logical conclusionfor his anger. “Sometimes it was difficult to understand why we were beingscolded or disciplined in a certain way, but I never questioned why or thereason behind it, or that it was right. That, that would never have occurred.The only question was, What did I do? [She laughs] What did I do wrong? Or howdo I need to correct myself?” She would go back, kneel at his feet, and put herhead on his feet. He would respond graciously, “More sweet than nearest dearestfamily or friends.”73 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn73]He frequently apologized for his scolding afterward, but disciples understoodthese apologies the same way Yogananda undoubtedly intended them: as marks oftenderness and humility, rather than admissions of error. Some found proof ofYogananda’s benevolent intentions not in his words or any overt behavior but insubtle body language indicators. “Even though he scolded us and showed greatanger or anxiety,” Darling reflected that if disciples looked directly into hiseyes, they could detect “a little glimmer of a smile in the corner of his eyes …he couldn’t help but smile, because he never had anger inside. It was just aplay to be able to correct us, or to teach us a lesson.”74[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn74] Employing a complex interpretive strategy, disciplesacknowledged Yogananda’s manifest wrath but refused to view it as an indicationof his interior state.A few authors address the issue of Yogananda’s authority and how difficult itcould be for disciples to face. Polly Trout goes out of her way to downplay theseverity of his discipline, asserting that “the guru could never hurt or failthe disciple and that apparent failures were misunderstandings on the part ofthe disciple.” She concludes that “no great harm was done by suspending criticalreasoning in this manner, for he was generally a kindhearted man.”75[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn75] Philip Goldberg suggests that while the attraction of a“genuine holy man” can be “fatal when the magnet is unscrupulous orexploitative,” “Yogananda seems to have had little of that dark side.” Goldbergacknowledges, however, that the “severity” of Yogananda’s leadership was “toodemanding for most.”76 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn76]Some disciples found the demands of Yogananda’s leadership overwhelming anddecided to leave. Cocks ultimately departed because he found Yogananda’s severetreatment detrimental. Yogananda acknowledged the harshness of his disciplinebut assured Cocks of its redemptive purpose. “I have through God saved lives notdestroyed them,” he explained. “I did not come on earth to do destructivework—you have misunderstood my words and me. Every saint is made of thunder andflower. But in regard to principles, one must be stern.”77[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn77] Knowing the benefits of his tutelage, Yogananda viewedthe temptation to leave as a sign of spiritual weakness and rarely made it easyfor disciples to depart. When a monk named Daniel Boone decided to leave becausehe found monastic life too difficult, Yogananda summoned him to his room andtried all night to persuade Boone to stay. Boone agreed to try for two moreweeks, but at the end of the period he still left.78 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn78]When Cocks wrote that he was tempted to leave, Yogananda told him that Satan wastempting him. Cocks eventually left, regretted his decision, and begged to comeback.79 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn79] Paulsen also became restless, in part becauseof Yogananda’s authority. “I seemed to feel strange within whenever I called himMaster. To me he was a God-realized elder brother of the highest caliber. … Theword ‘master’ seemed to create a barrier for some, making him seem almostunapproachable.” Paulsen made the difficult decision to leave in November 1951,along with a few other male disciples.80 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn80] AlthoughYogananda entreated disciples to stay for their own good, he viewed theirdepartures as a personal affront, interpreting defection as a form of divinetesting.81 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn81] He deeply valued loyalty and unswervingcommitment. As his dear childhood friend Satyananda recollected later in life,though “he had a loving, affectionate and motherly heart for the people aroundhim, by nature he could not rely on or trust them.”82 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn82]Identifying himself as Jesus, Yogananda frequently referred to anyone whobetrayed him as “Judas.”83 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn83]There was a gender dimension to contests of power between Yogananda and hisdisciples. Male arrivals to SRF ashrams in the late 1940s were struck by thepreponderance of female devotees, and those who were closest to Yogananda tendedto be women. This cannot be explained by an assumption that Yogananda heldegalitarian gender views. He characterized gender in dualistic ways: menrepresented God while women represented Nature; men were rational while womenwere emotional; sexual temptation resulted from arousal of “the negativefeminine instinct of feeling.”84 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn84] And some of thechoicest SRF properties, such as the Lake Shrine and the ashram in Twenty-NinePalms, whose “natural surroundings … lend themselves admirably to the meditativestate,” were exclusively available to male monastics.85 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn85]Though nonmainstream religious movements often have high female-to-male ratios,in SRF’s case this initial recruitment imbalance was exacerbated by the greaterendurance of women in the movement relative to men. In a period before secondwave feminism made gender equality a cultural norm, submission to a maleauthority figure would have been much less challenging for many women, who hadoften experienced such relationships already. Those who gave up on Yogananda’sauthority and left the community in the final years of his life were all men.Disciples who stayed, male or female, had learned, in SRF parlance, “attunement”with the Master. They were in harmony with him, which meant that they hadsurrendered fully to him.86 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn86]Even disciples who reconciled themselves to Yogananda’s purging never found theprocess easy. They learned to view this routine humiliation not as emotionalabuse but as an indispensable step toward their spiritual liberation. Purgingthe ego was painful, as Cocks discovered when he asked to grow a beard, but itwas necessary. When Walters was subjected to the “undeserved humiliation” of aYogananda “tirade,” he eventually concluded that he needed more criticism, notless. “Sir, please scold me more often,” he begged.87 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn87]And it was in a tone of great affection that Wright bluntly reflected, “Hefreely picked me apart in front of others.”88 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn88] Those whosuccessfully established an “inner process of commitment,” bravely surrenderingand enduring harsh treatment, found themselves cleansed of many spiritualimpurities.89 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn89]In abandoning their individual autonomy, disciples believed that, paradoxically,they had found their true selves. Social psychologists who have studiedhigh-demand religious groups find those who pay a higher price for membershipvalue it more highly. They conclude that the harshness of initiation intensifiesmembers’ commitment to the organization.90 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn90] Similarly,market theories of religion emphasize rational choices involving the reward forparticipation. Choosing a nonmainstream religion involved high social costs,from the judging looks of passersby who found it odd to see Yogananda meditateby the side of the road, to family members who worried about the psychologicaland physical well-being of converts. Walters had a skeptical friend who wasdisturbed by the authority Yogananda asserted over their lives. “This is a freecountry!” the friend pronounced. “Americans aren’t slaves. And anyway, no onehas a right to be the master of another human being.” Walters replied thatYogananda’s followers had handed him not their freedom but their bondage. “He isa true master of the practices in which we ourselves are struggling to excel.You might say that he is our teacher in the art of achieving true freedom.”91[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn91] In the face of outside judgments, SRF disciplescontinued to insist on the value of their choice.Disciples’ willingness to commit freely to Yogananda stemmed from theirconviction that he provided spiritual goods no one else could. In religion as inthe marketplace, value is often measured by access to a product that offersimmediate, tangible, powerful rewards—limited access to such a good makes it allthe more precious.92 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn92] Yogananda knew his disciplesperfectly—even better than they knew themselves—and what he did was always fortheir personal growth, whether they recognized it or not. Henry Schaufelbergerbelieved that even in their first conversation together, Yogananda “knew mebetter than I did.” This attested to Yogananda’s supernatural abilities, because“if somebody knows you completely, no ordinary human being can do that.” DespiteYogananda’s awareness of Schaufelberger’s mistakes, he was not judgmental butunderstanding, displaying “unconditional love.”93 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn93] Otherdisciples confirmed Yogananda’s telepathy, a siddhi described by Patanjali inYoga Sūtra III.19. Mrinalini Mata said simply, “He knew everything I wasthinking,” and Cocks recalled Yogananda telling him, “I know everything youthink and say.”94 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn94]A Master who had foreknowledge, knowledge of disciples’ previous incarnations,ability to read his disciples’ thoughts, moral infallibility, and the ability toheal and perform miracles was no mere human teacher. Like many gurus, Yoganandahad long claimed divine attributes. As scholar Orianne Aymard explains, inHinduism “the guru is the radiating mask that God takes to come to us.”95[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn95] But Yogananda hesitated to claim divinity outright,perhaps because Christian ideas of utter transcendence made such a claim seemmore audacious in an American context, while Hinduism often accepted moreporousness between human and divine identities. But in the late 1940s, he beganrevealing his true status, though only privately to individual disciples andeven then with great reticence. He told Darling that in a previous incarnationhe had been Arjuna, the warrior hero born of the god Indra and recipient of thegreat god Krishna’s revelation contained in the Bhagavad Gītā.96[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn96] Other disciples believed that he had been Jesus in aprevious incarnation. Asked about this, Yogananda replied that it was a matterof indifference. But he did not deny the identification.97[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn97] Given his routine hints throughout his major texts,this must be seen as an indication of humility rather than an admission ofuncertainty. In discovering that he was an incarnation of Christ, he was onlyfollowing the lead of Ramakrishna, who had had a similar realization decadesearlier.98 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn98]At one point, Walters asked him point blank, “Sir, are you an avatar?” orincarnation of a deity, a reasonable question to ask of a guru.99[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn99] Yogananda answered humbly but clearly, “A work of thisimportance would have to be started by such a one.” He answered Cocks’s query inalmost identical fashion. “Whenever a teaching of this magnitude is brought, Godalways sends it with an avatar.”100 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn100] One devoteechallenged him to acknowledge his divinity less obliquely. “But if you have noego left, that means you are God!” Again, Yogananda’s answer was humble butclear: “The Scriptures say, “he who knows Brahma becomes Brahma.”101[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn101] His divinity explained both his extraordinary powersand the appropriateness of unquestioning devotion.102 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn102]It is difficult to know how far beyond the inner circle of monastics the intensepattern of discipleship to Yogananda—and the acceptance of his exaltedstatus—extended. As a recent movement, all of its committed members wereconverts, including thousands of faithful SRF lay members. Intense devotion mayhave been widespread, since as sociologist Eileen Barker argues, “Converts,having decided to accept a new faith … rather than continuing in the one intowhich they were born and/or which is the norm in their society or subculture,tend to be considerably more enthusiastic about their new beliefs and practicesthan those brought up in their religion.”103 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn103] On theother hand, personal contact with Yogananda was essential to sustaining thepassion of his closest disciples, and he was unable to interact personally withthousands of students. Recognizing this, he and SRF worked hard to maintain asense of guru-disciple intimacy through teachings, poetry, and anecdotes invarious forms—radio, magazine, and personal address. And not all devoteesthought that Yogananda’s physical presence was necessary to experience himfully. “Does one miss out by not having a guru in the physical form on thisplane?” Dietz asked. “No, one need not miss out at all. Through right action,meditation, prayer and the power of spiritual love, the devotee will draw theguru’s response, from whatever he is. In this manner will the devotee experiencethe guru’s presence, realize peace of mind, and merge with Christ consciousness… and the glory of God.”104 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn104] Yogananda would bepowerfully present even after death. That conviction became more essential inthe late 1940s, as Yogananda’s worsening health hinted that death might be near.DEATH OF AN IMMORTAL YOGIThroughout his career, Yogananda had presented himself as an unofficialambassador of India to the United States, and although his own nationalism wasprimarily religious rather than political, he had long advocated autonomy forhis beloved homeland. When independence finally came in 1947, he invited readersto “imagine the joy” that “every one of the 400 million Hindus, Moslems, Jains,Parsis, Sikhs” experienced when they finally achieved what they had “wishedevery moment of their conscious lives.”105 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn105] Indiabecame a global role model when it achieved independence. Historian JohnSpringhall calls it “one of the most remarkable acts of decolonization in thetwentieth century,” stirring a “‘wind of change,’ which dislodged various otherEuropean colonial rulers in subsequent years.”106 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn106] Thecollapse of European overseas empires was one of the most momentous changes ofthe twentieth century, turning the possessions of a handful of European powersinto more than one hundred nation-states in a few short years. Thoughdecolonization was a complex phenomenon with many roots, observers both then andsince have recognized India’s crucial role as catalyst, inspiration, andexemplar for movements throughout Asia and Africa.The new nation’s global stature boosted American popular interest in thesubcontinent, though the Cold War tilted American foreign policy away fromIndia. Yogananda participated in the celebration welcoming the American visit ofJawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister, to San Francisco in November1949. The invitation to this significant event reflected acceptance of hisself-appointed role as unofficial Indian ambassador to the United States.Yogananda attended Nehru’s public speech, and later the two met in the primeminister’s hotel room, where they shared a brief conversation and Yogananda wasintroduced to some of Nehru’s family.107 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn107] Nehru alreadyhad some familiarity with the guru before coming to the United States. Yoganandahad reached out to him by telegram the previous year with a bold plea that he“save half of Gandhi’s ashes, some for India, some for America, to be buriedbeneath statues erected in two countries.”108 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn108]When Gandhi was assassinated January 30, 1948, less than six months afterindependence, Yogananda offered himself as curator of the great leader’s memory.It was only appropriate, he thought, that America’s most notable living Indiansaint should commemorate the martyrdom of India’s greatest leader. During hisregular radio broadcast he paid tribute to Gandhi’s legacy, placing him in aglobal context and assuring listeners of his ongoing influence. “MahatmaGandhi’s passing is a loss not only to India but to the whole world. Worldleaders and all India mourn for him. We mourn for our loss, but he is freer towork through the Infinite. Jesus Christ and Abraham Lincoln died for the samecause as Mahatma Gandhi has died.” In the wake of World War II and the emergenceof atomic weapons, Yogananda wrote and spoke publicly about the ongoing dangerof war; Gandhi stood out in the movement for world peace.By following Gandhiji’s nonviolent doctrine, India won her independence withoutfiring a single shot. If the world followed his doctrine, it too could receiveits independence from the slavery of destructive and misery-making wars.Gandhiji, limited by his frail body, accomplished much, but his liberated spiritwill work more mightily in the hearts of nations and individuals for all time.Let us pay homage to the ever-living great Mahatma Gandhi. He is not dead, forhis exemplary life and spirit of goodness are going to work unhampered throughthe temple of our hearts ever and forever.This address was reprinted in a Gandhi biography written by prominent occultauthor Marc Edmund Jones the same year.109 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn109]Self-Realization Fellowship also conducted memorial services for Gandhi,including a fire ceremony that symbolically consigned his body to the flameswhile his liberated soul “commingles with the soul of God.” In his memorialaddress, Yogananda called the audience to honor Gandhi’s legacy properly. It wasappropriate to erect statues to commemorate Gandhi, but it was more vital to“erect in one corner of our heart a statue to nonviolence if Gandhi is to berightly remembered. We must establish a monument to Gandhi within us if we areto have a world peace. Enemies and friends are all our brothers under thefatherhood of God.”110 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn110]In early 1949, Yogananda finally acquired a portion of Gandhi’s ashes throughthe assistance of a longtime Indian disciple Dr. J. V. Nawle, secretary of theGreat Mother Bharat Institute and Society for World Peace. Originally planningto inter the ashes at Encinitas, Yogananda ended up sending them to a new SRFproperty instead.111 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn111] Through James Lynn’s generosity,SRF had acquired a small artificial lake in Pacific Palisades a few blocks fromthe ocean. Resting in a bowl bordered by a long curve in Sunset Boulevard, theidyllic property had a Hollywood pedigree. A film site in the silent movie era,the land was later purchased by H. Everett McElroy, assistant superintendent ofconstruction for 20th Century Fox studios. The Lake Shrine’s official dedicationceremony in August 1950, which brought Lieutenant Governor Goodwin Knight andhis wife, commemorated the thirtieth anniversary of Yogananda’s ministry in theUnited States.112 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn112] Yogananda built a World PeaceMemorial honoring Gandhi at the lake and deposited the ashes there. In this way,Yogananda successfully associated himself with Gandhi, India, global peace—andHollywood—at one picturesque site. His own death would shortly transpire,appropriately enough, during a Los Angeles dinner honoring India’s firstambassador, Binay R. Sen.Yogananda had suffered poor health for years, though he kept this from thepublic and even many of his disciples. The stresses of the ministry—travel,organization, speaking, and, above all, the trial instigated by his formerfriend and partner Nerode—likely exacted a physiological toll. And despiteadvocating exercise and a healthy vegetarian diet, he was probably overweightduring much of his ministry, a factor that often contributes to heart diseaseand the likelihood of heart attack.113 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn113] In August 1936,on the eve of his departure for the return voyage to the West, he had adistressing experience:Yesterday afternoon as I sat in a half-meditation state, Satan dropped onto mybody and pulled my astral body out of my physical body; my heart stopped. ThenGuru as an angel of God appeared and warned me, saying, “Look, look what Satanis doing unto thee!” I made an effort; and like a stretched rubberband my astralbody slipped back into my lifeless frame, and I cried out. This happened underthe eyes of one of the school boys who was alarmed to see me suddenly grow coldand lifeless and then cry out. I would not understand why this happened on theeve of my departure.Yogananda portrays this experience as a dramatic demonic attack. But strippingaway the spiritual language reveals physical symptoms—a stopped heart, thesudden feeling of a heavy weight, a loud cry suggesting sharp pain, and thephysical appearance of death—that suggest that the forty-three-year-old hadexperienced a severe heart attack. Late that evening Yukteswar appeared toYogananda in a vision to supply a motive for the spiritual attack. “Satan onthis last day wanted to destroy your body that you might not be able to go toAmerica and redeem other souls.”114 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn114] As this visionmakes clear, Yogananda recognized that he had narrowly avoided death.Given Yogananda’s efforts to conceal his physical problems, it is difficult toknow whether he experienced other heart attacks in the decade after his returnfrom India. But an event in 1948, which he described as a particularly intensesamādhi experience, may have been another heart attack. Though the disciplespresent thought they were only witnessing deep meditation, some noted that theepisode marked a dramatic change in his behavior serious enough that at leastone disciple interpreted it as a harbinger of his death. He became reclusive,withdrawing even from his closest disciples. He spoke publicly less frequentlyand spent more time alone in the desert.115 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn115] A noticesubsequently appeared in SRF’s publication Self-Realization askingcorrespondents to be patient if Yogananda was slower to respond to mail since“he is now observing a stricter seclusion than he has done in the past. …Because of his constant immersion in God, it is not always possible for hissecretaries to intrude on his attention.”116 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn116] Thisabrupt notice was replaced two months later by a warmer personal address fromYogananda himself, who explained that “crowds of Souls from all quarters of theglobe are coming on pilgrimages to Self-Realization Headquarters—when I haveless time. The work has expanded beyond my imagination.” As a result, he“humbly” asked that personal letters be “short and to the point” and that,whenever possible, correspondents write directly to his secretaries, who are“equipped and spiritually trained.”117 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn117]His informal addresses to disciples after 1948 were often rambling repetitionsof familiar themes and lacked his characteristic vigor. Death seemed often onhis mind as he regularly cited a favorite trope about the insignificance of anindividual water drop in relation to the vast ocean. He also rehearsed themetaphor about life as a motion picture—his Hollywood-inspired tribute to theHindu notion of māyā that had become a cliché through decades of repetition.Thinking of his own weakening body and impending death, he reminded his flock ofthe illusory nature of individual human experience, repeatedly telling them thathe was not his body. “Oh, it is such a joke … that Divine Mother is playing onyou all. You think this is so real. It is not real. … Don’t take it soseriously. It is just a joke she is playing on you.” He began to cry, adding,“But I feel so sorry for all of you because to you it is yet real. Don’t take itso seriously.”118 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn118]By the fall of 1950, he began to suffer severe leg pain that kept himwheelchair-bound for months. Close disciples interpreted this physicalimpairment as the result of a master’s struggle to bear the karmic burden of hisdisciples. This was a gift Yogananda, like his alter ego Jesus, hadsacrificially bestowed on his disciples at great cost to himself, while “afrightful array of demonic entities” wreaked “havoc on his body.”119[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn119] Although Yogananda had taught this familiar Hinduprecept,120 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn120] he had also endorsed a countervailingtradition that “the great yogis,” as Buddhist writer Alexandra David-Neelexplains, were “inaccessible to sickness.” “These eminent individuals leave ourworld at the moment they choose, without physical deterioration.”121[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn121] Perhaps to avoid unnecessary distress, news of hisillness was concealed from the public. Even within the confines of MountWashington, Yogananda avoided scenes that might diminish his stature. On oneoccasion, waiting until he was sure no one else was around to see, he asked thesix-foot, four-inch Paulsen—whom he had nicknamed Big Boy—to carry him piggybackup the two flights of stairs to his room.122 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn122]Yogananda’s death occurred on the night of a banquet for Binay R. Sen, Indianambassador to the United States, at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. Yoganandawas to introduce Sen and present a gold medal from SRF to him. During theceremony, Faye Wright recalled that Yogananda was so “God-intoxicated” that thebanquet room, filled with the ambassador, the mayor, and other officials, was“absolutely motionless” while he poured out his heart. He ended his talk byreciting his poem “My India,” an autobiographical reflection of his deepaffection for India, for “there I learned first to love God”: “Her sages taughtme to find my Self / Buried beneath the ash heaps / Of incarnations ofignorance.” Though his soul had been “garbed sometimes as an Oriental /Sometimes as an Occidental,” its extensive travels had led it at last “in India,to find Itself.”His hybrid Indian-American identity was made all the more poignant by his havingrecently become an American citizen. The 1946 Luce-Celler Act allowed a smallnumber of Filipinos and Indians to immigrate each year by creating a loophole inthe Immigration Act of 1917’s Asiatic Barred Zone. The law also allowedimmigrants from these two groups to become naturalized, in effect reversing the1923 Thind decision. Yogananda began the naturalization process soon after thelaw took effect and took the oath of allegiance in 1949.123[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn123] Forced to accept the artificial boundaries ofnation-states, he had made America his country, but he never forgot hishomeland, birthplace of all religions:Images [../figures/f0226-14.jpg]The iconic “Last Smile” photograph Los Angeles Times photographer Arthur Saytook of Yogananda just moments before his departure. Though initially caughtoff-guard by Yogananda’s abrupt end, his disciples quickly understood it as hismahasamādhi, a yogi’s conscious exit from the body. This beatific image providedconfirmation that the Master had been perfectly at peace before the dramaticevent occurred.Better than Heaven or ArcadiaI love Thee, O my India!And thy love I shall giveTo every brother nation that lives.God made the earth;Man made confining countriesAnd their fancy-frozen boundaries.But with newfound boundless loveI behold the borderland of my IndiaExpanding into the world.Hail, mother of religions, lotus, scenic beauty,And sages!Thy wide doors are open,Welcoming God’s true sons through all ages.Where Ganges, woods, Himalayan caves, and men dream God—I am hallowed; my body touched that sod.Shortly after finishing the poem, he slumped to the floor, dead. Press accountstended to describe the suddenness of the attack, reporting his death due to“acute coronary occlusion,” or heart attack.124 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn124]Bearing his disciples’ karma had taken a heavy toll. The yogi who once touted“perpetual youth” and predicted he would “live forever” was dead at agefifty-nine, seven years short of the average life-span for American males at thetime.125 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn125] Devotees later remembered the moment of deathas calm and perfectly timed, a reflection of their belief that the guru’s timeof death was under his control.126 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn126] But that was nottheir initial reaction. Some disciples found the notion of his death soincomprehensible that they wondered if he was simply in an intense state ofsamādhi at an inopportune moment. So they all repeated the mantra he hadpreviously taught them to bring him out of a meditative trance. Gradually theyrecognized that he was really gone.127 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn127] Once thisrealization set in, his disciples perceived that their guru’s death was indeedunder his control, as Yoga Sūtra III.22 promised, and therefore perfectly timed.At a very apt moment during the celebration he had achieved mahasamādhi, thefreely chosen surrender of the fully self-realized soul.128[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn128] This rare phenomenon signaled that their guru hadpurged himself of all karma—including what he had vicariously assumed on behalfof his disciples—and mastered saṃsāra. Disciples of a fully self-realized guruwho dies often cope by trying to “correlate or reconcile the implicit, hiddenknowingness of their guru with his explicit, public unknowingness,”retroactively discovering hints that he had provided regarding his impendingdeath.129 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn129] Yogananda’s devotees recalled manyintimations over the last several years that left no doubt—at least inretrospect—that he had achieved mahasamādhi, like his master before him.As the leaders present at Mount Washington when Yogananda died deliberated overwhat to do with their master’s body, Premananda received a telegram fromYogananda’s brother Sananda: “Jotin, send brother’s body home.” Minott Lewisdeferred to Premananda as an Indian and Yogananda’s longest friend regarding thedisposition of Yogananda’s remains. Though burial is a deviation from thegeneral Hindu practice of cremation, it is not an uncommon practice for swamis,who symbolically consign their bodies to be consumed by fire when they taketheir monastic vows.130 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn130] Premananda reflected onYogananda’s decision in 1936 to bury Yukteswar in Puri and concluded that itwould be appropriate to bury their own master as well.131[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn131] The leaders then discussed the possibility of shippingYogananda’s body to Puri to be buried alongside his mentor, but transporting thebody back to India did not seem viable. In the end, the yogi who had made hishome in the United States for nearly his entire adult life would be buried inhis adopted country. Once SRF leadership made the decision to inter Master inCalifornia, the next question was the suitable location. Initially, SRF leadersplanned to bury him at Mount Washington or the Lake Shrine in Pacific Palisades,but zoning laws did not permit this.132 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn132] Given hisprominence, it seemed fitting that he be buried at Los Angeles’ most famouscemetery, Forest Lawn. Hundreds attended the funeral held at Mount Washington,including more than one hundred monks, ministers, and sisters, in what the pressdescribed as a two-hour “half-Indian, half Christian ceremony” that includedboth a sacred fire ritual and singing “Ave Maria,” chants from the Vedas andreadings from the Bible. Words from Gandhi were also spoken.133[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn133] The Indian who routinely compared himself to Jesus wasplaced in Forest Lawn’s replica Gothic cathedral, his vault in the Sanctuary ofGolden Slumber bathed in light that streamed in through stained-glass windows.Forest Lawn staff detected an unusual phenomenon while preparing Yogananda’sbody. The mortuary director wrote a notarized letter to SRF expressingastonishment at the unprecedented absence of bodily decomposition anddesiccation. Between March 11 and 27, “no indication of mold was visible onParamhansa Yogananda’s skin, and no visible desiccation (drying up) took placein the bodily tissues. This state of perfect preservation of a body is, so faras we know from mortuary annals, an unparalleled one.”134[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn134] SRF immediately republished this letter in full in acommemorative issue of Self-Realization. It also reprinted excerpts thatheightened the scale of the miracle by omitting any reference to the embalmingperformed twenty-four hours after his death.135 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn135] Thoughlack of outward decay is not unusual for embalmed bodies, Yogananda’s postmortempreservation quickly became proof that he had been no mere mortal.136[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn136] Self-Realization Fellowship compared this phenomenonto the bodies of such Christian saints as John of the Cross and the Spanishmystic nun Teresa of Ávila, who reputedly remained incorruptible for centuries,her burial place a site of “innumerable miracles.”137 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn137]According to Kriyananda, William the Great of Aquitaine and the Ferdinand III ofSpain, called el Santo, had also been miraculously preserved. Both men wereprevious incarnations of Yogananda, prompting Kriyananda to muse, “Was theincorruptible state of their bodies a condition that would always attend thissoul?”138 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn138] While SRF disciples reached for parallels inthe Christian tradition, they unaccountably ignored the fact thatincorruptibility of the guru’s body is a common Hindu belief.139[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn139]Images [../figures/f0229-15.jpg]The banquet room in the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles where Yogananda left thisworld on March 7, 1952. Yogananda was a guest speaker at the banquet held inhonor of Indian ambassador Binay R. Sen. After delivering a brief address,Yogananda read aloud his poem “My India” and suddenly slumped over.The tributes that poured in after Yogananda’s death affirmed the Paramahansa’slocal, national, and international status. California lieutenant governorGoodwin Knight, unable to break away from a difficult legislative session,expressed his “shock and grief” at the sudden death of his “good friend,”assuring SRF that his “warm personality and kindly understanding will be sorelymissed by all of those who were privileged to know him.”140[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn140] Papers across the country reprinted the AssociatedPress account of his funeral, including the claim that Yogananda had thirtymillion followers. Time magazine ran a short article, providing a summary of hisministry, his two years of illness, and his death from a heart attack, closingwith the mortuary’s report.India welcomed their expatriate teacher home as well. Mulk Raj Ahuja, consulgeneral of India in San Francisco, viewed Yogananda as “an apostle of peace anda believer in the brotherhood of man,” who saw India and the United States as“not two separate countries but the two component parts of one single plan forthe development in harmony of both material and spiritual values of man.”141[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn141] Fellow guru Swami Sivananda, leader of the Divine LifeSociety in Rishikesh, paid tribute to the “eternal, all-pervading, stable,immovable, and ancient” Yogananda, “an ideal representative of the ancient sagesand seers, the glory of India.”142 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn142] Throughout India,Yogoda Satsanga Society member organizations held their own memorial services,while university officials, church leaders, and other notables mourned hispassing.143 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn143]The death of Yogananda did not end his disciples’ relationship with him.Self-Realization Fellowship’s official death announcement two weeks laterreassured members that although Yogananda “has taken his physical form from thisearth, tremendous waves of spiritual upliftment are being felt by disciples andmembers, a divine assurance of his omnipresent spirit among us still.”144[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn144] Like other gurus, he remained near his closestdisciples.145 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn145] Donald Walters felt Yogananda’s presencewhile he stood in front of his master’s crypt shortly after the interment. Hetold Walters, “I’m not in there!”146 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn146] Three weeks afterhis death, Mary Buchanan recorded in her diary, “Master came! Here in my roomsuddenly Master was standing right before me. He was not only dear to my sightbut so tangibly here that impulsively I reached forward to put my hand on hisarm. He looked at me, said gently, ‘Well …’ Then he began to vanish. I wanted toask him to stay longer but he was gone.”147 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn147]These experiences were not confined to monastics who had enjoyed close contactwith the Master. Within months of his mahasamādhi, everyday members were writingin to share their experiences of the guru. One individual from San Francisco,while practicing the correspondence course lessons, “saw Master dressed in purewhite, watching me with approval.” After adjusting an imperfect technique, thedevotee heard a clear affirmation, “Now you do quite well.” In the same setting,a Canadian SRF member beheld the Master “dressed in a white robe,” “with hishands pointed upward in the position of prayer.” The student reflected howwonderful it was to have “a Master who manifests himself with such kindencouragement and loving guidance in the way that is most appropriate to ourstage of development.” After hearing word of Master’s death, a third memberfinally understood the meaning of a puzzling vision in which Yogananda had beenwalking alone at Mount Washington. “He seemed much younger, although it appearedto be almost dark and I could barely make out his form. It was not a materialform, but a spiritual one” the Master inhabited.148 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn148]These visions continued sporadically for decades. Yogananda appeared in physicalform to Daya Mata years after his mahasamādhi. When she touched his feet, “Theywere as solid as my own.” Mary Peck Stockton experienced a vivid vision ofYogananda during colon cancer surgery three decades after his death.149[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn149] In the mid-1980s, a woman stopped by an organizationheaded by Walters to buy a laminated photograph of Yogananda, though she did notknow who he was. She had had a very hard life and, shortly after the visit,decided to commit suicide by driving off a bridge. Walking toward the frontdoor, she had a transcendent experience. Her recently purchased “photographexpanded and became life-sized. It stood in the doorway, and wouldn’t let methrough. I decided at that point to drop my plan of committing suicide.”150[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn150]Such descriptions closely follow the patterns described in a “large, criticalliterature on ostensible post-mortem encounters,” according to New Testamentscholar Dale Allison, in which the departed appears and disappears abruptly; isboth seen and heard; appears to individuals who may not have known the person inlife; and provides guidance, issues commands, and offers comfort.151[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn151] While these accounts typically involve the postmortemapparition of merely human loved ones, occasionally a divine figure makes avisitation. Perhaps the closest parallel to Yogananda’s appearances comes fromTheosophy cofounder Henry Steel Olcott, who had a vision of “an immense Hinduman clad in white, his long black hair tumbling from underneath a turban, andhis black beard parted at the chin and twisted up and over the ears ‘in theRajput fashion’”:His eyes were alive with soul-fire; eyes which were at once benignant andpiercing in glance; the eyes of a mentor and a judge, but softened by the loveof a father who gazes on a son needing counsel and guidance. He was so grand aman, so imbued with majesty of moral strength, so luminously spiritual, soevidently above average humanity, that I felt abashed in this presence, andbowed my head and bent my knee as one does before a god or a god-likepersonage.152 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn152]Besides recounting reports of divine encounters, SRF preserved Yogananda’smemory in more prosaic ways. Within months of the mahasamādhi, SRF published TheMaster Said, a collection of wisdom and advice to disciples with a forewordexplaining how Jesus had foretold the existence of a master who would do greaterworks than he himself had done. Collecting and retelling a guru’s stories afterhis death is a common practice in India; such stories often have a folkloriccharacter and serve a hortatory purpose.153 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn153] Theaphoristic accounts in The Master Said, rarely more than a brief paragraph,frequently followed a stereotyped structure: an often nondescript setting thatgave the account a timeless relevance, a question or challenge to Yoganandaabout his teachings or practices, and his pithy retort—commonly a metaphor,paradox, or dialectical statement—that always began with “the Master said”:1) When a friend criticized the use of advertising to spread theSelf-Realization teachings, the Master said, “If Wrigley can use ads to makepeople chew gum, why shouldn’t I use ads to make people chew good ideas?”2) “You are very hard to understand, Master!” a disciple remarked. And theMaster said, “There is no need for you to understand me. Follow me. Everyonereads commentaries on Christ, but who does what he told us to do?”3) “How can God, the manifested Absolute, appear in visible form to thedevotee?” a disciple asked.And the Master said, “If you doubt, you won’t see; and if you see, you won’tdoubt.”4) When the Master first came to America he wore the Indian dress, and his hairwas long around his shoulders. Someone, fascinated by what was to him a strangesight, inquired, “Are you a fortune-teller?”And the Master said, “No, I tell people how to mend their fortunes.”5) A stranger talking to the Master for the first time said, “You seem tobelieve in Christ, but I thought all Hindus were heathens!”And the Master said, “Most Christians call the Hindu heathens. But the saints ofevery faith bow to the God within one another.”Each account ended with Yogananda’s final authoritative pronouncement, creatinga sense of deep paradoxical wisdom that hearkened back to such ancient sages asBuddha, Jesus, and Confucius.In Stories of Mukunda, published the following year, Walters presented more thana dozen anecdotes Yogananda told to various audience about his childhood thathad not made their way into the Autobiography, including “The Goldfish Tragedy,”in which the death of a pet prompted the six-year-old’s diary entry in English,“My red fish is die.”154 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn154]Self-Realization Fellowship published a commemorative volume in 1958,Paramahansa Yogananda: In Memoriam, which collected various postmortem tributesto Yogananda, along with his final speech and a narrative of his final days onearth. Following Yogananda’s lead in presenting himself as a Christ figure, thenarrative included a section entitled “A Last Supper with His Disciples” thatdescribed an intimate dinner with his devotees on Wednesday, March 5, two nightsbefore his death. His followers, who noticed how “quiet and thoughtful” he wasduring the meal, remembered that “Lord Jesus, just before his passing, observedthe Oriental custom when he sent Peter and John to prepare, for him and thetwelve disciples, a Last Supper.” In retrospect, they understood that “in honorof his approaching mahasamādhi, he too had arranged a Last Supper.”155[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn155]Disciples who knew Yogananda personally began sharing anecdotes from the stageat various SRF anniversaries and convocations. Every possible recollection wasretold, no matter how mundane; every anecdote helped maintain at least a tenuouslink with the Master. Self-Realization Fellowship recorded some of thesegatherings and eventually offered them for sale, institutionalizing disciples’memories while providing the organization with an ongoing revenue stream.156[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn156]Important SRF sites have become shrines devoted to Yogananda’s memory, notsimply functioning religious centers. At Mount Washington, Yogananda’s formertop-floor bedroom is preserved in the condition it was at his death; the librarydownstairs includes personal memorabilia. The former India Center at theHollywood temple functions as a miniature museum displaying a small collectionof historical photos. The Lake Shrine contains a small museum with photographsand artifacts. Encinitas, an active retreat center, has a welcome center.Yogananda’s childhood home in Calcutta, which remains in the Ghosh family as aprivate home, preserves his bedroom and meditation room as shrines. Group tourscan be arranged to visit the home. Outside, a plaque greets visitors:HERE LIVEDPARAMAHANSA YOGANANDAFOUNDERYOGODA SATSANGA SOCIETY OF INDIAANDSELF-REALIZATION FELLOWSHIPPerhaps most importantly, Yogananda’s image joined Krishna, Jesus, Babaji,Lahiri Mahasaya, and Yukteswar in the divine pantheon displayed on every SRF andYSS altar around the world.THE FATE OF YOGANANDA’S LEGACYAs an organization that epitomized Weber’s notion of charismatic leadership,SRF’s survival hinged on the question of Yogananda’s successor. Weber suggestedseveral ways that succession could be legitimated: a search for a new leaderwith appropriate charismatic qualities, divine revelation through some oracularmeans, designation by the original leader, designation by qualified staff,hereditary charisma, and office charisma.157 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn157] Yoganandaand, subsequently, SRF experimented with various combinations of theseapproaches before finding the right mix. Before his death, Yogananda hadprovided a temporizing solution by appointing James Lynn his successor. ThoughLynn was not a natural leader, Yogananda was essentially obliged to select him.Self-Realization Fellowship quite literally owed its continued existence toLynn’s largesse. Yogananda courted Lynn for years, writing him more than sevenhundred letters, many of which included requests for donations. Indeed, untilthe end of his life Yogananda continued to implore Lynn to donate his vastfortune to SRF. Lynn finally did so only in the summer of 1953, more than a yearafter Yogananda’s death and his own accession to the presidency.158[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn158] In gratitude and affection, Yogananda regularlypraised Lynn’s deep devotion and unparalleled spiritual progress.Yogananda gradually laid the foundation for Lynn’s authority as his successor,bestowing the monastic name Rajarsi Janakananda on him in 1951.159[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn159] He hinted at Rajarsi’s advanced spirituality,predicting that he would shortly achieve nirvikalpa samādhi, the highest stageof meditation.160 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn160] This was a remarkable achievementfor one who came to discipleship in midlife after years as a householder andbusinessman. To reach an advanced spiritual state, Lynn had to be purged of manyimperfections. He was, as Florina Darling put it, “more business thanspiritual.”161 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn161] His behavior during Encinitas visitsreflected the character of an entitled millionaire indulging his materialdesires as much as that of a spiritual renunciant. He required freshly launderedbedsheets daily and had soiled clothes shipped home to Kansas City in exchangefor clean ones. Rather than taming his appetite, he indulged it, eatingthroughout the day whenever he felt hungry, expecting dinner whenever he chose,and keeping the best portions for himself rather than his Master. He criticizedthe dietary habits of others so harshly that Merna Brown took to eating in herroom to avoid his reproach.162 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn162]Though Rajarsi grew spiritually, he remained a dubious candidate for spiritualleadership. Monastics may have viewed Yogananda’s decision as a reflection ofdeep affection for his friend or more pragmatically as a calculated reward. Mostlikely, they simply trusted the unfathomable wisdom of their guru. ThoughRajarsi was indisputably earnest and sincere, his understanding wasunsophisticated, his addresses were inarticulate, and his presence wasunderwhelming. In personality and presentation, he could not have contrastedmore sharply with the Master. His unassuming nature may have held some charm,especially for a millionaire, but it in no way compensated for his lack ofcharisma. Undoubtedly recognizing Lynn’s limitations as a leader, Yogananda hadlabored valiantly to steer him toward a figurehead position. He cast a visionfor Lynn of his retirement as a life of meditation “free from the entanglementsof an organization,” that is, devoted to the cause but not involved inleadership.163 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn163]Rajarsi’s lackluster leadership was on full display almost immediately. For hisfirst formal address as head of SRF for its convocation, the annual meeting thatcelebrated the organization and brought members from all over the world to MountWashington, he strung together a series of clichés totaling fewer than fivehundred words. He announced that Master was still present with the gathering,which explained why “I don’t care to talk.”164 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn164] MernaBrown attempted to put Rajarsi’s leadership in the best possible light bydescribing him as “that spiritual bridge that we needed between Master and thework” immediately after Yogananda’s departure, a necessary but temporaryexpedient during a crisis. She acknowledged that Lynn was basically a figureheadpresident and that real responsibility fell to Faye Wright after Yogananda’sdeath, because, as she delicately put it, “Rajasi didn’t get a lot into theadministration.”165 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn165] Lynn’s leadership flawsnotwithstanding, even a genuinely gifted leader would have struggled to donYogananda’s mantle. In the last few years of Yogananda’s life, his intimationsof divine status exacerbated the already daunting challenges any successor wouldconfront.Apart from giving Lynn no real decision-making power, Yogananda limited hisauthority in another way. Faced with indisputable evidence of his own loomingdeath and canny enough to recognize Lynn’s limitations, Yogananda endeavored tosecure the legacy he had worked so hard to create. Self-Realization Fellowshipmembers learned that, despite having ordained Lynn into the swami order, theparamparā would end with Yogananda. Neither Lynn nor any other disciple wouldformally succeed him. This was an unexpected strategy for one who relentlesslydiscussed the importance of the swami order, the guru-disciple relationship, andthe unbroken lineage from Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, and Yukteswar to himself.166[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn166]Instead, Yogananda came to view his own teachings themselves as “the guru,” asomewhat novel idea at the time, but one that anticipated a recent trend inyoga. Despite widespread belief in the necessity of a physical guru, some haveasserted that the guru’s part can be played by a “disembodied influence, that isin reality the inner guru, this interiorized and non-materialized aspect of theexterior guru, who is not separated from the Self and who never dies.”167[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn167] Yoga scholar Suzanne Newcombe argues that the“institutionalization of charisma away from a direct guru-sisya interaction” inrecent decades has facilitated the popularization of yoga globally.168[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn168] Arguably, however, reducing the guru’s authority iseasier in the largely secular world of postural yoga than in a tightlystructured religious organization like SRF. Indeed, the survival of a guru’slegacy may hinge largely on his teachings, as religious scholar Douglas Barnesnotes.169 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn169] Yogananda’s articulation ofteachings-as-guru reflected a sense of his own unique significance, hisreluctance to leave the spotlight, and his reticence about ceding full authorityto any of his disciples. Convinced by his declining health that he would notachieve literal immortality, he sought to live on through his writing. TheAutobiography had already begun the process of his immortalization through text,but he wanted to get the rest of his now voluminous teachings, some only in noteform suitable for oral instruction, in order for publication. He began toexpress great anxiety about having sufficient time to edit this mass of writtenworks. “Where is the time? There is no more time,” he lamented.170[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn170]The notion of Yogananda’s teachings as the guru was made plain to SRF followersearly in Lynn’s presidency. He announced in April, “Master is our guru. Therewill be no other guru. Is there another preceptor? He will continue as always tobe our preceptor.”171 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn171] To shore up any doubts, an SRFannouncement made clear Lynn’s desire “that the SRF teachings and ParamhansaYogananda remain forever the Guru of the organization.” This revelation waspresented not as a limitation on Lynn’s authority but as an expansion ofdevotees’ freedom to advance in their training and spiritual enlightenment“without dependence on the personalities of the SRF leaders.” The guru’s eternalnature and omnipresence would steer devotees away from error. “Yoganandaji istheir Guru still, watching over them beyond any shadow of doubt, and filled withjoy at each step of progress they make along the spiritual path. He promisedmany times to guard the organization and its members after he had left the bodyfor Omnipresence.”172 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn172]Lynn’s stopgap presidency combined with Yogananda’s teachings as the true gurudid little to resolve SRF’s questions of long-term stability. Self-RealizationFellowship’s third annual convocation, held at the Hollywood temple four monthsafter Yogananda’s death, featured instruction, not by Lynn, but by the temple’sresident minister, the Reverend C. Bernard.173 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn173] Lynnwas already ill with brain cancer when he became president; he would die in 1955after several treatments. His rapid decline raised the urgent question of asuitable long-term, authoritative successor. Merna Brown had asked Yoganandashortly before his death who would be president after Rajarsi, an indicationthat they knew his tenure would be short. “God and Guru already know who theyare, and when the time comes, they will be divinely revealed,” he reassured her.“There will always be at the head of this organization men and women of divinerealization.”174 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn174] This vague reassurance offered littledirection, however, about who this long-term leader might be. And howeverdivinely realized, this leader would exercise authority through what Weberdescribed as the routinization of charisma, a shift “from a unique, transitorygift of grace of extraordinary times and persons into a permanent possession ofeveryday life.”175 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn175] The next leader—the first notdirectly designated by the Master—had to be perceived as a consensusappointment, not the result of a majority vote by a board of directors.Self-Realization Fellowship found itself in the position of other Hindu gurutraditions that, as philosopher David Lane indicates, often feel pressure toensure the organization’s continued authority by disguising evidence ofsuccession disputes following a leader’s death.176 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn176]After Rajarsi’s death, Faye Wright and others asked Florina Darling to bepresident, but she declined.177 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn177] The positionultimately fell to Wright, who was presented to the public on the thirdanniversary of Yogananda’s death as the sole, unanimous choice, “an inspiringexample of one-pointed devotion to God and Guru.”178 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn178]The taciturn Wright may have lacked charisma, but she possessed a quietauthority acquired through her decades-long intimate relationship with theMaster. Though the accession of a woman to SRF’s presidency resulted frompragmatism more than progressivism, it was nevertheless remarkable in culturallyconservative 1950s America.Self-Realization Fellowship’s survival remained tenuous for the first decadeafter Yogananda’s death. The organization’s greatest strength, Yogananda’steaching, was also its greatest constraint. Lane’s description of anothertwentieth-century Hindu organization captures the choice SRF faced: “Turnbackwards toward the leader, thereby freeing the founder’s ideas as unique andunquestionable; or turn towards the present and future by looking toward the newsuccessor to forge new territory. In the former case, one runs the risk oflosing the vitality that personal charisma brings, while avoiding the essentialunpredictability (and occasional radicalness) that a new leader may display. Inthe latter case, the benefit depends largely on the success of the chosenmaster.”179 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn179] Having received the “teachings as guru”principle from Yogananda as a fait accompli, SRF was almost forced into thefirst choice. Its ongoing legitimacy rested largely on Yogananda’s teachings,and the organization became a repository of his instruction, endlesslyreprinting his articles and reiterating his sayings. Reliant on his authority,leaders lacked their own vision.The organization eventually found a renewed vision by emphasizing its Indianidentity even more strongly than Yogananda had. Self-Realization regularlyfeatured instruction on āsanas with photographs depicting proper posture andprovided detailed explanations of beliefs like the four āśramas. Monasticsroutinely adopted Indian titles and began wearing ocher robes. President DayaMata (Faye Wright) sponsored an extended trip to the United States orShankaracharya, at the time head of the Śankara swami order, which increasedSRF’s cachet at home and abroad. Daya Mata and other leaders then made ayear-and-a-half pilgrimage to India in 1958–59, replicating their guru’s earlierjourney and strengthening organizational ties between India and the UnitedStates. Along with her extended visit to India, Daya Mata poured financialresources into Indian centers, which placed them on a more stable footing.180[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn180] Among other things, Indianizing SRF helped to lessenthe awkwardness of an American-based Hindu organization led by a white woman—onefounded by an Indian and a nationalist to boot—overseeing a branch in India. Ina remarkable shift in its center of gravity, Yogoda Satsanga Society in Indiabecame home to twenty-five centers, double the number of American SRF centers.But SRF’s growth was not limited to India—in the 1950s, SRF became truly global.By 1960, there were seventy centers in nineteen countries across sixcontinents.181 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn181] Daya Mata gradually grew into her role,and her incredible fifty-five-year tenure ensured that Self-RealizationFellowship—and the guru who founded it—would long remain fixtures of thelandscape in California, the United States, and around the world.But the preservation of Yogananda’s legacy did not depend entirely on thesurvival of SRF, since several disciples ventured outside the organization toform independent endeavors. The death of a charismatic founder often triggersorganizational schisms, a tendency exacerbated by personal ambitions,personality conflicts, doctrinal disagreements, and the availability ofalternative means of legitimation.182 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn182] Former discipleshad several reasons for forming their own organizations. A few, like NormanPaulsen, had left SRF during Yogananda’s lifetime, disillusioned by hisleadership but still inspired by his instruction, while others, particularlyDonald Walters, continued in leadership positions for several years beforeconflicts within the leadership spurred them to set out on their own. Whatevertheir reasons for leaving, the survival of the groups they formed was even moretenuous than that of SRF.Because SRF could make the most plausible claim to be Yogananda’s successor,splinter group leaders were forced to work hard to legitimate their claims toauthority.183 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn183] Leaders of new movements oftenidentified a self-authenticating charismatic quality or recounted a mysticalencounter with Yogananda in which he transferred authority, but this did notresolve matters.184 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn184] These independent communities hadto walk a tightrope, celebrating their leaders’ heritage as direct disciples ofYogananda’s teachings while attempting to offer a compelling explanation fortheir separation from the very organization their guru founded.Donald Walters created the most successful independent community. He took hisfinal vows in 1955 under Daya Mata (Wright), becoming Swami Kriyananda andbecame vice-president of SRF in 1960. In 1958, he traveled to India for thefirst time promoting Kriya Yoga. His restlessness over the strictures ofinstitutional religion, combined with ongoing tensions with the leadership,particularly Wright, led to his ouster from the organization in 1962. Whereas hesaw them as hidebound, they undoubtedly viewed him as an upstart, having knownYogananda for such a short time by comparison with their own much longerrelationships.Though his discipleship had been much shorter than Wright’s, Walters had enjoyeda particularly close relationship with the Master during his last few years.Walters traced his spiritual legitimacy chiefly to his personal time withYogananda in the Twenty-Nine Palms ashram, transcribing his guru’s comments forthe Second Coming of Christ commentary. He claimed that Yogananda had bestowedon him a supernatural ability to recall accurately, years after the fact, theMaster’s exact words and their tone. And though Yogananda never asked Waltersoutright, he “intimated strongly that he wanted me someday to write about him.”Walters based this impression on Yogananda’s lengthy reminiscences about hislife, ministry, and plans for SRF’s future.185 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn185]After being forced out of SRF, Kriyananda felt disillusioned, unsure what to dowith his life severed from the one who had given that life meaning. As hewandered physically and spiritually, he explored Episcopalian monasteries inthree states, lived briefly in a Catholic hermitage near Big Sur, became anashram minister in San Francisco for a time, and contemplated joining a“little-known religious site in Lebanon.”186 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn186]In 1967, at the height of the counterculture, Kriyananda and a few likemindedindividuals began construction of a community in the Sierra Nevadas thatepitomized the era’s communes. Kriyananda’s community embodied all of thefeatures Timothy Miller identified as core values most 1960s communes shareddespite a host of variations: a common purpose and separation from society, somelevel of individual self-denial for the sake of the group, living in geographicproximity, regular personal interaction, economic sharing, real existence (asopposed to only envisioned), critical mass beyond an individual family, andcommitment to rural idealism, environmentalism, egalitarianism, andcommunity.187 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn187] Well-known Beat figures Allen Ginsberg,Richard Baker, and Gary Snyder purchased several hundred acres in Nevada City inthe mountains northeast of Sacramento for the creation of Ananda, Kriyananda’scooperative community.188 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn188] Ananda matched the communalspirit of the counterculture era and its fascination with Asian traditions, andundoubtedly deepened both.189 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn189]For Kriyananda, however, this communal vision sprang from the “brotherhoodcommunities” Yogananda had called for decades earlier when he returned fromIndia. Kriyananda envisaged “places to facilitate the development of anintegrated, well-balanced life, and as examples to all mankind of the advantagesof such a life.” Not isolated from the larger world, they would be “an integralpart of the age in which we live.”190 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn190] Ananda’s focuson “householders” offered a sharp contrast with SRF, which devoted substantialattention to strengthening monastic communities, even though the vast majorityof rank-and-file SRF members were married devotees. Kriyananda was personallyambivalent about the virtues of a monastic life compared with the attractions ofsexual intimacy. He was twice married and divorced, and he admitted to havingaffairs with women in his community. His personal lifestyle choices aside, byarguing that Ananda had remained faithful to Yogananda’s communal vision whileSRF ignored it, Kriyananda boosted his claim to be the Master’s authenticspiritual descendent.By the early 1990s, Ananda had grown to more than 350 members and severalsatellite organizations, including one in Italy.191 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn191]Legal and financial troubles have reduced its ranks over the years, but ahalf-century after its founding, it continues to exist as a modest community ofmore than 100 members who support themselves through work in and around thecommunity. Like Yogananda, a good part of Kriyananda’s popularity—and hisorganization’s longevity—stemmed from his 1977 book The Path: A SpiritualAutobiography. A massive, sprawling, supernatural account largely devoted to hislife with Yogananda, the book functioned as a recruitment tool, as Autobiographyof a Yogi had. Beyond his autobiography, Kriyananda wrote prolifically aboutYogananda, community, yoga, meditation, and spirituality in a destructive age.He reprinted numerous Yogananda works that were not copyrighted and published anedition of the Bhagavad Gītā in 2006, which he claimed to have reproduced frommemory based on his editorial work with Yogananda at Twenty-Nine Palms more thanfifty years earlier. In 2012, he published a lengthy biography of Yogananda thatincluded spiritual details, including his identity in previous incarnations.192[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn192] When Swami Kriyananda died in 2013, commemorations ofhis life and ministry revealed that his flock were as devoted to him as he hadbeen to his own beloved guru.193 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn193]In 1970, Oliver Black established Song of the Morning Ranch, an independentcommunity in Michigan similar to Ananda. Black’s path to yoga gurudom had beenlong and winding. Born in Ohio in 1893, he had owned a million-dollar auto partschain. Despite his success, he had been deeply unhappy before he met Yoganandain 1931. A severe hypochondriac, he popped “pills for laxatives, aspirins forheadaches, and probably would have taken tranquilizers if they’d had them.” Andlike many disciples, his attraction to Yogananda had been immediate, as he“instantly recognized” Yogananda “for the spiritual giant he was.” Black becamea disciple that day, and Yogananda changed the entire direction of his life.194[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn194] Though something of a renegade, he became a part-timeSRF teacher. But unlike Lynn, he never heeded Yogananda’s call to abandon hisbusiness life and donate the bulk of his wealth to the higher cause of SRF. Justmonths before his death, Yogananda wrote to Black, urging him to use hisleadership skills to do “something much greater, much more lasting, much easier,and much more secure than present-day business organizations in which one worksto pay taxes, ruining his health and happiness.” He thought Detroit’s locationideal for drawing “true seekers, both from East and West,” and wanted Black toestablish a center there.195 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn195] Black resisted this calland ultimately lost much of his wealth in a hostile takeover of his company in1952. Chastened by what he took to be punishment for ignoring God’s call throughYogananda, Black finally became a full-time minister.His relationship with SRF leadership after Yogananda’s death was rocky. In themid-1960s, he established an independent instructional program, YogacharyaOliver Black’s Self-Realization Yoga. A few years later he opened Song of theMorning Ranch on eight hundred acres in Michigan’s Pigeon River State Forest.The community was founded to practice meditation, teach yoga, explorephilosophy, “investigate unexplained laws of nature and the powers latent inhuman beings,” and “provide people with opportunities and facilities to reach abetter understanding of themselves, their environment, the universe and God onan interdenominational, interfaith and international scope.”196[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn196]Claiming the mantle of Yogananda, Black was credited with similar qualities.Believers experienced the power of his lustrous eyes, sensed that he knew theirthoughts—in fact, knew them better than they knew themselves—and viewed him asthe manifestation of God.197 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn197] Black died in 1989 at ageninety-six while practicing yoga. Like many communal experiments of that era,the community he founded has long since folded; the ranch continues todaylargely as a “yoga retreat of excellence,” providing guests “an environment inwhich to learn and practice timeless spiritual techniques and principlesanchored in the teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda.”198[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn198]Norman Paulsen, undoubtedly the most colorful of all of Yogananda’s disciples,received a cosmological revelation that authenticated his independent ministry.While still at SRF he saw UFOs. His visions ultimately landed him in CamarilloState Hospital for psychiatric evaluation. In 1969, he rented a house indowntown Santa Barbara that he dubbed “The House of Aquarius” and began teachingmeditation to hippies, surfers, and other seekers. Eventually, “Spirit broughttogether so many people of varied backgrounds to learn to live and work togetherin brotherhood” that they decided to create a commune.199[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn199] He formed Sunburst, a community of three hundred onthree thousand acres in Santa Barbara. The group operated the nation’s largestorganic farm, four markets, two restaurants, and a bakery.Despite some reliance on his short discipleship under Yogananda to establish hisspiritual pedigree, Paulsen largely forged his own path. His worldview was builton a narrative about earth’s ancient history:Five hundred thousand years ago the Earth supported a super civilization. Thissuper race, called The Builders, was invaded by a malignant, negative forcearound three hundred and fifty thousand years ago. This invasion was fought outin space for a while, from Earth, Mars, and the moons of Jupiter. The enemyfirst forced a landing in The Euphrates Valley, bringing the war to Earth’ssurface. A devastating attack by The Nephilim destroyed the whole continent ofMu finally and generated the great Biblical flood. This flood made the Earthuninhabitable for the invaders as well as most of The Builders.The Builders were decimated—more than sixty million died in one night—and thesurvivors fled the earth in their starships, leaving the solar systemaltogether. The Builders began to return in 1961, “to illuminate all of humanityand destroy the makers of war forever,” and Sunburst was one of their basestations.200 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn200]By the late 1970s, the community began to collapse as Paulsen’s erratic behaviordrove members away. Anticipating society’s collapse, he directed a former GreenBeret soldier to stockpile assault rifles and ammunition at Sunburst. Paulsen’sserious drug addiction also upset many, who wanted clean bodies along with cleanspirits in their community—not least from their leader. Paulsen acknowledged hisdrug problem, though he explained it as the consequence of absorbing hisdisciples’ bad karma. His explanation failed to persuade many. By the late1980s, his community had largely dissolved and he was living in a waterfrontcondominium in Oxnard next to his seventy-eight-foot schooner. A few members ofthe group held on to a sliver of the Santa Barbara land and operated a gasstation. Eventually, they reestablished the organic ranch and community.201[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn201] Today, Sunburst describes itself as “a world communityof practice dedicated to personal and planetary awakening.” The whitewasheddescription of their founder is brief and upbeat, describing Paulsen as havinghad “a series of illuminating experiences,” “culminating in a journey intocosmic consciousness—a face to face meeting with the ineffable light of God,merging with the eternal Divine Presence.” Ignoring its debt toextraterrestrials, Sunburst touts its link to Yogananda: “The teachings ofSelf-realization that Sunburst offers are based upon the universal lineage ofParamahansa Yogananda and his direct disciple, founder Norman Paulsen, as wellas the living guidance of the Christ consciousness Jesus exemplifiesunceasingly. These great souls are active in these teachings today, as are manyothers from the living presence of I Am That I Am.”202 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn202]Like Black, Roy Eugene Davis took an unconventional route to independentspiritual leadership. He joined SRF only in 1949, but shortly after Yogananda’sdeath, he left to serve a short stint in the armed forces. This decisionreflected an awareness of “a need to learn to live effectively in the secularworld,” an oblique criticism of SRF’s cloistered monastic lifestyle.203[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn203] Davis also objected to tenets of SRF theology thatwere essential to Yogananda’s glorified status: that a guru has no personalkarma, that he could avoid personal physical illness, or that he was anavatāra.204 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn204] He also strenuously rejected the notionthat the lineage of gurus stopped with Yogananda’s death. Davis staked his ownclaim to spiritual legitimacy as Yogananda’s “only living guru-successor” andinsisted that the Master expected his disciples to train their own disciples.205[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn205] In 1964, he formed an independent organization, theCenter for Spiritual Consciousness, on eleven and a half acres in Lakemont,Georgia, a mountainous community ninety miles northeast of Atlanta, with thismission: “All authentic enlightenment traditions are honored and the innate,divine nature of every person is acknowledged. We affirm that it is possible foreveryone, by right personal endeavor and God’s grace, to have a consciousrelationship with the Infinite and to fulfill all of life’s purposes in harmonywith natural laws.”206 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn206]Not long after Yogananda’s death, Mildred Hamilton moved to Seattle. LikePremananda, Hamilton was jolted from head to toe when she touched the Master’sbody on its deathbed. This was a fitting bookend to her physical relationshipwith Yogananda, which began with an electric shock when she first met him backin 1925.207 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn207] It was also an authentication of herauthority to teach in his name. In 1954, she became a follower of Ram Dass (bornRichard Alpert), one of the most influential yogis in the United States of thebaby boom era. She visited him in India and began to call him “Papa.” Despiteher devotion to Ram Dass, she viewed Yogananda as her guru and saw herself asfaithful to his teachings. Like many others, she received a postmortem visitfrom Yogananda in 1956. In this visit, however, “her great Guru” commissionedher “to initiate others, thus carrying on the hallowed guru-disciplerelationship.”208 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn208] Besides this vision and the electricshock, she traced her authority to her status as “the only woman world-wide whomYogananda himself ordained to be a Yogacharya, fully transmitting the highestvibration from his unending reservoir of spiritual magnetism.”209[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn209] After her return from India, she gathered disciplesaround herself and eventually formed the Cross and the Lotus, a “Christian Yoga”organization—not an officially incorporated church—“Dedicated to the Realizationof God and service to Him in all forms.” Despite tension between the Cross andthe Lotus and SRF, the two acknowledge the same guru lineage: Jesus and Babaji,Lahiri Mahasaya and Sri Yukteswar, and Yogananda himself.210[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn210] At Hamilton’s death in 1991, the mantle passed toDavid Hickenbottom, a disciple since 1974. Cross and Lotus favors virtualcommunity over literal community. It publishes a journal and a blog, whilemaking publications available to help people practice yoga as a “non-sectarian,non-affiliated group of souls who are sincerely working to manifest the will ofthese great Masters of Yoga: Union with God.”211 [18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn211]WHO SPEAKS FOR YOGANANDA?Swami Premananda, Yogananda’s sole remaining Indian friend and the man whoconducted his memorial service, outlived his master by more than four decades,finally passing from this life in 1995 at age ninety-two. Since his death, theSelf-Revelation Church of Absolute Monism has been run by an American-born whitewoman, Srimati Kamala. Self-Revelation Church mirrors SRF in that an Indianfounder has been succeeded by white disciples who oversee a largely white laymembership—though, given the nation’s increased ethnic diversity, bothorganizations boast more nonwhite members than in previous decades.Self-Revelation Church is also like the surviving independent organizations inanother key sense. With the exception of Davis, who remained the director of theCenter for Spiritual Awareness in 2018 at age eighty-seven, these organizationshave all entered at least their second generation of leadership. The directdisciples of Yogananda passed from the scene long ago.Few of these organizations have experienced substantial success. They lackaccess to various resources, tangible and intangible, that have allowed SRF tothrive. The departure of some to found their own organizations was too modest tocause a schism within SRF, whose power continued largely unabated, as is commonwith “religious groups with centralized authority structures.”212[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn212] SRF possesses tremendous financial resources thatcushion it from temporal storms. It owns several pieces of valuable property,some of which are tourist destinations at which brochures are distributed aboutthe correspondence course lessons and images, postcards, incense, and variousSRF publications are sold. Self-Realization Fellowship sells a host of Yoganandapublications in many languages and editions. To SRF’s chagrin, some ofYogananda’s works are in the public domain, including the Autobiography. But SRFretains copyright over several others. Years ago, SRF began including a messageof authenticity on the inside covers of its materials, entitled “The SpiritualLegacy of Paramahansa Yogananda.” Acknowledging the “increasing variety ofsources of information” about Yogananda, SRF was obligated to ensure that “thespiritual legacy he left not be diluted, fragmented, or distorted with thepassing of time.” The SRF name and logo guarantee that the publication“originates with the organization founded by Paramahansa Yogananda andfaithfully conveys his teachings as he himself intended they be given.”213[18_notes.xhtml#c5.fn213] This message has failed to make SRF the sole authorityon Yogananda’s image, teachings, and legacy. In the past few decades rivalportrayals, both positive and negative, have proliferated, thanks in part to thegrowth of the Internet."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUEOn December 12, 2010, a solemn group of spiritual devotees convened at thePasadena Civic Auditorium on the outskirts of Los Angeles, filling the threethousand-seat venue to capacity. The “blessed and sacred occasion” was amemorial service in honor of Sri Daya Mata, SRF’s sanghamata, or mother of thespiritual community, for more than a half-century. Daya Mata, Faye Wright, hadrecently “passed,” though disciples offered testimonials of her continuedpresence; the vibrations of her love continued to flow into their hearts, theysaid.1 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn1] Her death was honored—though not mourned,as participants steadfastly refused to express grief—in an elaboratetwo-and-a-half-hour ceremony replete with Hindu rituals and affectionatecommemorative speeches. The devotees, though well versed in the spirituallineage of their movement, were nevertheless reminded at the ceremony’s outsetthat their gathering was made possible by the “living spirit of Sri SriParamahansa Yogananda,” their “premavatar,” or incarnation of divine love, and“gurudev,” or personal teacher embodying divinity. The service concluded withaudio playback of a talk in which Daya had expressed her “one hunger” thatdevotees would know the “blissful love” she had experienced with God, “becausehe is the greatest lover in the world, he is the one love from whence we haveall come. We must learn to live and move and have our being in thatconsciousness of his love and then one day to melt again back into that immortallove, where we will all meet again.”The Hindu character of the event was unmistakable. A banner with SRF’s stylizedlotus logo, a prominent symbol of Indian spirituality, dominated theflower-festooned stage. The ceremony featured meditation, the intoning of “Om,Shanti, Om,” and lengthy kīrtan singing, including one of Daya Mata’s favorite“cosmic chants.” A reading from the Bhagavad Gītā reminded devotees that while“the end of birth is death” and “the end of death is birth,” the soul is“impenetrable, unentered, unassailed, unharmed, untouched, immortal,all-arriving, stable, sure, invisible, ineffable.” Thus, “never the spirit wasborn; the spirit will cease to be never.” Near the end of the service, a “sacredand holy ancient ascension ceremony” was conducted, the fire on stagerepresenting the “soul of the departed, which, free from limitations andphysical form,” was now “finding its greater existence in spirit.” SwamiSmaranananda, who led the fire ceremony, was a leader in Yogoda Satanga, theIndian branch of SRF. His presence was a reminder of SRF’s Indian roots, itscontinued ties to India, and its global reach. The memorial service alsoreflected SRF’s engagement with Christianity, selectively incorporating elementsof its belief and worship—with use of “Amen” and references to “Heavenly Father”and “Jesus Christ” intertwined with invocations to the Divine Mother, Krishna,and gurus in the movement’s lineage—into its larger Hindu vision that fulfilledall spiritual longings.Daya Mata’s death prompted SRF’s first leadership replacement since theEisenhower era. She was succeeded by the seventy-nine-year-old Sri MrinaliniMata (Merna Brown), SRF vice-president for nearly fifty years. Having long sinceroutinized its charismatic leadership, SRF chose Mrinalini Mata through abusinesslike board of directors election in early 2011.2[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn2] Her position seemed largely titular. She rarelyappeared in public and did not attend the 2016 memorial service for BrotherAnandamoy, a monk for more than sixty-five years. A board member read a letterfrom her instead.3 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn3]Yogananda and his ministry have reached the age where milestone celebrationsbegin to pile up. The year Daya Mata died, SRF celebrated the sixtiethanniversary of the World Convocation in Los Angeles, an annual spiritualconference begun by Yogananda in 1950 at Mount Washington. Where the originalconvocation drew a few hundred participants, more than four thousand attendedthe 2010 event held at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, a premier conference venuein downtown Los Angeles. The following March, SRF and its sister organization inIndia formally commemorated the sixtieth anniversary of Yogananda’s mahasamādhiwith local celebrations, a commemorative issue of Self-Realization magazine, andan audio compact disc of Daya Mata’s reminiscences of the Master.4[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn4] Self-Realization Fellowship celebrated theseventieth anniversary of Mrinalini Mata’s entrance into the ashram in June2016.5 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn5] As the introduction indicated, thecentenary of Yogananda’s work was celebrated in March 2017. And in January 2018,Yogananda devotees around the world commemorated the 125th anniversary of hisbirth.The year 2017 also saw a changing of the guard. The centerpiece of that year’sconvocation was a memorial to the recently deceased Mrinalini Mata. On September1, SRF announced that Brother Chidananda, a longtime board member and a monksince 1977, would become the organization’s fourth president. The first male tohead SRF in more than sixty years, he is also the organization’s first presidentwho never knew the Master personally, having been born the year after Yoganandadied. Following established SRF precedent, the announcement of his appointmentwas accompanied by testimonials legitimizing his succession: shortly before herdeath, Daya Mata had confided to Mrinalini that Chidananda would be the nextpresident; Mrinalini had had a similar conviction months before her own death;and the SRF vote was unanimous. At sixty-four, Chidananda could potentially leadthe organization for two decades or more, providing stability after therelatively short tenure of the aged leader Mrinalini.6[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn6]Brother Chidananda’s first act as president was to announce the upcoming releaseof a “comprehensive enhancement and expansion” of the SRF lessons. In theircurrent form, the convoluted, repetitive, and dated-sounding lessons sprawlacross more than thirteen hundred pages. The revised lessons will condenseYogananda’s instruction “into a more organized and focused presentation” thatwill provide “clearer and more detailed instruction on the SRF meditationtechniques, including Kriya Yoga, and many other subjects.” A cause forcelebration and possible trepidation, SRF leadership walked a tightrope in theirrollout presentation. They sought to assure the faithful of the ongoing validityof the existing lessons, which “have everything a seeker needs to find God,”until the new lessons became available. At the same time, they established thenew lessons’ legitimacy by authenticating their pedigree: Yogananda himselfbegan the revisions before personally commissioning the task to Mrinalini Mata,who labored on the project for decades.7 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn7] In thisand his many other endeavors, Chidananda does not have to manage the burden ofleadership alone. Gurudev Sri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda will undoubtedlycontinue to guide the organization, as he done ever since his mahasamādhi.Changes in leadership are not the only hurdles SRF has overcome in the past fewdecades. Since the 1990s, several controversies have also challenged theidentity that Yogananda so carefully crafted for himself and his ministry. In1995, a man named Ben Erskine began to pursue family hints he had heard sincehis childhood that Yogananda might be his father. His search became moreprominent through the work of the Los Angeles New Times, a short-livedpublication that prided itself on exposé-style investigative reporting, whichpublished two lengthy articles purporting to prove that Yogananda had fatheredErskine in 1933 with an SRF member named Adelaide Erskine.8[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn8] The credibility of this claim depended in part onearlier rumors and accusations. Besides the allegation of sexual improprietyNerode made in his 1939 lawsuit, rumors long swirled that Yogananda had fathereda child with Laurie Pratt. Pratt, a devotee since 1924 and editorial assistantto Yogananda for decades, gave birth out of wedlock in 1929, and Yoganandaallowed the unmarried mother and child to live at Mount Washington. At best,this evidence was circumstantial and could easily be explained as Yogananda’scompassionate response to a vulnerable young mother and child. But if paternitywere to be established for Erskine or any other claimant, it would damageYogananda’s reputation, premised on his perfect character. Equally devastatingto SRF, the legal rights to his lucrative writings would transfer to his closestblood relative. Self-Realization Fellowship reportedly threatened the New Timeswith multiple lawsuits. In 2002, the conflict concluded when blood tests failedto confirm Erskine’s claims, New Times folded, and the rumors faded.9[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn9]Another attack challenged the character of Yogananda’s successors. A New Timesarticle reported that Daya Mata and her sister had been living in a luxurioushome in Sierra Madre for decades and driving a pink Cadillac to MountWashington—a secret so well kept that even some monastics at Mount Washingtonwere unaware of the women’s residence. New Times also alleged that SRF paid hushmoney to a woman who claimed that she became pregnant by Brother Arjunananda.10[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn10] Though inadequately sourced, these accusationsnevertheless blackened SRF’s reputation.Even SRF’s generally friendly Mount Washington neighbors have sometimes turnedhostile. In 1999, SRF resurrected plans to inter Yogananda at Mount Washington,a move the well-off residents of the steep hillside community successfullyresisted. Some critics viewed the reburial plan as an effort to control accessto the shrine (presently publicly accessible at Forest Lawn Cemetery) and tocommercialize it through construction of a museum and gift shop.11[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn11]Some have accused SRF of being a secretive cult. Geoffrey Falk’s Stripping theGurus offered a scathing exposé of SRF from a former member who spent more thana decade with the organization, including time at its Hidden Valley ashram. Hefound SRF oppressive and invasive.12 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn12] Other formermembers have sometimes echoed these accusations. A now-defunct long-runningonline discussion board, SRF Walrus, provided a forum for ex-SRF members todiscuss their negative experiences with the organization while defending whatthey viewed as a more accurate account of Yogananda’s character, teachings, andlegacy. The introduction to the discussion board avowed that those “using thisboard are loyal devotees of Paramahansa Yogananda. The board is not intended tobe a source of criticism of his message or life. While it is often critical ofthose currently in leadership positions within Self Realization Fellowship, thisshould not reflect on the many giving loving service to Master.”13[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn13] A successor site launched in 2012, SRF Blacklist,has been more willing to target Yogananda himself, with threads exploringallegations of sexual impropriety and assertions, often with proffereddocumentation, that he was not sole author of texts attributed to him.14[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn14] Online nonprofit organizations such as CultEducation Institute, which describes itself as a nonprofit public “internetarchive of information about cults, destructive cults, controversial groups andmovements,” monitors SRF—as well as its offspring, Ananda—and posts regular newsupdates about the organization’s activities.15 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn15]The most impassioned controversies have taken place between rival organizationscontesting Yogananda’s legacy—and legal right to the lucrative products of thatlegacy. Hugh Urban notes that as “struggles over intellectual property havebecome increasingly common with religious movements,” disputes over copyright,patent, and trademark have become more common, though some organizations “haveresisted the commercialization of traditional spiritual practices, arguing thatthese are ‘public goods’ that cannot be privatized and commodified.”16[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn16] Self-Realization Fellowship challenged Ananda ina major lawsuit that spanned more than a decade, triggered in part by Ananda’s1990 decision to change the organization’s name by adding “Self-Realization,” aterm SRF claimed to have sole right to as a result of its 1935 incorporation. Atstake was SRF’s claim to be the sole entity authorized to represent Yogananda.The organization asserted exclusive right to publish Yogananda’s writings, eventhough some texts had never been formally copyrighted and others, like theAutobiography, had expired copyrights. It also claimed to own the rights toYogananda’s name and photographs of him. Throughout the lawsuit, Kriyananda senta raft of open letters to Ananda members and to SRF members, portraying hisorganization as David to SRF’s Goliath and offering to “make friends.”17[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn17] Self-Realization Fellowship leaders did not seethese unsolicited letters as benign attempts at reconciliation. They sent theirown lengthy letter to SRF members clearing up what they viewed as Kriyananda’sfalsehoods, while clarifying their own position on various issues raised in thelitigation.18 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn18]During this lawsuit, a former member of Ananda, Anne-Marie Bertolucci of PaloAlto, sued senior minister Danny Levin, vice president of Ananda’s publishingwing, Crystal Clarity. Later, she added Swami Kriyananda to the suit, allegedlyfor making unwanted sexual advances toward her when she went to him asking forhelp with Levin. Ananda acknowledged an affair between Bertolucci and Levin butsteadfastly denied the charges against Kriyananda. Ananda believed that SRF hadsecretly encouraged Bertolucci’s suit to destroy Kriyananda’s reputation, sincethe lead attorney, Michael Flynn, was the same in both cases. Self-RealizationFellowship vehemently denied the charge. Seven women ultimately testified underoath to sexual harassment, and a $1.8 million judgment was brought againstAnanda.19 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn19]Ironically, Ananda largely won the copyright lawsuit: the organization wasallowed to use Yogananda’s name, some photographs of him, and the label“Self-Realization.” Also ironically, Ananda now refers to itself as AnandaSangha Worldwide, adopting the Sanskrit word meaning “community,” a termYogananda employed in the United States in the years before SRF’s incorporationin 1935 and which is still incorporated in YSS, the India branch of SRF.20[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn20] More importantly, anyone can publishAutobiography of a Yogi and a few other books without threat of suit by SRF.Project Gutenberg, for example, provides an electronic copy of the firstedition.21 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn21] Between legal expenses and thejudgment in the Bertolucci case, Ananda filed for bankruptcy. Critics viewedthis as a cynical effort to avoid paying damages to Bertolucci.22[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn22]Through the litigation process, it became clear that over the years SRF hadaltered Yogananda’s writings in generally small ways but in countless places.Most notably, the organization made more than a hundred modifications toAutobiography of a Yogi, which it justified as expressing the true intent oftheir guru, who had himself made alterations between the first edition and 1946and his death in early 1952. Many of these changes were simple updates ofinformation that was no longer relevant or accurate decades after Yogananda’sdeath. Some changes corrected minor errors or clarified statements thatYogananda had worded ambiguously. He was curiously reticent, for example, tocredit James Lynn for the Encinitas Hermitage, a vagueness clarified in revisededitions.23 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn23] But many changes seem moreself-interested, reflecting efforts to portray SRF as the chosen vessel forYogananda’s teachings. For example, the revised text describing learning theKriya Yoga technique adds that it should be learned “from an authorized Kriyaban(Kriya Yogi) of Self-Realization Fellowship.”24 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn24]Editors of the book placed a very convenient declaration into Yogananda’s mouthon the eve of his 1935 departure for India, having him announce, “ToSelf-Realization Fellowship I donated all my possessions, including the rightsin all my writings.”25 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn25]If some changes to the Autobiography portrayed SRF as Yogananda’s uniquemouthpiece, other changes seemed designed to discredit independent organizationsas legitimate representatives of his teachings. References to groups no longerassociated with SRF were purged entirely. Several references to SwamiPremananda, a close friend of Yogananda’s from India who first came to theUnited States in 1928, disappeared from SRF’s revised Autobiography. This islikely because his organization had become the Church of Absolute Monism, anorganization independent of SRF—but continuing to claim direct authority throughdirect lineage from Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswar, and Yogananda.26[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn26]One notable disagreement between SRF and other organizations surrounds thecentrality of celibacy. Self-Realization Fellowship has consistently presentedmonasticism as the preferable form of community. Consequently, SRF staff omittedentirely Yogananda’s vision of a brotherhood colony at the end of theAutobiography that had inspired Kriyananda, Davis, Black, and others to createtheir own communities of families rather than monastics. After the Autobiographywas published in 1946, Yogananda does seem to have shifted to a focus onmonastic communities. By 1949, he was “showing a new way of freedom in the West”by envisioning the creation of “simple colonies of approximately 25 acres eachin various areas beyond the city limits where taxes are lower.” Each communitywould consist of fifty to one hundred “selfless monks and sisters.” Whetheryoung, middle aged, or elderly (as long as they were healthy), Yogananda wasquite clear that they would be “renunciants,” not householders.27[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn27] Still, even if brotherhood colonies did notreflect Yogananda’s mature vision, SRF’s elimination of his original words fromthe Autobiography was a bold assertion of interpretive authority.Later editions also made Yogananda’s supernatural qualities more prominent. Thisincluded the deletion of his warning about the possibility of World War III, astatement that later readers might have interpreted as a failed prophecy.28[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn28] It also included insertions, such as the lengthyfootnote explaining that Yogananda told his students that “after this life, hewould continue to watch over the spiritual progress of all Kriyabans (studentsof Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons who have received Kriya initiation …).The truth of his beautiful promise has been proved, since his mahasamādhi, byletters from Kriya Yogis who have become aware of his omnipresent guidance.”29[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn29]The most important change to SRF’s later editions of the Autobiography was theinsertion of a publisher’s note that explicitly defended the organization’sunique authority to propagate Yogananda’s teaching. The note accused otherunnamed groups of “borrowing the name of this beloved world teacher to furthertheir own societies or interests, or to gain recognition for themselves.” ThenSRF’s explanation went on to justify their changes as a fulfillment ofYogananda’s express wishes.Others are presenting what is purported to be his “original” teachings, but whatis in fact material taken from publications that had been poorly edited bytemporary helpers or compiled from incomplete notes taken during ParamahansaYogananda’s classes. Paramahansaji was very dissatisfied with the presentationof this material, which came out during his early years in America, when he wasoften away on lecture tours for months at a time and had very little opportunityto oversee the material being published. He himself later did much work on itand gave specific instructions for its correction and clarification.The punchline was the explanation that followed, which assured potentiallyconfused readers that the only genuine publications were those bearing the SRFlogo. Even though SRF’s editors had indisputably altered what the Master wrote,they remained the guarantors of his authentic message: “Paramahansa Yoganandafounded Self-Realization Fellowship in 1920 to be the instrument for worldwidedissemination of his teachings. He personally chose and trained those closedisciples who constitute the Self-Realization Fellowship Publications Council,giving them specific guidelines for the publishing of his writings, lectures,and Self-Realization Lessons.”30 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn30]The Autobiography was only the most prominent of Yogananda’s texts to receive apostmortem makeover from SRF. Two other massive works based on his writings werepublished near the start of the new millennium. The Bhagavad Gita: God Talkswith Arjuna: Royal Science of God-Realization, appeared in 1995 and totaled morethan twelve hundred pages in two volumes. The Second Coming of Christ: TheResurrection of Christ Within You followed in 2004, also in two volumes andseveral hundred pages longer. As systematic treatments of the core texts ofChristianity and modern Hinduism, the books represented Yogananda’sauthoritative treatment of the two great religious traditions that defined hisministry. These lavish publications, with hardback covers, gold lettering,decorative endpapers, and dozens of rich full-color illustrations, both appearedin print for the first time decades after Yogananda’s death. Both bore his nameas author and were ostensibly based on long-running columns in East-West—andboth departed dramatically from the text that appeared there.At the outset of each tome, SRF was obligated to explain the astonishing delayin publication after Yogananda’s death—more than forty years in the first caseand over fifty in the second. In her preface to the Gītā, Daya Mata referred tothe East-West articles parenthetically and called them merely a “a preliminaryserialization.” Yogananda’s real work, she said, began at Twenty-Nine Palms inlate 1948 and required “a review of the material that had been written over aperiod of so many years, clarification and amplification of many points,abbreviation of passages that contained duplication that had been necessary onlyin serialization for new readers.” But work extended beyond mere editing to the“addition of new inspirations—including many details of yoga’s deeperphilosophical concepts that he had not attempted to convey in earlier years to ageneral audience not yet introduced to the unfolding discoveries in science thathave since made the Gītā’s cosmology and view of man’s physical, mental, andspiritual makeup much more understandable to the Western mind.” Converting thesenew insights to book form required extensive labor. Completely ignoring any roleby Walters, the preface explained that Tara Mata (Laurie Pratt) editedYogananda’s work as he wrote and, after his death, continued the magazineserialization. She died in 1971, “before she could complete the preparation ofthe Gītā manuscript as he had intended,” according to Daya Mata. The baton wasthen passed to Mrinalini Mata, the only person who, “because of her years oftraining from the Guru and her attunement with the Guru’s thoughts,” could havecompleted the task.31 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn31]The hints that Pratt’s product was inadequate and that Mata uniquely possessedthe requisite understanding of Yogananda’s teaching together suggest thatsomething more substantive than mere editing of Yogananda’s words was involvedin bringing the commentary to print. Whatever the disarray of his notes, editingalone cannot explain the decades-long delay in publication. More likely, therewas protracted debate within the leadership of SRF about how best to representthe spirit of the Master’s words without relying exclusively on extant texts.Daya Mata seems to suggest this kind of interpretive editorial process in herpreface to the other major commentary, The Second Coming of Christ. She explainshow Yogananda worked on the Gospel commentaries at Encinitas throughout the late1930s and into the 1940s, though only sporadically, since much of his time wasabsorbed by other projects, especially the Autobiography. After a plan fellthrough to turn the Gospel series into a book, Yogananda recognized “that forthe worldwide public distribution he envisioned, the manuscript would requirefurther attention.” For the time being, the Gospel commentary would be availableonly through the magazine. “Continue to print the articles in our magazine forour readers,” he purportedly directed. “Later, I will have to do more work onthem.” During his final period in Twenty-Nine Palms, when he was at work on theGītā commentary, Yogananda also sought to revise a number of earlier works,including the Gospel commentary. “His instruction for the completion of thispresent book was to draw on the full measure of material he had given on thelife and teachings of Jesus in order to impart to a world audience thecomprehensive presentation of the true teachings of the blessed Christ that hehad divinely received.” This required SRF staff to cull through his years ofweekly sermons, since “he often included some commentary on, or applicable to,one or more verses from the Gospels.” A review of these materials revealed“freshly expressed concepts, clarification and elaboration of points” notdirectly addressed in the magazine serialization. The sermon insights, alongwith “other of Paramahansaji’s truth-perceptions, forthcoming during his fulllifetime” of ministry, “have been made an integrated whole in this definitiveedition of The Second Coming of Christ.” Thus, the final product was a compositework that stitched together teachings from various texts that the author hadnever himself combined and, like the Gītā, seemed designed to capture the spiritof the Master’s teachings, even if some of the particular words had never beforeappeared in print (preface, Second Coming, xvi–xx).Publication of The Second Coming of Christ drew interest from the press in LosAngeles, home of SRF’s international headquarters. The Los Angeles Times article“A Hindu’s Perspective on Christ and Christianity” reported that the work by a“renowned Indian guru” was receiving praise as “the first detailedinterpretation of the four Gospels by a Hindu.” The article cited praise fromtwo religious scholars. Robert Ellwood called Second Coming a “rarebridge-building book,” and Arvind Sharma said it was “path breaking.” “We haveto let go,” Sharma continued, vindicating Yogananda’s inclusivist adoption ofthe New Testament, “of the attitude that only Christians have the right tointerpret the Bible, that a religion belongs only to its followers.”32[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn32]Given SRF’s sense of interpretive license, it is no surprise that the BhagavadGītā and Second Coming are both strikingly different from their early East-Westserializations. First, the books are considerably longer. For example, the SRFcommentary on chapter 1 [12_chapter01.xhtml], verse 1, of the Bhagavad Gītācontains roughly 50 percent more words. But length alone fails to capture thetrue differences. The titles, subtitles, organization of material—even theSanskrit translation of the Gītā text—all differ from the magazine articles. Theactual wording has also been heavily revised. Consider an example of oneparagraph from the magazine followed by another from the commentary with sharedwords highlighted:The Bhagavad Gita in the first stanza speaks of the glaring truths of how lifeis a series of battles between Spirit and matter, knowledge and ignorance, souland body, life and death, health and disease, changelessness and change,self-control and temptation, discrimination and the senses. In the mother’s bodythe baby has to battle with disease, darkness, and ignorance. Each child has tofight also the battle of heredity. The soul has to overcome many hereditarydifficulties. It has also to contend with the self-created influencing effect ofpre-natal Karma or past actions.33 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn33]This is an important point. The timeless message of the Bhagavad Gita does notrefer only to one historical battle, but to the cosmic conflict between good andevil: life as a series of battles between Spirit and matter, soul and body, lifeand death, knowledge and ignorance, health and disease, changelessness andtransitoriness, self-control and temptations, discrimination and the blindsense-mind. The past tense of the verb in the first stanza is therefore employedby Vyasa to indicate that the power of one’s introspection is being invoked toreview the conflicts of the day in one’s mind in order to determine thefavorable or unfavorable outcome.34 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn34]In this fairly typical example, nearly two-thirds of the words in the bookversion differ from what Yogananda originally wrote.Unlike the backlash by Yogananda followers in Ananda and elsewhere over SRF’schanges to the Autobiography, the editorial liberty SRF exercised with these twopublications did not generate significant outrage. It is not hard to see why.The Autobiography has been the Bible for Yogananda’s followers, within both SRFand other organizations, a role neither commentary ever came close to playing.Also, while many knew the Autobiography well and could easily comparedifferences in published editions, particularly after free versions of the 1946edition were made available online, relatively few have access to the originalmagazine articles. Fewer still probably read either the Gītā or Second Comingarticles in sequential order as part of an ongoing series, which is the only waythe discrepancies would have stood out.But unaltered versions of portions of these commentaries were familiar to someof Yogananda’s disciples outside SRF. Between 1979 and 1986, the AmritaFoundation published the copyrighted The Second Coming of Christ: From theOriginal Unchanged Writings of Paramhansa Yogananda’s Interpretations of theSayings of Jesus Christ in three volumes, reprinting verbatim text from themagazine articles.35 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn35] The tendentious subtitlesuggests the organization’s views on SRF’s revisions. Something similar happenedwith the Gītā in the Ananda community, though on a much more modest scale, whenthe monks prepared a mimeographed copy of Yogananda’s commentary on the firstchapter as a Christmas present to the community in 1980.36[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn36]In 2006, Swami Kriyananda offered a much more ambitious commentary on the Gītācomparable to SRF’s two-volume edition. Still, at under seven hundred pages, TheEssence of the Bhagavad Gita is considerably shorter than SRF’s version.Kriyananda and, since his death, Ananda have consistently portrayed themselvesas defenders of the original, unexpurgated editions of Yogananda’s works. It isironic, then, that Kriyananda’s approach in the Essence so closely resemblesSRF’s. Kriyananda built his authority to publish the Essence on the fact that hewas with Yogananda in Twenty-Nine Palms as the Master worked on his text. As heexplained in the preface,I should state that I worked personally with Paramhansa Yogananda during themajor portion of his writing of this work. He had told the monks in 1950, beforehe went out to his desert retreat to begin this labor, “I asked Divine Motherwhom I should take out there with me to help with the editing, and your faceappeared, Walter [the name by which he called me]. To make extra sure, I askedHer twice more, and each time your face appeared. That’s why I am taking you.”I read the original manuscript, and worked on it with him (though notextensively). The copy I worked on still exists in SRF’s archives; it containsmy handwriting. I was in my early twenties then, however, and a “greenhorn”without proper experience as an editor. Now that I have reached nearly the ageof eighty, I might be described as somewhat seasoned in this field—especiallywith some eight-five books to (what I hope are) my credit.While criticizing SRF for keeping the original manuscript hidden, Kriyanandafound its published commentary wanting, which explained why he produced his ownversion when he did. Since the 1995 publication of SRF’s commentary, he had seenthe need for a “simpler and clearer version,” and one that “was closer to theoriginal”—an edition that did not eliminate teachings and stories that “do notappear in the first published version.”Even if he could make a case for his authority to publish, he still had topersuade readers of his ability to faithfully reproduce his master’s words ahalf-century later. “Fortunately,” he possessed “an exceptionally clear memory.”In addition, he had been “teaching these truths for nearly sixty years, as adevoted disciple of my Guru, and have the teachings, so to speak, ‘under mybelt.’” Now, with more confidence and experience, he had attempted to “reproducehis book in such a way that I think (and certainly hope) has been pleasing to myGuru, with at least some of its impact of immediacy. His insights are the mostamazing, thrilling, and helpful of any I have ever read on the Bhagavad Gita.”37[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn37] The year after the publication of The Essence ofthe Bhagavad Gita, Kriyananda adopted a similar role as Yogananda’s interpreter,this time exegeting his master’s teaching on Jesus. Revelations of Christ:Proclaimed by Paramhansa Yogananda was a much more modest project than his Gītācommentary or SRF’s Second Coming. Kriyananda did not attempt to providesystematic commentary on specific New Testament passages and settled instead forexplaining Yogananda’s views, rather than trying to present his actual words.38[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn38]In the end, then, though SRF and Ananda are bitter rivals in claimingYogananda’s mantle, they have adopted similarly capacious definitions ofauthorship in which each claims the right to intuitively express the sense ofthe Master’s meaning. The title page of the Essence captures this blurringbetween author and interpreter:The Essence of the Bhagavad GitaExplained by Paramhansa YoganandaAs Remembered by His DiscipleSwami Kriyananda(J. Donald Walters)Viewed apart from the eyes of faith, both organizations might be seen asasserting the authority to ghostwrite texts by listing the long-departedYogananda as the author of works he did not compose in their published form.Such boldness stems from parallel theological convictions. Leaders of bothorganizations treasure their position as direct disciples, believe they havereceived Yogananda’s anointing to carry on his work, and express confidence thathis spirit—if not his ghost—remains present after his mahasamādhi to guide themand prevent error. Together these principles have bestowed the authority eachorganization needs to present his teachings more fully. In endeavoring to intuitthe Master’s deeper meaning by transcending the literal text, they were merelyfollowing in his footsteps; he had already charted this hermeneutical path inhis interpretations of the New Testament and the Bhagavad Gītā.Self-Realization Fellowship’s modification of the Autobiography was only themost obvious of its concerted efforts to tidy up Yogananda’s reputation. It hasnever made earlier issues of East-West accessible to its members, perhaps out ofconcern that they might encounter embarrassing content—Yogananda’s praise forMussolini or Nazi Germany, which could undermine perceptions of his divinityamong less secure devotees, or his early enthusiasm for atomic energy, which nowseems retrograde. The most bizarre example of SRF’s obsession with posthumousrectification of their guru’s reputation is the decision to change the spellingof his official title. In mid-1958, when Daya Mata and other leaders discoveredthat “Paramahansa” was a more appropriate English rendition of the Master’sSanskrit title than “Paramhansa,” the way he had always signed it, they simplyadopted the new spelling without making any announcement. More dramatically,they surgically enhanced his original signature by separating the two halves ofthe title, inserting an “a,” and reattaching the parts.39[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn39] Though outsiders rarely notice this difference inspelling, it has become a shibboleth that differentiates SRF members fromdevotees in other organizations who use Yogananda’s actual signature—and derideSRF for what they see as its chicanery.These bitter disputes testify to the ongoing vitality of Yogananda and histeachings. As Yogananda wooed celebrities during his lifetime, his message ofself-realization continued to draw them after his mahasamādhi. As discussed inthe previous chapter, Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder collaboratedwith Swami Kriyananda—whose reputation largely rested on his discipleship byYogananda—in the creation of Ananda. Reclusive novelist J. D. Salinger and hiswife became enamored of Yogananda after reading the Autobiography in 1954; theywrote to the publisher asking for a recommendation for a local church and weredirected to Swami Premananda’s D.C.-area church.40[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn40] Emmy-winning Gunsmoke star Dennis Weaver visitedthe Hollywood temple in 1958, where he met Minott Lewis, who made a pitch toWeaver that would have made Yogananda proud: “Can you give fifteen minutes inthe morning and fifteen minutes at night to know God?” Weaver found that “anoffer I couldn’t refuse,” so “from that day, I never failed” to practice KriyaYoga. He remained a faithful follower until his death nearly fifty years later,often serving as a leader of monthly Sunday services at the Lake Shrine.41[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn41] Actor Woody Harrelson revealed to late-night hostJimmy Kimmel in May 2018 that he had found God after reading the Autobiographyand deciding that Yogananda was not a “phony and a fraud,” but instead “full ofintegrity and a deeply spiritual man.”42 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn42] DoriaLoyce Ragland and Thomas Markle—the parents of Meghan Markle, who married PrinceHarry in May 2018—met when they were both working on the set of General Hospitaland were married at Self-Realization’s Hollywood Temple in 1979.43[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn43]Musicians have been especially attracted to Yogananda. He inspired the Beatles’George Harrison for a number of years, which explains why Yogananda, SriYukteswar, Lahiri Mahasaya, and Babaji—the entire Kriya Yoga lineage—appear onthe cover of the Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover. WhenHarrison died in 2001, SRF hosted a memorial service for him at the Lake Shrine.His onetime Traveling Wilburys bandmate, rocker Tom Petty, was honored in thesame fashion after Petty’s 2017 death.44 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn44] ElvisPresley visited the Lake Shrine during filming for Harum Scarum in 1965. Afterreading a number of Yogananda writings, he made several visits to SRF andeventually began Kriya Yoga instruction.45 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn45] JohnColtrane’s music was inspired in part by Yogananda,46[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn46] and singer-songwriter Kenny Loggins says that theAutobiography (along with Herman Hesse’s Siddartha) prompted him to practicemeditation and “helped me see everything in my life—performing, writing songs,relationships—in a more spiritual light.”47 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn47]Perhaps the most famous American to show interest in Yogananda has been SteveJobs. In 1972, he and his friend Daniel Kottke had spent a lot of time togetherin the attic crawl space above the dorm room of Kottke’s girlfriend. “We tookpsychedelic drugs there sometimes, but mainly we just meditated,” Jobs laterrecalled. Jobs and Kottke shared an interest in Eastern spirituality, andAutobiography of a Yogi was one of the books they discussed. Two years later,Jobs was a sandal-wearing college dropout who wanted a break from his job atAtari, an electronic game maker in Palo Alto, California. He strode into hisboss Al Alcon’s office announcing his plan to quit and travel to India. AsAlcorn recalls, “He comes in and stares at me and declares, ‘I’m going to findmy guru,’ and I say, ‘No shit, that’s super. Write me!’” An earlier traveler hadleft an English copy of Autobiography of a Yogi in the room Jobs was rentingfrom a local family. He read it through several times as he recovered fromsevere dysentery.48 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn48] Jobs would embrace aneclectic set of Eastern beliefs throughout his life—derived more from ZenBuddhism than anything else—but he never forgot Autobiography of a Yogi. Afterhe returned from India, he began reading it once a year, a practice he continuedfor the rest of his life. Shortly before Jobs died, biographer Walter Isaacsonlooked at the contents of Jobs’s brand-new personal iPad 2 and discovered justone book: Autobiography of a Yogi. Jobs’s relationship with Yogananda did notend with his death. The fastidious planner organized all the details of his ownmemorial service at Stanford University, which included a small wrapped gift foreach guest. Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff was excited to open his friend’s gift.“I knew this was a decision he made that everyone was going to get this. Sowhatever this was, it was the last thing he wanted us all to think about.” Itturned out to be a copy of Autobiography of a Yogi.49[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn49]Yogananda-related material continues to proliferate, driving continued interestin him and, in turn, driven by that interest in a positive feedback loop. Otherpresses, including Ananda’s Crystal Clarity, reproduce Yogananda texts in thepublic domain such as Autobiography of a Yogi and a slate of other texts inwhich Yogananda figures prominently. Kriyananda published a collection of hisreminiscences of anecdotes and instruction from Yogananda in 2004. Five yearslater, he wrote an updated version of his own spiritual autobiography, in whichYogananda is a near-constant presence. Shortly before his death, Kriyananda alsowrote a long biography of Yogananda.50 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn50] But SRFfar outpaces Crystal Clarity, regularly publishing various editions of Yoganandatexts, sometimes in deluxe hardcover editions with gilt titles.Yogananda’s message has been become available in various formats outside oftraditional printed texts. In 1982, he found fame as the subject of athirty-two-page full-color comic book in the famous Amar Chitra Katha series.Since the late 1960s, Amar Chitra Katha (“immortal illustrated story”) hasdominated the Indian comic book market, serving as a vital tool for teachingabout Indian religion, history, and culture. Individual issues, which oftenappeal to educated readers at home and in the diaspora, are published in Englishand translated into regional Indian languages. The series, which has sold morethan a hundred million copies, includes more than four hundred titles thatintroduce classic religious narratives and biographies of Indian nationalfigures.51 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn51] The comic’s storyline includes avision from God telling Yogananda to go to America, for “you are the one I havechosen to spread the message of Kriya Yoga.” But interest in his teaching beginsto grow only after his move to Mount Washington. In the final panel, hismahasamādhi takes place as he promises his disciples, “My body shall pass, butmy work shall go on.”52 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn52]More recently, SRF released ten audio compact discs of Yogananda talks from latein his life that they had won exclusive rights to through the lawsuit withAnanda.53 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn53] Unauthorized fan sites hosted byprivate devotees have sprung up all over the Internet, and YouTube featureshundreds of audio, video, and music selections from his ministry posted byindividuals alongside formal presentations provided by SRF.Yogananda has also featured in film. In 2014, Awake: The Life of Yogananda wasreleased. This hagiographic documentary presents Yogananda as a prescient globalthinker for the twenty-first century. Though filmmakers Paola Di Florio and LisaLeeman claim that Awake represents an “outside point of view” on “the guru whobrought yoga to the West,” it was produced with the full cooperation of SRF. Infact, the project originated in SRF’s outreach to them. Di Florio and Leemanstruggled with the challenge of how to “make a film about an exalted master,”and the process became their own “voyage of Self-discovery.”54[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn54] Despite Awake’s support from SRF, the filmincluded interviews with Kriyananda before he died. Some hoped that the projecthelp heal wounds between the two organizations. This turned out to be undulyoptimistic; even while filming was under way, Kriyananda criticized SRF for nothaving any males “at the highest levels” of leadership—comments that seemedinsensitive to SRF, coming only a few months after the death of Daya Mata.55[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn55] The film received generally positive press as an“absorbing glimpse into the life and times of the world’s first superstarswami,” though some were put off by its “feel-good cinematic hagiography.”56[18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn56] The same year Awake was released, Ananda’s TheAnswer, a docudrama about Swami Kriyananda’s relationship with Yogananda,premiered at Cannes.57 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn57]In 2018, The Life of Yogananda: The Story of the Yogi Who Became the FirstModern Guru, a popular biography of Yogananda by spiritual author and teacherPhilip Goldberg, was published. Before the book’s release, Goldberg askedrhetorically, “Why a biography? Isn’t Autobiography of a Yogi enough?” Hisanswer, not surprisingly, was “No, it’s not. As the terrific documentary Awakeshowed, much of Yogananda’s fascinating and influential life is not covered inhis iconic memoir.” Goldberg aimed to “fill in the many blanks and placeYogananda in historical context.”58 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn58] Interest inYogananda is as lively as it has ever been, so the market for Yogananda-themedproducts, within SRF and outside it, remains vibrant.ENSHRINING YOGANANDAEncinitas remains a sleepy town, a beautiful Southern California location whosebeach-casual vibe belies its residents’ high income average. On any weekend,this scenic spot is overrun with tourists. Though most just want to enjoy thestunning beach, they cannot avoid hints of Yogananda’s imprint, seamlesslyintegrated into this quintessentially California locale. There is Swami’s Café,a stone’s throw from the former vegetarian restaurant he ran for years,decorated inside with a mural of a surfing Yogananda. The town’s famous surfingspot is named Swami’s Beach in his honor. A pedestrian crosswalk spanningPacific Coast Highway is labeled “Swami’s Ped X-ing.” More overt signs of SRF’spresence include the Encinitas ashram, the adjoining garden with breathtakingbluff-top views, a local SRF temple, and an SRF bookshop.The SRF store combines shameless Orientalist pandering—incense, textiles, Ganeshstatues, Om wall decorations, carved furniture, and expensive musicalinstruments—with a variety of SRF publications. The shop promises consumers anauthentic taste of India while they remain in Southern California comfort. Notsurprisingly, the store’s most prominent publication is Autobiography of a Yogi.Copies in English and a number of foreign languages are available, a testimonyto Yogananda’s worldwide popularity and a reminder of the ways that, accordingto Yale theologian Miroslav Volf, “world religions are part of the dynamics ofglobalization.”59 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn59] One of the translations of thisEnglish-language classic is in Bengali, Yogananda’s native language, a perfectexample of the pizza effect.Images [../figures/f0264-16.jpg]The Yogananda “shrine” inside the Encinitas Books & Gifts shop in Encinitas,California, a quintessential beach town and magnet for yoga practitioners. Thestore combines the sale of Orientalist products with the offer of spiritualdevelopment. While the lighted Yogananda display is reverential, his framedportrait is also for sale, an example of commodified spirituality that perfectlycaptures Yogananda’s career.In the center of this lavish Encinitas shop there is an elaborate, lightedshrinelike niche with a large iconic portrait of Yogananda from Autobiography ofa Yogi. This arrangement conveys his revered, even his divine, status. At firstthis shrine seems out of place amid the flood of books, pamphlets, andOrientalist decorative items from his homeland. On further reflection, however,the portrait is perfectly suited to this commercial setting. The Hindumissionary to America who taught yoga to countless thousands through acorrespondence course looks at home in this affluent, white, Southern Californiabeach town. The polyglot books that surround him simultaneously suggest hisstatus as “the 20th century’s first superstar guru,” as one Los Angeles Timeswriter labeled him.60 [18_notes.xhtml#epilogue.fn60] Posed forever with aserene, beatific smile, he continuously extends the promise of God-contactthrough yoga, an offer of transcendence as compelling to manytwenty-first-century seekers around the world as it was a century ago, when ayoung Bengali swami first set foot on American soil."},{"pageContent":"NOTESUnless otherwise indicated, all Web addresses are accurate as of May 2018.INTRODUCTION1.

[12_chapter01.xhtml#kc1.fn10] Halbfass, India and Europe, routinely uses thelabel Neo-Hinduism to describe this modern outlook among Indians. Neither theterm, which for Halbfass connotes inauthenticity, nor his negative assessment ofthe phenomenon is embraced in the present work.11. [12_chapter01.xhtml#kc1.fn11] Yogananda, Autobiography (1946), 29. Trout,“Hindu Gurus,” 132–33, acknowledged the challenges of working with theAutobiography as a source and the dearth of unauthorized sources on his lifenearly twenty years ago.12. [12_chapter01.xhtml#kc1.fn12] A few other sources might ostensibly fit intothis category of those who did not know Mukunda during his childhood, but whospent extensive time with him and might have heard him relate childhood events.The most plausible candidate is Swami Kriyananda, who joined SRF in 1948 andspent extensive time, much of it one on one, with Yogananda during the lastthree years of his life. Kriyananda’s lengthy Yogananda biography offers littleassistance as a source, since it is more interested in hagiography thanhistoriography. See Kriyananda, Paramhansa Yogananda, 1.13. [12_chapter01.xhtml#kc1.fn13] Ghosh, “Mejda,” 3.14. [12_chapter01.xhtml#kc1.fn14] Ibid., 23.15.

Dasgupta’s account was originally composed in Bengali in 1984and translated into English only in 2006.18. [12_chapter01.xhtml#kc1.fn18] In this chapter, I note several examples ofYogananda’s penchant for imaginative reconstruction. I limit these examples tocases where the understanding of a major event in his biography hinges on hischaracterization of the event. In chapter 4 [15_chapter04.xhtml], I undertake asystematic discussion of the Autobiography’s narrative art.19. [12_chapter01.xhtml#kc1.fn19] For information about Mukunda’s father,“Mejda” is far and away the most useful source; it provides specific, concretedetails about dates of service, local, office, rank, and so on. Sananda claimsthat this information derives from History of Services of the Officers of theEngineer and Accounts Establishment, Government of India, Public WorksDepartment (Ghosh, “Mejda,” 10n.). Unfortunately, his bibliographical referenceis incomplete, lacking a date of publication and page numbers. History ofServices was published annually, but extant copies do not provide theinformation Ghosh reports. Other government sources do provide some record ofBhagabati’s career, and these sparse sources uniformly corroborate Sananda’sinformation. For example, Government of India, Public Works Department,Classified List and Distribution Return of Establishment, 595, confirms that“Bhaggobaty Charan Ghosh” was a deputy examiner, class I, in the SuperiorAccounts Establishment of Calcutta Railways. A second-grade accountant, hejoined government service in April 1875 and had served for thirty-one years andthree months as of June 1906. He had been in his current position since November1905. Variations in the Anglicization of Indian names create a challenge intracking down individuals in Indian government sources; the spelling ofBhagabati’s name is different from Sananda’s spelling, but the date of birthmatches Sananda’s information, confirming that this is his father, despite thevariation in the spelling.20. [12_chapter01.xhtml#kc1.fn20] In a country with a staggering 94 percentilliteracy rate, just over 1 percent had any education (as opposed to basicliteracy skills), and an even smaller fraction completed high school.Bhagabati’s ability to speak English put him an elite category of 0.14 percentof the population. See General Report on the Census of India, 1891, 224.21. [12_chapter01.xhtml#kc1.fn21] Kopf, Brahmo Samaj, 195. Less than 1 percentof Indians were employed in state service, and the bulk of these were in jobsthe census described as “menial”; about 0.2 percent of all employees were inclerical positions such as his.

In 1885, he wastransferred to the Office of the Government Examiner of Railway Accounts andsent to Saharanpur in the United Province. A year and half later, he wastransferred again, this time to Muzaffarpur in Bihar. In October of 1890 he wassent to Gorakhpur to work for the Bengal and North-Western Railway (Ghosh,“Mejda,” 13).23.

[12_chapter01.xhtml#kc1.fn24] Only twenty-eight towns in all of India had apopulation of over one hundred thousand at the time, and all of the placesBhagabati worked (with the exception of Gorakhpur, whose unique features arediscussed above) fell into that category. The 1891 census indicates that Indiawas over 90 percent rural, but even this statistic underreports the nature ofthe case. The rural population was composed overwhelmingly of tiny villagesnumbering fewer than a thousand people—hundreds of thousands of these villageswere spread across a vast area largely untouched by direct British influence.See General Report on the Census of India, 1891, 42–49.25.

Given the nature ofthe Indian social pyramid, it makes sense to consider the bhadralok elites, andthis label is used for them throughout this chapter. More recently,Chattopadhyay, Representing Calcutta, 138–39, offers a more nuanced taxonomythat reveals the aspirational character of the bhadralok; though they excludedthe nobility and the destitute, the bhadralok spanned a range of income levelsand classes.28.

For a perceptive introduction to both the ṣaḍdarśanas, or“six orthodox schools,” and the relations among them, see Flood, Introduction toHinduism, 231–49. “Hinduism” has become a heavily contested label among avariety of scholars. Some think Hinduism is a fictional European entity “the waythe ‘satyr’ and the ‘unicorn’ are” (Balagangadhara, “Orientalism,Postcolonialism, and Religion,” 162). The most radical critics object that thelabel “Hinduism” is only symptomatic of the real problem. European invention ofHinduism simultaneously imported the category of religion into India. TheBritish, in this view, used Christianity as a model to impose normativeassumptions about “religion” on India. David N. Lorenzen pleads for reasonedmoderation in defining religion, pointing out that despite the many differencesin metaphysics, codes, and rituals, “religions are grounded in a certain type ofmental experience or emotion that somehow gives authority to cultural and morelnorms without the necessity of strict rational analysis” (Lorenzen, “Hindus andOthers,” 25–40, quotation on 38). Richard King, “Colonialism, Hinduism and theDiscourse of Religion” 111, while cautioning about the potential for anachronismin using Hinduism for the premodern period, acknowledges that “in the latecolonial/modern context, the term ‘Hinduism’ certainly does take on increasingsignificance and social power as an indicator of Hindu national identity and hasbecome a powerful cultural vector through which Indian civilizational historyhas been and is being interpreted.” Without getting mired in this debate, thepresent work generally uses “Hinduism,” since most scholars agree that by thenineteenth century, something called Hinduism undeniably existed, whether arecent reification or part of a longer tradition.157.

In 1946, he weighed164 pounds, which, at his then-reported height of five feet, eight inches puthim on the cusp of being overweight, according to BMI, an admittedly imperfectmeasure. If his height was actually five feet, three inches, as reported on hispassport renewal form in 1925, then he was significantly overweight—nearlyobese—at 164 pounds. Since the passport application spells out “three,” it seemsmore likely that the taller height is a typographical error.
