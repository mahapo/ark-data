Yogananda was born on January 5, 1893 in Gorakhpur in northeasternIndia near the Himalaya Mountains. From the earliest years of his life, helonged to know God, to taste the thirst-quenching waters of Spirit.His search for the Infinite led him to Sri Yukteswar, his Preceptor. Under theguidance of this God-realized teacher, he attained Supreme Realization and wasgiven the revered title of Paramhansa [Notes: Paramhansa—literally, param,highest; hansa, swan. The hansa is represented in scriptural lore as the vehicleof Brahma, Supreme Spirit; as the symbol of discrimination, the white hansa swanis thought of as able to separate the true soma nectar from a mixture of milkand water.] by his Preceptor in 1935. Paramhansa Yogananda [Notes: Yoganandameans “Bliss (ananda) through divine union (yoga)”.] later brought the specialTechniques of Concentration and Meditation to the Western World, including KriyaYoga which is the scientific method to accelerate the devotee’s spiritualunfoldment.In addition to bringing the Techniques of Concentration and Meditation to theWest, Paramhansaji’s great spiritual mission included imparting hisintuitively-perceived interpretations of the Christian Bible. Throughout thetext of The Second Coming of Christ, Paramhansa Yogananda uses capitalization toplace emphasis on a specific truth to aid the reader. In the instances wherethere is redundancy of material, he includes it because it relates and clarifiesthe new material introduced."},{"pageContent":"PrefaceThese spiritual interpretations, received and interpreted through ChristConsciousness, are the methods which the Masters have taken to show the worldthe common, scientific platform of intuitive perception, where the ChristianBible, the Hindu Bhagavad Gita, (Hindu Old and New Testaments), and trueScriptures of all true religions, can find unity. The Spiritual interpretationof the Christian Bible reveals and liberates the Truth hidden in the dark cavesof theoretical and theological studies.Jesus Christ was crucified once, but His Christian teaching has been, and is nowbeing crucified by ignorant people. The understanding and application of theseintuitively-perceived teachings are attempting to show how the ChristConsciousness of Jesus, free from theological crucifixion, can be brought back asecond time into the souls of men.These spiritual interpretations are born of intuition, and will be found to beuniversally true if they are meditated upon with intuitive perception."},{"pageContent":"PARAMHANSA YOGANANDA wrote:“O Christ—Thou Rarest Flower of Hearts.”“O Thou Great Lover of error-torn brothers—as unseen monument of the mightiestmiracle of love was established in each heart when the magic wand of Thy Voiceuttered: “Forgive them, for they know not what they do.”“O Shepherd of Souls, wandering hearts are of themselves seeking the one fold ofdivine devotion. We have heard the ever-calling music of Thy infinite kindness.Our one desire is to be at home with Thee, to receive the Cosmic Father withjoyous, open eyes of wisdom, and to know that we are all sons of our own OneGod.”(Excerpts from the original 1929 editionof Whispers From Eternity)."},{"pageContent":"The Universal Christ“But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.”(John 1:12)As a small cup cannot hold an ocean within it, no matter how willing it may beto do so, likewise the cup of material human consciousness cannot grasp theuniversal Christ Consciousness, no matter how desirous it is, but when thestudent, by the Praecepta [Notes: Initially the organizational name and thewritten teachings in America of Paramhansa Yogananda were known as YogodaSat-Sanga Society and Yogoda Course, respectively. He later enlarged his writtenteachings and changed the name of them to the Praecepta. The Techniques ofConcentration and Meditation and Kriya Yoga as taught in the original PraeceptaLessons are available from Amrita Foundation, Inc.] method of Concentration andMeditation, enlarges the caliber of his consciousness in all atoms (ChristConsciousness) within his own. This is what is meant by “received Him”. Thus,according to Jesus, all souls who can actually find their souls one with ChristConsciousness, by intuitive Self-Realization, can be called the “Sons of God”.All Scriptures, such as the Bhagavad Gita, or the Hindu Bible, and the ChristianBible, have a three-fold meaning. In other words, the Scriptures deal with threefactors of human beings, namely, the material, the mental, and the spiritual.Hence, all true Scriptures have been so written that they serve to be beneficialto the body, mind, and soul of man. True Scriptures are like the wells of Divinewaters, which can quench the three-fold material, mental, and spiritual thirstsof man. In addition, the Scriptures, in order to be worth-while, should reallyhelp the businessman, the mental man, and the spiritual man. Although both thematerial and the psychological interpretations of the Scriptures are necessary,it should be remembered that the scriptural authors undertook with great painsto point out to man that the spiritual interpretations are of supreme importanceto him.A materially or intellectually successful man may not be truly, scientificallysuccessful man who makes a perfect success of life; whereas, a spiritual man isthe happy “all-round” man, who is healthy, intellectual, contented, and trulyprosperous, with all-satisfying wisdom. Since by intuition the spiritual authorsfirst sought to make man primarily spiritual, I give the spiritualinterpretation with the psychological and material interpretations interwoven.These interpretations will help alike the spiritual aspirant, the intellectualman, and the businessman.These intuitively-perceived spiritual interpretations of the words spoken byJesus Christ are to be studied every day conscientiously and meditated upon bytrue Christian and all true devotees of God.Universal Christ Consciousness appeared in the vehicle of Jesus, and now throughthe specific techniques of concentration and meditation as taught in theoriginal Praecepta Lessons, and these intuitionally-received interpretations ofthe Scriptures, the Christ Consciousness is coming a second time to manifestthrough the consciousness of every true devotee of God."},{"pageContent":"A Sacred RemembranceWhen Paramhansa Yogananda began writing his intuitively-perceivedinterpretations of the sayings of Jesus, he prayed for Christ to guide him indivining the true meaning in his words.Paramhansaji was blessed with the presence and vision of Jesus Christ many timesduring his life. On one such occasion, in later years, he asked a question ofJesus pertaining to these writings.It was a time of silent prayer and his room became filled with an opal-bluelight, and Christ appeared—radiant and about him a glow of golden light. Lookinginto his wondrously beautiful eyes, he asked Christ if he had pleased him in theway he had interpreted his teachings.At once a Chalice appeared at Christ’s lips, and then came over to touch hisown, and Christ answered:“Your lips have quaffed the same LIVING WATERS from which I drink.”Words of matchless assurance! This holy response was sacredly cherished withinhis heart."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 1: The Divine Nature of Jesus, The Boy“And he said unto them, ‘How is it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must beabout my Father’s business?’”(Luke 2:49)This Scripture depicts the proper Divine attitude of Jesus to His parents. Inthe above statement, the perfect life of Jesus brings forth a perfect utteranceas to how a Divine child, consecrated to serve humanity, should behave. Jesushints that it is the highest duty of parents not to worry about a Divine childlike Jesus, who was protected by the King of Kings. He implies also that thehighest duty of the son was to look after the celestial business of spreadingthe Kingdom of the Heavenly Father. He implied that duty to our Heavenly Fathercomes first and foremost, and that duty to parents, although important, issecondary.Jesus knew that parental love and affection, being blind, might demand from Himgreater attention to His earthly father’s business than to His Heavenly Father’sbusiness, for which He came on earth. He also here signifies to His parents thatthey should know, and at the same time wish for Him to be busy with His HeavenlyFather’s business. Since parental and filial relationships are brought about byGod, parents should first teach their children that it is good to be proficientin God’s business.The above saying was the first hint by Jesus to His parents as to what theywould have to expect, and about what His life was going to be. As all nobleparents are lovers of God and of His business, so they should wish the firstinterest of their children to be in God’s business. All parents should starttheir children on the right road in life by making them first proficient incontacting God, and in doing all things with God consciousness. A life guided byGod’s inner, intuitive direction can be successful, healthy, and complete onlywhen activity is balanced with wisdom and happiness.The ordinary man thinks that this world, his family, and his work are hisbusiness, but the spiritual man knows that parents, children, family ties, thebusiness world, and all else are God’s business. He knows that everyone shouldhelp to maintain a world by love and service compelled and actuated byinstinctive blood-ties. Hence, all business should be spiritualized; that is,everything should be done with the consciousness of God within, and man shouldtry to please God by harmonizing all things with His ideals.Religious duties should not conflict with the duties of business; neither shouldduty to business conflict with spiritual duties. When such conflict occurs, thespiritual duty is incomplete and should be modified. Business duties also shouldbe revised when they militate against spiritual duties. Spiritual and materialduties should work together like two stallions, pulling the car of lifeharmoniously and uniformly to one happy goal.A successful life, therefore, must be begun with spiritual culture first, forall material and moral actions are governed by spiritual laws. All business mustfirst conform with God’s business of Divine laws in order to be of lastingbenefit to mankind. Any money-making business which caters only to human luxury,and false or evil propensities, is bound to be destroyed by the workings of theDivine law of the survival of the worthiest. The business which does harm to thereal spiritual comfort of people is not doing real service, and is bound to meetwith destruction because of the very nature of its activities."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2: Baptism“Then cometh Jesus Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. But Johnhim, saying, ‘I have need to be baptized, of thee, and comest thou to me?’ AndJesus answering said unto him, ‘Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh usto fulfill all righteousness’. Then he suffered him. And Jesus, when baptized,went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him,and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: Andlo a voice from heaven, saying, ‘This is my beloved Son, in whom I am wellpleased.”(Matthew 3: 13-17)The Original ceremony of baptism by water came from India. Baptism meansimmersion in water in order to cleanse or purify. Purification of the bodyshould precede the purification of the mind. Hence, all souls who desired tobegin living the spiritual life had to purify their bodies. “Cleanliness is nextto Godliness,” but baptism of the body, unless followed by baptism of the mind,becomes practically meaningless. If we bathe and thus purify our bodies, we willfind that our mind will temporarily become purified, but unless we change oursoul’s wickedness by calmness, and meditation, and constant spiritual vigilance,we will remain the same old devils with bad habits in spite of the temporarypurifying effect of the water on our bodies.To illustrate this metaphorically, a Hindu saint said to his would-be disciple:“Son, it is necessary to bathe in the Ganges to purify the mind from sin. Thesins will leave you temporarily while you bathe in the holy waters; but theywill wait for you in the trees skirting the Ganges, and as soon as you come outof the sacred influence of the holy water, they will again jump on you.”It is well to immerse initiates in water, but the ceremony of immersion withoutfollowing it up with continued spiritual lessons in meditation and God-contactis of little value.The aristocratic, modern way of baptism consists in sprinkling water on thehead. This is all that is left of the original custom of purifying the body bywater. Immersion of initiates in water may be unnecessary if they are mentallyevolved, but sprinkling of water on the head of evolved people is unnecessary,unless this is done only out of respect to the ancient, baptismal ceremonies.It is evident that Jesus, although he was so evolved, did not fail to go intothe water. He did not fully immerse, for the River Jordan was practically dry atthat time.Another important matter in connection with the baptism of Jesus Christ is thatHe insisted on being baptized by John, who in self-realization was inferior toHim. John said he was not worthy to unloose the lachet of the shoes of Alas,modern baptism has become baptism by water only. Specific Praecepta methods ofConcentration and Meditation are showing the real way of baptizing self withSpirit and ultimate wisdom. Feeling his spiritual inferiority, John wondered whyJesus wanted to be baptized with water. This action of Jesus distinctlydemonstrated the ancient, pre-Christian, Hindu custom and the real spiritualway, which every God-aspirant should follow.The method of finding God is different from the methods demanded by mostcolleges for any kind of specific training. Even in medical training, thestudent never learns if he roams from college to college, joining differentmedical institutions, and listening to a few lectures, but without going throughintensive training in materia medica, physiology, dissection, and other studiesin one college. Also, it is true that a student cannot join all the universitiesat the same time.A student should follow one course in one college until he receives acertificate that he has completed certain studies, but alas, in spiritualdenominations even the loyalty the usual intellectual college expects, is notgiven to the denomination by the aspirant, nor is the time necessary forSelf-Realization given to the practice of the spiritual lessons. Such peoplecontinue taking lessons from any new, good, bad, or indifferent teachers, whohappen to come to town and advertise. I say that people should discriminatebetween the so-called teacher, who uses religion only to make money or just aliving, and the real teacher who may use business methods in his religion inorder to serve his brethren with real spirituality.It is extremely necessary to remember that in the beginning it is wise tocompare many spiritual paths and teachers, but when real Guru (Preceptor)[Notes: The author uses the words Guru and Preceptor interchangeably.Guru-spiritual teacher; from] and the teaching is found, then the restlesssearching must cease. The thirsty one should not keep seeking wells, but shouldgo to the best well and daily drink its nectar. That is why in the beginning weseek many until we find the right path, and the right master, and then remainloyal to him through death and eternity, until final emancipation."},{"pageContent":"WHY JESUS SOUGHT BAPTISM FROM JOHN THE BAPTIST, THE GURU-DISCIPLE RELATIONSHIPWe can have many teachers first, but only one Guru, and no more teachersafterwards. Teachers call those who come to learn from them students, but a Gurucalls the spiritual aspirant who comes to him, a disciple. Jesus himself said:“None cometh unto the father but by me. “This signifies that human souls aremostly truant children of God roaming away from Him in the wilderness ofsuffering. Such souls are impelled by the scourge of sorrow to have faintglimpses of their lost home of spiritual blessedness. They begin to long forGod, and inwardly pray for a way out of the conundrum of life, then when theprayers of such errant children become deep and strong enough, God is touchedand sends help. It is then that the One Father of All sends a superman on earthto give help to the lost seeking souls. Such a man, ordained by God, to help theindividual in response to deep prayer, is not an ordinary teacher, but a GURU ora vehicle, whose body, speech, mind, and spirituality, God Himself uses to bringthe lost souls back to the Home of Immortality.In the Hindu Scriptures and (original 1929 edition of) Whispers From Eternity[Notes: My Guru, “from the original 1929 edition of Whispers From Eternity,p.47] it is written: “As a naughty baby, I cried for my Mother Divine, and Shecame to me as my Guru. My Guru, Thou the Voice of God, I found Thee in responseto my soul-cries. If all the gods are displeased and yet, Thou art pleased, I amsafe in the fortress of Thy pleasure. And if all the gods protect me by theparapets of their blessings, and yet I receive not Thy benedictions, I am anorphan, left to pine spiritually in the ruins of Thy displeasure. Together wewill fly to His Shores, and then we will smash our planes of finitude foreverand vanish in our Infinite Life.”This conception of Guru and Disciple depicts the only real way to retrace thetruant soul’s footsteps back to God. This Guru and Disciple relationship is notthe enslaving relationship between the blind church or temple members and apriest of a temple or church, elected, not by God, but by the temple or churchorganization, or by a higher church dignitary, honored by orthodox followers,but unknown to God."},{"pageContent":"FREEDOM OF WILL, AND OBEDIENCEMy Guru said to me: “Allow me to discipline you, for freedom of will consists innot doing things according to the dictates of pre-natal or post-natal habits ormental whims, but according to the suggestions of wisdom and free choice.” Hecontinued: “If you tune in your will with mine, you will find freedom.”Formerly, my will was guided by habits, but when I tuned it in with theGod-guided and Wisdom-guided will of my Guru, I found freedom.To tune in with a soul whose will is guided by wisdom is to find freedom ofwill. Most teachers who slavishly control their students after the pattern ofdogmatic teachings destroy the power of free will in them, but obedience to aGuru does not produce spiritual blindness in the disciple. On the contrary, itdevelops his third eye of wisdom and intuition. Most teachers want theirstudents to see through the teacher’s eyes, but a Guru disciplines the discipleonly until he can guide himself through wisdom. A Guru, (a Preceptor), is sentby God.If a disciple, after following a Guru for a long time, should spurn him, then heactually spurns the help sent by God. A Guru is not a help for this life only.He also makes a spiritual soul-contact with the disciple, and says: “Let ourfriendship be eternal, and let us help each other through incarnations until weare both completely emancipated in spirit. Sometimes, likewise, an advanceddisciple can help a Guru, and vice versa. Such friendship is not based on anyselfish consideration or on any condition. Such Divine friendship and perpetualgood will expressed between two or more souls gives birth to the ever-pure,unselfish, all-emancipating, Divine Love. My Master [Notes: Master—one’sspiritual preceptor; one knowing his dominion over the Cosmos.] said to me, “Iwill be your friend from now until Eternity, no matter whether you are on thelowest mental plane or on the highest plane of wisdom. I will be your friend ifever you should err, for then you will need my friendship more than at any othertime.”When I accepted my Master’s unconditional friendship, he said: “Will you be myfriend under all circumstances? Will, you protect me in my highest or in mylowest strata of mind?” I was stupefied, for how could I dream of my Masterbeing in the lowest strata, but until I vowed to be his friend always, under allcircumstances, he did not rest. He was gladdened when I said, “I will be thinealways.”It was then, after this amazing spiritual compact, that I understood thesignificance of a Guru, and really, I never found complete satisfaction,comfort, and God-consciousness until I turned myself in with the Divineconsciousness of my Master.Jesus knew of the above law of emancipation. He must have found in John hisreincarnated Guru, (a Guru, although inferior in spiritual quality, is a Gurujust the same, a vehicle of God always). This is why Jesus insisted on beingbaptized by John the Baptist. Jesus also had spoken of John the Baptist as thereincarnated prophet, Elias (Elijah).Jesus said: “Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill allrighteousness.” The Sanskrit Scriptures have a statement exactly parallel tothis. “There are many sages with many wisdoms with their scriptural andspiritual interpretations, apparently contradictory, but the real secret ofreligion is hidden in cave.”The path followed by a man of self-realization is the path to be followed by anyspiritual aspirant. A scripture, no matter what records of spiritual truths itcontains in its bosom, is not as useful as a saint, who is veritably a walking,talking, living scripture. There is a vast difference between the powerfulsulphuric acid in a bottle and the mere statement of its formula as H₂SO₄.Neither the formula itself, nor the description of the power of sulphuric acidin a book can ever describe its burning, vital quality. Truths ofself-realization are like little insignificant seeds, but their power andwisdom-yielding qualities are truly felt when they are seen to grow into hugetrees in the gardens of the self-realization of saints—trees laden with thefruits of Divine Love.We meet little teachers in the beginning through our vague desires to knowtruth. But the Guru (or Preceptor) is the living embodiment of scriptural truthsand is the agent of salvation appointed by God in response to a devotee’sdemands for release from all the bondage of matter. It is very difficult tochoose the right path from the many religious paths and varied religiousopinions. Most people who wander from church to church seeking intellectualinspiration, never find God, for intellectual inspiration is necessary onlyuntil one begins to “drink” God. Otherwise, intellectual inspiration, (when itforgets to taste God), is detrimental to self-realization. It is more easy tofollow a living breathing, talking man (who lives truth) than a mute scripture.If a saint has reached his goal, whether by the shorter Yoga [Notes:Yoga—communion with God through the practice of scientific meditations; to unitethe individual soul with Cosmic Spirit.] route, or by the longwindedspiritual-prayer way, he experiences actual self-realization. Anyone followinghim certainly would reach the goal by using either method. Unlike ordinaryprayers, real prayers, which alone can bring conscious response from God, mustbe offered in meditation intensely and for many hours continuously until Divineresponse comes.The signs of a Guru are as follows: his eyes are still and unwinking whenever hewants them to be so; by the practice of Yoga his breath is quiet without hisforcibly holding it in his lungs; his mind is calm without effort. If a man haseyelids that blink continually, and lungs acting like bellows all the time, anda mind always restless like a butterfly, and he keeps on telling you he is incosmic consciousness, laugh at him. Just as a man cannot pretend that he issleeping while he continues to run, so one with restless eyes, breath, and mindcannot convince you, who know better, that he is in cosmic consciousness. Justas sleep manifests in the body by certain physiological changes, so the muscle,eyes, breath, all usually become still during cosmic consciousness. No Guru canbe developed alone by years of study in the intellectual factory of atheological seminary, which deems it has attained its ends when it confers B.D.or D.D. degrees. Such titles can be won by men of good memory, but character,self-control and intuition can be developed only by knowledge of advancedpsycho-physical methods of self-realization and deep, daily meditation.Jesus and His disciples were products of unceasing meditation and intuitivedevotion, and not merely results of intellectual theological seminaries.Most Christian churches today have wandered away from the path ofself-realization and are satisfied with sermons, ceremonies, organizations, andfestivities. The complete revival and restoration of Christian churches can beeffected only by discarding the oft-repeated theoretical sermons andtoo-frequently changing psycho-physical ceremonies, and replacing them withadded concentration during church services on the part members;—they shouldconcentrate more and more on perfect stillness in both the physical and mentalrealms. For stillness and peace are the real temples wherein God most oftenvisits His devotees.The secret of true religion lies in the cave of stillness, in the cave ofwisdom, in the cave of the spiritual eye. By concentrating on the point betweenthe eyebrows and delving into the depths of quiet, one can find answers to allthe religious queries of the heart. A disciple should tune in with the will ofhis Guru. Such tuning in of your habit-led and whim-guided will with thewisdom-guided will of your Guru is far different from mechanical obedience to anunspiritual guide, no matter whether he is traditionally, religiously, orsocially elected. To follow the blind unthinkingly is to fall with them into theditch of ignorance completely. To follow the awakened, if you are blind, is toreach the goal without danger. How can you take away the blot from yourbrother’s eyes if there is still a blot in your own?Very few people truly know what freedom of will means. To be compelled to dothings by the dictates of your own instincts and habits is not freedom. To begood because you have been so for a long time and to refrain from evil becauseyou are accustomed to do so is not freedom. When your will is perfectly free tochoose good instead of evil anytime, anywhere, because you really feel good, youwill know real happiness, then indeed are you free. Evil gives only sorrow. Whenthe influences of heredity, prenatal and postnatal habits, family, social, andworld environment, all cease to influence your judgment,—when you can act,guided only by your highest, inner, intuitive discrimination,—then only are youfree. Until then the way to all righteousness lies in tuning in your whim-guidedwill with the wisdom-guided will of your Guru. Harnessing your will to wisdom,you will cease to be swayed by prejudice and error, for you will then always beguided by righteousness.Hence, the first requisite in your spiritual path lies not entirely in going tochurch services and being a passive member, satisfied merely with listening tosermons, but also in finding your spiritual Guru who will lead you as far alongthe spiritual path as you wish to go. Having found him, follow him closely, obeyhim with intelligent devotion, and practice what he teaches you; thus ultimatelyyou will attain your highest goal."},{"pageContent":"THE BAPTISM OF JESUS BY WATER AND BY THE HOLY GHOSTThe gospel tells us that John the Baptist had said to the people, “I indeedbaptize you with water unto repentance, but He that cometh after me is mightierthan I whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. He shall baptize you with the HolyGhost and with fire.” Jesus, being high in spiritual advancement, obeyed the lawof temporary purity signified by baptism by water. But immediately following Hisbaptism by water, He was also baptized by the Spirit. The real, advanced Guruasks his disciple first to bathe his body with water, and then after the bodyfeels the influence of temporary cleanliness and purity, he baptizes him withSpirit. But sometimes it has happened that when the disciple is furtheradvanced, as Jesus was, and the Guru, like John the Baptist, not so faradvanced, then the Spirit of God uses the Holy Ghost to baptize the advanceddisciple through the medium of the divine agent, the Guru, even though he isless advanced in spirituality than his disciple. The Guru must be wise, butsometimes a Guru of past incarnations is in this life less advanced in wisdomthan the disciple. Sometimes it is given him to redeem a disciple morespiritually advanced than himself. A Guru, being the agent of salvationappointed by God, must take the disciple through successive incarnations, ifnecessary, until complete salvation of the disciple is reached. A great secretof understanding lies in the reason for the less advanced Guru, John, initiatingas his disciple the so greatly-advanced savior of mankind,—Jesus. In his pastincarnations John the Baptist had been appointed as the agent to be the originalGuru of Jesus. In the dim past, when John was first sent by God as the Guru ofJesus in response to His prayers, the Guru-consciousness of John was moreadvanced than the disciple-consciousness of Jesus. At that time the souls ofJohn the Baptist and of Jesus were eternally bound together by the law ofunconditional divine friendship, and both at this long-ago first meeting as Guruand disciple had made the resolution, “We will be friends forever, striving forone another’s perfection until both of us redeem our omnipresence, now lockedbehind the bars of flesh.” So as time went on and many incarnations passed, by asuperior effort, the soul of Jesus advanced further than did the soul of John.Jesus knew that the soul of the prophet Elias (or Elijah) was His Guru-Preceptorof former incarnations, and that it had reincarnated in the body of John theBaptist. The prophet Elias, who was much more highly advanced than Jesus when Hefirst became his disciple, later on, through the irony of his own Karmic law(actions of past lives), had lessened in spirituality, and thus had the power tobaptize with water only. By intuition John the Baptist knew of the coming ofJesus Christ, yet having less spirituality for a time he forgot he was onceElias. After the baptism of Jesus, John was informed of this fact, “For Elias iscome already”. But John the Baptist knew that Jesus, though now so far advancedas to become the Redeemer of the World, was this disciple of formerincarnations, and thus he predicted, “I indeed baptize you with water, but Onemightier that I cometh, the latchet of Whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose.He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire. “Jesus was now moreadvanced than John the Baptist, yet He accepted him as His Guru-Preceptor offormer incarnations,—the agent first sent b God to enter with Him into thisspiritual, divine covenant and this divinely ordained friendship. “We will bedivine friends forever until our souls by mutual help and the lasting goodwillof many incarnations break the bubble-walls off caging desires and set free ourimprisoned omnipresence to become one with the sea of Infinitude”. This is whyJesus said, “Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill allrighteousness”, and why He chose to be baptized by John with water according tothe ancient custom. It is very interesting then to note how the Spirit of Godused the Holy Ghost for the spiritual baptism of Jesus.Real Gurus know not only how to baptize with water but also with Spirit, or theHoly Ghost. But alas! Many Hindus in their temples, and many Christians in theirchurches are baptized only with water, temporarily experiencing good physicalbaptism, but knowing and perceiving nothing of those marvelous soul-renewingexperiences of spiritual baptism. Ministers in churches and priests in templesare oftentimes chosen only by virtue of their intellectual study of theScriptures, and sacerdotal authority conferred on them by ceremonies, performedby formally higher spiritual authority. But real ministers and priests who arefit to be Gurus train first their inner selves in the theological school ofintuition and meditation. They must spiritually baptize themselves first beforethey can aspire to baptize others at all. They teach their disciples not formundane gains, but, being impelled by God, they baptize them spiritually. It isadmirable to lecture and teach good principles, but without becoming a real Guruone cannot redeem souls, nor should he accept others as disciples until he hasprogressed far himself. Once the true relationship of Guru and disciple isestablished there will be no more blind spiritual gropings, roaming, or partingsbecause of admonition on the part of the Guru, or for any other reason. Usuallythere is instantaneous recognition between Guru-Preceptor and disciple, butsometimes it takes long to remember consciously that past close friendship, orto recognize the forgotten memory of past incarnations, so long buried beneathash-heaps of ignorance.Know also that one cannot be a Guru by self-choice; he must be ordained to serveand save others by a real Guru, or else he must hear in reality the voice of Godasking him to redeem others. Many become self-appointed Gurus after reading afew occult books, and listening to the voice of their own misguided imaginationor their falsely imaginative subconscious mind."},{"pageContent":"THE MANY KINGS OF BAPTISM DESCRIBEDIf you bathe every day and meditate immediately thereafter, (if you are near ariver or a lake surrounded by God’s scenic grandeur and you bathe in them withthe consciousness of purity), then you will feel the power of baptism by water.Water opens the pores of the skin, letting out the disturbing body-poisons,calming and soothing the circulatory system.Baptism by WaterWater cools the nerve-endings and sends reports of cool sensations throughoutthe vital centers, balancing evenly all the vital energies. All life cameprimarily from energy—then from nebulae—then from water. All seeds of life areirrevocably connected with water. Physical life cannot exist without it.Baptism by FeelingIf you love poetry and are much in the company of a great poet, he will baptizeyou with those clean, wholesome feelings and the appreciation of good ineverything which are aroused always by good poesy.

The soul, areflection of spirit, while dwelling within it, cannot remember its omnipresentstate. But by meditation one can hear the vibration of the body by closing theears—as taught in the original Praecepta-given Meditation Technique, and thentune it in with the cosmic mind which emanates from the vibration of all atomsand life force. The Christian Bible says, “God is the Word”—(Cosmic,intelligent, sounding vibration). Sage Pantajali, greatest of Hindu Yogis, says,“The Spirit, God the Father, or Iswara, manifests Himself as the cosmicvibration, or matter.” “The Spirit was made flesh”—for the intelligent spiritmaterializes itself into gross flesh by changing its rate of vibration. Cosmicintelligence becomes cosmic intelligent motion, or vibration, which changes intocosmic energy. This intelligent cosmic energy changes into electrons and atoms.Electrons and atoms change into gas, sometimes known as comic nebulae. Cosmicnebulae, or masses of diffused gaseous matter change into water. Water changesinto solid matter. Man’s body is a part this variously divided matter. In cosmicvibration all things are one; but when cosmic vibration becomes frozen intomatter, then it becomes many. So man’s body, being separated from cosmicvibration, again must retrace the various states of higher vibrations in orderto lift his consciousness from the vibrations of breath, heart, and circulationto the vibrating sound emanating from cosmic life force and all atoms. Withclosed eyes, one can feel his consciousness limited by feelings of the flesh andby the sounds of breath, heart, and circulation. But by deep meditation—astaught in the original Praecepta-given Meditation Technique—the Praeceptastudent can hear the voice of cosmic sound, emanating from all atoms and sparksof cosmic energy. By listening to this omnipresent sound the consciousness ofthe body-caged soul begins gradually to spread itself from the limitations ofthe body into omnipresence. One listening to this cosmic sound will find hisconsciousness spreading with it to limitlessness. This cosmic sound, emanatingfrom cosmic vibration, is called the “Holly Ghost”. Ghost signifies anintelligent, invisible, conscious force, or intelligent cosmic vibration. It isholy because the emanent (outflowing) consciousness of God the Father, or Christintelligence, guides it to create all finite matter. The ancients not versed inthe polished language of modern times, used “Holy Ghost” and “Word” forIntelligent Cosmic Vibration, which is the first materialization of God theFather in matter. The Hindus speak of this “Holy Ghost” as the “Aum”. “A” standsfor “Akar” or creative vibration; “U” for “Ukar” or preservative vibration; and“M” for “Makar” or destructive vibration. The storm-roar of the sea creates thewaves—preserves them for some time as larger or smaller waves—and them dissolvesthem. So the cosmic sound of Aum or Holy Ghost creates all things as Nebulae,preserves them in the forms of the present cosmos and worlds, and ultimately itwill dissolve all things in the bosom-sea of God. But this cosmic dissolution issometimes only partial and temporary, and again sometimes it is complete and fora long time. In the partial temporary dissolution, portions only of matter andworlds are dissolved; but in complete dissolution the entire system ofuniverses, all stars and planets, all things are dissolved. But the dissolvingoff all creation is impossible until all souls cease to desire anything at alland thus become fully emancipated in God. Unredeemed souls desire life, and withit they desire the earth, the sky, and its starry beauties. So, in order tofulfill our desire for children, souls come on earth as fleshly human beings.Aum has to create the entire universe at the behest of God the Father. Becauseof the endless rise and dissolution of the desires of creatures, their universeis endlessly being dissolved and recreated again.Hence, baptism by the Holy Ghost means first the dissolution of all wrongdesires by good desires, and then the conquering of all good desires by an onlydesire for the blessed contact of God. To know God is not the negation of alldesires, but instead their complete fulfillment. Men of the world strive wronglyto fulfill desires by forgetting to distinguish between those of the world andthose of the soul. Just as by feeding somebody else your hunger cannot besatisfied, so by wrongly trying to satisfy the senses your soul can never behappy. Senses crave indulgence, greed, and temptations to excite and amuse them,whereas soul can be satisfied only by the calmness, peace, and bliss, born ofmeditation and the moderate use of the sense servants. Ambition for good things,noble achievements, and spiritual organizational work, serving the many, must beinstituted to displace desires for selfishness and greed and for helping onlyone’s own self or one’s immediate family. Enjoy all good work and achievementswith God. By contacting God in the world and in meditation you will find allyour heart’s desires fulfilled. Then you will be a true man of renunciation, foryou will find that nothing is more worth-while, more pleasant or attractive thanthe all-beautiful, all-satisfying, all-thirst quenching ever-new, joyous God.Desire for one object alone keeps your consciousness tied to that object. Lovefor all things, as the expression of God, keeps man’s consciousness expanded inomnipresence. So one baptized by the Holy Ghost must be unattached, enjoyinggood things only with the joyousness of God within. He must learn first to hearthrough touch the Aum, or cosmic sound. First, by the Praecepta-given Techniqueof Meditation, as taught in the original Praecepta Lessons, he hears the soundof Holy Ghost when all bodily and astral sounds cease. Then, by deepermeditation on this sound, by higher processes learned from the Guru, he can beone with the sound and “touch” it. Then, after touching or feeling it, by stillhigher methods, the spiritual aspirant will find his consciousness vibratingsimultaneously in his body and in several continents. As he progresses furtherby deeper and longer meditation, he will find his consciousness vibratingsimultaneously in his body, in the earth, the planets, the universes, and inevery particle of matter.The intelligent holy vibration, or the first manifestation of God the Father,therefore manifests as the cosmic sound of Aum, or Amen, which can be heard inmeditation. It also manifests itself as cosmic energy in all matter. All earthlysounds and the sounds of the body—the heart, lungs, etc.—come from the cosmicsound of Aum. Aum contains all the sounds of the nine octaves perceptible to thehuman ear, as well as all cosmic sounds, low or high, which cannot be registeredin the human ear. So also, all forms of earthly lights—coal light, gas light,electric light, astral light—come from cosmic energy. Cosmic sound manifests ascosmic energy and vice versa. This cosmic sound manifests as the astral soundsof harps, bells, etc., (microcosmic cosmic energy) in the astral body of man. Soalso this cosmic energy exists as the reflected, luminous, or astral body ofman. Higher lessons of Praecepta teaching can teach one to hear and locate theastral sounds emanating from the spinal cord. The physical body is condensedcosmic energy. The astral body is also condensed cosmic energy. The physicalbody has two eyes—positive and negative, due to the law of relativity. Theastral body has only one eye, which is variously named—the spiritual eye, thesingle eye ( the Christian Bible), the third eye (the Hindu Bible), the star ofthe east, the star of wisdom, the dove descending from Heaven, the inner eye,the intuitive eye, Shiva’s eye, the star through which the wise men saw, etc.,etc. During the baptism by the Holy Ghost, as perceived by Jesus Christ, Heperceived it as a cosmic sound or Heaven, and the spiritual eye as the dove.This spiritual eye is a spiritual telescope with three rays as its lenses. Theouter circle is golden. The inner lens of light is blue, and is studded with afive-pointed, silver star (as the third ray). The microcosmic cosmic energymicrocosmically manifests in the human body as the specific reflected lifeenergy or the astral body. The spiritual or astral eye is the eye of the astralbody. The astral eye is the individualized cosmic energy in the human body. Inmeditation, first the life force must be withdrawn from the body, and must crossthe portals of cosmic energy represented by the golden ring. Then it must plungein the blue light representing Christ Consciousness. Then it must penetratethrough the silver star representing Spirit, in the region of the Infinite.These three—golden, blue, and silver light—contain all walls of rays ofultra-violet, electronic, and atomic rays—rays of cosmic energy through which onhas to penetrate before one can reach Heaven. The golden halo and the bluecentral light are two wings of the dove and the little white star represents themouth of the dove. The outer golden light is the Holy Ghost or Cosmic Energy orNature, the blue represents God the Son or Christ, and the silver starrepresents God Father.So Jesus, during His baptism, saw the cosmic energy manifested in bodily shape,or materialized out of the ether, as the telescopic spiritual astral eye; andout of that spiritual eye representing the cosmic energy came a voice, orintelligent, all-creative, cosmic sound, saying, or vibrating, in intelligiblevoice (for all language comes from the Holy Ghost), “Thou art my Son (or mymanifestation) I am glad thou hast risen (lifted thy consciousness from matter),and tuned in with my Omnipresence.”All material human beings are prodigal sons who have left the home ofOmnipresent Holy Ghost and have identified themselves with the infinitelysmaller territory of the human body. This Holy Ghost is the Great Comforter.Being guided by the universal, reflected, God-Consciousness, it contains theall-coveted bliss of God. One filled with this Holy Ghost, or Holy Vibration,can talk with the diverse tongues of inspirations of men, animals, and atoms.Since all languages are productions of the Holy Ghost, when man can hear, touch,and spread in Aum (or cosmic sound emanating from Holy Ghost), then canunderstand or utter all languages, not only men, but also of all animals and allatoms too. Holy Ghost, Aum of the Hindus, the Mohammedan Amin, the ChristianAmen, Voice of Many Waters, Word are the same thing. Aum is called the wordbecause the word signifies cosmic intelligent vibratory sound which is theorigin of all sounds and languages. This intelligent cosmic vibration or word isthe first manifestation of God in creation.On the day of Pentecost the disciples were filled with the new wine of joycoming from the touch of Aum, or the comforting Holy Vibration, and they couldtalk “in divers tongues”. Such were some of the experiences of Jesus after Hisbaptism by the Holy Ghost; and such can be the experiences of Praecepta studentsnow if they study the Praecepta Lessons, and do not forget them, but continue topractice them constantly and continually in real life as the years roll by.More on Baptism by the Holy GhostMan is a combination of body, life force, and consciousness. His consciousnessis a reflection of Christ consciousness. His life force is a reflection ofcosmic energy. His body is condensed cosmic energy and life energy.Consciousness, life force, and the body are the different rates of conscious,cosmic vibration. Life force vibrating more finely becomes cosmic consciousnessand life force when it vibrates grossly, changes into electrons, atoms,molecules, and bodily flesh. After all, the human body, life force, andconsciousness, being three different vibrations, are held together by thenucleus of ego and soul. Man is condensed miniature vibration. In order to freethe soul from the cage of the threefold vibrations of body, life force, andconsciousness, it has to be baptized or united with the original cosmicvibration of “Aum”. When the wave feels itself isolated from the sea then theboundaries of the wave must be expanded until they take on the shape of the sea.In the same way when the soul feels itself confined in the physical, astral, andideational bodies, it should be taught how to detach itself consciously fromthree bodies and become expanded into spirit. By the highest meditation the bodyloosens its atomic vibrations and becomes life force, and by deeper meditation,the astral body becomes elaborated into the ideational body. Then by wisdom theideational consciousness becomes expanded into Christ consciousness. But it mustbe remembered that when the Yogi [Notes: Yogi—one who practices yoga; one whoseeks scientific union with God] or Praecepta student listens to cosmicvibration, his mind is diverted from the physical sounds of matter outside hisbody to the circulatory sounds of the vibrating flesh. Then his consciousness isdiverted from the vibrations of the body to the musical vibrations of the astralbody. Then his consciousness wanders from the vibrations of the astral body tothe vibrations of consciousness in all atoms. Then the consciousness of the Yogilistens to the Holy Ghost or Cosmic Sound emanating from all atoms. This is theway that ordinary consciousness should be baptized or expanded into Christconsciousness through the expanding power of the Holy Ghost, or theall-spreading “Aum-vibrating-sound” heard in meditation by the practice of theMeditation Technique taught in the Praecepta Lessons.When you utter “Aum” it travels not only all around the earth but throughout allspace and eternity. So the sound emanating from the vibration of all atoms iscalled the Holy Ghost or the Sacred Vibration. As above said, when by thepractice of the Praecepta-given Meditation Technique, one is able to shut outsounds of matter, his consciousness passes through the vibrating sounds of thebody and through the musical astral sounds to the sound of “Aum” or the HolyGhost”. When the Yogi’s consciousness is able not only to hear this cosmic soundbut also to feel its actual presence in every unit of space, in all finitevibrating matter, then the soul of the Yogi becomes one with the Holy Ghost orHoly Vibration.Jesus, the Savior, (a Yogi( having met His Guru of former lives, (preceptor),St. John, was baptized by this omnipresent sound of “Aum”, and He also saw withit the spiritual dove, or the light with the two wings of golden and blue color(representing vibrating creation and Christ consciousness), and the silverystarry mouth (representing Spirit).Pic2_1.jpg [../images/00002.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":" Pic2_2.jpg [../images/00003.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":" BAPTISM BY CHRIST CONSCIOUSNESSThis voice of the Omnipresent Vibration of “Aum” signified “Thou art My Son” ;Jesus felt his consciousness attuned to the Christ consciousness or the onlybegotten reflection of GodPic3_1.jpg [../images/00004.jpeg]the Father’s Intelligence in the Holy Vibration. In other words, Jesus firstfelt His body as the entire vibratory creation in which His little body wasincluded; then feeling His cosmic finite body, he felt that within the cosmicbody of all creation there was a Christ or Universal Intelligence. This Christis the only begotten Son, because it is the only active reflected intelligenceof the indirectly active, transcendental (lying beyond creative vibration) Godthe Father, in vibratory creation. As the husband is reborn in the wife as theSon, so God the Father (transcendental Intelligence), is reflected in the wombof the Virgin Mary (the Virgin Creation), as the only begotten Son, or ChristConsciousness.The illustrations on the next pages serves best to illustrate Spirit, God theFather, Son, and Holy Ghost. In Figure A, the sun is seen to exist by itselfwithout anything surrounding it. Such aPic3_2.jpg [../images/00005.jpeg]sun can be described as a bright mass of light with power and heat spreading itsrays into space. But in Figure B, the sun is found to be active, existing inrelation to the blue crystal ball. In this figure the sunlight is divided as theinactive ball, and the active light appearing as blue light in the blue crystalball. This division of the one sunlight into white and blue light is possibledue to the dividing effect of the third object, the blue crystal ball. So thesun is one without any object around it, and with and object around it becomesdivided into two lights.Just as the sun is bright and spherically spreads its rays in space when itstands by itself without any surrounding creation, so the Spirit (as in Fig. C)is called the Unmanifested Absolute.When no goblin nebulae breathed and glided in the space body, when no fire-eyedbaby planets opened their eyes in the cradle of space, when the ocean of spacewas unpeopled, uninhabited by floating island universes, when the sun and moonand planetary families did not swim in space, when the little ball of earth withits doll houses and little human beings did not exist, when no object of anykind had come into being—Spirit existed. This spirit in its unmanifested formcannot be described except that it was the knower, the known, and all theobjects known which existed as one. In it the being, its cosmic consciousness,and its powers, all were one without differentiation. It could be described asthe ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new, joyous spirit.Spirit is ever-new Bliss. There was even no space, for the Spirit did not existin space or time; there was no dual conception or law of relativity in Spirit;it was everything that there was, is, or is to be. Space and time are categoriesof objects; as soon as a human being sees a planet hanging in the sky, then heconceives that the planet is occupying dimensional space and existing in time.But when there were no finite objects in creation, neither was there space nortime, but only the Blissful Spirit existed.But when the sun falls on a blue crystal ball its light suffers formal changeand division. The unmanifested Spirit felt, “I am alone. I am conscious Bliss,but there is no one to taste me”. Even as He thus dreamed, He became many.The Spirit was invisible, existing alone in the home of all space. He piped toHimself the ever-new, ever-entertaining song of Perfect, Beatific Bliss. As Hesang through His voice of Eternity to Himself, He wondered if aught but Himselfwere listening ad enjoying His song. To His astonishment, He felt He was thecosmic Song, and he was the Singing. Even as thus He thought, lo, He became two;Spirit and Nature, Man and Woman, Positive and Negative, Stamen and Pistil ofthe Flowers, Peacock and Peahen, Male Gem and Female Gem."},{"pageContent":"THE SPIRIT EVOLVES ITSELF AS THREEThus in Fig. D the Spirit is seen as divided into three. As soon as the cosmic,bachelor Spirit becomes active and creates the universe, he is no longer Spiritbut the husband, God the Father, wedded to the Virgin Mary or Cosmic Vibration."},{"pageContent":"MATTER CANNOT BE DIFFERENT FROM SPIRITSpirit being the only substance that there was when He wanted to create, He hadno substance but Himself to create with, for if there were two substances,spirit and matter, then both could not be infinite and all-powerful. Thus,Spirit having nothing else but Itself began to create a Magic Delusion, or thecosmic Magical Measurer, which made the infinite look like the finite, even asthe calm ocean becomes distorted into ripples on its surface by the action of astorm. So all vibratory creation is nothing but frozen spirit. Spirit dreamed avibratory universe or Holy Ghost and it was there."},{"pageContent":"ALL FORMS OF MATTER ARE DIFFERENT RATES OF VIBRATING SPIRIT-THOUGHTThought of matter, energy, all matter, all things, are nothing but thedifferently vibrating thoughts of the Spirit, even as man in his dreams createsa world with lightning and clouds, people being born or dying, loving orfighting, and experiencing heat or cold. All the births and deaths, sickness anddisease, solids, liquids or gases in a dream are nothing but the differentlyvibrating thoughts of the dreamer. This universe is a motion picture of God’sthoughts on the screen of human consciousness."},{"pageContent":"SPIRIT EVOLVES THE HOLY VIBRATION OR AUMSo all things, all created planets and living beings, in the Holy Ghost, or HolyVibration, are nothing but the frozen imagination of God. This Holy Ghost in theHindu Bibles is called “The Aum”, but by the scientists it is known as cosmicvibration. The Spirit, therefore, could not create matter as anything differentfrom Itself, for it had only Itself as the tissue or material with which tobuild the cosmos."},{"pageContent":"GOD THE FATHERAs soon as the Spirit evolved a cosmic vibratory thought, through the action ofthe cosmic magical measuring power of Delusion, it became condensed into cosmicenergy. Cosmic energy then became condensed into the material cosmos with solid,liquid, and gaseous substances. After creating the Ideational, Astral andPhysical Vibration, or Holy Ghost, the uncreated, unmanifested Spirit became Godthe Father. Spirit became the creator of all creative vibration. This God thefather is called the “Sat” in the Hindu Bibles, and is the TranscendentalIntelligence, according to metaphysical science. This Virgin, vibratorycreation, or Holy Ghost, became the consort of God the Father; that is, God theFather existed transcendentally, or outside the vibratory creation as aconscious, separate cosmic consciousness, jut as the sunlight remains around andbeyond the crystal ball (as in Fig. B).It should be noted that all human similes are imperfect since by their materialnature they are limited and cannot exemplify spiritual truths except in alimited way. It should be noted also that the sun does not create the crystalball, whereas the Spirit, as God the Father, evolved the Holy Ghost (as in Fig.D). In order to divide itself the Spirit first differentiated itself as God theFather and the Holy Ghost Vibration."},{"pageContent":"CREATION OF THE ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, OR CHRISTThen the Spirit found that the Holy Ghost could not sustain itself just by itsinactive omnipresence, so it made itself manifest as the active ChristIntelligence in all vibratory creation, to create, recreate, preserve, and mouldit according to its divine purpose. So the distinct, active, differentiated,conscious intelligence, existing in all specks of vibratory creation, or HolyGhost, is called the Only Begotten (Christ) Son. It must be remembered thatChrist consciousness in all specks of creation is the only existing reflectionof God the Father; hence, Christ intelligence is spoken of as the only begottenSon.The Christian church has failed to differentiate between Jesus the body andJesus the vehicle in which the only begotten Son, or Christ Consciousness, wasmanifested. Jesus Himself said that He was not speaking of His body as the onlybegotten Son, but of His soul which was not circumscribed by the body, but wasone with the only begotten Son, Christ consciousness in all specks of vibration.“God so loved the world (or matter); that He gave His only begotten Son” toredeem it; that is, God the Father remained hidden as Christ Intelligence in allmatter and in all living beings in order to bring all things, by beautifulevolutional coaxings back to His home of All-Blessedness, when they shouldover-come all mortal tests, and should reincarnate in matter no more; i.e., “gono more out”.Jesus said, “to all those that received Him, to then He gave the power to becomethe Sons of God.” The plural number in “Sons of God” shows distinctly from Hisown lips that not His body but His spirit was the only begotten Son, and allthose could become sons of God who could clarify their consciousness bymeditation, and receive, or in an unobstructed way reflect the power of God. Inother words they could be one with the only begotten reflection in all matterand become Sons of God like Jesus.Before Jesus came, Sage Byasa, writer of the Hindu Bible, Bhagavad Gita, was aSon of God, and knew how to be one with the only begotten reflection or KutasthaChaitanya (The undistorted consciousness existing in all vibratory creation). Soalso, Swami Shankara (the founder of the Swami order of renunciation about 700A.D.), Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswar (my Guru), and others havingChrist consciousness were Sons of God. The Spirit could not be partial increating one as Jesus and all others as mortal beings. A divinely-imported Jesuscould be made by the thousands by God and they would, being predestined,naturally behave on earth as Christs—as spiritual puppets of God. Such Christscould not be the ideals of struggling mortals with all their frailties. But whenwe see a man who by self-struggle and proper use of his God-given free-choiceand power of meditation become a Christ, then we can stir hope of salvation inthe weak, matter-tortured, fear-maligned, timorous, frail, human breast.Just as the husband is born again in the wife as the son, so inactive God theFather, active and manifest in Holy Ghost became the only reflected, onlybegotten Son. Therefore it should be remembered by the Praecepta student thatafter listening to and feeling the cosmic sound in all the Physical, Astral, andIdeational cosmos, or in the Physical, Astral, and Ideational Holy Ghost, hisconsciousness becomes stable in all creation, it feels the presence of Christconsciousness in all vibration. Then the Praecepta student becomes Christ-like;his consciousness experiences the Second Coming of Christ; he feels in hisvehicle the presence of Christ-consciousness as Jesus felt Christ expressed inHis body. All human beings find their consciousness hidebound by the body, butby listening to and feeling the “Aum” vibration and intuitive Christconsciousness the Yogi realizes that God the Father’s cosmic consciousnessexists inactively in regions where there is no motion or presence of theHoly-Ghost-vibration. (For the Holy Ghost vibration is limited only to a certaintract of space which is peopled by the cosmos and all island universes. HolyVibration is condensed into planetary creation.)When the Praecepta student feels his consciousness one with Christconsciousness, he realizes that Christ consciousness is nothing but thereflection of the cosmic consciousness of God the father. Then the Praeceptastudent, like Jesus, can say, “I (Christ consciousness in creation) and myfather (Cosmic consciousness beyond creation) are one.” As the white lightbeyond the blue crystal ball and the blue light in the crystal ball are thesame, so also the cosmic consciousness (God the Father), existing beyond allvibratory (Holy Ghost) creation and the Christ Consciousness (KutasthaChaitanya), in all vibratory creation are the same. When vibratory creationexists, God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost exist. When by cosmic dissolution(greater than Noah’s Flood, which was only partial dissolution), or when byuniversal dissolution the holy vibration is dissolved, then automatically Godthe Father, Son, and Holy Ghost become reconverted into the one Unmanifested,Absolute Spirit."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3: Why Jesus Was Tempted By The Devil—The Cosmic Struggle“And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by theSpirit into the wilderness, being forty days tempted of the devil.”(Luke 4:1-2)Jesus, the man, had become one with the Holy Vibration. His body was one withall Creation, in which His little body moved. His consciousness wasChrist-Consciousness, but until the body goes beyond the Christ state andbecomes one with the Father, and until the complete union of body, Holy Ghost,Christ Consciousness, and God Consciousness are perceived as one Spirit, mortaltests born of Past Delusion remain.Although Jesus was one with the Holy Ghost, still His old limited humanconsciousness and its earthly desires, through the law of habit, tried toattract His expanded consciousness to earthly consciousness. This is thepsychological explanation of the origin of the tempting, by the firmlyestablished bad mortal habits, of the new Divine habit, in order to keep Himfrom contacting the Great Comforter.All satisfaction comes from Holy Vibration, for it is the sum total of allearthly things looked for. Sense pleasure is evil because it limits the soul,blinds it, and keeps it from seeking the unlimited happiness in the universalsensorium of the Holy Ghost.The Spirit alone is perfect. Everything else in Creation is imperfect. Creationstarted with the law of duality, with the law of division. The Spirit wasperfect. Nothing else was necessary for His perfection; hence, Creation wasunnecessary for His evolution. Then why did Spirit create at all? The Onlyanswer to that question is that He wanted to consciously enjoy Himself. TheSpirit thought: “I am the very nectar of Bliss, but there is no one to enjoy me,so I will create a Cosmic play and divide Myself into many, then Myself as manyselves gradually with many mouths of minds may taste the nectar in my InfiniteSelf.”This Cosmic play came out of the Spirit’s desireless desire; that is, thisdesire for Cosmic play was unnecessary to complete the Spirit’s Being, for Hewas already perfect, but this Cosmic desire itself was imperfect, for it was anurge, a desire to do something. Just as poison does not affect the serpent, sothis Cosmic delusive desire existing in Spirit does not affect Him.This Cosmic desire of Spirit was an unnecessary desire, just as sometimes afather may play with his child through a desireless desire which is unnecessaryfor the father’s development. It was imperfect because it wanted to accomplishsomething when that accomplishment was not necessary for the completion of theall-perfect Spirit.This imperfect desire was the original thought vibration which divided theSpirit into many through the law of duality. Besides, the Spirit at first foundthat He alone, being the only substance existent, could not very well divideHimself into two distinct essentially different objects of Spirit and matter, sothe Spirit created the differentiation between Spirit and matter in thoughtonly, just as a piece of stone and a thought of a piece of stone in a dream haveno essential difference except in the difference existing in frozen humanimagination.Thus the Spirit had to practice a Cosmic deception, a universal mental magic, toperform before the duality of matter and mind and the dualities of finiteobjects.This delusive Cosmic differentiation in thought is responsible for allimperfections in Creation; then again, according to the law of cause and effect,the small selves which came out of Spirit were specially gifted with the powerof free choice and independent action even as Spirit possessed.This Cosmic delusive will thus inherited the power and free choice of Spirit toact independently of His perfect will. As the one sheet of water of the calm seais chopped into many miniature pieces of water called waves, by the action of athird agent, the wind storm, so the conscious Cosmic, delusive, desirelessdesire of Spirit manifested itself as the independent conscious Magicalmeasurer, or the Maya [Notes: Maya: The Sanskrit root ma signifies “to measure”.The original Aryan race, from which Indu-Arian, American Aryans, and CaucasianAryans originated, lived in central Asia. Their principal wealth consisted ofcows. Pa, father, was the protector. Ma, duh, (from which dohter and daughter,Sanskrit duhrter, originated) signified “milking the cow,” which was thefunction of the daughter, and ma, mother. Sanskrit mata, latin mater, and mothersignified “to measure,” for mother used to measure milk and give it to thechildren. Sanskrit is the mother of all languages.] (Cosmic measurer ofdelusion) of the Hindu Scriptures, and was solely entrusted with the independentpower of superficially dividing the Spirit into the perception of perfect finiteobjects materialized as icebergs of planets and wavelets of stars, floating onthe vast sea of Infinity.This Cosmic delusive Magical Measurer has ever since manifested Itself as theHoly ghost, the Cosmic sacred vibration, or Nature (Sanskrit Prakriti).The plan of Spirit was that this subjective, conscious, Cosmic, delusive forceshould be endowed with independence in order to cooperate with objectified,conscious, Cosmic vibration in objectified, conscious, Cosmic energy, and withonly reflected Christ Intelligence present in it, to create perfect finiteobjects.Perfect gems in mines, perfect flowers, perfect animals, and human stars inperfect planets were thus created. These perfect objects, after displaying aflawless dream of perfect form, health, habits, and modes of existence on thestage of time, without disease or painful premature death, or cruel accidents,were to dissolve back into Spirit, just as numerous waves after a separate happyexistence without the necessity of being killed or shattered by accidentsdissolve back into their one self, the sea, at the end of the storm. That is whyin the Christian Bible we find the perfect Adam and Eve communing with God, soeasily and simply, under the tree and near the altar. They were only cast awayfrom the paradise of Cosmic Consciousness when they were tempted by the devil ofCosmic ignorance.According to God’s plan, the flower, plant, animals, and human cells were tolive recharged by Cosmic Energy and not cruelly feed on one another. Then, aftera perfect existence, a perfect expression and pleasant mutual entertainment,without suffering, all created forms were to dissolve back into Him. Just asrainbows come and go, just as forms of flowers, animals, and human bodies can becreated by electrical devices in moving pictures for entertainment and switchedon or off at will, so all living creatures and all created things were to existlike mutually entertaining vitaphone pictures on the screen of space, and wereto disappear in God at the end of their cycle, after the drama of that periodwas perfectly played.This conscious Cosmic delusive force, receiving independent power from God,found that all things and all living forms after a perfect existence began todissolve back into the Cosmic Energy. In this way the Cosmic delusive forcebegan to think that, inasmuch as the Cosmic Energy manifestations of the HolyGhost or Holy Vibration were to dissolve back into Spirit, It must Itself ceaseexisting with the disappearance of the Holy Vibration. Just as the stormdisappears when waves dissolve into the sea, so with the withdrawal of HolyVibration, the Cosmic delusive force would have to lose Its separate existence.This thought frightened the Cosmic delusive force, the force which aims to keepthings in manifestation, and ever since. He has rebelled. Before this the Cosmicdelusive force was considered an Archangel of God and was in a friendly mannercooperating with Christ Intelligence and Holy Vibration in creating perfectfinite objects. It was at this period that the Cosmic delusive force fell fromheaven in this form of lightning and began to act in apparent opposition toChrist Intelligence and conscious cosmic Holy Vibration.The falling of Satan as lightning from Heaven signifies that originally allCosmic Energy, being vibrated by the Holy Ghost and Christ Intelligence, wasflowing Godward, then the creative, Cosmic delusive force, fearing completewithdrawal of all energy back into God, began to turn the flow of Cosmic Energyaway from His heavenly Presence toward finite creation. Just as, when waves wantto fall back into the sea, a fresh storm can compel them to retain their forms,so the Cosmic delusive force became rebellious and began, through the mundanedesire of beings, arising from imperfect living, to slap then back into finiteexistence through the law of reincarnation.Reincarnation was started by Satan, so that human beings would have to come backagain and again to earth until they could lose their imperfect desire to stay onearth and could finally go back to Spirit. Ever since creating the law ofreincarnation, the Cosmic delusive force has tortured the immortal souls of thechildren of God by forcibly imprisoning them again and again behind the bars ofpainful flesh and making them stay away from their kingdom of omnipresence. Bycreating the law of reincarnation or punishment by law of cause and effect,which law governs human actions (Law of Karma), the Archangel of God, the Cosmicdelusive force, converted Himself into the rebellious Satan.Since then this conflict has existed between the God-tuned, universal, OnlyBegotten Son of Christ Intelligence, the Holy Ghost, and the matter-bent loverof finite creation, Satan.Jesus, possessing Christ Consciousness, realized the tug of war between theperfect, universally intelligent, Holy Vibration and the satanic pull orImperfection toward finite Creation. Ever since his rebellion, Satan has createdimperfect patterns, representing evil, disease, pain, and catastrophe, todisturb the desireless, perfect existence of human begins who were destined toreturn to God after perfectly playing His Cosmic Drama, inaugurated to entertainHis immortal children.Human beings, disturbed by disease, wanted perfect health, but were cut off bypremature death. They wanted to live long, therefore Satan created in themearth-bound desires, and Satan also deluded them into indulging in mentaldesires which would bring them back again and again under his dominance by thepernicious law of reincarnation. Satan began to create imperfect patterns ofplants, infested trees, and diseased human beings in order to foil the perfectpatterns of perfect plants, healthy trees, and wholesome human beings institutedby God through Holy Vibration acting in consonance with Christ Intelligence."},{"pageContent":"HOW SATAN CREATES DEATH, DISEASE, AND DISTURBANCEMany modern scriptural interpreters, unable to understand why Christ Himselfintroduced the idea of the existence of Satan, have tried to explain away theold conception of a devil by saying it is obsolete, that evil does not exist, orthat God does no know evil. Such interpreters, unable to solve the problem ofhow it was possible for evil to originate in God, who is only good, have gone tothe extreme of denying the existence of evil. In the first place, let me saythat the denial of the power of evil has some good points, although it ischildish to deny the existence and temptations of evil in this world of seemingduality.Even if the conscious evil force of Satan does exist, it could not influencehuman minds if we did not mentally accept it. It is better to know all the luresof evil and the ways to combat them than to be blind and deny their existence.Knowledge only, and not indifference, can produce final emancipation. The greatdrama of Cosmic existence has endowed man with free choice and the power ofreason. Man, the image of God, has the same liberty or free choice in his sphereas God the Father has.If God is Almighty and knows that we are suffering, why does He, being Almightyand eternally blessed, allow weaklings to suffer from the temptations of evil?The answer is, that after receiving independence, the Cosmic force began to fillCreation with patterns of imperfections, displacing the perfect patterns ofGod’s first plan. God then destroyed all Creation, as described in Genesis, butseemingly He found Himself illogically using His Almighty power in arbitrarilydestroying Creation. Also, He seemed to be contradicting His own laws, inasmuchas He destroyed the power of Satan after once giving him independence of action.Then God created again and reinstated the original power of independent freechoice which He gave to Satan and to all Creation. God could destroy Satan evennow and free us at once from the thralldom of earthly miseries, imperfections,broken hearts, and death, by using His Almighty material force, but He would notdo that because that would be taking away our independence.Since God gave independence to man and Satan, He can free them only throughteaching them the right use of their own power of free choice. God is enjoyingHis eternal blessed state in selfish happiness, but He is suffering for ourmiserable tragic existence, delayed evolution on earth, and belated return tothe paradise of all-emancipating wisdom. He is continuously trying to use thesuperior force of Divine Love expressed as the parental, friendly, filial,all-surrendering pure conjugal love to coax man to forsake his cooperation withevil, which helps and strengthens it to destroy him.Man stands in the middle, with God on one side and Satan on the other side, eachready to pull him in whichever direction he wishes to go. It is up to man tosignal God or Satan as to which direction he wants to be pulled. Man isperfectly free to act without being influenced by God or Satan, but whenever hedoes act right, or as a pure, ennobling thought, that is the signal to God andhe is automatically pulled toward God, but as soon as man thinks or acts evil,he is automatically pulled toward Satan. However, being essentially an image ofGod, man can never be eternally drowned in the hades of evil.No matter how persistently sinful man is, he can never suffer eternalpunishment. Evil promises happiness and results only in unhappiness. As soon asman realizes this, then he begins to wish for emancipation and for God. Thiswish for goodness and freedom serves as a portal through which God is againinvited to come into the life of the prodigal son and lead him to the abode offreedom. Even fathomless evil cannot destroy man’s soul, for he is essentiallyimmortal and eternally good."},{"pageContent":"EVIL IS A TEMPORARY PARASITEAll evil is a passive graft, a temporary parasite on the tree of life, which canbe amputated by the knife of wisdom possessed by man.Whenever man initiates good actions, he is proceeding toward a paradise ofBliss, hidden in the womb of eternal futurity.God is coaxing us with an array of limitless good happenings and is influencingus for our own welfare, whereas Satan is tempting us with pleasant-looking butfleeting happiness-producing patterns of evil. Satan’s patterns are temptationsbecause they are deceptive contrivances created to consciously delude us bypromising us good and giving us evil instead.According to the dual conception of good and evil (God and Satan), it becomeseasy to understand why there is so much good, together with so much evil. Thesky and earth are full of the productions of God’s patterns of perfection andSatan’s patterns of imperfection to influence man. The beautiful sunshine,clouds, and rain are created by God to benefit man. Cataclysms, earthquakes, andfloods were created by Satan to make man uncomfortable.An eternal display of goodness is materialized in Nature and the life of man,proving that God is trying to impress man and influence him to use his free willand return to the abode of Bliss. Satan, through deceptive, apparently pleasantcontrivances of temporary happiness-yielding acts, greed, and lust is trying tokeep man tied to this misery-making limited earth. Jesus, as a manifestation ofGod, came to speak of the eternal kingdom of Heaven, upon whose threshold nosorrow can tread. Jesus taught that permanent happiness can only be found inGod. Satan deludes man into seeking permanent happiness in impermanent materialthings.God made man immortal. He was to remain on earth as an immortal. He was tobehold the drama of change with a changeless immortal mind, and after seeingchange dancing on the stage of changelessness, he was to return to the bosom ofeternal blessedness, then evil crept in, causing man to concentrate on thechanges of life and on outward appearances rather than on the underlyingimmortality in all things, and thus made him conceive the false idea of death orcomplete annihilation.The motion picture of a man’s life, his birth, life on earth, and death, seen onthe screen, produces the joyous consciousness of his birth and the sad conceptof his death, or end, but Satanic ignorance hides from view the motion picturesof man’s pre-natal life as he joyously began the descent from God, and thejoyous return to God as he hurried back after death. Satan has made us forgetour pre-natal and post-natal experiences, and by showing us for a time thisdrama of life and then lowering the curtain, it has produced in us the erroneousconception called death.I am not denying the experience of the change called death, but I consider itonly as an outwardly moving link in the chain of immortality, all of which ishidden from our view. To say that death or change does not exist, isunmetaphysical and erroneous. To forget this dismal, delusive death, man shouldbehold all change as dancing on the bosom of changelessness. Man should beholdthe changeless ocean of Infinity as wavelets of change appearing anddisappearing."},{"pageContent":"SUPERNATURAL DEATH VERSUS PAINFUL DEATHIf Adam and Eve had not transgressed the wishes of God, and their descendantshad not allowed themselves to be influenced by hereditary ignorance, then modernman would not have to witness the heartrending painful deaths through accidentand disease.Man appeared on earth, being materialized by God, and was to live on earth,beholding the birth, sustenance, growth, and the painless, sorrowless, return ofthe body in complete perfection. Then, as it is possible to watch the slowprocess of a flower budding, growing, and disappearing on the movie screen, soman should behold his life picture on the screen of his consciousness throughthe stages from childhood to a full-grown individual, and then his disappearanceunto God of his own accord by his own power of dematerialization.Man, being out of tune with God, has lost his power of dematerialization, so heis frightened by the screen picture of life prematurely cut off even before hehas finished seeing the whole perfect picture of his changeful life. Thispremature withdrawal of the motion picture of life produces pain due toattachment to those screen pictures of flesh and consciousness and is known inthe world as terrible death by pain.We mortals have so many misconceptions about death that it has grown intoimportance and has fixed in us an idea of annihilation and pain instead of beingseen as a phenomena necessary in the successive steps which the soul must followin order to return from the state of change to the changeless state. It isnecessary for death or change to come, so that the soul may finish beholdingthis motion picture of life and be released in order to go back to the home ofImmortality.Satan saw that it would all be very simple if the immortal children of God,after beholding a perfect earthly existence with a changeless attitude, would goback to immortality again, so Satan made imperfect patterns or tampered with theshowing of a perfect picture of life before it was completed, and caused mentaland bodily pain through delusion. This dissatisfaction, arising from animperfect, prematurely destroyed picture of life, created in man the desire tosee perfect pictures of life in order to behold then until completion.Ever since, the immortal images of God forgot their already perfect immortalityand began to introduce delusive imperfections in the perfect dramas of lifestaged on the screen of time. Ever since, immortals have been coming and goingfrom earth by the law of cause and effect, which governs desires. Ever since,this law of cause and effect has affected free souls as the Law of Karma(action), which keeps them earth-bound.This law of cause and effect, which imprisons souls on earth in Satan’s Kingdomof finitude, has been called “reincarnation”."},{"pageContent":"HOW TO DESTROY REINCARNATIONImmortal souls can only expect to be free by utterly destroying all seeds ofearthly desires by Divine contact with God through meditation. This reminds thesoul of the unending fulfillment in the immortal inheritances of Bliss whichmakes desires for earthly ways unnecessary and ridiculous.Emancipation from reincarnation is also possible by playing the living drama ofa perfect life of health, abundance, and wisdom on the screen of consciousness;that is, if one can remove the consciousness of sickness and not fear sicknessif it does come, and not desire health while suffering from ill health, then onecan remember one’s soul, which was always well and was neither sick nor healthy.If we can feel and know that we are the children of God, and as such posseseverything, even as our father, God does, although we may be poor or rich, wecan be free. If we can feel that we have Divine knowledge, because we are madein the image of God, although humanly speaking we know little—then we can befree from reincarnation.Fear of sickness and a desire for mortal health, fear of poverty and a desirefor opulence, a feeling of lack of knowledge as well as a desire to knoweverything, belong to the domain of ignorance. Of course, if we are strickenwith ill health, failure, or ignorance, we need not continue to remain so. Weshould strive for health, prosperity, and wisdom without being afraid offailure.While struggling, man must know that his struggle for health, prosperity, andwisdom is born of delusion, for he already has all he needs within his innerpowerful self. It is only because he erroneously imagined, when in spirituallyignorant mortal company, that he did not have these—that is why he lacked them.All he has to do is to think right and not strive to acquire things. He needsonly to know that he already has everything.Once a healthy, wealthy, and wise prince dreamed that he was poor, and in thedream he shouted: “Oh, I am suffering from cancer and I lost all my wisdom andriches.” His Wife, the queen, woke up and aroused him, saying: “Look, prince,laugh and rejoice, for you are neither suffering from sickness nor have lostriches and wisdom, but you are comfortably lying at my side in health andwisdom, in your rich kingdom. You were only dreaming about these catastrophes.”So it is with ignorant man. He is dreaming about lack and failure, when he mightclaim his birthright of joy, health, and plenty as a son of the ruler of theuniverse. He is now living in his perfect kingdom, but is dreaming evil.The constant desire for health and prosperity, which is so much harped upon inmodern spiritual organizations, is the way to slavery. We must seek God firstand then find health and prosperity through Him. Beggars get only a beggar’sshare, whereas, a son of God gets his son’s share. That is why Jesus spoke ofseeking and knowing the kingdom of God first. When that is actuallyaccomplished, then health and prosperity will be added. The acquirement ofwisdom and everything else that the soul of man needs will be received as amatter of his Divine birthright.It is best to feel by visualization and by Divine contact in meditation that youare already perfect in health and wisdom and have abundance, rather than try tosucceed by begging for health, prosperity, and wisdom. In fact, man’s mortalefforts are bound by the laws of cause and effect. Man cannot get more than hedeserves. By the method of begging, no human being can ever fulfill all hisendless desires, but by first realizing his oneness with God, man can owneverything he needs.Man cannot have immortality by begging for it or by feeling a desire for it. Heshould know that he is already immortal and that so-called death is only adream.According to the plan of God, man should have experienced growth from childhood,and through youth to manhood, but should never have experienced death by old ageor disease. Even if man becomes old, he should never die of disease or sufferpainful death. In the drama of life and death, when beheld with Divineunderstanding, there can be no pain in death, but only the showing or stoppingof the motion picture of life at will without physical or mental pain."},{"pageContent":"ORIGIN OF PAINThe outward flowing force which struggles to keep all things in manifestationsaw that without pain people would not create earthly desires to hold them here,so the illusion of pain was created, which is purely a mental phenomena. Thepain of ill health and death creates the desire for health and life, and to havehealth and life the immortal image of God must again and again return on earthto complete its slow growth from ignorance to enlightenment.Satan is defeating his own purpose, for it is physical pain and sorrow whichcause matter-imprisoned souls to seek freedom in God. A child’s pure soul feelsvery little pain. A doctor friend in a orthopedic hospital told me that childrenvie with each other to get their deformed limbs operated upon, whereas, adultshave to be coaxed for weeks, and at the time of their operation they are usuallyovercome with emotion and fear.Man has fortunately discovered anesthetics to neutralize pain. Originally manhad great self-control and a mind which was unattached and impersonal, and sodid not feel pain when the body was injured. He could behold his own bodywithout pain even as one can witness an operation on another’s body withoutbecoming mentally excited or suffering physical pain.Although a mother feels terrible agony when her own son dies, she does not feelthe same when hearing of the death of a stranger’s son. So it is that man feelsthe agony of accident and disease in his own body but not the suffering ofothers. This is only due to the proximity of continued attachment. The farmer’swater-proof, fire-proof, less sensitive child feels much less physical sufferingthan the sensitively brought up son of the rich. If you have no fear or nervousimagination, you will feel less pain.Jesus was tempted in the wilderness with the wild beasts of passion and thefierce mortal desires of pain and hunger for material kingdoms, sent by CosmicSatan."},{"pageContent":"ORIGIN OF EVILThere are many causes which can be set forth, as to the origin of evil. Somepeople say that it is due to man’s own fault and that neither God nor any evilpower, such as that of a conscious Satan, is responsible for all the evil in theworld.Although evil is relative and is due to the lack of harmony with God’s laws, ifyou hit a stonewall with your knuckles the resulting undeniable evil of painwould not be created or willed by the wall, but would be due to your ignorancein trying to hurt a stonewall.Likewise, it can be said, God is the eternal stonewall of goodness, and anyonewho is foolish enough to misuse his intelligence and try to act against the goodis bound to produce the evil of pain and suffering. God is good. We were made inHis image, endowed with the gift of free choice to tune in with His Nature ofGoodness, Peace, and Immortality, and those who get out of tune with Him byperforming evil actions are bound to suffer.A little boy endowed with reason may enjoy perfect health and protection underthe strict discipline of his mother, but when he grows up and says: “Mother, Iknow I am safe under you care, but I wonder why you gave me the power of freechoice if you are always to decide how I am to act? Mother dear, I want tochoose for myself and find out in what lies my own good and what leads me tosuffering.”The mother replies: “Son, it is right for you to demand from me the right to useyour free choice. When you were helpless and your reason had not yet buddedforth into full expression, I helped you, and nurtured you through the maternallove which protects babies. Now, however, you are grown up, your reason hasopened your eyes, and you must depend upon your own free choice and judgment toguide you to do what will produce your well-being.”Thus the youth ventures into the world unguarded, with a semi-developed reason,and the first thing that he does is to get into a fight and secure the resultingevil of a broken leg a black eye.In exactly the same way the Divine Mother protects each baby through theinstinctive love of parents until grown up, then the baby has to protect itselfby the exercise of reason. If the baby uses the reason rightly, it becomeshappy, but if reason is misused, then evil is precipitated through the misuse ofreason.Many intellectualists claim that evil is more subjective than objective. This isnot wholly true. It can be explained that most evil is due to the ignorance ofman. For example, the habit of physical over-indulgence, and is consequent evilsof indiscretion, ill health, and grip of temptation, does not arise until man,by an act of erroneous judgment, forgets himself and subjectively by repeatedtransgressions allows this consciousness to become a habit.All habits, good or bad, control and enslave the mind only after the will hasallowed itself to be overcome by repeated good or evil actions born of good orevil judgment, as the case may be. Thus it may be said, man’s good judgment, andhis will, acting under its influence, produce all good, and man’s ignorant orevil judgment, and his will acting repeatedly under its influence, isresponsible for all evil. From this viewpoint good and evil are mostlysubjective instead of originating in some objective power.It may be asked why some children are born with special tendencies ofself-control and some with tendencies of weakness. Some intellectuals may pointout that heredity is responsible for good or bad traits in a child. Then thequestion comes: Why would an impartial God start one child with a good heredityand a good brain inclined only to good tendencies, and another child with a badheredity and the brain of a moron inclined only to do evil under the compellinginfluence of evil physiological instincts?According to the law of reincarnation and the Law of Karma, or the law of causeand effect, which governs the actions of all persons, it is explained that thesoul attracts to itself a good or bad heredity, and a good or bad brain,according to pre-natal habits formed during the period of the past incarnationpreceding death in the last incarnation and rebirth in this life. There-fore, itmay be said that the good or bad judgment of all incarnations, working throughthe law of cause and effect, which governs all human actions, creates good orbad habits, and that good or bad habits create good or bad hereditarytendencies, and that thus all evil arises from wrong judgment.All this is very well said, namely, that evil is subjective, but it does notexplain why millions of bacteria and virulent, invisible armies of germs movesilently about the earth seeking, like devouring locusts, to destroy the crop ofhuman lives.Why is it easy for the majority of people to be tempted materially? Why are theyspiritually idle, and why do they do the very things that will hurt them? Why isthere death by floods and cataclysms? Why do men murder each other in war?Why is there cannibalism in Nature? Why does the baby salmon live on the fleshof its mother? Why does the big fish eat the little fish? Why does even thethoughts of wrong judgment and emotions of jealousy, revenge, greed, andselfishness arise at all in human mind which was made in the image of God?If man is the image of God, and God is good, then the logical deduction is thatman could become nothing else but good. The world wars may have resulted fromindustrial selfishness, from nations fuming with national selfishness and greedfor possession, but why was it not avoided by parliamentary discussions?Think of the joy in fishing. You deceive the fish by hooked food, and the morethe fish struggles for life, the more you enjoy it and say: “My, it is a gamefish.” Would you like to change places with the fish? Think of the Aztecs, whoused to cut the hearts out of their prisoners of war, six or seven hundred at atime, in front of their idol gods. Think of all the burning of witches andmartyrs under the zeal of the Christian faith.Think of the war of the Crusades, fought for the Biblical teaching, which preachonly love for your enemies. Think of the numberless diseases which infest plantsand animals who have no free choice and who consequently could not attractpre-natal evils due to bad Karma.The eternal warfare of animals preying on one another, and the battle ofopposites in Nature, distinctly show that there is an evil force which isemploying germs, wrong judgment of men, and cannibalistic instincts, which arewrong vibrations resulting from the wrong actions of man, and breed temptationto do wrong in infinite ways by trying to destroy the efforts of the InfiniteGood who is trying to express Himself in infinite good ways.We think that if were Almighty we could create a much better world than this. Wewould banish from this earth cancer, accidents, weakness, revengefulness, anger,greed, murder, famine, leprosy, cannibalism, industrial greed resulting indepression, earthquakes, floods, bad weather, drought, death by pain, boredom,old age, despair, poisonous bacteria, tragedies of life, and so forth.We would create a world with a joyous struggle and not painful struggle, anever-new happy state of mind for all men entirely different from mental idlenessand boredom. We would make the body with the qualities of asbestos, diseaseless,changeable according to the commandments of our will. We would have our bodiestailored in the workshop of materialization and self-rejuvenation.We would create a variety of occupations with a variety of actions, all leadingto Infinite, unending, ever-new happiness. Good citizens would be materializedby will from the ether, even as God created the first man and woman, and woulddematerialize ourselves in cosmic Consciousness after we had successfullyfinished our earthly entertainment.Blind theologians and superstitious people made a dragon out of Satan, which hadto be killed by the sword of the conquering knight. Modern intellectuals try toexplain Satan away as a merely subjective idea born of ignorance. Some modernspiritual denominations, beings unable to explain the existence of evil in theentirely good God, completely and blindly deny even the existence of evil.We find that Jesus, whose knowledge was born of intuition, distinctly spoke ofconscious Satan who lured Him to the wilderness and tempted Him with the wildbeasts of evil patterns arrayed side by side with the good patterns of God. Thisconscious force comes in the form of little temptations to the ordinary man. Theexistence of such evils is the reason Jesus prayed: “Thy kingdom come,” in orderthat man might use his independence and act rightly, and that he mightsubstitute the kingdom of evil for the kingdom of God.Satan, like a fisherman, has cast a net of delusion around all mankind and iscontinually trying to drag man toward the slavery of delusion, death, andfinitude. Satan tempts humanity by his baits of greed, and promises of pleasure,and leads people to destruction and continuous painful reincarnations. He keepssouls, like fish, in the pond of finitude and spawns them with desires for hisown destructive uses.For all the patterns of good created by God, Satan created correspondingpatterns of psychological evils. God created wisdom, Satan ignorance. Godcreated all good, Satan all evil. God created the senses of sight, smell, taste,hearing, and touch to be the servants of man, bringing happiness to him. Satanby temptation made man the slave of his senses and caused the resultant misery.The sense of hearing, smell, and sight can be over-taxed with very little illeffect. Very few people are foolish enough to strain their eyes so much thatthey become blind. No one can smell flowers or perfumes long enough to causedeath. Very few people can make themselves deaf by continuously listening togood music. Of course, the sense of sight may be baited by physical beauty andresult in a series of wrong judgments and misery. The sense of hearing may bemisused and lost by too much practice of cannon shooting or other loudexplosions. The sense of smell can be vitiated, but it is the most harmless ofall of the five senses and can stand much abuse without retaliation.Think what dreadful consequences follow when the sense of taste or touch isover-taxed. How easy it is to over-eat and hasten death by indigestion. How easyit is for most people to over-indulge in physical temptation and indiscretionand bring upon themselves ill health, boredom, social, and matrimonial disaster,jealousy, murder, and so forth. God wanted man to procreate His species bymaterialization, but Satan, through misuse of his God-given power of freechoice, created the physical urge and its infinite complications to keep man’smind away from the joy of God. If God created infinite Bliss, Satan created thegreatest of all temptations—that of the flesh.Is it wrong to have good children by the ordinary law, of procreation? No, butremember that Satan’s law of procreation and its misuse can be overcome only bymoderation in marriage and by self-control and by the joyous contact with God inmeditation and not by hypocritical renunciation. When the joy of God, felt inmeditation with stillness of breath, remains continuously in the soul, then thephysical temptation vanishes forever through contrast with this greater joy.Real freedom can be accomplished in no other way.The joy in God is more tempting than all temptations. Just as when opium issuddenly denied to an opium addict, he becomes sick or dies, so, unless the lawsof Satan, which have become second nature to man, are worked off gradually, mandies the death of ignorance.Attempted complete self-control, by the sense-tortured individual developshypocrisy, that is why Saint Paul said: “It is better to marry than to burn”.Moderation in married life, supplemented by tasting of the Infinite Bliss ofdeep meditation and the unconditioned Divine Love in the soul, is a better wayto freedom than the earthly way of reincarnation by physical procreation. Theman who has completely attained Divine Bliss may not marry. If he does marry, asdid Lahiri Mahasaya ( my Guru’s Guru) it is only to show people how theconsciousness of God can tame temptation and how God’s love can spiritualizeconjugal love, and how it can exist under all conditions of life.Since God’s love is more tempting than temptation, one can love God even thoughhe loves his wife. One can love his wife with the love of God and not love offlesh. To love your wife in a material way only is to invite Satan to dwell withyou and lead you to boredom, destruction of your most wonderful love, and toseparation. To love your wife with the pure love of God and to live with her alife of self-control by mental development, and to create spiritual children isa noble way to live. To be drowned by material cares, weariness, over-work,greed for money, over-indulgence in amusements, buying more things, and slavingfor more money and saving no time for God leads you to the misery kingdom ofSatan. A happy, contended, simple, harmonious married life of self-control andmeditation leads you to God.God created forgiveness; Satan created revenge. Likewise, God created calmness,fearlessness, unselfishness, spirit of brotherhood, peace, love, understanding,wisdom, and happiness, and for each of these Satan created its psychologicalopposite of restlessness, fear, greed, individual and material selfishness, war,anger, hate, murder, and jealousy instead of understanding; ignorance in placeof wisdom, and sorrow to fight happiness.Sense slavery was created to defeat the happiness in self-control. Nationalselfishness, false sense of patriotism, industrial selfishness, and nationalpride were created by Satan to destroy the universal spirit of brotherhood,international understanding, and law of equality created by God. Conscience, thevoice of God, always beckons you to do right. Temptation, the voice of Satan,coaxes you to do wrong.Remember that Satan has brought disease, cataclysms, famine, pain, death,strife, and imperfection in Nature so that man may desire to have a perfectearth and return again and again to earth life, where Satan reigns, and never goback to Spirit. Let us, by perfect living in a spiritual United States of theWorld, make God’s Heaven from Satan’s earth of imperfection. Let us help God’spattern, to take the place of the evil designs of Satan.Belief in an objective Satan explains the origin of all evil, which cannot beexplained by the individual or collective subjective ignorance of man. You arefree, so when you are tempted, or angry, or jealous, or selfish, or greedy, orrevengeful, or restless, remember that Satan is asking you to come to his side.Remember that every time you are master of yourself: moderate, calm,understanding, unselfish, forgiving, and when you practice meditation, you areinviting God to help you. Remember, above all, that you are a free agent endowedwith free will, and that Satan can only influence you when you command yourselfto yield to his temptations.Remember, God can redeem you only when you act in accordance with His laws ofright living in every way. Remember, also, that you are in the middle with Satanstanding at your left with his kingdom of misery, and God remaining at yourright with His kingdom of happiness. It rests with you whether you will allowSatan to pull you to his side, or whether you will ask God to draw you to Hisside of Eternal Freedom.Remember, every time you are tempted to do wrong, it is not your subjective mindalone which is tempting you, but also objective Satan, and recognizing this,refuse to cooperate with him, thereby being destroyed.Satan can work as wrong subjective consciousness in man, or he can become theobjective evil in Nature. Many people think this conception of Satan teachesduality and not the conception of one God, who alone exists in the Cosmos. Thisis not true. In essence, in reality, there is nothing but Spirit, the onlysubstance in existence, the ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss.As the ocean, when it is calm, can exist without the storm and the waves, so theSpirit, by withdrawing all waves of manifestation, can exist as the only OneGoodness, as the only One Reality, but when the ocean is in movement we mustacknowledge a second force, the storm, which divides the one ocean into manystruggling, mutually destructive, big and small waves.God, in creating the Cosmos, has to use the independent Cosmic force of Satan’sdelusion to produce in us the delusion of finite substances. As the waves do notchange or hurt the ocean, in spite of the fact big waves are destructive tosmall waves, so God, manifesting as finite imperfect waves of creation, is notaffected or changed in essence, although finite objects are perpetuallycolliding and destroying one another. After all, the evil of delusion exits onlyin the form, not in the essence of the Spirit. As long as there is Creation, solong will there be the conception of imperfection, for the formal delusion whichproduces in the infinite substance the consciousness of finite phenomena is bornof Cosmic delusion.Spirit is perceived as the only Reality, the only eternal substance existing,when one goes into deep Samadhi (oneness with Spirit) and sees the ocean ofSpirit without the waves of Creation. After attaining this realization, one isjustified in saying that there is neither subjective nor objective Satan, butonly ever-new, ever-joyous Spirit. However, as long as Creation only isperceived, one has to acknowledge the appearance of duality. God and Satan arefacts, even if the latter exists only in delusion and not in reality. If you aredreaming and you hit your dream head against a dream wall, you will have a dreampain. While dreaming, you cannot deny the resultant pain of the collision of adream head with a dream-conceived wall. In the same way, we are dreaming thedelusion of the universe and cannot say that Satan or evil, or pain, disease,and matter do not exist. One who has wakened up in Cosmic Consciousness andforgotten the dream of Cosmic Delusion may say: “Ah, nothing exists but pureeternal goodness—one Spirit”.While Jesus was striving to reach the final state of highest wisdom, theaccumulated, subjective, and objective evil, born of delusive habits ofincarnations, through memory of short-lived happiness born of contact withtemporal finite things, began to tempt him and try to dissuade him from God.Jesus did not deny this evil. He recognized it and destroyed its binding forceby the sword of wisdom, saying: “Get thee behind me, Satan,” which means: “Letdelusion be left behind my soul racing toward the Spirit”. Do not denysubjective or objective evil while you are in delusion, but watch thedestructive patterns of evil everywhere as temptation within you and asimperfection and strife in Nature.Rally your patterns of goodness in your conscience and reason, and in thepresence of God, as beauty in all nature. Strengthen your consciousness ofgoodness, and in is light drive away the darkness of evil. After successfullydoing this say: “Nothing exists but the goodness of God”.To the ordinary man, Satan appears as subjective ideas subtly luring him throughpre-natal and pos-natal bad habits. To the highly advanced, Satan takesobjective form and uses vibratory voices in his last attempt to dissuade theGodward fleeing master who tries to remain completely beyond the net of satanicdelusion.Thus it was that when Satan saw Jesus nearing complete emancipation in God, hetook an objective shape, talked to Him, and promised Him the temporal happinesswhich all his evil patterns of life could afford if Jesus would only forsakeGod. In the wilderness, when Jesus was enjoying the Divine Bliss contact of God,Satan used the wild beasts of passion, greed of possession, and so forth, tolure Him away from the complete attainment of Divine understanding.If Jesus had been God on earth, He could not have been tempted, and would nothave shown signs of mental struggle, as he did when he said: “Father, if thou bewilling, remove this cup from me: Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done”.He also said: “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”Even after His crucifixion, in the astral state, Jesus had to purify Himself ofall vestiges of delusion. That is why He said to Mary, to whom He firstappeared: “Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father.” Jesus wasfreeing Himself from all delusion, and when that was finished He attainedcomplete self-mastery and could materialize His body at will and thus appear forforty days to His disciples."},{"pageContent":"Pic4.jpg [../images/00006.jpeg]Chapter 4: Why Jesus Fasted—How Christ Consciousness Descends Into HumanConsciousness“And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by theSpirit into the wilderness, being forty days tempted of the devil. And in thosedays he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered. Andthe devil said unto him, ‘If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that bemade bread.’ And Jesus answered him, saying, ‘It is written, That man shall notlive by bread alone, but by every word of God.’”(Luke 4:1-4)The consciousness of Jesus, the man, felt the limitation of the body and beganto vibrate with the ghost-like, holy, intelligent, Cosmic vibration as heard inmeditation. This was the first attempt of the soul of Jesus to rise above Hisbodily attachment of incarnations. Jesus had been successful in transferring Hisconsciousness from the circumference of the body to the boundary of all finitecreation in the vibrating region. (See Figure X.)The whole Cosmos can be divided in halves. One portion is pervaded by thetranscendental God, the Father, who is ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-newBliss, and beyond all the categories of time, space and vibration. The otherportion is the vibratory region of space and time which contains in its sphereall the planetary universes, milky way, stars, and our little family of solarsystems. The earth is a part of the solar system, and the body of Jesus was asmall speck of the earth. Jesus, the man, had His consciousness caged in thelittle body, a speck of earth space.Jesus, the Christ Consciousness, by the expanding power of love and thespreading power of meditation, had been able to extend His consciousness to theregion of all vibratory space. This is what is meant by Jesus being full of theHoly Ghost. His consciousness was expanded fully from the region of the bodyvibration to the region of all vibration, as shown in Figure X. Jesus, the man,a speck of the earth, became Jesus, the Christ, with His consciousness pervadingall finite vibration.Omnipresent Spirit becomes buried in matter and vibration, just as the oilremains hidden in the olive, and can be released again only through love andmeditation.When the olive is squeezed, tiny drops of oil appear on its surface, so Spirittries to squeeze its way out of matter as the souls of gems, beautiful minerals,plants, men, and supermen. Spirit expresses itself as beauty, magnetic andchemical power in gems, as beauty and life in plants, as beauty, power, life,motion, and consciousness in animals, as comprehension and expanding power inman, and again returns to omnipresence in the superman. The gem expresses a part of Spirit, the plant expresses a little more. Theanimal expresses Spirit more than plant, for the animal can cover a greaterportion of space by bodily movements. Man, by his self-consciousness, cancomprehend the thoughts of other men and can project hid mind into space and tothe stars, at least by the power of imagination.The superman, by withdrawing life and energy from his body, can expand them andproject them into all space, thus actually feeling the presence of all universesand every atom of the earth in his own consciousness. In the superman the lostomnipresence of Spirit is bound in the soul by individualized Spirit. Tounderstand exactly what Jesus meant by being filled with the Holy Ghost, onemust scientifically and metaphysically explode superstition and understand thetrue significance of His statements. That is why Jesus said: “Are not twosparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them shall not fall on the groundwithout your Father. Fear ye not, therefore, ye are of more value than manysparrows.” (Matt. 10:29-31).Jesus, like the great Yogis of India, not only could foretell the actions ofpeople and the course of events from a distance through telepathic vibrations ofthought, but He also knew about all the happenings on the earth surface orwithin it, or in any portion of space, in any planet of vibratory Creation,through His omnipresent feeling. That is why Jesus foretold or felt the death ofLazarus in His own omnipresent Christ Consciousness of omnipresence.A little ant’s consciousness is limited by its little body. An elephant’sconsciousness is extended all over his big body. His consciousness is aware inall parts of his own body, so that ten people touching ten different parts ofhis body would awaken simultaneous awareness in him. Likewise, ChristConsciousness is extended to the boundaries of all vibratory regions, asrepresented in Figure X. Jesus, the man’s consciousness, was at first extendedonly to the boundaries of His body.The body of man may not be as large as that of an elephant, but hisconsciousness, unlike the elephant’s can cover the territories of stars inimagination. Christ, a Superman-God, by constantly meditation upon the finitelyomnipresent vibrating ocean sound (as taught in the Praecepta-given MeditationTechnique) or Holy Ghost vibration, felt His consciousness filled in everyparticle of space.First: Jesus, the man’s consciousness, was bound by His body occupying a littlespeck of vibratory region on the earth. Second: By meditation and feeling Cosmicvibration in every particle of vibratory space, Jesus, the man, became Jesus,the Christ. (Simply listening to the Cosmic sound will not do. ByGuru-Preceptor-given higher and higher meditation one must learn to actuallyfeel the sound in plants and stars or in any portion of space at will.) In theHoly Ghost state the consciousness of Jesus had expanded from the body to allvibratory regions.This Holy Ghost state is the second state of high metaphysical development. ThisHoly Ghost state can be attained externally by extending the feeling of love toone’s family, society, nation, all nations, all creatures, and internally byexpanding consciousness through semi-subconsciousness, soul consciousness,semi-superconsciousness, semi-Christ Consciousness to Christ Consciousnesspresent in all vibratory regions.A Christ-like person must love all living creatures and actually feel Hispresence in every portion of earth of vibratory space semi-universally at thesame time. He does not need to concentrate in order to know anything. He alreadyknows all things because he feels all finite creation, stars, and all specks ofspace, as the living cells of his own body.Once Lahiri Mahasaya, my Preceptor’s Guru, was teaching the Hindu Bible, orBhagavad Gita, to a group of his students in Benares, India, and was talking ofKutastha Chaitanya, or his Christ Consciousness in all finite vibratorycreation, when suddenly he gasped and cried out: “I am drowning in the bodies ofmany souls off the coast of Japan”. Later the disciples read in the newspapersthat a shipload of people were drowning near the coast of Japan at exactly thetime when Lahiri Mahasaya felt and saw the shipwreck in his omnipresence.So it was with Jesus. By extending His consciousness through the differentstates of consciousness, He had arrived at this second Holy Ghost state.At this time, after Jesus, the man, became Jesus, the Christ, he had to gothrough a metaphysical and psychological test before He could reach the thirdand last state of extending His consciousness to the Spirit of God, the Father’svibrationless region, as shown in Figure X.The devil, or conscious Cosmic metaphysical Satan, through Cosmic delusion andpsychological temptations, began to tempt the Christ Consciousness of Jesus byreminding Him of the limited needs of the body, so that instead of living by Hisnewly-found Cosmic energy, He might become mortal again by misusing His Divinepowers in changing atoms of stone to atoms of bread.Before Jesus attained the third and final state, in which He could beholdHimself as the transcendental, vibrationless God, the Father, and the ChristConsciousness in vibratory space, he was led by the ultimate Spirit in thesilence of the wilderness to be tested, to see if Christ Consciousness had risenabove all mortal memories of food and other small material temptations of thepowers of miracles.Miracles are held in esteem by earth-bound mortals, but they should not be lovedor used by a superman to test the attention and love of God to the devotee. Totest the love of God by invoking His miracles is to disturb the faith in Him andHis all-protecting power. That is why Jesus refused to convert the stones intobread, even though His body was hungry from the delusive human standpoint. Also,that is why He refused to be tempted by Cosmic Satan into jumping from themountain top to show whether the angels would hold Him or not.The Christ Consciousness of Jesus found an adequate test in the temptations bornof the memories of past mortal habits, and in the test of “living by breadalone,” and so forth, which was instigated through the Cosmic delusion of themetaphysical Satan.Whether one believes in Cosmic Satan or not, it can be easily understood thatthe Spirit, before giving the final transcendental, Cosmic Consciousness of God,the Father, to Jesus, wanted to see if His newly-acquired Christ-Consciousnesscould rise above the temptations born of the memory of mortal habits.Jesus, in lifting Himself from the Holy Ghost state of feeling all Cosmicvibration and its universal Christ Consciousness, found a matter-ward pull ofCosmic delusion which began to remind Him of confining, limiting, human habitsof incarnations.Jesus successfully stood the test by saying: “I have found the new source ofliving by God, the Father, as the fountain of all life, and not by physicalbread.” In doing this, Jesus teaches mankind one of the greatest methods ofactually knowing that the body live principally by God and secondarily by bread.Jesus said that the body does not live by the little condensed solidified energyof bread alone, but by the word of the unlimited vibrating Cosmic Energy of God."},{"pageContent":"FASTING AND MEDITATIONDeep meditation is possible only when all bodily functions are stilled. This isone reason why fasting is helpful in attaining a state of quiet and freedom frombody consciousness. People who eat too much and never fast, keep the Life Forcein their bodies busy burning carbon and cleansing venous blood, and they thusoverwork the heart and keep the five-sense telephones forever active.When a long meditation of several days is desired, a fruit diet is to berecommended because it contains less carbon than ordinary varied diet. It alsosatisfies the bodily bad habit of continuous eating and is better for mostpeople than complete fasting. Such partial fasting by a group of a people,accompanied by long meditation, can give a tremendous spiritual experience. Thisexperiment should be undertaken only under the strict guidance of a wisepreceptor or guru.Meditation is the method of connecting the Life Force with Cosmic Energy, andthis can be accomplished only when all bodily functions are slowed up.Therefore, meditating when the stomach is full defeats the very purpose forwhich one meditates. With a full stomach, the heart, nervous system, and thefive-sense telephones are all busy digesting food, burning carbon, and keepingup the circulation in the body. This keeps the subconscious mind restless, andthus prevents it from becoming one-pointed and concentrated on God.On the other hand, to meditate when the stomach is empty is a good practicebecause the energy which runs the nervous system is not then busy with thebodily functions. When the body, lungs, and diaphragm are still, the heart iscalm. When the heart is calm, the current is switched off from the five-sensetelephones.Therefore, fasting in connection with meditation means the slowing up ofactivity in the muscles, heart, circulation, diaphragm, and lungs by denyingcarbon and chemicals to the blood. Hence, fasting helps to draw the attentionaway from the body and its functions, and metaphysically it helps to open up theinner source of Cosmic Consciousness and Cosmic Energy by which the body reallylives.Jesus said: “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word thatproceedeth out of the mouth of God.” Man’s body battery is not sustained bysunshine, oxygen, and food alone, but by the word or vibrating current of CosmicEnergy which, by radio-active force descends into the body and human willthrough the medulla, or “mouth of God”. Not to use the will, as some peopleteach, is to shut off all Divine currents from the body.Man can be like a dry battery. He can live more and more by condensing CosmicEnergy into flesh instead of always receiving chemical atomic energy from food.In a book called “Amanzil,” about Theresa Neumann, [Notes: Theresa Neumann diedSeptember 18, 1962.] the peasant girl of Konnersreuth, Bavaria taken from anaddress by Rt. Rev. Joseph Schrembs, D.D., Bishop of Cleveland, delivered Feb.12, 1928, and reprinted from the Catholic Universe Bulletin, Cleveland, Ohio,(eleventh edition) we find striking facts about Theresa Neumann’s life relativeto living by Divine Energy.(1) “She possesses the wounds of the Crucified Savior. The wounds remain alwaysthe same. They neither fester nor heal.” (2) “She goes through the Passion ofour Lord each Friday.” (3) “She repeats the Aramaic words spoken by Christ.” (4)“She divines the innermost secrets of the heart.” (5) “She takes neither foodnor drink. Has eaten no solid food since 1923, except water or a little fruitjuice.”“But on Christmas Day of the year 1926 she ceased entirely taking any food orany drink, so that almost for two years now, this girl has neither eaten nordrunk anything except to receive Holy Communion every morning. Now, it may bethat you will say, ‘Perhaps she takes food on the sly. Perhaps this is alldeception.’ No. It is guaranteed. It is absolutely certified. The EpiscopalGovernment of the city of Ratibon sent four hospital sisters who were placedunder oath to watch her night and day. These sisters changed off in pairs andnever left her presence. They stayed for fifteen days and deposed under oaththat entire time not a drop of water or any liquid substance or a morsel of foodpassed her lips. And the verdict of all the doctors from the University ofBerlin, from Prague, from Frankfurt, from Munich—doctors without any faith—wasthis: ‘Deception and fraud are absolutely out of the question in the case ofTheresa Neumann.’ She is not emaciated, despite lack of food since Christmas,1926, and is as healthy looking as anyone around you. On Fridays she loses abouteight pounds. Six hours after the vision of the Passion is over, she is againback to her normal weight of one hundred and ten pounds.”The greatest of all things in Theresa Neumann’s life was that she actuallydemonstrated what Jesus said: “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by everyword that proceedeth out of mouth of God,” and she did not become emaciated byfasting. To live by eating food is not a sin, but to live and think only of thephysical means of sustaining life is to live in delusion. We must know that itis the power of God that digests food and changes it into blood and nourishment.It is God alone who sustains life. Theresa Neumann showed that her Divine Willcould replace the decayed bodily tissues by materializing electrons of energyinto flesh.Many Hindu saints have demonstrated that life is possible without oxygen orfood. Sadhu Haridas of India conducted an experiment under the observation ofmedical men and was buried several feet beneath the surface of the earth forforty days in the courtyard of a well-guarded palace, and came back to life eventhough he was pronounced dead.These extreme examples are cited, not in order to make you aspire to becomeanother Haridas or Theresa Neumann, but simply to show that if such greatcontrol of the physical Being is possible, it is also possible for a personliving a normal life to so spiritualize his body that he can be free fromphysical suffering, and that he can actually know through experience that DivinePower is the real source of his life.Of course, long fasting, that is, more than three days, is not necessary inorder to demonstrate that you really live by Divine Power. You can alsospiritualize the body, or make it live on this higher plane, by right eating atall times. The proper diet should be chosen and care should be taken never toovereat.When fasting, mental resistance and fear of losing weight should be put upon thespiritual purpose for which the fast is undertaken. During this time, you mustfeel alive with Cosmic Consciousness and the newly-awakened Life Energy.Jesus discovered this new source of energy through fasting and meditation. Healso found that He had conquered the race-habit and the race-idea of thenecessity of living by physical food alone. The Cosmic Delusive Force has ledman to believe that he would die without physical food and the bodyconsciousness. Jesus refused to convert the stone into bread because He knewthat He lived by the power of the changeless Infinite Energy and not alone bythe limited relative energy derived from physical food.During fasting, you should say to yourself and actually realize: “I am learningto live by the power of God and not by physical means only.” Everyone shouldtest out this truth in his or her own life by fasting and meditation, and becomeaware of God Consciousness and Cosmic Energy.However, be sure to remember that long fasting should never be undertakenwithout the guidance and direction of a competent preceptor. It is good at alltimes, however, to fast one day a week, to choose the proper diet, to eat littleat night, and to meditate regularly every day."},{"pageContent":"REINCARNATIONSatan saw that the Divine plan was for all finite creation, after a perfectexistence, to go back to God, and knew that with the disappearance of all finitecreation, his kingdom would be gone, so he determined to use his God-given powerto create imperfect independent desires in finite creatures in order to makethem come back to earth again and again through reincarnation.Satan created the consciousness of death through accident or fear, and thusstarted a desire in human beings for a perfect life on earth. This desire causedsouls to reincarnate again and again in their vain hope of finding a perfectexistence on earth, which can only be found in God.God is almighty. He could destroy Satan, but if He used His physical miraculousforce, He would subjugate Satan, but would not convince his immortalintelligence of his evil ways, so God is using love to convert Satan. As Satanis trying to keep human beings deluded by greed, anger, fear, desire,attachment, and delusion, so God is using the psychological counterparts ofunselfishness, calmness, courage, satisfaction, unattached Divine Love, andwisdom, to bring man to His Divine Kingdom.There was no evil in God. Satan precipitated evil by the misuse of his God-givenfree choice and his power of creating finite things. God might have anticipatedthe origin of evil in Satan through His omniscience, yet He organized thisCosmic Play in order to enjoy Himself through His many selves, and because Heknew that, ultimately, His goodness would bring all things back unto Him. AfterGod gave independent power to Satan, who had been an archangel, to createperfect finite things, Satan misused his independence, as a rebellious generalsometimes turns against his king. Ever since then Satan has created an uglycounterpart for every beautiful creation of God, in man’s body, mind, and soul,and in Nature. God created a beautiful body to be charged by Cosmic Energy andto live in a free, unconditioned, Divine state, but Satan created hunger and thelure of the senses. For mental power, Satan substituted mental temptation; forsouls wisdom, Satan invented delusive ignorance; for beautiful Nature, Satansubstituted ugly warfare, disease, germs, earthquakes, cataclysms, floods, andother disasters.￼Pic5.jpg [../images/00007.jpeg]If there were no individual and industrial greed, selfishness, sex temptation,nor false ambitions, this earth would be free from physical and moral crimes andwar. By these misfortunes, Satan is systematically fighting God’s perfect plansof unselfishness, international cooperation, self-control, and true ambition,which includes the happiness of other people in one’s own happiness,brotherhood, and so on."},{"pageContent":"LIVING BY GOD-POWERWhy must God’s children be hungry? The soul, identified with theSatan-desecrated human body, feels hunger, and in turning to the earth-productsfor nourishment, remains earth-bound. Thus the soul forgets that it can livelike God by God’s Cosmic Energy.Jesus, as he contacted God, found that hunger is a delusion connected with thelaw of change in the body, and can be overcome gradually until one can liveentirely by God’s energy. Man should behold the soul as above hunger and thedesire for food, for as long as the soul feels dependent upon food, it isearth-bound, and so long must it come back again and again to satisfy this fleshdesire. This does not mean that the spiritual aspirant should stop eating, butit does mean that he should joyously eat to maintain the temple of God (thebody) and not eat just to satisfy sense craving.Even when Jesus said that stones could be made into bread by changing their rateof electronic vibration, he realized that it would be foolish to remember andencourage his mortal habits when tempted by Satan, since he knew that he wasimmortal and could live by God-power. Stones can be changed into bread when manunderstands how Divine Intelligence controls atoms and electrons. God’sintelligence has divided vibrations into solids, liquids, and gases, and isholding them in balance by mind, thermal, and electrical laws.Man must understand how his intelligence controls the atoms of his body. When helearns that, he will find that his intelligence is a reflection of DivineIntelligence, which supports the life of his body. When he understands that, heknows that his body is not maintained by the physical law of bread only, butthat it is sustained principally by God’s Cosmic Energy. So Jesus controlled hismortal enemy of hunger by His Divine Memory of unconditioned spiritualexistence, which is self-sustaining.The Cosmic Satan, through past mortal memory, asked Jesus to use his Divinepower over atoms to change stones into bread. Satan wanted Jesus to forget hisnewly remembered Divine state of unconditioned existence. So Satan workedthrough the mind of Jesus, and said: “Why don’t you use your Divine power tochange stones into bread?” If Jesus had done that, he would have misused hisDivine power, and also would have again catered to the Satanic psychology ofphysical hunger, instead of living by Cosmic Energy.If Jesus had converted stones into bread, he would have had to depend again onbread for life. Of course, Jesus humanly ate bread even after this experience,but he did it as a God-man, and not as a deluded human being, subject tophysical hunger. Great souls, who attain the highest, do not use theirmiraculous power for themselves, but live in the common human way so that theymay attract people to God by the higher miracles of love and devotion, and notby ostentatious physical miracles.By not yielding to Satan’s temptation to turns stones into bread, Jesusconquered, and from then on it was at His option to live with or without food.Jesus found that a Son of God should not test God, for that is to doubt Him.God’s power should not be used to satisfy the challenge of unbelievers, unlessso commanded by God Himself. For those who see the miracles of God, there isnothing left to disbelieve. It is those who believe in God’s power withoutseeing, who deserve to behold the miracles of God.So Jesus answered within himself with a great vibratory force of thought, to themetaphysical Satan, who was tempting Him to transgress God’s laws. The word“said” signifies vibrating thought, and not speaking voice. Jesus quoted thescriptural truth, not theoretically, as so many theologians do, but after hisown experience of finding the mystery and origin of life through a forty-dayfast and by an intense inner meditative preparation. Man does not need to dependupon bread, or solids, liquids, and gases only sustaining life, but upon thevibrating Cosmic Energy proceeding from the medulla (Mouth of God) into thehuman system.Evil on earth was not all created by man’s wrong actions (evil Karma),accumulated during many incarnations. Evil existed from the time the CosmicSatanic force first misused the Cosmic Energy to create imperfect things andbeings. Even when Adam and Eve were created, Satan foresaw that if they remainedperfect on earth and were dematerialized and draw back into God, there would benothing left for him to do and he would lose his power, so even in that earlyperiod, Satan has already turned against God and had created such patterns ofimperfection as physical temptation to make Adam and Eve transgress the perfectlaws and become earth-bound through the creation of imperfect desires.Adam and Eve, by yielding to Satan’s temptation of physical procreation, lostthe power of immaculate creation by which they materialized their tendencies andenergy into Divine Children, even as God had especially created them out of theether. All creation is special in the beginning and physical creation issecondary, for male and female must first exist before physical creation ispossible.From then on, the law of reincarnation became effective for the outworking ofhuman desires on the earth plane by rebirth. Satan created this law because hewanted souls to be bound to the earth by earthly desires.Reincarnation originated principally from Satan trying to immortalize changeableflesh in order to keep creatures under his subjugation. Satan found, however,that flesh was subject to the law of change, which included the change of thestate called death.Souls, being immortal, could not go back to God, with the imperfect desiresengendered on earth by Satan, so they had to return to earth, throughreincarnation, to work out their material desires. In a way, Satan is helplesslyacting as the tool of God in ultimately freeing souls from body and earthattachment. Reincarnation assures freedom, for it gives immortal souls time towork out their past desires. In that way Satan is deceived into thinking thatsoulswill remain earth-bound forever, whereas, at the expiration of theincarnation of desires, they will be liberated.When a soul incarnates to work out its desires of past incarnations, Satan,fearing the freedom of that individual at the end of the working out of thosedesires, creates new desires in this incarnation by ingenious temptations sothat the soul may keep on reincarnating by weaving fresh nets of desires.Reincarnation, forced by earthly desires, is painful and wrought with suffering,and is the tool of Satan to keep souls earth-bound and miserable.Death was to have been a conscious, happy transition from the changeful body tothe changeless God. This was God’s idea of death. Satan created the painful,dreadful, unconscious phenomena of death. To desire lasting happiness in thebody causes unconsciousness and pain at the time of death. Satan made soulsthink death was a parting from the beautiful earth, and as such, that theyshould grieve and desire to come back. Souls fail to see, due to Satan’sdelusion, that death was to be a godly event, a promotion, a liberation from thetoil weary, imperfect earth life, to the perfect, everlasting freedom in God."},{"pageContent":"MAN’S RELATION TO EVILMan may be accused of misusing his reason, and, by creating inharmony with God’slaws, of giving birth to evil. However, we find that evil had already beencreated to delude man, and influence his free choice against God’s suggestionsthrough His patterns of good. Greed, revengefulness, and sense temptation, wereall created to tempt man to miserable, evil ways, by forsaking God’s pattern ofunselfishness, forgiveness, self-control, and so on. Man cannot be heldresponsible for being tempted, for even in his own body Satan created theterrible physical temptation, constantly urging him to morally transgress. Manis responsible, however, for not using his reason and will power to conquer hissenses, and know God’s laws of happiness in self-control, and in transmutingLife Force into the creation of children of wisdom, or, with utmostself-control, in the creation of spiritual physical children.Man did not create physical temptation, or death-dealing bacteria, orearthquakes, or cataclysms, or floods. Satan created them as counteractingimperfect patterns, to destroy the perfect patterns of God, of creation by will,and of helpful bacteria of a solid, peaceful earth, free from earthquakes,cataclysms, and floods. God wanted man, after a perfect existence on earth, togo back to His immortal home of peace.Satan was the result of the desire of God to divide His Sea of Oneness intowaves of finite creation, by the storm of vibration, which resulted in the wavesof manifestation and in the law of relativity. This power, coming from God,became independent and endowed with free choice. Later, Satan, who embodies thispower, beheld finite things, after a perfect existence, dissolving back intoGod, and feared the loss of his existence at the end of the creation of finitemanifestation, so he rebelled against God and started to misuse his free choiceby using God’s Cosmic Energy to create patterns of imperfection.Satan was at first an Archangel of God and used Cosmic Energy to create perfectfinite things, with astral lights turned inward on God. Later, Satan becamelightning falling from heaven, because he caused Cosmic Energy to be turned awayfrom God, and kept it busy creating on the earth plane, revealing finite lightslike the sun and the moon, and the lightning which shows only finite things.Satan keeps man sense-bound, and does not allow him to reverse the search-lightsof his senses Godward and behold His glory and His wonders in the Astral Cosmos,where all things are indescribably beautiful.The battery of man’s wisdom, intelligence, life, and body shall not live (besustained) by bread (outer material, solids, liquids, and so forth) alone, butby every word (unit of intelligent living vibration) that proceedeth out of themouth of God. The Cosmic Energy or Life Energy, as it proceedeth out of medulla,through which mouth or opening, God breathes His breath of life (Cosmic Energy)into the soul, mind, and body battery of man.The batteries of man’s wisdom, intelligence, life, and body, in all futurity,will not be kept alive by the outer agency of solids, liquids, gases, or byphysical food only, but by the inner source of wisdom, power, and Life Energy,which recharge the soul, mind, and body batteries of man. It is foolish to thinkthat bread alone sustains man. Man lives by wisdom, power, and energy, all ofwhich come from God, through the finite opening of the medulla.The above is one of the greatest truths which Jesus ever revealed, namely, thatfuture generations would learn to live by Wisdom and Cosmic Energy and not byfood only. The ordinary animal-man thinks that his entire life depends uponsteak, oxygen, water, and sunshine. He forgets that the body is like a battery,which cannot work with distilled water only when its electricity runs out. Thedeath battery can live only when it is sent to a battery shop and recharged withelectric current. Likewise, oxygen, inflated into the lungs of a dead man, andfood stuffed into his stomach, and his body exposed to sunshine, will not bringback life.It is the Life Force, coming down from the medulla, and distributed throughoutthe cells, which changes food into energy. This energy, derived from food,reinforces the energy existing in the body. In this way the inner life energy isself-contained, and alone can support the body. Still, through generations ofbad habits, it feels its complete dependencePic6.jpg [../images/00008.jpeg]upon food, and refuses to function without it. Just as extreme opium addicts diewithout opium, so, to the food addict, the Life Force refuses to stay in thebody without food. The Life Force, constantly depending upon physical food,forgets its original continuous supply of Cosmic Energy.The time comes in the life of every individual when, no matter what food heeats, or how many breathing exercises or sun baths he takes, he says: “No matterwhat I do, my health is failing”. This shows that outside agencies, whichsupport the body, are only indirect causes of energy, and are dependent upon theLife Force, which is the direct source of life.In suspended animation, Sadhu Haridas was buried several feet below the earthfor forty days and lived without food, oxygen, or sunshine. When he was broughtout, he was pronounced dead, and yet, to the amazement of his attendant Englishand French physicians, he came back to life.Of course, the Yogis, know how to withdraw their consciousness into the spineand connect it with Cosmic Consciousness, and thus keep all the subconsciousthoughts recharged and active in the dream state of the soul. Without thisinternal activity of consciousness, the body cells would decay. In suspendedanimation the Cosmic Consciousness works through the subconscious mind and showsto the body cells their complete dependence upon the Divine CosmicConsciousness. Just as ships can be controlled by a distant radio, so the CosmicConsciousness of God keeps all thoughts, and cells alive in the body bycontinually sending energy to them.During the suspended state of the body, unless the cell and thought radios aretuned in with Cosmic Consciousness, or with the superconsciously-chargedsubconscious, the cells and bodily functions will be destroyed because of thelack of a controlling intelligence. Human conscious intelligence, charged withGod Consciousness, is the supreme sustainer of the body. Without that, no humanbody can live; so, in the suspended states of the body, thesuperconsciously-charged subconsciousness withdraws the Life Force from theorgans and unites it with Cosmic Energy to electrify all the body cells andconvert them into dry batteries. When the cells are electrified with thissuper-current, they cease to grow or to decay. This is what is meant by“suspended animation”. The Life Force and human consciousness cease theiroutward activity with the material world, and temporarily suspend their slaveryto oxygen, food, and sunshine, and learn to depend wholly upon the true bodysupporters, Cosmic Consciousness and Cosmic Energy. The Yogis suspend theactivity of change in the muscles, blood, nerve force, and all tissues, andsupport the body by the changeless power of Cosmic Consciousness and CosmicEnergy.The body, being a cluster of atomic, cellular, circulatory, muscular, astral,electrical motions, depends usually upon such motion for its existence, but whenthe animation is suspended in the right way, the body is charged by the CosmicSource. If you gently touch the spring of a fine watch, it will stop, and whenyou shake the watch, it will run again. In the same way, when the heart isstopped, by stilling the activity of thoughts, the animation of the body issuspended.While buried, the cold earth acts like a refrigerator, preserving the body fromthe work of heat. Besides, the inner Life Force creates a sort of coolness inall the cells, which serves to preserve them by direct current from CosmicConsciousness and Cosmic Energy. In this state, the cells temporarily forgettheir bad habit as food addicts, and live by the Word, or the vibration ofCosmic Consciousness and Energy.To return to activity, the Yogi takes his will and consciousness into the spineand brain. Then he puts in the switch of the will, and the thoughts begin tostir. With the connecting of the switches of the thoughts, the Life Force beginsto bring animation into the body again.Besides the above, it is a known fact each gram of flesh in the human body hasenough energy in the electro-protonic center to run the electrical supply of thecity of Chicago for two days. The Life Force in the ordinary human body usuallyderives power from the chemical energy in food. It does not know how to live onthe electro-energy stored in the protonic center in food atoms. In the state ofsuspended animation, some Yogis, instead of drawing on Cosmic Energy bydisintegrating atoms through the power of will, release the electro-protonicheat to keep the body cells electrified like billions of dry batteries.Pic7.jpg [../images/00009.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"RECHARGING THE BODY, MIND, AND SOUL BATTERIESGood electricity is extremely necessary in maintaining a battery. In the sameway, the body battery needs to be inwardly charged with good thoughts, wisdom,and Cosmic Energy. Dietetics is not delusion. Distilled water (and not any kindof water) is necessary for the life of the battery; also, good food, pure oxygenthrough proper breathing, sunshine, and less carbon-forming foods are necessaryfor the proper upkeep of this body battery. The body is a battery withinbatteries.The body battery is charged outwardly by good food, chemicals, and so forth, andinwardly by pure mind, pure soul, Cosmic Consciousness, and Life Energy. Thebody battery is contained in the mind and soul batteries.The mind battery is charged by Life Energy, bodily chemicals from the outside,and inwardly it is charged by super-consciousness of the soul. A weak,dilapidated body weakens the mind, but a healthy body does not always mean aremarkable mind, unless it is charged with superconsciousness of the soul.Likewise, the soul battery is charged with a good mind, good Life Energy, andgood chemical energy of the body from the outside, and inwardly the soul ischarged by Cosmic Consciousness through the channel of the superconscious.In other words, remember that the more you daily meditate deeply, and feel yourjoy increasing, the more your soul battery will be recharged with daily wisdompoured out from God. The more one meditates, keeps in the company of Saints andintelligent, mentally-powerful people, reads good books, introspects, doescreative work in art, science, literature, and business, the more one feelsmentally powerful.Then, last of all, it must be remembered that, since the soul has descended intomatter from Spirit, and made the imperfect body its playground, all theperfection of Spirit and soul and mind must be centered in the body in order toenable the flesh-entangled soul to remember its vastness in Spirit.A diseased body discourages the soul, due to the latter identifying itself withthe former. A strong soul, which finds its joy in meditation, on the order hand,can influence a disease-stricken body to manifest healing and perfection.The soul’s battle for immortality, diseaselessness, and ever-lasting happiness,must be won and established in the body, at least from the mental standpoint,before the soul can disentangle its attachment from the mortal, imperfectcondition of the body. A spiritual man, unless highly advanced, eating foodinjudiciously, would find the body standing in the way of spiritual realization.Also, a food fanatic will find the thought of the body hindering spiritualrealization.Eat the right food and then forget that you live by food. Think that you arealways living by Cosmic Consciousness, which changes the food into energy. Youmust realize that food alone cannot support the body, whereas, in the state ofsuspended animation, the body can be sustained by the consciousness andsubconsciousness in the brain and spine. No one can live without the innerintelligence of subconsciousness drawing energy from the protonic center ofcells, or Cosmic Energy. When consciousness departs from the spine and brain inthe suspended or dead body, death is instantaneous, and decay starts.In the case of Theresa Neumann, we find one of God’s many miracles. She wasslightly active, breathed, enjoyed sunshine, had her heart and circulatorysystem working, but she did not live by bread, water, and so forth. This wasmost unique. She demonstrated in this age the teaching of Jesus, namely, thatthe body does not have to live by bread alone, but that it can live by thevibrating energy of God, sent through the sunshine, oxygen, and the Life Forceinto the body. Of course, very few persons in the world have lived by sunshineand oxygen only. Saint Theresa Neumann lived by her will, drawing Cosmic Energy,and by the Cosmic Consciousness of Christ.Saint Theresa Neumann was sent by God to demonstrate that the future food of manwill come through oxygen, sunshine, and etheric energy. To use oxygen andsunshine only, along with Cosmic Energy on one hand, is wonderful, for the decayof the bodily tissues is rebuilt by food from oxygen, sunshine, and CosmicEnergy. On the other hand, Theresa Neumann apparently had to depend a littleupon mortal breath and sunshine. Yogis of India, in the suspended state, liveonly by Cosmic Energy and to not depend upon oxygen and sunshine.The suspended state is not the highest state, however. When a Yogi can at willremain conscious and active without breath and sunshine, and can live, then heis known to make the body live by God, and the Word of God (Cosmic Energy)alone. Yogis who can do this are much higher than those who remain in thesuspended state only. Saint Theresa Neumann’s state was a higher state than theYogi’s (who remains subconsciously alive only in suspended animation), in thatshe consciously lived without eating and was active and breathing. There is aneven higher state than this.Some Yogis live consciously only through God and Cosmic Consciousness (Word ofGod). Jesus could do this. He ate only to be human. By the manifestation ofCosmic Consciousness during His forty days of fasting, He attained this.Therefore, He said: “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word thatproceedeth out of the mouth of God.” Yogis, after attaining the above state, maynot eat at all, or they may eat to remain human, and thus help out his drama oflife.The spiritual aspirant, however, must eat rightly. He should eat less carbonizedfood, and every little in the morning and evening, the times of meditation. Mostkinds of meat and heavy food keep the Life Force busy working in the vitalorgans burning carbon, and therefore it is difficult to disengage the activeLife Force from the senses and vital organs, and to reverse the current andattention toward God without retarding digestion and receiving opposition fromthe vital organs.Meditation, after heavy meals, in the early stages, sets up a tug of war betweenthe body consciousness and superconsciousness. That is why fruits, containingless carbon, are better than most heavy meats, like pork and beef, since fruits,having less carbon to burn, do not use much Life Force, and do not tax thenervous system, vital organs, kidneys, and so on. The heavy meat eater will findthe mind pulled down to the region of the senses during meditation. In themorning eat fruits, at noon eat a good meal (whatever you want), at nightfruits, milk, and cooked vegetables.Fast once a week on orange juice and meditate. Fast three days consecutively onorange juice every month or every forty-five days, and meditate long and deeply(two or three hours): This will not only give rest to the body and eliminatepoisons, but it will teach you how to live more by Cosmic Consciousness and lessby food. Concentrate during fasting. Don’t mentally miss food or dwell on food.Rather feel that you are being charged by Cosmic Consciousness and CosmicEnergy, and are learning that your life depends entirely upon it, and that youare getting out of the habit of depending too much upon food."},{"pageContent":"PSYCHOLOGICAL SATAN OF IGNORANCE“Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacleof the temple, And saith unto him, ‘If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself downfrom hence; for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee,to keep thee: And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thoudash thy foot against a stone.’ And Jesus answering, said unto him,“‘It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.’“Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and sheweth himall the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, in a moment of time. Andthe devil said unto him, ‘All this power will I give Thee and the glory of them:for it is delivered unto me: and to whomsoever will I give it. If you thereforewill fall down and worship me, all shall be thine.’ And Jesus answered and saidunto him,“‘Get thee behind me Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thyGod and him only shalt thou serve.’“And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for aseason. And, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.”(Matthew 4:5-11; Luke 4:5-13)[Notes: From time to time, the Preceptor combines verses of Scripture to give amore complete word picture of the Sayings of Jesus Christ.]There are two meanings to the above message. The Cosmic Intelligent Force, whichturned away from God, threw Its searchlight of consciousness upon matter toextol it and to tempt man with its tinsel glory. Any man who turns hisconsciousness externally upon matter automatically finds his vision matter-boundalong with Satan’s vision. To be a slave to the senses is to use the soul’ssearchlight of attention for worshiping the glory of changing, temporary,pleasure-yielding matter. To reverse the searchlight of attention upon the soulis to behold and enjoy the changeless, everlasting, joy-giving Spirit.The first meaning is that the Psychological Satan of Ignorance took hold of themind of Jesus while He was on the very height of the Temple of Meditation,situated in the Holy City of His Universal Christ Consciousness. This means thatthe mind of Jesus, although it had reached the pinnacle of meditative intuitionin His Christ state of consciousness, was still subject to the temptation ofignorant delusion. His past delusive habit of yielding to temptation, findingconstant defeat in the sacred consciousness of Jesus, was making a last effortto dislodge His Divine habit of right thinking and claim Him as its own. Thememory of His past delusive habit cast a tempting thought in His mind, and Hewas led to think: “Since I have regained my lost high state of Divine Sonhood bydeep meditation, it is safe for me to cast myself down into temptation becauseGod will protect me through my guardian-angels of spiritual conviction,intuitive experiences, and meditation-born wisdom. Even if I fall intotemptation, the angels of spiritual thoughts will lift me up again to my highestate of consciousness and will prevent my strong foot of will power fromdashing against the stone of misery-making spiritual error.”The better spiritual habit conquered, and Jesus replied by thought to temptationwithin Himself. The highest wisdom, as written in the great Scriptures, says:“Attention must not stray from God, the Father, the Creator of all forms ofconsciousness, but that consciousness must remain identified with andconcentrated upon God. It must not separate itself from Him and try to drag Himmatter-ward.”All craving and desire in man should be transmuted and turned toward God,instead of allowing it to try to delude the God in man. Temptation is adelusive, compelling, conflicting, joy-expecting thought which should be used topursue happiness-making truth and not misery-producing error. Although God isthe creator of consciousness, still the vitiated consciousness in man turns awayfrom Him and tries to lure the soul to concentrate upon the temporary joy of thesenses. When Jesus found this, He snubbed His temptation, and told it not to beaudacious enough to tempt the God in Him.Again, the psychological temptation followed Jesus to His very highmountain-like state of Self-Realization, and in a quick mental vision showed Himall the power and temporary glory that material possessions could give Him, andthus lured Him with the thought: “I will give you all this power and wealth”.Further, His psychological delusive habit made Him feel that it had completepower over all temporarily-glorified material things, and that it had power togive Him enjoyment of material objects if only He would fall from His high stateof self-control and happiness in Spirit, down to the plane of sense enjoyment.A superman, even though he is fixed in a high state of consciousness by deepmeditation, he is still subject to the temptations of his past pre-natal andpost-natal memories of sense enjoyments, which promise all kinds of quicklyobtainable pleasures in place of the hard-earned, lasting joy of self-controland meditation.Jesus answered within Himself: “Oh, ye senses of smell, taste, and touch, youwere made to be devoted to the everlasting joy of Spirit, and to constantly actand serve in such a way that the joy of Spirit would become a permanent habit ofthe soul.”The sense of taste was not given to create greed and indigestion by overeating,but to joyously select the right food in order to help build the Temple of God.To eat only for the pleasure of taste, produces greed, slavery, indigestion, anddeath. To eat for the maintenance of the soul’s body temple, producesself-control, long life, health, and happiness.“My senses were given to serve me,” thought Jesus, “and were not made for me tocater to their insatiable appetite.” As a man cannot satisfy his hunger byfeeding someone else, so also the soul cannot be happy by catering to theunnatural appetite of the senses.When the Psychological Delusive Habit had finished tempting Jesus with memoriesof pre-natal and post-natal material habits, the delusion of mortal habitdeparted, for a time at least, giving rise to the feeling of victory for thegood habit. The departing of Satan for a season signifies the transcendentalstate of fixed self-control, when the devotee rises above the state of strugglewith evil.As soon as the mortal delusive habit disappeared, the angels of Intuition,Calmness, Omniscience, and Self-Realization appeared in the consciousness ofJesus to serve Him with lasting joy and happiness."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 5: Jesus, the Lamb of God and John, the Baptist—Spirit And Flesh“This is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites fromJerusalem to ask him, ‘Who art thou?’ And he confessed, and denied not; butconfessed, ‘I am not the Christ.’”“And they asked him, ‘What then? Art thou Elias?’ And he saith, ‘I am not.’ ‘Artthou that prophet?’ And he answered, ‘No.’ Then said they unto him, ‘Who artthou, that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou ofthyself?’ He said, ‘I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Makestraight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.’“And they which were sent were of the Pharisees. And they asked him, and saidunto him, ‘Why baptized thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias,neither that prophet?’ John answered them, saying, ‘I baptize with water: butthere standeth one among you, whom ye know not; He it is, who coming after me ispreferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.’ Thesethings were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.“And John bare record, saying, ‘I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like adove, and it abode upon him. And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptizewith water, the same said unto me, “Upon whom thou shalt see the Spiritdescending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the HolyGhost.” And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.’“Again, the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; And lookingupon Jesus as he walked, he saith, ‘Behold the Lamb of God!’ And the twodisciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. Then Jesus turned and sawthem following, and saith unto them; “What seek ye?”(John 1:19-28; 32-38)The Priests and Levites, with only ordinary spiritual perceptions, werenaturally skeptical about the qualities of a Christ. Wise men, meeting aChrist-like man, would not ask him if he were Christ, because the wise by theirown wisdom, can recognize the qualities of a Christ-like man. It was theignorant priests who asked John if he were the expected Christ.Human consciousness is circumscribed by the circumference of the body, butChrist Consciousness is unlimited, stretched over the entire tract of Eternity.Many people ignorantly worship the body of Jesus, and forget to recognize theconsciousness of the Christ which could encompass the entire Cosmos with all theisland universes, just as a cup can take up all the soup in a vessel.John, being a good saint, in spite of his greatness, could not see that he hadexpressed Christ Consciousness in his consciousness. If souls can be made in theimage of transcendental God, the Father, they are automatically also made afterthe pattern of the Christ Consciousness present in all Creation. My contentionis that everyone is a potential Christ, and all those who can make theirconcentration deep enough and broad enough can receive Christ within their ownconsciousness. John was a potential Christ, still, due to his identificationwith ignorance, he could not feel that in essence he had reached the state ofChrist Consciousness. Therefore, John spoke the truth and confessed that thepotential Christ in him had not yet manifested in his outward humanconsciousness. That is why John confessed: “I am not the Christ.”John also denied that he was Elias, because (as told before) he could notremember his previous incarnation as Elias. John, as Elias, was the Guru(preceptor) of Jesus. Teachers are many, but there can be but one Guru. He isthe vehicle which God uses to bring a prodigal son back to His mansion offreedom. Elias had been spiritually advanced in the earlier incarnation, but hadsomewhat fallen from his high consciousness during his incarnation as John. Itwas Jesus, John’s disciple, who had advanced so greatly that he was able toremind His Guru of his forgotten incarnation.John was humble because he had fallen somewhat spiritually, and he did not wantto identify himself with the high state of his previous incarnation as Elias. Hesaid: “I am not Elias;” i.e., I am not as highly developed in this incarnationas I was when Elias. He gave an evasive answer when he was asked: “Who art thou,that we may give an answer to them thatPic8.jpg [../images/00010.jpeg]sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?” He said: “I am the voice of one crying inthe wilderness; make straight the way of the Lord, as saith the prophet Esaias.”I am the voice, or Cosmic Sound, crying or vibrating in the Wilderness ofSilence. The “wilderness” signifies the consciousness of a saint where no greenherbs of fresh material desires can grow. The saint makes his soul barren sothat God may come in without resistance from the weeds and brambles of materialdesires. And as John heard the all-knowing Cosmic Sound within him, in theWilderness of Silence, he heard the intuitive wisdom command him silently: “Makestraight the way of the Lord.” Manifest the Lord, or the subjective ChristConsciousness in all Cosmic vibratory Creation, through the awakened intuitivefeeling of a straight spine during the state of meditation.Though John denied that he was as developed as Elias, still he spoke of hisinner spiritual state as having attained the knowledge of expanding OmnipresentCosmic Vibration. He also made it plain that he not only knew he had attainedthe Cosmic Vibratory state, but that he was meditating with a straight spine,and trying to open up the spinal centers so that the locked-out ChristConsciousness could descend into his body. The word “straight” signifies alsofollowing the straight path of Truth through which alone the soul can reach God.John told the priests in all spiritual subtleness that he was neither the bodyof Jesus nor Elias, but that he was the Omnipresent Cosmic Vibration trying tofeel Christ Consciousness in his body.John also hinted to the ignorant mass of people that the only way by which ametaphysical, Omnipresent Christ Consciousness could be received is by means ofa straight spine with awakened centers of consciousness.The populace was looking for Christ in a physical body, so John subtly told howhe was welcoming Christ through a straight spine, and said that anyone whowanted to know Christ must receive Him in meditation with a straight spine, andmust follow the straight path of Truth.Of course, the physical interpretation is that John cut down the bushes ofpeople’s ignorance and created a straight path of Truth so that others mightfollow that path to receive the teachings of Jesus in attaining ChristConsciousness.John was also explaining that just worshipping the body of Jesus was not theright way to know Him. The Christ Consciousness embodied could be felt only inthe Astrally-awakened straight spine. John was educating the people in orderthat they might know the straight way by which the metaphysical ChristConsciousness in the body of Jesus could be understood and intuitionallyperceived.The prophet Esaias also knew that the subjective Lord of Finite VibratoryCreation, or Christ Consciousness, could be welcomed only through the awakenedstraight spine in meditation. The flow of Life Force through the spine andnerves causes man to perceive and appreciate sense objects only, but when thesearchlights of the senses are reversed and thrown back on the Spirit throughthe awakened spine, then Christ Consciousness is revealed.All the Yogis (those who seek scientific union with God) of India lay the utmostimportance on keeping the spine straight during meditation, and uponconcentration on the point between the eyebrows. The idea is that when theattention is switched off from the senses it begins to withdraw the currentsfrom the sense telephones, and to reverse them towards the Spiritual Eye,situated between the two physical eyes and the medulla.The Spiritual Eye is a reflection of the medulla. As one switch throws lightinto the two lights of an automobile, so the medulla throws the current into thetwo physical eyes, but by making the eye single; i.e., concentrating on thepoint between the two eyes, one can see the medulla reflected as only one light.The Pineal Eye and the Medulla Eye are one and the same, reflected through thetwo outer eyes. By making the eyes single again, the diffused light of the twophysical eyes is seen as one Spiritual Eye. Jesus said: “If, therefore, thineeye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.”Attention is the conductor of our life currents and consciousness. Those whogreedily indulge too much in the pleasures of the senses of touch, smell, taste,sound, and sight find the searchlights of their consciousness and Life Forceturned outward towards matter, but when, by self-control and meditation, theattention is focused on the point between the eyebrows in the spiritualsensorium, then the Life Force and consciousness steadily begin to throw arevealing light over the Christ Consciousness Omnipresent in all finiteCreation.Every spiritual aspirant should know that a bent spine during meditation offersreal resistance to the process of reversing the life currents. A bent spinethrows the vertebra out of alignment and pinches the nerves, making itimpossible for the Life Force to reverse its direction and flow towards theSpiritual Eye and the medulla.John, Esaias, and Yogis say that to receive Christ Consciousness from Jesus, orfrom a real Yogi preceptor, more than a simple physical contact is necessary.One must know how to meditate with a straight spine, how to keep the attentionswitched off from the senses, and how to keep it fixed on the altar of theSpiritual Eye between the two eyes, where Christ Consciousness can be receivedin all glory.The people sent by the Pharisees, in their ignorance, not understanding thedepth of John’s statement, asked again: “Why baptize if thou be not that Christ,nor Elias, neither that prophet?” This was a foolish question, because John hadalready told them that he had heard the Cosmic Voice, and that he had authorityto baptize, but in his greatness he went on to say: “I baptize with water: butthere standeth One among you, who ye know not; He it is; who, coming after me,is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.”John still realized his matter-wardness, or attachment to the watery flesh. Hewas more conscious of the body than of the Spirit, and so he thought: “I havelots to overcome in order to purify my body before I can baptize my Spirit.”Since John’s concentration was on purifying the body first, he taught the way ofbaptizing with water. It has been explained elsewhere that cleansing the bodywith water before a Spiritual Initiation is conducive to a receptive state ofthe mind, due to the calming and cooling effect of bathing.After the body is clean, the soul should be baptized by wisdom, magnetism,spiritual radiation, or Holy Ghost (or holy silent, ghost-like vibratoryemanations from the preceptor). John knew that he could bring a temporaryspiritual influence into the body ofPic9.jpg [../images/00011.jpeg]his disciples, but that Jesus, with His Cosmic Aura, could baptize the souls ofpeople with wisdom, and with Cosmic Vibratory Emanations.John speaks of Jesus as the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world.A lamb is the symbol of innocence, humility, and loyalty. Jesus was innocent,pure, humble, and true to God in every way. His was not the arrogance or powerof a tyrant trying to destroy evil. Evil never can be uprooted by evil. Murdercan never be abolished by murder. Unless the desire to murder is torn from theheart, it will leave its roots in the hearts of men and go on growing. Evil canonly be destroyed by good. Murderers should not be hanged, but should bereformed with wisdom. The thought of murder must be banished from all heartsbefore killing will leave the shores of this earth.If God, powerful as He is, punished man by physical means, man could not live onearth and exercise his independence of judgment and thus learn by his ownmistakes. Therefore, God uses love, and like a lamb lets Himself be butchered sothat some day, by the example of the humble resignation of the lamb to thebutcher, He may awaken the higher sympathy and kindness in man.Therefore, Jesus came as the lamb of spirituality, humble, loyal to God, readyto offer Himself as a sacrifice before the Temple of Truth, so that by Hissupreme example of purity, humbleness, and meekness He might act as the greatestspiritual light to drive away the dark sins of the world. Darkness can not bechased away by darkness. Sin cannot be dispelled by sin. Lying cannot be stoppedby lying. Murder cannot be stopped by hanging. Revengefulness cannot be stoppedby revengefulness.Darkness can be dispelled only by light. Sin can be dispelled by righteousness.Lying can be stopped by examples of truthfulness. Murder will cease by exampleof forgiveness and love, for the murderer’s desire to commit murder can only behealed by forgiveness. Revengefulness can cease only by forgiveness. Jesus, Sonof God, by His unique example of grand, humble, Almighty Godliness, has becomethe light of ages to show people the way out of darkness for all time.John predicted that Jesus would come after him, destined by God to work out Hisplan of showing people the path of redemption. John at first did not know thatJesus had come, so he continued to baptize with water in the way that he knewbest how to do good to mankind.John spoke of the Christ Consciousness, immanent in all vibratory Cosmic energy,as symbolized in the dove-like Spiritual-Eye, the star-marked opal-blue lightencased in a ring of golden ray. This light is a symbolized by a dove because itbrings perennial peace. The star represents the mouth of the dove and is thesecret passage to Cosmic Consciousness. The blue and golden lights are the twowings of the dove. The blue represents the Cosmic tunnel leading to theperception of the subjective Christ Intelligence in all Creation. The ring oflight represents the objective Cosmic energy, Cosmic Vibration, or the HolyGhost.The Spiritual Eye is composed of the lifetron (like electron) or the finestultimate unit of intelligence and energy. It is finer than electrons, of whichall matter and consciousness are composed. Each microcosmic lifetron contains inminiature the essence of all the macrocosmic creation. The Cosmos is made of thetranscendental God, the Father, the consciousness beyond all Creation; and God,the Son, (the consciousness of the Father reflected in the womb of Cosmic Energyas the Only Begotten, only reflected Christ Consciousness) and the Holy Ghost,or Cosmic Vibration. This Cosmic Vibration appears as the Cosmic Sound of alllifetrons and Cosmic Energy.Microcosmically each lifetron, or the Spiritual Eye in man, is composed of theelements God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or of transcendental CosmicConsciousness, of Christ Consciousness, and of Cosmic Energy. However, Johnsaid: “I saw the Spirit descending from His abode of Heavenly Bliss, in the formof a microcosmic Spiritual Eye, and rest upon Jesus. The spiritual telescopiceye of Jesus was opened through this, and he could perceive the macrocosmicmanifestations of Cosmic Consciousness, Christ Consciousness, and Cosmic Energy.Ordinary man, through his physical eyes, sees only his body and a little portionof the earth at a time, but any man, like Jesus, can see the spiritual dovealight in him; i. e., behold through his telescopic Spiritual Eye the entirekingdom of Cosmic Energy and the consciousness existing in and beyond it.Spirit, by Cosmic Vibration, had instructed John to baptize people with water,and then the same Spirit showed John the mystery of baptism by Spirit. “Uponwhom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same is Hewhich baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw, and bare record that this is theSon of God.”Any man who can see his Spiritual Eye, not temporarily, but always, and who cansee the Omnipresent Spirit through it, can baptized people with the Omnipresent,sacred Cosmic magnetism (Holy Ghost). Simply seeing the light, or showing othersthe light of the Spiritual Eye, is not enough (as advanced students ofPraecepta-given Kriya, the Highest Art of Realization, can). One must be able toperceive the Spirit through the Spiritual Eye. This is what is meant by theSpirit remaining on Om. When we can do that, we can summon the Almighty Spiritto envelop the disciple with the Cosmic magnetism. Of course, the disciple mustbe advanced and deserving in order to be able to receive such a baptism inOmniscience by his advanced Guru (preceptor) who is saturated with CosmicConsciousness."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6: Calling the Apostles— Jesus the Man and Jesus the Christ“They said unto him, ‘Rabbi, (which, is to say, being interpreted, Master,)where dwellest thou?’ He saith unto them, ‘Come and see.’ They came and sawwhere he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.“One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, SimonPeter’s brother. He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, ‘Wehave found the Messias.’ Which is, being interpreted, the Christ. And he broughthim to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, ‘Thou art Simon, the son ofJona: thou shalt be called Cephas,’ which is by interpretation, A stone.”(John 1:38-42)Andrew, after staying with Jesus for a day, was so saturated with His spiritualmagnetism that he understood who Jesus was. After a short acquaintance withJesus, Andrew became filled with the vibration of Jesus, the Christ. ChristConsciousness cannot be intellectually inferred, but has to come throughintuitional awareness. There is a difference between Jesus, the son of man, andJesus, the Son of God."},{"pageContent":"SIGNIFICANCE OF CHRIST VIBRATIONThe Cosmic Energy and Cosmic Consciousness enter the medulla oblongata aspositive and negative currents, forming a series of attracting magnets. Eachindividual is a bundle of these magnets and attracts others according to theirstrength. Jesus was a Christ magnet empowered to attract all men, as comparedwith the ordinary man who can attract very little.All the parts of the body which come in pairs—eyes, ears, big and littletongues, hands, feet, and so on, receive and radiate positive and negativecurrents, and each pair forms a magnet with more or less power. The opticalmagnet can charm, enthrall, and draw people so strongly that they may feel themagnetism of one’s soul through the eyes. Some highly-developed people are ableto spiritualize or heal a whole audience just by the magnetism of the eyes.The laying of the hands on sick people is done to send the healing X-Rays of thehands into the body of the patient to electrocute the disease germs. There is nopower greater than the Life Force flowing through the hands, provided it is madestrong by an indomitable will. Man’s strong will, which refuses to bediscouraged by anything and which flows continually and energetically toward theaccomplishment of an object, becomes divinely empowered. The strong will of manis Divine will.The best way to know an individual is to reside with him in the same house. Twopeople living in the same room, even if they did not talk, would attract eachother with their consciousness, nature, vitality, and so forth. Each would feelthe silent emanation of the other’s thoughts, Life Force, and the range andstrength of his vital magnetism.Each man carries a tell-tale silent evidence of his own vibrations with him. Allunbiased, spiritually sensitive souls, can know people simply by looking intotheir eyes, or by merely coming in close contact with them and feeling theiremanating vibrations. Worried, calm, timid, brave, cruel, wise, or godly peoplecan be felt instantly even by people with little spiritual perception.People with ordinary perception can feel others only when within close range oftheir magnetism. Great minds, however, can feel one another from a distance,although perception is stronger if they have been closely associated for awhile. Thus it was that Andrew’s great soul, after remaining with Jesus for aday, felt His Christ magnetism and he was able to say to his brother Simon: “Wehave found the Messiah.”We find Christ defined in the Bible as “The first begotten of the dead, and theprince of the kings of the earth.” (Rev. I:5.)The definition is very deep and subtle. It means that the soul wave is usuallyencased in the physical body of sixteen elements and in the astral andideational bodies of nineteen elements. It is corked in these bodies byignorance and material desires and is unable to mingle with the ocean of Spiritwhich surrounds it. With the change of the physical body, called “death,” thesoul remains encased in the astral and ideational bodies and is still unable toloosen its Life Wave to join the ocean of Spirit. It is possible by highermeditation for the soul to free itself from the physical and astral worlds andthen to merge itself in the ocean of Christ Consciousness.That is why, in the above passage, it is stated that this Christ Consciousnesscan be experienced only by those souls who have seen the complete death ordissolution of their encaging physical, astral, and ideational bodies, and notby all who are merely physically dead.In the human consciousness, the soul experiences itself as identified with thephysical body, name, titles, possessions, nationality, and so forth. In thesubconscious state, the soul cognizes itself as the restless power of dreams oras the formless peace of deep sleep. In the superconscious state, the soul feelsitself as undiluted, formless, ever-new joy. In the state of ChristConsciousness, the soul, emerging from its three dead bodies, feels the ChristIntelligence in all Creation as the conscious, supreme, princely intelligenceguiding all other kingly powerful forces which govern the earth and all matter.Jesus, the man, could feel His consciousness, not only as residing in andgoverning the body, but He could also feel it as the Christ Intelligencepervading all the space cells of His finite Cosmic body.It is important to note the difference between Jesus the man and Jesus theChrist. Jesus was the name of the man. The Sanskrit origin of this name is foundin the word “Isa,” or, Lord of Creation. Mispronounced by travelers in manylands, and being used in many different languages, the word Jesus came to beused in place of Isa. The Spanish pronounce it “Hazus”.Different people, with voices influenced by different climates, pronounce thesame words differently and give birth to different languages with differentspellings. The word “Calcutta” is spelled differently by different races. TheEnglish spell and pronounce it “Calcutta”. The Bengalees pronounce it and spellit “Kalicata”. The Western Hindus pronouce and spell it “Kalicutta”. SomeNorwegians pronounce and spell the same word as “Colquita”. This illustrates howthe name “Isa” could be changed through the ages into “Jesus”.Originally names expressed a quality of an individual. Then they were handeddown from father to son for generations. This complicated matters and later eachindividual had to have the name of his family, and also a name signifying hisindividuality. This may be illustrated by my own name, which is a combination ofYoga and Ananda. Yoga means scientific union, and Ananda means Bliss. Thedistinctive quality is the love of scientific union of the soul with God. Forthat reason, the name of Yoga was given by my Master. Ananda corresponds afamily name, but in this case it belongs to the order of Swamis and means thosemen who seek Divine Bliss.Jesus, the Christ, likewise has meaning. Jesus was the name given by the familysignifying a Divine child, or Lord of Creation, and the name Christ was givenlater and signified the Christ consciousness which was manifest in the body ofJesus. Strangely enough, the family of Jesus, seeing the miraculous signs whichattended His birth, named him “Lord of Creation” or “Isa”, and later, due tochanges in pronunciation, called Him “Jesus”.The Sanskrit name “Kutasha Chaitanya,” or Christ Consciousness, and the name ofone of the greatest prophets of India, Christina, who lived about 1500 B. C.,show that the word Christ is very ancient word, meaning the unchangeableconsciousness present in every atom of matter and in every speck of finiteCreation. The Hindu prophet was called Jadava, the Christina. Jadava was thefamily name, Christina the spiritual name. Jesus, the Christ, signifies that thebody of Jesus was the vehicle in which the Christ Consciousness, or universalintelligence present in everything, was manifest.People, through different ages, have sought the Messiah, or the Christ, whocould turn their attention from the soul’s consciousness of little portions ofthe matter-world, such as country, society, and family, to the Omnipresence ofChrist Consciousness. Throughout the ages, when the souls of people, instead ofbeing identified with Christ Consciousness, became entangled in individual,family, social, and national consciousness, they became limited, producing manymiseries. Blind attachment of family property, and so on, leads to selfishness,quarrelsomeness, delusion of permanent possession, inharmony, worries, and thelike. So-called blind patriotism produces commercial greed, desire of wrestingthe possessions of others from them, and terrible wars.After souls suffer by repeatedly passing through family, social, and nationaltroubles in different incarnations, they automatically, desire to be releasedfrom misery and long to find emancipation through a Christ-like savior. TheBhagavad Gita says that self-liberated souls are used again and again asvehicles of God, and are sent on earth to express the Christ Consciousness inorder to help release matter-entangled souls.God never created Himself into a human being, subject to the weakness of fleshand mental limitations. If God manufactured Jesus Christ as His Son, alreadycomplete and perfect, then the temptations of Jesus, by Satan, and His victory,were nothing but Divine Acting. Christ, who was already above death andtemptations, could not have needed any mental strength to overcome them. Hence,Jesus, as a perfect Son of God, could not be an example for us.Jesus was a liberated soul, one of the greatest that ever came on earth. He hadstruggled through many incarnations in order to come to that Christ State, andit was during the Christ State, in which He could feel His consciousness inevery atomic cell of His great body of all matter, that He could act as a Saviorof mankind. It is only in this State that any Soul is able to feel Its perfectidentity with God. Jesus, Himself, said that all those who received Him (i.e.,were mentally advanced enough and spiritually transparent enough), to them Hegave the power to become the Sons of God. In the words of Andrew we first findthe differentiation between Jesus and Christ.“And when Jesus beheld him (Simon Peter) he said, ‘Thou art Simon, the son ofJona: thou shalt be called Cephas,’ which is, by interpretation, A stone.” Jesussaw Simon Peter and predicted that his spiritual life would be strong as astone.“The day following, Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, andsaith unto him, ‘Follow me.’”(John 1:43)When great Masters, like Jesus, come on earth, they bring with them theiradvanced disciples in order to give them the higher teaching, and to test theirspirituality on the psychological battlefield of the earth. So, Jesus knowingHis previous Guru (preceptor) and disciple relationship with Philip, calmlysaid: “FOLLOW ME”. This was a command to Philip, for Jesus recognized Hisspiritual responsibility as a preceptor toward Philip as His disciple. Jesusindicated that Philip should tune his instinct-guided reason and will power withthe higher wisdom-guided reason and will power of Jesus because that was theonly way Philip could free himself from mortal delusion and overcome thecompelling temptation of flesh.Delusion and pre-natal bad habits may completely over-power the reason and willpower of disciple during crucial tests when the delusive dictates of his ownreason seem to him to be virtuous and true. In this state the disciple shouldnever trust to his own decisions about new undertakings of his life. Vice wearsthe cloak of virtuous reason to lure him away from the spiritual path. At thattime the foresight of the preceptor should be consulted and his advice should befollowed obediently by the disciple, even though his own befogged reason mayrebel and tell him to do otherwise. In the delusive state the best undertakingsmay end in a disaster, for Satan, the Universal Metaphysical Tempter, tries byevery means to take the virtuous man from the spiritual path.“Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip findethNathaniel; and saith unto him, ‘We have found him, of whom Moses in the law andthe prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.’ And Nathanielsaith unto him, ‘Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?’ Philip saithunto him, ‘Come and see.’ Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and saith unto him,‘Behold and Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.’”(John 1:44-47)Philip quotes the intuitive revelations of Moses and the prophets about thecoming of Jesus, the Christ. This raises the question: “Are the happenings onthis earth and earthly human affairs all predestined?” We do not think so, butif not, how could Moses and the prophets foretell the coming of Christ? We thinkit was this way: Moses, by his intuitive foresight was able to trace the law ofcause and effect which governs human life. He knew also of the law of God whichsends self-emancipated, Christ-like souls onto the earth at different ages, whenthe people of the earth become burdened with sin. God uses the vehicles ofChrist-like souls to inspire sorrow-laden mortal beings with the courage to seeksalvation.Nathaniel was a plain-spoken, sincere man, and he knew the sin-laden state ofNazareth, and naturally he expressed doubt that such a place could ever producea Savior. Philip was practical, and without argument tried to bring Nathanielinto the transmuting personal magnetism of Jesus Christ. Philip knew thatChrist, by His very look and His magnetic life force, could electrocute theseeds of bad habits and doubts that had formed grooves in the brain ofNathaniel. Jesus gave Nathaniel a soul-penetrating look which scorched out hisignorance and took an intuitive photograph of his life. That is why Jesus said:“Behold and Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.” Behold a soul which isfree from Satanic insincerity.“Nathaniel saith unto him, ‘Whence knowest thou me?’ Jesus answered and saithunto him, ‘Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, Isaw thee.’”(John 1:48)Nathaniel was astonished to hear Jesus analyze him so correctly and he wanted toknow how it was done. So Jesus said: “Before Philip called thee, I saw thee.”This seeing was not by the superficial eye, but it was the intuitive photographof the soul taken on the sensitive perception of Jesus, who was Omniscient andversed in the art of telepathy.Omnipresent God would never be born on earth as a human being, for God in Hisgreatness could never completely identify Himself with the limitations oftemptation, mortality, and so forth a human existence. Unless God could forgetHimself in a human incarnation, He could never in reality struggle with thelimitations of human nature and make Himself a spiritual example to us.If Jesus was already God, and came as God, His trials and sorrows, struggles,victory over Satan and crucifixion, were but Divine Acting. In the case, Jesusacted out the pre-ordained Divine part of His life without being touched by it,just as an actor plays a part on the stage without being inwardly identifiedwith it. Such a Divinely manufactured Jesus could never inspire faith in weakhuman beings so that they could conquer evil, but a God-man Jesus, who struggledto the highest spiritual freedom, could be a universal human example, and thatwould save God from being accused of the partiality of making one soul the Sonof God and all other souls the sons of temptation and weakness.God uses only about-to-be-perfect souls to serve as examples and teachers todeluded humans. It has occurred sometimes that perfect angels of God haveconsciously come on earth to show people how they should behave by leadingexemplary lives. Even the highest and all-powerful saints express their naturesin the human body through humility, meekness, forgiveness, undying love, andunselfishness, instead of through miraculous physical forces. In evil-submergedhuman life the tendency is to suppress wrong by physical force. When the humanlimitation vanishes from man, then he uses only the superior, nobler forces oflove, instead of machine guns and revengefulness, to right the wrongs inindividual and collective life. Even if great saints are tortured or ridiculedon earth, they behave Divinely, using only the highest and noblest moral methodsto conquer evil.“Nathaniel said unto him, ‘Whence knowest thou me?’ Jesus answered and said untohim, ‘Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I sawthee.’ Nathaniel answered and said unto him, ‘Rabbi, thou art the Son of God;thou art the King of Israel.’ Jesus answered and said unto him, ‘Because I saidunto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greaterthings than these.’”(John 1:48-50)Jesus said to Nathaniel: “I saw thee under the fig tree; i.e., I saw thy soulunder the nerve branches of the cerebro-spinal tree.” Jesus, by his SpiritualEye saw Nathaniel’s soul resting under the astral nervous system (fig tree.)Man’s body is an upturned tree with roots of hair and cranial nerves at the baseof the trunk of the spinal tree of life, shooting out branches of the nervoussystem. Any spiritual adept looking into another soul deeply can see the souland its astral nervous system. Spiritual souls have a refined astral nervoussystem. Material souls have the poor figs of material desires vibrating on thebranches of their astral nervous system.The above explains how Jesus saw Nathaniel under the fig tree. Nathaniel mighthave been under a real fig tree and Jesus could have seen him there, but hereJesus speaks of seeing Nathaniel, not with physical eyes, but with thetelescopic spiritual eye which can reveal the remotely situated fig tree of theastral nervous system in the Kingdom of the unseen.Nathaniel could feel the astral body of Jesus entering into his. That is why inan instant he said: “Thou art the Son of God.” A son of man is attracted to onebody and is unconsciously ejected only at the time of death, but a Son of God,like Jesus, feels His omnipresent consciousness existing in His great body ofall matter. Jesus, although apparently existing and working through one body,was not limited by it, but could transfer his consciousness into any other bodyand feel its sensations, perceptions, and thoughts and emotions.Jesus, through his omniscience, could simultaneously feel his own body or anygroup of bodies at the same time. That is why He said: “Are not two sparrowssold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without yourFather.” (Matt. 10:29)Jesus, being one with the Father, had the same omniscient consciousness that Hisfather had. Therefore, Nathaniel, feeling the consciousness of Jesus transferredwithin himself, felt himself divinely transmuted and acknowledged Jesus as theSon of God and the King of Israel. The first title is the Divine Title and is oftremendous significance.Nathaniel spoke of Jesus as the Son of God and owner of the universe and, beingsuch, he was also the greatest power (King) in Israel, which lay somewhere onthis little pill of earth situated in God’s Kingdom of the Universe.Jesus answered and said: “Because I said unto Thee, I saw thee under the figtree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.” Jesus waspleased to find Nathaniel respond to His spiritual vibrations. Nathaniel’sbelief in the words of Jesus was the result of the vibratory experience whichNathaniel received from Jesus.Many people do not believe even after they feel a truth, so Jesus said untoNathaniel: “As you believe in Me, just receiving My vibrations, you will seegreater things (greater miracles) than these, i.e., than these miracles of Mysending to you astral and thought vibrations.”“And he said unto him, ‘Verily, verily, I say unto you, hereafter ye shall seeheaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son ofman.’”(John 1:51)Verily, I say unto you: “Afterwards you shall see the astral region through theopening of the telescopic Spiritual Eye and you shall see the luminous astralbodies ascending out of the dead physical bodies into the Astral Kingdom. Alsoyou shall behold many astral bodies descending into the physical bodies ofnewly-conceived babies.” Son of Man signifies the physical body.In Genesis, God created the firmament. He called the firmament “Heaven,” and Hedivided the waters from the waters. Space is the pearly gate of Heaven, whichhides the finer forces of waters, and the waters (gross elements) under thefirmament gathered together and the dry land appeared. The gross elements lie onthe outward boundary of space.Different races conceive of Heaven according to their racial habits of thought.Certain sects believe that Heaven is filled with large-eyed damsels, fine food,and so forth, even as the fish who live in water might conceive of human beingsliving on earth as a heaven of celestial fishes all swimming in water. Just asthis is absurd, so most human beings talk of Heaven as a place where coolbreezes blow evermore, where weather is not violent, where all kinds of fruitscan be found, and where winged angels move. We can easily see the idea thatangels were given wings because of the human desire to be like the birds, freelyflying where they choose.Modern man may picture angels using airplanes moving at the rate of 4,000 milesan hour, yet, when we think how fast light and electricity move, the flight ofairplanes seems like the movement of an ox cart. The time will come when manwill learn to change the atomic vibrations of his gross body and make them intoan astral force. It is then that he will be able to shoot along with the astrallight rays at the rate of 500,000,000 miles per second—even faster than(material) light.When man learns astral traveling, he will find that he can travel faster thanlight, but when man learns the full mystery of mind, he will be able to travelfaster than any force—material light or astral. If he wished to be in the sun orthe moon, or the fastest star, he could be there instantly.Jesus speaks of the opening of Heaven. This is possible in two ways.1. By losing limitations of the physical eyes (which see nothing but the grossvibrations of matter) through years of practice in looking into and penetratingthe Spiritual Eye until is possible to see into the Astral Heaven.2. By having the vibrations of space and other finer walls of lights removedthrough the command of the Ultimate Intelligence, then man can see the luminousAstral Kingdom hidden behind the Firmament.In the Astral Kingdom everything is light. There is astral land, astral sea,astral air, astral skies, astral darkness and light and astral gardens andbeings, all made of the different vibrations of light. They may be compared todifferent kinds of fish which have to live in differently-vibrating spheres. Itis difficult for astral beings living in grosser vibrations to go into thesubtle astral vibratory sphere where finer astral bodies live.We have astral gardens and flowers planted on the soil of the ether. Theysurpass any human description. Here the flowers glow like Chinese star shells,ever-growing and ever-changing, and ever-adapting themselves to the fancy of theastral beings and disappearing when they are not wanted. They come back againwith new colors and fragrance when desired again.Here the astral beings drink many-hued lights from living fountains falling fromthe bosom of Astral mountains. Here millions of miles of deep and wide astraloceans heave with azure, opal, green, silver, gold, blood red, yellow, and aquamarine lights). Diamond-colored waves dance in perpetual rhythm of beauty.Astral beings swim here and use all their subtle senses as we use them in thedreamland. The only difference is that there is more beauty and perfection inthe Astral World than on the earth. The earth is so full of decay anddestruction. In the Astral World the havoc done by an astral earthquake could beremedied by mere willing. Of course, this Astral Kingdom decays slowly and is abillion times older and longer-lived than earth has been or is going to be.In Astral Kingdom there is only spiritual marriage, and children are created bythe immaculate method of condensing the positive or negative thoughts, and will,and feeling tendencies of parents into the form of a male or female child; thepositive thought producing a male child, the negative thought producing a femalechild.In the Astral World there is birth and death. Souls promoted from the earth areborn in the Astral Kingdom, and when they leave, at the end of their good Karma,they go back to the earth or to similar inhabited planets in other islanduniverses. Some souls, who developed in the Astral Kingdom, do not die there,but consciously lift themselves into the omnipresent bosom of God and become Onewith God.Jesus had gone beyond the Astral World, so He said: “I and my Father are One.”Souls who consciously spiritually develop on earth, and who can retain theirconsciousness during the transition of death, can come into the Astral Land andconsciously develop until final freedom in God is attained. Then theKarma-compelled journey of reincarnations toward the earth is stopped.In the Astral Land souls do not use imperfect, limited, mortal intelligence andsenses. There they use various grades of semi-developed intuition andhighly-developed intelligence.The Astral Land is conspicuous for the absence of books, for the Astral Beingscan concentrate upon anything and know about its nature through theinstantaneous knowledge-producing power of intuition.Here in Astral Land we find highly-developed saints and also ordinary beingswith only semi-developed intuitions. It is only after becoming One with God thata soul does not have to read books or concentrate upon anything in order to knowit by intuition. When a soul becomes One with God, that soul’s intuition, beingidentified with Spirit, already knows all and sees all without trying to knowanything, even by the effort of intuition.“And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter,and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers. Andhe saith unto them,“‘Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.’”(Matthew 4:18-19)And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, beheld the two brothers casting a netto catch fish in the sea. And Jesus, turning toward then, told them what Hethought about fishing, and that He wanted them to learn about fishing for Souls.All Masters teach in parables, and Jesus thought, like a Hindu Master thought,when he said: “O Divine Mother, passing by the sea of my consciousness, I beholdmy Ego catching the small bony fishes of material objects, such as name andfame. Bless me so that I may see, instead, the way to catch with my net ofdevotion, the large fishes of Divine Truth-seeking Souls swimming in the sea ofmy unruffled consciousness.”It is common to catch fish in the sea for one’s own paltry self, but to catchTruth-seeking Souls in the net of Heavenly devotion in order to present them toGod is a great achievement. To catch fish and eat them may help to appeasephysical hunger, but it is not so good for the fish. To catch Souls in the netof one’s own Truth-conviction and bring them to God, brings harm to no one. Onthe contrary, it brings the Divine blessing for the Soul-fisherman, and it alsoeventually liberates the fishers of Souls. Blessed are those who fish for Souls,for that is the highest spiritual activity on earth.To seek one’s own salvation and not benefit others by it is extreme selfishness.But to seek salvation for yourself so that ultimate freedom may be shared withothers is Divine. To try to bring salvation to others without first having ityourself is impossible. You can give only what you have and nothing else. Inorder to give Spiritual power, you must first acquire the power yourself.God loves to see a son consciously seek Him, but He is extremely pleased when Hefinds that son exhorting another son to come unto Him. When a spirit-bound,truant Soul inspires another Spiritual fugitive to return to God, that isconsidered the highest human duty.In all the churches in the world ministers should not concentrate upon catchingonly materially rich Souls and bringing them into the fold to be devoured by thetiger of church dogma. All religious teachers should seek to convert Souls, notfor their money, nor for the purpose of swelling the number of church members,but only for bringing them to the all-freeing Presence of God. The commercialSpiritual teacher uses his students to further his own ends, while the trueSpiritual teacher uses the student’s attention to bring him unto God.“And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. And when he had gonea little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother,who also were in the ship mending their nets. And straightway he called them:and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and wentafter him. And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the Sabbath day heentered into the synagogue, and taught. And they were astonished at hisdoctrine: for the taught them as one that had authority, and not as thescribes.”(Mark 1:18-22)The Sabbath Day is meant to be a time of rest and repose. It is the seventh day,or day of rest, following six days of hard material activity. God is supposed tohave worked out His Creation in six days, and on the seventh day to have takenrest. “Thus the heavens and the earth, were finished, and all the host of them.And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested onthe seventh day from all His work which He had made.” (Genesis. 2:1-2)Of course, in Genesis, the seven days were not solar days, but consisted ofseveral cycles. It seems that Creation took much time and everything was evolvedunder the direction of the active intelligence of God. When most of Creation hadcome into being, the directly-active intelligence of God became inactive orindirectly active and when most of the desires of God to create wereaccomplished, His will and intelligence had to take a rest. Hence, there is arest period in creative activity, when very little creation of new planets, andso forth, goes on.So, it looks as if the universe in which we are situated has a kindred vibrationwith us. If rest is needed after activity, each human being should have aSabbath. Observance of the Sabbath Day does not signify the hypocritical denialof such activities as dancing or transacting business only, but it signifies thewilling cessation of all activities which scatter and divert the mind. Peopleshould willingly stay away from diversion and material entertainments on theSabbath Day. Of course, to see a picture, like the “Kings of Kings,” concerningJesus, on the Sabbath Day, is spiritually stimulating instead of degrading.On the other hand, if too many materially interesting diversions are kept aliveon Sabbath days, the minds of people will be running riot in that direction. Theidea is that a rest on the seventh day must be willingly cultivated so that theSoul may recharge itself with calmness, introspection, and creative thinking toadopt the best actions for an all-round existence during the coming week.A Sabbath well spent in silence, meditation, and creative thinking affords theSoul reinforcement with harmony, peace, and mental and physical strength withwhich to use the discrimination to develop, not only physically, but mentallyand spiritually, in the best possible way. The man who works seven days a weeklets his Soul become governed by mechanical activity. Such a person forgets togovern his activity by free will, discrimination, and peace. He easily becomes aphysical wreck and mental wreck, and loses Spiritual happiness. Activity andcalmness must both be cultivated and fostered in order to produce peace andhappiness during the periods of activity as well as during those of silence.The Sabbath Day must be used for the most part in real Spiritual activity, whichhelps the Soul to be recharged by the greatest power and wisdom of God. To spendthe Sabbath by attending morning services for one hour and then spending therest of the day eating, idling, and sleeping, will not do. The real observanceof the Sabbath consists in spending it in seclusion, fasting, and meditation.The reader may say that this is impossible in modern times. Well, I can say inreply: “You might just as well say that it is impossible to be peaceful inmodern times.”In order to be peaceful and God-intoxicated, you must pay the price. You mustgive the time necessary to the cultivation of peace. The one reason why themodern generation is so restless is because children are allowed to go to themovies and indulge in all kinds of restless activities following the short,uninteresting Sunday School classes in the morning.The members in every home, both adults and children, should observe one day aweek of complete silence, as Mahatma Gandhi, [Notes: Mahatma Gandhi—1869-1948;religious and social reformer of India.] one of the world’s greatest Spiritualand active reformers of the day, did. The Sabbath can be made most interestingby complete ecstatic communion with God. There is no happiness greater thanjoy-contact of God in deep meditation. To keep children or yourself away fromthe movies and other distractions just because it is the Sabbath is not enough,but to merge yourself and your children in the greater happiness of God-ecstasyby meditation constitutes your real observation of the Sabbath.Jesus was always filled with the Spirit, hence to Him every day was a SabbathDay. He did not need an extra deep communion with God only on Sunday, for Godwas with Him always and He preferred to share His ecstatic joy with others onthat day. Jesus observed Sunday (Sun’s day, or Wisdom’s day) by teaching peoplethat they should pass the Sabbath with the authoritative presence of God orotherwise. They were told to meditate on God until they could transmit theirdivinely-saturated consciousness to others.So, Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath Day and spoke with God-saturatedconviction of the Truth in His work. Words are like bullets, but they can beeffective only if they are charged with the gunpowder of spiritual conviction.If you try to sell a thing, or an idea, or a belief in which you do not whollybelieve in yourself, your words, no matter how clever, will lack luster and bewanting in the ammunition of the proper zeal born of conviction. To sellsomething for the purpose of rendering material or Spiritual service is good.The wages and compensation for rendering such service, when used mostly forrendering further Spiritual service to all men, is really spiritually admirable.A person who uses his hard-earned wages for spreading God’s work is a muchbetter man than the one who pockets all free-will offerings and collectionsgiven to him for his material pleasures, under the pretext of not charginganything for Spiritual services. It is better to have a definite charge forbooks and lessons and to spend the income therefrom in propagating God’s Causethan for the teacher to use all the free-will offerings for himself.Jesus was absorbed with God and tried to sell His conviction of Him to others.However, Jesus did not preach like the scribes with empty words, but when Hespoke His words were filled with the Cosmic Energy of God. The words of Jesuswere filled with the wisdom-conviction born of Cosmic Consciousness. His wordsvibrated with the authority of God’s wisdom. His sermons bore the seal of God’sassurance.This is a hint to all ministers of the Gospel. It is not enough to commit tomemory the words of the Scriptures and to stand on a soapbox to preach. Oneshould digest the Truth contained in the words of all Bibles and then preachwith power and conviction. Few people listen to soapbox orators; and those whodo, forget what they have heard, but when God speaks through a Soul, thenmountains of doubts are removed from the minds of his listeners.Face-to-face realization of Truth gives one intuitive conviction and true visionand understanding. True wisdom gives power, for knowledge is the energy thatmoves the Cosmic Factory. Wisdom produces power over all things and powerdeclares the absolute authority of infallible Truth. Jesus, unlike the scribes,spoke, not with the authority of fanaticism or imagination, but with theauthority born of Self-Realization of God and a knowledge of all His mysteries.“And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people wereastonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one having authority, and notas the scribes. When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudesfollowed him.“And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word ofGod, he stood by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and werewashing their nets.“And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s and prayed him that hewould thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the peopleout of the ship.”(Matthew 7:28-29; 8:1; Luke 5:1-3)Throngs pressed upon Jesus as He stood by Lake Gennesaret. He saw two shipsanchored while the fishermen had gone out to wash their nets. He boarded oneship to ask Simon to move the ship a little way from the shore, but he sat downand taught the people from the ship.“Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, ‘Launch out into the deep,and let down your nets for a draught.’”(Luke 5:4)Jesus told Simon to go into the deep sea and cast his net. He wanted todemonstrate to Simon the abundance in God, and to show that even the fish obeyedthe Divine Command. Besides this, Jesus wanted Simon to go deep into the oceanichearts of people and catch their souls in the net of wisdom, and bring them untoGod, and make them immortal.“And Simon answering said unto him, ‘Master, we have toiled all the night, andhave taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.’ And whenthey had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their netbrake. And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, thatthey should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, sothat they began to sink.“When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, ‘Depart from me;for I am a sinful man, O Lord.’ For he was astonished and all that were withhim, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken: and so was also James,and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon.”(Luke 5:5-10)Simon did as he was told by Jesus even though he had no luck in hauling fishesafter a whole night’s toil. So many fishes filled Simon’s net that it broke. Thepartners from the other ship, James and John, were called to help with thecatch. They came and filled both ships so that they began to sink. At this signof the power of Jesus, Simon Peter fell down at the feet of Jesus, repenting ofhis sins. James, John, and all the others were astonished at the haul of fishes.“And Jesus said unto Simon, ‘Fear not, from henceforth thou shalt catch men.’And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followedhim.”(Luke 5:10-11)Though Jesus advocated fishing for food, as the people’s lives depended upon theseafood, still He brought out a great truth in the miracle of hauling fish,which He performed. He told Simon Peter to learn how to cast the net of wisdomand to take the soul-fishes roaming in the poisoned waters of delusion, and letthem loose in the immortalizing sea of God-wisdom.The question might come to the mind of the ordinary reader: “Why did Jesus askSimon to be a teacher when he had not undergone even the rudimentary spiritualteachings?” This is because Jesus had taught Simon in a previous incarnation,and even though Simon didn’t know it, Jesus could see Simon’s spiritualattainments in the astral marking in his brain, so He asked Simon to catchdeluded men, prodigal children of God, and to bring them back to theever-freeing mansion of God.Only the Spirit-baptized and ecstasy-baptized person can spiritually baptizeanother soul and bring him to the doors of God and ecstatic Heaven. Catchingsouls by advertisements, just to fill the church, and then stuffing them withhackneyed teachings is not enough. One must be in ecstasy with God duringpreaching and then be must cast the net of his blissful perception over hislisteners. In this way real souls will be hauled into the everlasting nectar-seaof God-perception.“And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, a publicannamed Levi, the son of Alpheus, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saidunto him, ‘Follow me.’”(Matthew 9:9; Mark 2:14)In these words we hear the intuitive command of Jesus when, at the sight ofMatthew, He recognized one whom He had known in many past incarnations. GreatMasters, such as Jesus, often bring with them into embodiment great disciples tohelp them in the enactment of the divine drama on earth. Jesus knew that Matthewhad been born as a publican, the son of Alpheus, in order that God might beglorified. Even though Matthew was a publican, his inner consciousness, whichhad been acquired in a previous incarnation, remained unchanged. Jesus showedthat the divine son, Matthew, was high in the path of Spirit even though he wasa publican. Jesus knew Matthew as a divine son in spite of his lowly birth andoccupation, and called him with a firm, confident voice which echoed with therecognition of past incarnations.Physical scientists expose Nature’s truth, but spiritual Masters, by theiractions, reveal the nature of the drama of reincarnation which governs humanlives. Think what it means, that out of the multitude of people surrounding Him,Jesus glimpsed the publican, Matthew, whom He had not seen before in thatparticular body, and immediately commanded: “Follow me.” And Matthew followed,not because of a hypnotic spell, but because he too felt the call of pastrecognition.“And he left all, rose up, and followed him. And Levi made him a great feast inhis own house: And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house,many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: forthere were many, and they followed him. And when the scribes and Pharisees sawhim eat with publicans and sinners, they murmured against his disciples, saying,‘How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?’”(Luke 5:28-30; Mark 2:15-16)Matthew left all and followed Jesus, and gave Him the customary feast. Mostspiritual activities are attended by feasts. All people, Christians, Hindus,Jews—all have feasts in connection with religious ceremonies. Even though feastsare distractions at such times, they are necessary when the disciples of aMaster gather from far and near. If the disciples would eat elsewhere and cometo the Master for meditation only, without the digression of feasting, it wouldbe better.The Soul Doctor, Jesus, ate, drank, and associated with the spiritually-sickpublicans and sinners who needed Him, while the hypocritical Pharisees andscribes, who were accustomed to associating with the rich and the outwardlydevout orthodox people, criticized and asked why Jesus associated with sinners.“When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, ‘THEY THAT ARE WHOLE HAVE NO NEED OF APHYSICIAN, BUT THEY THAT ARE SICK: I COME NOT CALL THE RIGHTEOUS, BUT SINNERS TOREPENTANCE.’”(Mark 2:17)As healthy people do not require a physician, so spiritually virtuous people,who are able to redeem themselves by their own good actions, do not require thehelp of a spiritual doctor. Jesus realized that He had been appointed by theHeavenly Father as the spiritual doctor to cure ignorance-stricken souls, andHe, therefore, associated with sinners and publicans who might benefit by Hispresence. Jesus did not care to redeem the righteous, who could redeemthemselves, but He came into the world to save those who suffered and sinned.Righteous people are the ones who act properly and ideally in the varioussituations in life which call for righteous actions. Such actions are thosewhich are performed with the satisfaction of the inner consciousness. Righteouspeople need no guide because their spiritual sense, or conscience, keeps them onthe right path and prevents them from wandering into the jungles of ignorance.Sinners are those who misuse their God-given reason to do that which is wrong.By the repetition of wrong actions, evil habits are developed. Sinners areguided into the labyrinthine ways of inextricable error, and thus they sufferconstantly. They need to be guided by Christ-like, spiritual doctors, until theyare able to control themselves by their own salvaged conscience.People who repeat evil actions usually begin to like evil ways in spite of thesuffering involved. Therefore, sinners must first be reasoned with so that theirparalyzed reason may be brought back to life. Once the reason is awakened,repentance usually follows, for then people are sorry for their evil actions andwant to be free from their evil habits. By convincing the heart of the folly andmisery involved in evil actions, the sinner is called upon to awaken himself andmake a dash for spiritual liberty. Without understanding the nature ofsorrow-producing sinful actions, the sinner can never repent. Repentance is theforerunner of spiritual liberty. Ordinarily, sinners without repentance do notmake an effort to liberate themselves spiritually.Jesus knew that all He could do for the sinner was to awaken his spiritualreason and thus make him sorry for his evil actions, and thereby ultimatelycause him to use his free will to choose righteousness in preference to evil. Tobe able to awaken repentance in a sinner is to show him the way by which he canmake the effort to redeem himself. The sinner cannot redeem himself until he isconvinced of the error of his evil ways. Therefore, he must repent when he seesthe folly of his evil actions, and must use his free will to repeat good karma(actions), and thus redeem himself by his own good actions.Great doctors of souls can inspire metaphysical truants to retrace theirfootsteps Godward, but the actual walking back to the divine home must be doneby the error-stricken souls themselves. Great spiritual teachers never claim toforgive sinners, but they expect to awaken the sinners to the point where theywill make an effort to become spiritually emancipated. If sins could be forgivenby human beings, then one person could relieve another from feeling the effectsof swallowing poison through self-created error. However, the effects of evilaction can be neutralized by the effect of good actions. No one can preventother people from reaping the effects of their evil actions, but if theythemselves become sufficiently awakened, they will be able to free themselvesfrom evil by their own efforts.Repentance for evil action already performed is a forerunner to the effortrequired to attain freedom from evil. Also the sincere and continuous effort tofree oneself from evil is the forerunner to real spiritual freedom."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7: Jesus’ Relationship With the Apostles“And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come andsay unto him: ‘Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, often,and make prayers, but thy disciples fast not?’ And Jesus said unto them, ‘Can yemake the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can not fast. But the dayswill come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shallthey fast in those days.’”(Mark 2:18-20; Luke 5:33-35)Just as the bride does not fast while she is with the bridegroom, so also, thedisciples did not need to fast or to discipline themselves while they were withtheir Master, who was the extreme example of discipline. The very presence ofthe Master Jesus among His disciples was sufficient help for them through theexchange of spiritual vibrations.Fasting at times is necessary for the health of the body, and consequently, forthe purity of the mind. Fasting makes the soul feel free from its bodilybondage. However, Jesus was Spirit, and all of the people who were fortunateenough to contact Him automatically felt the spiritual freedom emanatingdirectly from Him without having to create that freedom by the mere abstinenceof food. Jesus emphasized the fact that the disciples need not create spiritualfreedom by fasting, since He could inspire them with spiritual vibrationsdirectly from his limitless store of spiritual power.However, Jesus did not ignore the value and necessity of fasting and itsspiritual influence on the minds of men, and so He said that the time would comewhen He would be taken away and they would then have to fast and discipline thebody in order to bring it nearer to the Spirit.“And he spake also a parable unto then; ‘No man also seweth a piece of new clothon an old garment; else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from theold, and the rent is made worse, and the piece that was taken out of the newagreeth not with the old.“‘And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine will burst thebottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish, but new wine must be putinto new bottles; and both are preserved. No man also having drunk old winestraightway desireth new; for he saith, ‘‘The old is better.’’”(Mark 2:21-22; Luke 5:37-39)No one should be so foolish as to patch an old garment with new material, forthe new strong piece will pull away more of the worn out material and thus makethe rent in the old garment bigger than before. Furthermore, the new materialwill not match the old cloth.Jesus meant also that the new inspiration emanating directly from His spirit didnot fit in with the old-fashioned stereotyped ways of spiritual living. He wasliving in Truth, and in a dynamic new way He was emancipating the new spirit ofthe disciples who understood Him. He realized that His new spirit was of littleuse for mending the custom-worn, dilapidated, antediluvian, dogmatic habits ofthe people in general. His new inspiration and new ways of living Truth wouldnot harmonize with the old dogmatic theological living.Jesus went on to explain that, as new wine should not be put into old bottleslest the new wine burst the old bottles, so new, powerful inspiration could notvery well be put into dogma-worn minds without exploding old beliefs or causingmental rebellion. His new inspirations ought to be housed in newly enthusiasticand powerful souls in order to produce a good and harmonious effect.No man, having drunk the wine of old dogma, could have a taste for new truths.He would say, “Ah, I know it all. The old rules of the forefathers (no matterhow bad) were good enough for them, so they are good enough for me.” Throughforce of habit he would prefer the old ways of dogmatic living to new habits ofspiritual emancipation.“Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, ‘Why do we and the Phariseesfast oft, but thy disciples fast not?’ And Jesus said unto them, ‘CAN THECHILDREN OF THE BRIDECHAMBER MOURN, AS LONG AS THE BRIDEGROOM IS WITH THEM? BUTTHE DAYS WILL COME, WHEN THE BRIDEGROOM SHALL BE TAKEN FROM THEM, AND THEN SHALLTHEY FAST. No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for thatwhich is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is madeworse. Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, andthe wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into newbottles, and both are preserved.’”(Matthew 9:14-17)“Can the disciples living in the divine consciousness or bridechamber of theirMaster, the divine Bridegroom, mourn or undergo physical discipline?” What Jesusmeans is that He and His disciples were so wrapped in the consciousness of Godthey did not have to fast in order to forget the daily contact with food andthus revive God consciousness. Fasting not only does good to the body but ifproperly done impresses the consciousness with the knowledge that the body isnot dependent on food alone but on the Spirit of God. Those who fast andmeditate realize they are in tune with God and do not have to depend on foodonly for sustenance. Theresa Neumann [Notes: Theresa Neumann, the stigmatist, isreported to have abstained from food entirely from Christmas 1926 until herdeath in September 1962, a total of 36 years.] of Konnersreuth, Germany, who wasin the ecstasy of God, did not eat at all.Jesus says: “When the bridegroom (His great spiritual personality) will bewithdrawn into heaven, the disciples would partially lose that spiritual contactand would have to fast and in order to be free from bodily attachment and torevive the consciousness of God. As it is foolish to put a new piece of cloth inan old garment or new wine in an old bottle, so it would be foolish for mydisciples, filled with the nectar of new thoughts, to follow old mechanicalrules. And as new wines with expanding power should not be but into worn-outbottles so my disciples, intoxicated with the wine of divine wisdom, should notbe following age-old popular superstitions or hard-and-fast rules of conduct. Asnew wine should be kept in new bottles, so my disciples, intoxicated with thewine of new wisdom and bliss, will live in bottles or atmospheres of new living.As new wine will split open an old bottle, so my God-intoxicated disciples couldnot very well maintain themselves bottled up in atmosphere of mechanicalspiritual living, but, being God-intoxicated by following the spirit of newrules, they have not to observe any mechanical spiritual discipline in theirlives. They are already experiencing that for which the rules were made,therefore there is no need for them to observe those old rules for they are nowabove them.”But Jesus pointed out that the disciples would go through strict discipline whenthe atmosphere of His spiritual personality would be withdrawn from them intoGod."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 8: Jesus Ordains the Apostles to Preach, Heal and Cast Out Devils“And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray,and continued all night in prayer to God. And when it was day, he called untohim his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles.”(Luke 6:12-13)“And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might sendthem forth to preach, and to have power to heal sickness, and to cast outdevils.”(Mark 3:14-15)Before Jesus chose His twelve disciples, He went on a mountain top to pray andcommune with God. He was so deeply engrossed in His union and joy with God thatHe did not notice the passing of the night. Mountain tops and caves are alwayssanctioned by the Masters as quiet places for meditation. The pure oxygen onmountain tops helps the practice of breathing exercises calculated to burn thecarbon on the system, quiet the heart and switch off the life current from thefive sense telephones so that the sensations cannot bother the brain andattention directed toward God. Mountains also take the vision of man from thesurrounding confinement of houses to the vast, limitless sky which is thephysical embodiment of the Infinite. Ordinary souls pray with their mindsconcentrated on the clock, but Jesus prayed with His mind concentrated in theInfinite Bliss of Spirit and not on time."},{"pageContent":"CHOOSING THE TWELVEThe choosing of twelve from His disciples by Jesus has a very significantmeaning. In India each great master who attains God-consciousness has two kindsof people who come to him for spiritual training. Those, married or unmarried,who come for general training, are called students or, in Sanskrit, shisyas, butthose students who dedicate their entire lives to God-realization and who areordained to propagate the teaching of the master to the world through theexample of their spiritual development are called disciples, apostles or chelas.As children keep the family name, and endeavor to add to its prestige in theworld, so disciples are the spiritual children of master. When the ordinaryfather brings forth a son in the world, the child inherits the family traits,good or bad. Even if a child happens to turn out a criminal, the father has toput up with him. The father of a family usually has no choice as to the kind ofchildren he is going to bring on earth (unless he knows the spiritual art ofpropagation by which he can bring forth a soul from the astral world to come andbe born in his family by an act of his super-will power and meditation).Masters, on the other hand, have this advantage, that they can select disciplesfrom a vast number of people, and implant in them the seed of their spiritualvitality so that they can perpetuate the master’s spiritual life.In the case of Jesus, He not only selected a particular group as His disciplesbut he selected souls that He knew in a previous incarnation. Jesus selected Hisdisciples for three reasons. One, because these disciples had not reached thefinal state like Him and therefore He wanted to make them perfect. Second, afterhelping the disciples to reach the final state of emancipation, Jesus wantedthem to be apostles or model disciples who could be pioneers to propagate themessage of Christhood to the masses through ideal living. That is why Jesus, onseeing Simon, told him, “Follow me,” and he followed. Last of all, Jesus knew,according to the plan of the Heavenly Father, He had to have twelve disciples tocarry out His message to the world.The coming of Judas distinctly shows that a disciple has independence to workagainst the will of God. God, by His omniscient knowledge, can find out howsouls are going to act in using their will power, whether they will use itproperly or misuse it. Jesus knew the law of cause and effect and the evil karmaof Judas, so he could predict the betrayal of Judas. It must be clearlyunderstood that Judas was not ordained by God to betray Jesus, but that Judaswas to act wrongly according to the lawful effects of his prenatal actions andthat he thus would be the cause of the betrayal of Christ, and of his test onthe cross.Even though Judas was in an indirect test case for the victory of Jesus over theflesh, still it was not fated for Judas to become what he chose to become duesolely to his own evil propensities and league with Satan or ignorance.Jesus knew that he was the pioneer of a great movement to uplift mankind, so hechose twelve disciples to be apostles who could preach the truth by example andwho could heal physical sickness due to disease of the body, mental sickness dueto psychological errors of the mind, and soul sickness due to inner ignorance;and to cast out devils or dislodge metaphysical ignorance lodged in the threebodies of man, and also free souls from the possession of evil agents.In the modern world preaching theology or imaginations about truth by preachersversed in theory is quite the vogue.There are few real preachers who live the life left in the world, especiallyteachers who are in tune with God and who know how to heal physical, mental andsoul sickness by God’s power and who can cast out Satan’s satellites present inthe body of each man. Those that are real preachers are in tune with God and canheal the sickness of true devotees by invoking the unlimited power of God.Medicine, suggestion, all these are indirect mediums of physical or mental cure.True devotees know that God is the supreme cure of all sickness.Therefore those that are really in tune with God ought to be able to heal thespiritually sick by removing ignorance from their souls, and to heal thepsychologically sick by removing anger, greed, bad habits, and so forth fromtheir mentalities and to heal bodies by divine suggestion, divine will power orinjection of cosmic energy by the command of will. Many great teachers not onlyshow their disciples the way of physical and mental healing of others by thesystem of dietetics and methods of concentration, but they teach the highesttechnique of meditation to cure spiritual sickness and drive away ignorance fromthe minds of disciples and true seekers. It must be thoroughly understood thatintellectual preaching through the power of a good memory is far different fromspiritual preaching through example.Last of all, casting out devils is not an old superstition. The art of castingout devils and healing the spiritually sick has almost passed away from theministers of Churchianity of the various religions of the world. The subtleknowledge of casting out devils has been forgotten due to the lack of God-tunedapostles who know the workings of the good and evil forces that are in theworld.Satan was an archangel of God who was given the power to create all creatures asperfect images of God, that in perfection his creation and creatures, after aperfect existence, were to go back to God. But Satan found out that if allcreation and creatures went back to God he would lose the exercise of his ownindividual powers. So he began to misuse the freedom of will that God hadentrusted to him. Ever since Satan has implanted in man anger, fear, greed,hate, revengefulness in place of calmness, bravery, self-control, love andforgiveness, which are divine qualities.We find from the beginning or birth, a child is influenced not only by goodtraits of love and kindness, but by a host of mischief-making traits. God couldcertainly not start out a child in life with evil traits. These traits the childbrings from bad habits of previous incarnations—bad habits that were createdunder the influence of the evil qualities implanted in the child by Satan.As God’s light is present in every being as the soul, so Satan is also presentin every man as ignorance, and has distinct regions of himself, called evilspirits. Because God is present in every being as soul, and Satan as an evilspirit, so each individual is influenced both by the soul and its goodqualities, and by Satan and his evil qualities. All good qualities in a beingcome from God and His reflection in the soul; all evil qualities come from Satanand his reflection, the devil who works in each being through his eviltendencies.It must be remembered that each soul is independent and free to act according tothe good influences of the soul and God and soulful qualities, or to act underthe influence of Satan’s evil qualities and Satan’s reflections, the devilswhich possess the being of man. The evil reflection of Satan in each manconstantly urges him to do wrong through prenatal tendencies and the false lureof evil temptations. God tries to influence a being through conscience andsoul-peace found in meditation. The great masters like Jesus can transmit theirlight of spirituality into a dark soul and thereby dislodge the specific evilspirit which is possessing it.All human beings do not do evil only through the influence of their prenatal orpostnatal bad habits, but also because they are consciously pushed by the evilresiding in the brain. The evil entity not only tempts a soul through evilqualities but also through his evil habits and tendencies. When the evil entityis dislodged from the brain by higher meditations and the help of theGuru-Preceptor, then a soul really becomes free. Jesus healed Mary Magdalenefrom several visitations of the evil forces which were trying to influence herto follow the path of false pleasure.Jesus once commanded the entities to take leave of sick souls and to enter intothe body of pigs who then perished in the sea. No amount of skin-deep “liberal”thinking can explain away these works of Jesus of casting out the devils.Because most modern theologians do not know anything about healing or castingout devils, that does not mean that the physical and mental and spiritualhealing of man is impossible or that casting out of devils is superstition.Great masters of course prefer healing the ignorance in man by theChrist-contact. Great souls can heal the ignorance in truth-seeking people bytransmitting their spiritual power. By higher concentration and meditation andby the contact of God, souls can actually dislodge the originator of evil, Satanand his entities, from the sacred sanctum of the inner body temples. Greatsaints, after illumination, have declared how the spirit entity of evil takesshape and leaves the body permanently, after highest spiritual attainment.When the evil entity leaves a man, he becomes not only absolutely impervious toevil but cannot see evil in anything anymore. He sees God alone everywhere. Ifone follows the technique of self-realization and develops himself with the helpof the preceptor-guru, then he will find the evil entity or devil leaving him.Such people who are entirely free from evil can show others how to be likewisefree.So, casting out devils, the originators and pioneers of evil working throughevil tendencies in man, should be cast out from ignorance-haunted souls. Everytrue preacher ought to know how he can heal ignorant souls, cast out their evilentities and open up the latent heaven within. The author has seen how histeacher cast out devils from other beings and healed so-called incurablesickness and preached through his exemplary living.An evil entity can be thrown out by constantly looking into the eyes of astricken individual, using steady, silent will power, continuously, inwardlycommanding the evil entity to leave.The evil entity will depart provided the will of the healer to get the evilforce out is stronger than the latter’s will to remain. Casting out devils is areal metaphysical way of freeing a soul forever from the influences of evilentities who have carried on their misery-dealing work through incarnations in asoul who has chosen to misuse his reason. One great revealing feature is this,that every soul must remember that although God speaks to him throughconscience, and although evil speaks to him through evil tendencies and evilqualities implanted within, still he is a free agent, free to act under theinfluence of God’s direction through conscience, or evil directions throughwrong habits.It should be borne in mind that when a soul acts according to the influence ofconscience or good qualities only then does he create good tendencies and goodhabits which automatically draw him toward God. Whenever an individual actsevilly under the influence of evil habits or evil qualities, then automaticallyhe is drawn toward Satan, ignorance and satanic ways. Good and evil actions canbe chosen by a soul but after he has acted in a good way or bad way he has nofree choice as to consequences. If he acts in a good way he must receive a goodresult and if he acts in an evil way he must receive an evil result.This explanation of good and evil clearly points out that man is not responsiblefor being tempted to do evil under the influence of anger, greed, or fearimplanted in him by Satan, but he is responsible if he chooses to act accordingto the temptations of the evil forces. Such temptations appear in man as evilimpulses and inner promptings to go wrong.If a man sits in a room full of light, beholding beautiful things, to him lightexists. If another man sits in the same room with eyes closed, to himself-created darkness exists. So, if a third person in the room asks them both:“Please tell us if it is light or dark in the room,” the answer would be thatthe first man sees light, because he has his eyes opened, while the second manwould say that it is dark because he has his eyes closed. Similarly, in thisuniverse there are two kinds of people. One kind have their eyes of wisdom open,and the second kind have their spiritual eyes closed. If anyone asks these twokinds of people whether there is good and evil, those that have their spiritualeyes of wisdom open will see God and God existing alone. And those that havetheir spiritual eyes closed will see Satan and evil existing everywhere.The above examples point out that man is responsible for harboring evil, but itmust be remembered that a man may keep his eyes open being asked to do so byanother man, and similarly he may close his eyes being asked to do so. In thissense, devotees are those souls who obey the wishes of God to keep the eyes ofwisdom open and behold only good, and evil persons are those who listen to thevoice of evil and keep their eyes of spirituality closed, thus beholding thedarkness of misery, sickness, and evil.The truth is that God or man is not the creator of evil but that this Satanicforce who used to be an archangel of God, being turned away from God, misusedhis will power, to create evil as a counterpart of all the good that God hascreated. It is for this reason that we find in each man opposite qualities—goodcreated by God, evil created by the devil; love created by God, hate created bySatan; kindness created by God, selfishness created by Satan; intoxication ofdivine ecstasy created by God, and intoxication of evil created by Satan.So, casting out devils is one of the greatest metaphysical arts known by themasters to teach a soul how to be free forever from the innate influences ofevil entities, by consciously establishing God.“And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of hisdisciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judea and Jerusalem, andfrom the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healedof their diseases; and they that were vexed with unclean spirits; and they werehealed. And the whole multitude sought to touch him; for there went virtue outof him, and healed them all.”(Luke 6:17-19)And Jesus, in Divine glory, with His twelve disciples, stood in the plainsbefore a great multitude of people. Many came to be healed of unclean spiritsand were healed. The whole multitude tried to touch Him, for virtue or lifeforce went out from the body of Jesus and burned out the bacteria in the sick.This all-healing energy was roused in the diseased individuals by their faithand reinforced with cosmic energy coming from the body of Jesus.The faith of the sick caused Jesus to send the all-healing energy out of hisbody and reinforce the healing energy present there (in the body of the diseasedindividual). The energy in the body Jesus and the energy in the body of thepersons healed both came from the cosmic energy of God. This energy is finerthan X-rays and has the power to destroy not only physical germs but mentalbacteria of evil tendencies and the soul bacteria of ignorance."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 9: Jesus Exhorts the Apostles to Follow God Consciousness“And another of his disciples said unto him, ‘Lord, suffer me first to go andbury my father.

Since you are my disciple andhave acknowledged God as your Father, you need not bury the dead body of yourfather which can be buried by so many spiritually dead people.”Jesus had elsewhere quoted the divine injunction: “Honor thy father and mother,”(Matt. 15:4) so he was not here teaching disrespect from a son to his father.Jesus said, ‘Let the dead bury their dead,” to his disciple only because thedisciple had changed his family relation and had been trained to be conscious ofhis real divine relation with Christ and humanity. Jesus was trying to remindthe disciple, when he wanted to bury his father, that it was more important forhim to be one with God by being in tune with his Christ-Consciousness than towaste time in the delusion that the burial of the father was necessary, whenthere were so many spiritually dead people ready to bury the useless dead bodyof the disciple’s father.In India it is the custom for the son to cremate his father or mother. He is thefirst one to put the fire in the funeral pyre where the dead relative lies. Buta Swami, who leaves his personal family and becomes identified with God’suniversal family, is not allowed to cremate any of his dead relatives, becausein this cosmic motion picture of the world, he no longer identifies himself withonly one single little family. A Swami thinks that as he belongs to God’s familyand does not cremate the dead of all families, why should he cremate the deadwho belong only to the family into which he was born?Of course, spiritually it is not a sin for a Swami to cremate his own relatives,for even the founder of the Swami Order, Swami Shankara, went against the letterof the rule of his order, and cremated his own mother. In that case, SwamiShankara was not attached to his mother, but because there was no one else tocremate her at the time of death, he came to perform that duty. It is said thatSwami Shankara produced divine fire to consume the body of his mother. A Swamiis not prevented from cremating any of his dead relatives if there is no oneelse to do so, but he is taught not to identify himself with the family in whichhe was born nor to follow its traditional rules, since he alters hisconsciousness from being a family member and becomes a member of the universalfamily.Jesus was also teaching his disciple to consider God first and to spend everymoment in God-contact, rather than put God-contact and meditation in the secondplace even when it was necessary to bury one’s dead father. The Heavenly Fatheris the giver of the earthly father and therefore the greatest honor andattention should be given to the Heavenly Father at all times. Jesus especiallyasked his disciple to follow Him in preference to burying his father because hewas a disciple who has changed his family relation and had entered intorelationship with Jesus and his divine family of the cosmos.It is also significant to note how Jesus emphasized that the physically dead aredead and the spiritually dead are also dead but do not know it. Jesus emphasizedthat the spiritually dead were greater objects of pity than the physically dead,for the physically dead having lost their earthly lives could not awakenthemselves to the teachings of Christ or truth, but the spiritually dead couldhardly be pardoned for deliberately making themselves dead to the life-giving,emancipating teachings of Christ.Jesus also assured the disciple that by following Him, who held the keys to themysteries of life and death, the disciple could do greater service to the soulof his dead father by his spiritual good will than he could by merely buryinghis physical frame."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 10: The First Miracle—Changing the Water into Wine“And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother ofJesus was there: And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, ‘They have nowine.’ Jesus saith unto her, ‘Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour isnot yet come.’”(John 2:1-4)Jesus addressed His mother as “woman” because He saw only the Divine Spirit asHis real mother and father, and His earthly mother as only a human being.“Woman, I can have nothing to do with thee, even though thou art my mother,until the right time comes for me to be directed by the Divine Power to act, andmanifest His glory.”Jesus did not perform the miracle of turning the water into wine just toaccommodate His mother, or to show His Divine Powers, but He performed themiracle in obedience to God’s direction.At the proper time, before people who have the possibility of Spiritualawakening, miracles are sometimes performed by Saints in order to bring peopleunto God. Saints usually prefer to draw people by the love of God and not bymiracles. That is why they seldom show their power. Miracles draw curiosityseekers, while the love of God draws highly-developed Souls. For that reasonJesus did not want to perform miracles until He was commanded by God to do so atthe right time.“His mother saith unto the servants, ‘Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.’ Andthere were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifyingof the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. Jesus saith unto them,‘Fill the waterpots with water.’”(John 2:5-7)At Divine intuitional suggestion, Jesus asked the servants to fill the waterpotsso that He could declare the glory of God by changing the water into wine.Besides, He had the pots filled with water before their eyes in order that theymight see it and know that it became wine through Divine Power and not throughmagic.“And they filled them up to the brim. And he saith unto them, ‘Draw out now, andbear unto the governor of the feast.’ And they bare it. When the ruler of thefeast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (butthe servants which drew the water knew); the governor of the feast called thebridegroom, And saith unto him, ‘Every man at the beginning doth set forth goodwine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou has keptthe good wine until now.’ This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana ofGalilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.”(John 2:7-11)The above sentence distinctly shows that the miracle of Jesus was not meant forthe gaze of curiosity seekers, but was meant to enhance the faith of thedisciples in God’s power over all things.Wine and the human body are equally made of electrons. It is the different rateof vibration of these electrons that constitutes the endless variety of materialforms. Jesus, being omnipresent in God, knew the metaphysical relation of matterto Divine Will. He demonstrated that one form of matter could be changed intoanother form, not only by chemical processes, but by the Universal Power ofMind. This miracle testifies to the fact that all matter is controlled by theone unifying and balancing power of Divine Intelligence and Will.By reacting to this Divine Intelligence, Jesus changed the arrangement ofelectrons and protons in the water and thus turned them into wine, which has adifferent specific gravity from water. The law of causation of all materialforms can be traced to the activity of electrons, but beyond that the sources ofthe law of cause and effect is lost. Scientists do not know why electrons andprotons rearrange themselves into different forms and create different kinds ofmatter.Herein lies room for a Divine Intelligence, says the scientist, inasmuch as itmust be that power which commands the subtle electronic and protonic bricks anddirects them to arrange themselves in different combinations, thus creatingdifferent substances."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 11: Jesus Purging the Temple—Driving Out Material Vibrations“After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, andhis disciples; and they continued there not many days. And the Jews’ Passoverwas at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, And found in the temple those thatsold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: And when hehad made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and thesheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew thetables; And said unto them that sold doves, ‘Take these things hence; make notmy Father’s house an house of merchandise.’ And his disciples remembered that itwas written, ‘The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.’”(John 2:12-17)Jesus was not suffering from anger while He was using the whip or cords to drivethe moneychangers from the temple. It was not the little cord, but thepersonality, the Divine vibration and the colossal Spiritual force behind it,which frightened away the moneychangers. Great prophets, though they areinternally free from anger, may use the semblance of anger to admonish andcorrect those who respond more to fear vibrations than to love vibrations.Jesus, who tells you to love enemies, shows by the above action that the DivineSaint also has power behind His meekness. No one dared to resist His SpiritualPower and determination, as was shown by the fact that a whole group ofable-bodied moneychangers fled before the power of a single, meek man.Jesus said that the House of God should be free from the contradictoryvibrations of material thoughts involved in buying and selling. He only meantthat according to the laws of concentration we should center our minds upon onething at a time. While in the house of God, we should concentrate upon Him, andthere should be nothing there to awaken material thoughts. He meant that buyingand selling should be carried on in the marked and not in the temple.There is a spiritual lesson in the above act of Jesus. The temple of mind,during prayer, should not be a place where the thoughts of material gainpersist. Many people, during prayer, carry in the background of their minds thethought of buying and selling of material things and the profit thereof. Jesussays this is disastrous because it brings neither God nor prosperity.During meditation, as often as the moneychangers of material thoughts come toyour mind, so often should you make a scourge of calmness, formed out of thegathered will power, acquired throughout life, and drive out the restlessmaterial thoughts from your temple.In the foregoing passages, it looks as if such a great Son of God, as Jesus,should not have become angry and made a scourge of cords with which to hit themoneychangers. In this action of Jesus it looks as if He contradicted His ownsaying: “But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smitethee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.” (Matt. 5:39.)Jesus used the cord more or less to scare these grow-up ignorant children of God(His brethren) and to send them away so that they could not desecrate the Houseof God. He meant that merchandise in the House of Prayer was a distraction, justas an altar and preaching in the shop would be a distraction. Jesus, in thisact, tried to show people that they should concentrate on one thing at a time.In the house of business they should think of selling articles. In the House ofGod they should think of Him. Besides, Jesus, with his little cord, didn’t hurtanyone, nor was He actually angry internally. He put on a show of anger tofrighten the big, naughty children who were trading in God’s House. If Jesus hadbeen really angry, He would have used His Divine powers to destroy thesedesecrators of God’s Temple.This is well illustrated by an old Hindu story. Once upon a time, long, longago, a venomous, vicious serpent used to live in a hole in the hill on theoutskirts of a village. A hermit of great miraculous power also made his home inthis village. Many of the villagers’ children, who ventured to play around thehill, were attacked by this vicious serpent and stung to death. The serpentextremely resented any noise around its dwelling. The villagers tried theirutmost to kill the serpent, but met with no success. Failing in this, thevillagers went in a body to their local hermit and asked him to find a remedy toprevent the death-dealing work of the serpent.Yielding to the legitimate prayers of the villagers, the hermit went near thehole in the hill, where the serpent resided, and by his spiritual powerssummoned the serpent to appear in his presence. The master hermit scolded theserpent for stinging the villagers’ children to death, and instructed him neverto bite again, but to practice loving his enemies.The hermit left the village for a year on a pilgrimage, and as he was returningto the village by way of the hill, he thought: “Let me see how my friend theserpent is behaving.” As he approached the hole in the hill, he found theserpent lying in front of the hole half dead with several stitches in his back.The hermit said: “Hello, Mr. Serpent, what’s all this?” The serpent dolefullywhispered: “Master, this is the result of practicing your teaching. Whenever Icame out of my hole in quest of food and minded my own business, the villageboys notice my docility and refusal to attack them, and then they threw smallstones at me, and when they found me running away from them they made it theirbusiness to throw big stones at me with the object of killing me. Master, Idodged many times, but also got badly hurt many times, and now I am lying herewith several stitches in my back because I have been trying to love my enemies.”Then the village hermit looked at him and said rebukingly: “Fool, I told you notto sting to death, but why didn’t you hiss and scare them away?”This story illustrates that a person, although meek and spiritual, should not bespineless or without common sense and allow himself to be made into a doormat.When provoked or unnecessarily attacked, the spiritual man should try to scarehis enemies away by a show of anger or strength, but without getting reallyangry internally. However, one should never hiss, even with a show of anger, ifhe has the tendency to bite or to materially injure anybody. That is what Jesusdid. He hissed at the moneychangers and scared them away, but did not injurethem or become really angry himself. Instead, he tried to put sense into them sothat they would not incur bad Karma (results of evil action) by blasphemyagainst the Temple of God.Jesus said: “Take these material things away, for they spread materialvibrations and evoke material thoughts. In the Temple of God people should thinkonly of possessing the imperishable Infinite, but if material articles are soldin the Temple, they arouse, in the spiritual novice, thoughts of greed anddesire for possessing perishable material things and distract him from God.”Jesus knew the law of vibration, which is that each object or person throws outa magnetic vibration, thus producing specific thoughts. The vibration of acandle in the church throws out the symbolical thought of unruffled peace or ofthe light of Wisdom, whereas, oxen in the church remind one of the slaughterhouse or of farm labor and so forth. Jesus signified that the church should beso equipped that it would emanate only spiritual vibrations.Jesus distinctly advises that churches should be places of worship and notplaces for the sale of material thought-arousing objects. It is all right tosell Bibles or books in the Temples if they are sold with a spirit of renderingcontinuous spiritual service. Using the proceeds from the sale of spiritualbooks in order to print more spiritual books, or using the money for some otherspiritual purpose, is all right.“THE ZEAL OF THINE HOUSE HATH EATEN ME UP.”The disciples corroborated the words of Jesus with scriptural sayings, whichintimate that the material zeal or vibration swallows up the spiritual vibrationof God.“Then answered the Jews and said unto him, ‘What sign shewest thou unto us,seeing that thou doest these things?’ Jesus answered and said unto them,‘DESTROY THIS TEMPLE, AND IN THREE DAYS I WILL RAISE IT UP.’”(John 2:17-19)The Jews wanted a Divine Proof that He was of God, since Jesus took upon Himselfthe responsibility of driving the moneychangers from the Temple. In other words,the Jews meant that it was illegal for Jesus to drive away the moneychangersunless He had Divine authority greater than human laws to do so.It is beautiful to see that Jesus accepted this challenge in a peculiar Divineway. He did not employ a new miracle to convince the Jews of His greatness. Hesimply told them what was going to happen. Jesus was not in a hurry to convinceHis enemies. He only said this to demonstrate the wish and work of God in Hislife. Jesus thought that no other proof of His divinity could be greater thanthe telling about a future event in which God was to perform themiracle-of-miracles by rebuilding His crucified body after three days.Human nature is composed of three qualities; namely, good, evil, and activatingqualities. The soul of man has three dresses: the ideational, astral, andphysical, just as we put on an undergarment, a suit, and an overcoat. The Soulof man can only be liberated from the bondage of mortal Karma and limitationwhen it rises above the desires of the physical, Astral, and Spiritual bodies.It takes three distinct efforts for the Soul to leave the physical, Astral, andIdeational bodies.Some people take years and many incarnations to accomplish this, but Jesus knew,advanced as He was, that He would be able to liberate His Soul from thelimitations of three bodies by three distinct efforts in three days, and wouldbe able to unite it with the unlimited power of the Spirit.It is only when Souls, by desirelessness, are free of the limitations of thesethree bodies that they are not compelled to remain in the Astral or toreincarnate in the physical. It is then that they are imbued with the power ofGod to re-create any dead body, even as He can. Jesus knew that once He was outof the three bodies, he would demonstrate His Oneness with the Father, and Hispowers, by re-creating His crucified body as no one could except His HeavenlyFather.There is a story that the East Indian Saint, Kabir, told his Hindu andMohammedan disciples that he would never die, and yet, when he lay in his coffindead, the first thing his Hindu and Mohammedan disciples did was to doubt thetruth of his saying about his deathlessness, and they began to fight with oneanother. The Hindus wanted to cremate his dead body and the Mohammedans insteadupon entombing it.At last they fought so hard that their Master Kabir could not keep still anylonger and he broke the after-death, paramount vow of silence and rose up in hiscoffin and rebuked his disciples. “Look, you dreamt that I was dead. Lo! I ameven living in the body. Since I told you not to fight about anything and thenyou quarreled about my dead dream body, I will convert it into the same DivineCosmic Dream from which it came.” Saying this, and blessing them, he said:“Whatever is left in the coffin, half of that bury, and half of it cremate.”When the disciples lifted the coffin lid, they found that their Master haddematerialized the body and left in its stead a few golden flowers. The Hinduscremated half of these flowers and the Mohammedans buried the remaining half.It is said from an authoritative source that our great Guru (preceptor) ShyamaCharan Lahiri Mahasaya of India consciously left his body when his life work wasfinished, and that he appeared again in the flesh in three places.Great saints of India, who have lived knowing and contacting God in their lives,have been known to raise their bodies after death both before and after the timeof Christ. It is reported that some saints, like our greatest Guru Babaji, neverexperience the so-called human death, but keep their bodies for centuries, andthrough Eternity, enjoying communion as the Infinite God and as the specificfinite body.One can see the ocean without the waves, or one can see the ocean as the oceanin the waves. Likewise, some souls see God without the finite body or anydelusive waves of Creation, and yet others may behold God as the Infinite becomethe finite, or the body. In the latter case, the soul beholds God become thewave of one or more souls. Babaji, the great Guru, experiences himself not apartfrom God, but perceives that He has become Babaji, you, and me, and allmanifestation. In the ultimate experience, one does not lose his Soul orindividuality. One only expands it and finds that God has become one’s soul.The little Soul-Wave, tossed by the storm of dark ignorance, finds itselfisolated from the Ocean of Spirit, but when the sunshine of highest wisdomcomes, the little Soul-Wave finds that the Ocean of Spirit has become theSoul-Wavelet."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 12: How to be Born Again in Christ—Lifting the Kundalini“Then said the Jews, ‘Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wiltthou rear it up in three days?’ But he spake of the temple of his body. Whentherefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had saidthis unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus hadsaid.“Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, in the feast day, many believedin his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. But Jesus did not commithimself unto them, because he knew all men, And needed not that any shouldtestify of man: for he knew what was in man.“There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: Thesame came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, ‘Rabbi, we know that thou art ateacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, exceptGod be with him.’ Jesus answered and said unto him, ‘Verily, verily, I say untothee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.’“Nicodemus saith unto him, ‘How can a man be born when he is old? can he enterthe second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?’ Jesus answered, ‘Verily,verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, hecannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh;and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said untothee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearestthe sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; sois every one that is born of the Spirit’.”(John 2:20-25; John 3:1-8)The Jews misinterpreted the saying of Jesus about raising the temple in threedays. Naturally they wondered how Jesus could rebuild the temple of Jerusalem inthree days if it were destroyed, when it took forty-six years to build it thefirst time. His raising the body after death was much more wonderful thanrebuilding a broken temple in three days would have been.At the Passover many believed in Jesus because of His miracles, but Jesus didnot count upon man’s testimony for the spread of His message. He went onpreaching His gospel, being impelled by His Infinite Force.Nicodemus visited Jesus secretly in the night, for he was afraid of socialcriticism. Yet it took a lot of courage, faith, and sincere curiosity for him toseek Jesus. Upon meeting, Jesus declared that only Divine Beings, who had actualGod-contact, could work the super-laws which govern the inner life of all beingsand things.Jesus, in his answer to Nicodemus in the following way: “VERILY, VERILY, I SAYUNTO THEE, EXCEPT A MAN BE BORN AGAIN, HE CANNOT SEE THE KINGDOM OF GOD,”suggests the way in which we can contact God and the way in which Jesuscontacted God. Jesus meant that only super-Beings who contact God can performmiracles, and that anyone can contact God and can perform miracles if he is borna second time.In the Hindu Scriptures the newly born child is called Kayastha, which means“body-bound”. The two physical eyes in the child are given by its physicalparents to look into alluring matter, but when the child grows older, and at theage of seven, or later, is initiated, his Spiritual Eye is opened by hisSpiritual father, or Preceptor. Through the help of his Preceptor, the initiatecan use this telescopic eye to see Spirit, and then he is called Dwija, or thetwice-born, or the Brahmin, or the one who knows Brahma or Spirit.Alas, even in India this initiation from the body consciousness to the Spiritualconsciousness has become just a formal ceremony performed by the priests, whoonly baptize in water, but great Hindu Masters baptize the body in Spirit. Johnthe Baptist also said that he baptized with water, but that Jesus was to baptizewith Spirit.Jesus meant that the ordinary consciousness is tied to the flesh, and thatthrough the two physical eyes and senses, with their limited powers ofperception, man can see only into the tiny playhouse of this earth.When a person is flying in an airplane, he sees no walls but only the vastnessof limitless space and free skies, but if he is suddenly locked up in a littlecage surrounded by walls he loses sight of all the vision of vast space.Likewise, when man’s Soul is thrown out of the vast eternal Spirit into thelittle bodily cage, he beholds nothing but the limitations of matter and thelittle earth experiences. So, Jesus said, with the modern scientists, that wecan see and know as much as our limited power of the senses allow. Just as, by atwo-inch telescope, the details of the distant stars cannot be seen, so Jesussaid that man cannot know anything about the Astral world by using only thelimited power of his senses.Scientists tell us that if the powers of the senses were expanded, the earthwould look much more beautiful and would be full of colors and blinding lightsof glow-worm-like atoms.Jesus said that after man’s Soul is born in water or protoplasm, and then byself-development is born again through the awakening of the sixth sense,intuition, and the opening of the Spiritual Eye, his illumined Soul goes out ofthe body and can then enter into the Kingdom of God.Just as, by a 200-inch telescope, a man can enter into the vast region ofstar-peopled space, so by developing the intuitional sense through meditation hecan enter the Kingdom of God and behold the birthplace of thoughts, stars, andSouls.Jesus meant that body-bound Souls can see nothing but limited matter through thesmall outer windows of their senses. It is only when Soul opens the inner windowof Oneness with the Spirit by meditation that he can enter into the perceptionof the vastness of omnipresent Spirit.Jesus said that the body born of flesh has the limitations of the flesh, whereasthe Soul born of the Spirit, has potentially limitless powers. The ordinary manknows himself as so many pounds of flesh. Such a person, being born of flesh,sees nothing but flesh or matter in and around him, but when by meditation theSoul’s mind is transferred from the body to the invisible powerful presence ofthe Soul, then it realizes its Oneness with the eternal Spirit and not with thelimited body. Jesus said, as the Hindu Masters have said, that man has to beborn in body and in Spirit in order to know God.Nicodemus could not see how a Soul could be born twice, so asked Jesus if Hemeant that old men could reincarnate in their mother’s bodies and become youngagain. Jesus was not talking of reincarnation; that is, of a second birth afterone birth and death. He was explaining how a Soul in one life could be bornentangled in the flesh and sense limitations, and then by meditation couldacquire a new birth in Cosmic Consciousness.The matter-bound Soul, lifted into the Spirit by God-contact, is born a secondtime in Spirit. Here the body remains the same, only the Soul’s consciousness,instead of roaming on the material plane, enters into the eternally joyousKingdom of the Spirit.Jesus was describing a metaphysical law of pneumena (substance or cause) andphenomena (the appearances of substances or effect) when He compared the Spirit,and the Souls emerging from it, with the visible wind and its presence, declaredby its sound. Just as the source of the wind is hidden, and is known by itssound, so the Spirit substance is invisible, hidden beyond the grasp of humanssenses, and the birth of Souls from the Spirit is the visible phenomena. By thesound, the invisible wind is known. By the birth of intelligent Souls, theinvisible Spirit is manifest.Jesus was only stating that as it is difficult to find the source of the wind,so it is difficult to find the Spirit source from which all things come. Jesussaid that all Souls born of Spirit are known by their existence, but very fewknow all about the Spirit source from which they come.“Nicodemus answered and said unto him, ‘How can these things be?’ Jesus answeredand said unto him, ‘Art thou a master of Israel and knowest not these things?Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that wehave seen; and ye receive not our witness. If I have told you earthly things,and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? Andno man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even theSon of man which is in heaven.’“‘And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son ofman be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but haveeternal life. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son thatwhosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For Godsent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world throughhim might be saved.’“‘He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not iscondemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begottenSon of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, andmen loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. Foreveryone that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest hisdeeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that hisdeeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.’”(John 3:9-21)Jesus told Nicodemus that it took more than being a master of the house ofIsrael to know the mysteries of life. Nicodemus was informed by Jesus that thespiritual things which He was describing were known only by intuitiveexperience. “WE SPEAK THAT WE DO KNOW” means something deeper than the knowledgederived through the senses of understanding. Human knowledge percolates throughthe senses, understanding, and intuition.The senses are limited in their powers, so is understanding, which depends uponthe senses for its data. If the senses lie, the conclusion drawn by theunderstanding on that data is also incorrect. If you see in the distance a whitecloth that looks like a ghost, you conclude that there is a ghost, but comingnearer to the object you discover the error of your conclusion.The senses and understanding are the outer doors through which knowledge of thepneumena, or the eternal substance, percolates into the Soul. The senses andunderstanding are deluded because they do not know or see the real nature of allcreated things. Jesus, with his intuition, knew the real nature of the Cosmosand of life, so He said authoritatively: “We do know.”Jesus regretted that Nicodemus doubted the intuitional experiences of the Christstate, and He said to Nicodemus: “If I tell you about matters pertaining tohuman Souls who are visibly present on earth, and how they can enter into theKingdom of God, and you believe not, then how can you believe me if I tell youabout happenings in Heaven or the Astral realm, which are completely hidden fromthe ordinary human gaze?”Jesus went on to say that no man can ascend to Heaven except the one who camedown from Heaven. A man is composed of a Soul and the three ideational, astral,and spiritual bodies. Just as the little threads of flame coming through theholes of a gas burner are all individualized flames coming out of the one flameunder the burner plate, so also Souls are individualized Spirit. The one flameof Spirit lies under all things and comes out through each human Soul andthrough every living thing.The threads of flame first come out of one big flame, and when the light is putout they go back to the same flame. To do that, the little flames have to comeout of the big flame. This illustrates what Jesus said about Souls ascending anddescending from Heaven. The Spirit projects the desire, then the Soul projectsthe idea of the body, then the idea becomes energy or Astral body, and theAstral body becomes condensed into the physical body.It has been described before that Heaven is behind space, hiding the limitationsof the senses. This Heavenly region is the abode of all Astral forces andangels. Thus Jesus said that no physical body could get back into the AstralKingdom which did not in the first place come out of the Astral plane. In otherwords, all men were first created as Souls with Astral bodies in the HeavenlyAstral Kingdom. From there they were projected into matter as men with physicalbodies. Then the logical conclusion is that all supermen who conquered materialdesires and were promoted back to Heaven were originally in Heaven and hadfallen from there through earthbound desires.Jesus spoke of a very strange truth when He said: “Even the Son of Man which isin heaven.” Jesus often used the phrase, “Son of Man” whenever he referred toHis own or to any physical body. So Jesus said that the Son of Man, His ownphysical body, could exist in the finer Astral kingdom as well as on the earth.The highest Hindu Yoga Scripture tells how some Yogis have power to appear intwo places at the same time in two similar bodies. It is said that some Yogisnever die, but carry their bodies into the Spirit, and never lose theirpersonality or individuality.Just as the ocean and the wave can exist together, so some saints with theirbodies are said to exist externally in God without ever melting the bodily formin the Cosmic Ocean. Other saints are said to become One with the Spirit anddissolve the bodily wave in the Spiritual Ocean. Such Saints only materializetheir bodies when they want to come on earth to bring back deluded Souls untoGod.Jesus spoke of His body which dwelt simultaneously in the Astral and thephysical worlds because He was conscious of both His physical body and Astralbody. Ordinary Souls behold their bodies roaming only on the earth, but advancedsouls, like Jesus, can see their souls simultaneously present in the physicaland in the Astral Kingdoms. This is also proven by the fact that, although Jesusexperienced death as the Son of Man, or physical body, still He was conscious ofthe Astral Kingdom all the time, and after death He raised his physical body andtook it back to Heaven.The Soul is encased in the Idea body of thirty-four ideas.The Soul is encased in the Idea body through delusion. This Idea body, throughdesires, is tied to the Astral body; and the Astral body is fitted in alldetails to the finest mechanisms of the physical body. The Astral body is tiedto the physical body in the brain and in the six plexuses. The last tie whichbinds the Astral body to the physical body is the attachment emanating through acoiled knot at the base of the spine, called by Hindu Saints, the Kundalini orSerpent Force. Jesus spoke of this Serpent being lifted by Moses in thewilderness. That is, Moses, in the wilderness of silence, by deep meditation,learned the art of relaxing or of consciously withdrawing the Astral body fromthe physical body by first doing away with bodily attachment, and then byreversing the Astral current from the senses to the spine, Godward, through thecoiled passage at the base of the spine. Unless one knows how to open thiscoiled knot of Astral and physical power at the base of the spine, one cannotenter into the Astral Kingdom.Jesus said that each Son of Man, or each bodily consciousness, must be liftedfrom the plane of the senses to the Astral Kingdom by reversing the Life Forcethrough the serpent-like coiled passage at the base of the spine. Every time youmeditate deeply, you automatically reverse the Life Force and consciousness frommatter to God. This helps to loosen the Astral and physical knot at the base ofthe spine.Few people know about this Kundalini and often confuse it with sex force. Thatis why so many ignorant teachers make a mystery about it and frighten theirgullible disciples by telling them that it is dangerous to awaken this LifeForce (Kundalini). It takes years of meditation under the guidance of acompetent Teacher-Guru before one can dream of releasing the Astral from itsbondage to the physical by awakening the Kundalini."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 13: The Only Begotten Son—The Christ Intelligence“‘And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son ofman be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but haveeternal life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.’”(John 3:14-16)Moses, and Jesus Himself, along with the Hindu Yogis, knew the secret ofscientific spiritual life. That is why they unanimously said that allphysically-minded people must know the art of lifting up the serpent force inorder to accomplish the first retracing of the inward steps toward the Spirit.Jesus said that whosoever believes in the doctrine of lifting the bodilyconsciousness (Son of Man) from the physical to the Astral body reversing theLife Force through the coiled passage at the base of the spine, will not perish,that is, be subject to mortal changes of life and death, but will graduallyacquire the changeless Eternal state.Jesus emphasized here that His disciples, or people who would believe in HisSpirit as manifested in Him as Son of Man, or physical body, would know the artof lifting the serpent force in the silence and would see the path to Eternallife. But Jesus realized that His physical body was to remain on the earth planefor a little while only, so He said that in His absence people would be able tofind God.This confusion between Son of Man, Son of God, and Only Begotten Son, hascreated much bigotry in the followers of Churchianity, who never want toacknowledge the human element in Jesus and that Jesus was a God-man who evolvedand became God Himself. If Jesus were God Himself from the beginning, then Hislife and His struggles before crucifixion and the cross were nothing but DivineActing. However, a superman Jesus, who, by spiritual discipline became GodHimself through His efforts, stirs more hope of salvation in the human heartthan a God-manufactured Jesus. No doubt a God-made Jesus could conquertemptation, and while on the cross could say: “Father, forgive them, for theyknow what they do” (Luke 23:34), but how could this be expected of a human beingof manifold frailties?Before and after the coming and passing of Jesus, Sons of God existed. Jesusnever set a limit to time. He Himself said: “All those who received Him, to themHe gave the power to become the Sons of God “(John 1:12). As the sunlight shinesequally on the diamond and on the charcoal, so also, God sheds His light equallyon the diamond and the charcoal mentalities. The difference is that thebelieving diamond mentalities receive and reflect the rays of God more than thedoubting charcoal mentalities. So, all Souls who, by meditation, become pure andtransparent, will be able to receive and reflect God and be called Sons of God.Each Soul who leaves delusion and becomes One with God is termed a Son of God.Jesus was the big brother, beloved of God, who was sent on earth to redeemdesire-deluded brothers, and to urge them to become like Him. Potentially, weare all Sons of God, only we have to manifest that by self-discipline, even asJesus did.Not the body of Jesus, but the consciousness within it was one with the OnlyBegotten Son, or Only Reflection of God, the Father, in Creation.Jesus said that when His body (Son of Man) was gone from the earth, people couldstill find salvation by believing and knowing the Only Begotten Son of God.To fully understand the meaning of the expression the “Only Begotten Son,” oneshould read again the earlier chapters of this book for only a short summary canbe given here.The Spirit is unmanifested Absolute—ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Joy.When He projects Creation, He becomes three: (1) God, the Father, (2) the OnlyBegotten Son, and (3) the Holy Ghost. God, the Father, is the Spirit andIntelligence which remains indirectly active beyond Creation (Cosmic Vibration).The transcendental God, the Father, has only one reflected, directly activeIntelligence (or the Only Begotten Son) working in the Holy Ghost, or increative vibratory matter (Virgin Mary).The consciousness in the body of Jesus was not confined to the physical, but wasidentified with the Only Begotten Intelligence of God, the Father, in allCreation. Just as the waves change on the bosom of the changeless ocean, so allvibratory waves of Creation dance and change on the bosom of this Only BegottenChrist Intelligence.Jesus, the man, was one with the Only Reflected, Only Begotten ChristIntelligence in all matter. He referred to this changeless Only Begotten ChristConsciousness within himself and in the hearts of all true Souls of all ages.Jesus said that all good Souls, who lift their physical consciousness (son ofman consciousness) to the Astral plane and become One with the Only BegottenChrist Intelligence in all Creation, will know Eternal life.Souls on the material plane perish, or witness the change of life and death,just as men watching ocean waves see the constant change on the surface of theocean; but Souls who concentrate upon the Only Begotten, Only Reflectedchangeless ocean of Christ Intelligence do not perceive change anymore thanwould a man who concentrates upon the ocean itself see any change, though thewaves come and go.It is this Only Reflected Christ Intelligence in all matter which is the saviorof all. Souls tuning in with this Universal Christ Consciousness can releasetheir consciousness encased in the body and plunge it into the vastness of theOcean of Omnipresence.This Christ Intelligence is the Only Reflected Intelligence existing between Godand matter, through which all matter-formed individuals, irrespective ofdifferent castes and creeds, must pass in order to reach God. This OnlyReflected Christ Intelligence in all matter is the only savior of all mankindthroughout all ages. Jesus never referred to his son-of-man consciousness, or tohis body, as the only savior throughout all time. People, like Abraham andothers, were saved even before Jesus was born. It is a metaphysical error tospeak of the body of Jesus as the only savior, or Only Begotten Son.God did not reflect His pure Christ Intelligence in all matter in order to letit act like an eternal detective to punish man. This Christ Intelligence is inthe bosom of every Soul, whether sinful or virtuous, waiting with infinitepatience for it to wake up in meditation and be redeemed through Him.The person who believes in this Christ Intelligence Saviour is not tortured byerror, but the person who laughs at this thought is condemned to remain steepedin ignorance and to suffer until wakes up. Unbelievers remain body-bound, and donot desire to seek the only path of salvation, through the Christ Intelligence."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 14: Healing"},{"pageContent":"SPIRITUAL HEALING—THE WOMAN OF SAMARIA“Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcelof ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesustherefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it wasabout the sixth hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saithunto her, ‘Give me to drink.’ (For his disciples were gone away into the city tobuy meat.)“Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, ‘How is it that thou, being a Jew,asketh drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? For the Jews have no dealingswith the Samaritans.’ Jesus answered and said unto her, ‘If thou knewest thegift of God, and who it is that saith unto thee, ‘Give me to drink,’ thouwouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.’”(John 4:5-10)It is evident that Jesus, like all great prophets, reincarnated at the same timeas His great disciples of past lives. Jesus brought along with him his twelvedisciples. They had qualified themselves in past incarnations and so were fit tobe close disciples of Jesus in His inner circle. As has been shown in a previouschapter, John the Baptist was the Guru-Preceptor of Jesus in a formerincarnation and He acknowledge him as such by saying: “This is the way of allrighteousness,” meaning that the ultimate path of righteousness can only befound by following the directions of the Guru, or the vehicle chosen by God tobring the devotee disciples to His Kingdom. When one has spasmodic desires toknow God, he meets Spiritual teachers, but when one whole-heartedly wishes toknow the Almighty, God chooses the spirituality and intelligence of a human Guruto bring the devotee unto Him.Jesus knew the difference between disciples of a past incarnation and those whocame to him for the first time for enlightenment. However, the betrayal by Judasshows that even close disciples of a great Master like Jesus are by no meanscompletely perfect. That is why the Guru-Preceptor has to come back on earthvoluntarily until all his disciples become liberated. The Soul of theGuru-Preceptor and the Soul of the disciple enter into an everlasting covenantof friendship that they will come back on earth for one another until both Soulsare finally redeemed. Sometimes, the real Guru-Preceptor, instead of coming onearth, appears in vision to redeem the disciple.It appears that Jesus purposely planned to go to Samaria and sat on Jacob’s welland knowingly asked the low-caste woman of Samaria to give him a drink. ThisSamaritan woman was a morally lost disciple of some past incarnation whom Jesuscame to redeem. Her truthfulness, when admitting the fact that she had nohusband because she had five, shows the genuine quality of her Soul. Herdegradation was temporary and lay like a clay-crust over the hidden glow of herpure truth-loving Soul.We see that the people in the time of Jesus differentiated between the highcaste Jews and the low-caste Samaritans. All castes originate in the vocationswhich people follow. In India, those who worshipped God, or the clergy, werecalled Brahmins; the soldiers were called Kshatriyas; the business-men, Baisyas;the laborers, such as sweepers, and so forth, were called Sudras or Kayasthas.The first three castes intermarried and ate together, but had nothing to do withthe last caste because of their filthy mode of living.This caste division became rigid in time, and instead of being based on qualityand vocation, began to be based on heredity. This permanently excluded aneducated Spiritual Sudra, no matter how great he was, from socially minglingwith Brahmins, no matter how spiritually degenerated they were. A son of Brahminclaimed to be a Brahmin even though he never worshipped God and even though heled the life of a Sudra (low caste individual.)A son of a soldier claimed to be a Kshatriya, even though he never saw a weapon.This brought the downfall of India, for when the soldiers lost out in battleagainst foreign aggressors, the Brahmins and Baisyas refused to fight. Realcaste should be elastic and should be governed by the principal vocation of anindividual. This caste rigidity, in spite of its manifold evils, protected theAryan stock from getting mixed with all kinds of foreign races.Intermarriage between people of equal culture is productive of some good,according to the law of eugenics. A Brahmin, when he fights, should be called asoldier or Kshatriya, and a soldier, when he adopts the vocation of preaching,should be called Brahmin. Likewise, a man of low caste, when he becomesillumined, should be called Brahmin.There is an esoteric significance about the four castes which consists in thefour states of consciousness of a devotee who aspires to know God. When heremains identified with his body, or engrossed in flesh pleasures, he is calledKayastha (Kaya sthita manah jasya—one whose mind is settled on the flesh). Whenthe devotee begins to cultivate his mind or starts the business of acquiringSpiritual wealth, he is called Baisya, or businessman. All individuals whoprincipally carry on the Spiritual business of self-improvement are calledBaisyas.In the third state, the devotee fights with the senses for Spiritual victory andis then said to have reached the Kshatriya state. Any individual who passes hislife warring with temptation is called a Kshatriya, or Spiritual soldier. Lastof all, when the devotee knows Brahmin or Spirit, he is said to be in theBrahmin state. Any individual who remains identified with the Supreme Spiritshould be called Brahmin.You see, the above Spiritual caste system does not prevent any low caste or anyindividual from being called a Brahmin if he qualitatively proves himself to beone, but the hereditary caste system is selfish and unjust and uses heredity tobroadcast evil and division and thus should be abolished.Jesus knew no artificial race barrier, as the woman of Samaria understood it,and therefore he asked her for a drink. He also asked her for a drink in orderto get acquainted with her when the disciples were gone, so that he could giveher the everlasting elixir of life without disturbance.Jesus hinted to the woman of Samaria (when He said: “If thou knewest the gift ofGod and who it is that saith to thee,”) that God had gifted her in previousincarnations with the greatest of all gifts, a Divine Savior (Guru) who hadfollowed her to this life to redeem her. Jesus was trying to awaken the dormantmemory of the past in his fallen disciple. Thus Jesus meant that if she knewthat her Guru of the past was asking for the drink, she would, instead, haveasked Him for the living water of God’s contact.“The woman saith unto him, ‘Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well isdeep: from whence, then, hast thou that living water? Art thou greater than ourfather Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and hischildren, and his cattle?’ Jesus answered and saith unto her,“‘WHOSOEVER DRINKETH OF THIS WATER SHALL THIRST AGAIN: BUT WHOSOEVER DRINKETH OFTHE WATER THAT I SHALL GIVE HIM SHALL NEVER THIRST; BUT THE WATER THAT I SHALLGIVE HIM SHALL BE IN HIM A WELL OF WATER SPRINGING UP INTO EVERLASTING LIFE’.”(John 4:11-14)The woman of Samaria steeped in ignorance, could not yet understand what Jesusmeant by “living water,” hence her foolish question: “From whence, then hastthou the living water?”Jesus, to elucidate what he meant by “LIVING WATER,” said in effect that:“Whosoever drinks of the material water will live by material food only and willdie with that consciousness. He will have to reincarnate again due to thepresence of material desires accompanying the Soul after death. To die,depending upon material water and food, will bring the Soul back to the earthagain because of a latent thirst for material things in the heart.”Jesus said that whosoever drinks of the fountain of Eternal Bliss in God willhave all the thirst of desires of all his incarnations quenched forever. SuchGod-drinking Souls, finding the everlasting well of Bliss within themselves, arenever thirsty for the satisfaction of mortal desires or mortal life. Mortaldesires promise happiness and then always give sorrow instead.The Soul cannot find its lost happiness in material things, though it seekscomfort in them. The Soul, losing its contact with God-Bliss, tries to satisfyitself by pseudo-sense pleasures. The Soul of even the most worldly person isinwardly conscious of its lost supernal Bliss, and that is why it can neverremain satisfied for long with temporary sense pleasures only, no matter howalluring they may be. The worldly man goes on searching for his lost happinessin God by flying from one sense pleasure to another. At last, when he suffersfrom satiety, he begins to seek God-Bliss within, where alone it can be found.If one loses a diamond and tries to satisfy himself with little pieces of brokenglass, shining with sunlight, he is bound to be disillusioned. He cannot findthe diamond in the pile of broken glass. He is seeking in the wrong place and socan never be happy unless he seeks in the right place and finds the diamond. Inthe same way, the Soul tries to find its happiness in the momentarily glitteringsense pleasures, but when it has enough of sense happiness it becomes disgustedand tries to find peace and joy in the Soul.This is the supreme reason why people should seek happiness in God and not inmaterial things. It is foolish to expect true happiness from material things,for they are powerless to give it, and yet, many millions of people die ofbroken hearts trying vainly to find the comfort in material things which Godalone can impart in the temple of meditation.“The woman saith unto him, ‘Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neithercome hither to draw.’ Jesus saith unto her, ‘Go, call thy husband, and comehither.’“The woman answered and said, ‘I have no husband.’ Jesus saith unto her, ‘Thouhast well said, “I have no husband.” For thou hast had five husbands; and hewhom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.’”(John 4:15-18)After hearing about the water of everlasting life, the woman of Samaria becamedesirous of getting it, for she wanted to quench her mortal thirst forever.Jesus wanted to test the character of his fallen disciple, the woman of Samaria.He wanted to find out the degree of her degradation, so he asked her to call herhusband, and when Jesus heard her say that she had no husband, he was pleased.Insincerity, prevarication, and treachery toward a Guru-Preceptor are thegreatest sins, for these are deliberate transgressions and, as such, are greaterevils than flesh transgressions, which are to a considerable extent due toinstinctive compulsion.Some Souls, due to such transgressions in a past life, are born with acompelling inclination, which overrules almost all sense of shame, churchthreats, moral sense, social discomfiture, or efforts toward self-control. SuchSouls can be helped if they sincerely confess their faults, that is, let theirSpiritual doctor diagnose their moral disease and give mental and moral strengthand advice, which, if followed, will remedy the malady.The disciple who practices insincerity toward his Guru-Preceptor, not only hidesmoral disease, but refuses the healing help of the Master. In this way anerror-stricken disciple makes his moral transgression grow upon him. To hide themoral disease from the Spiritual doctor is extremely dangerous to Spiritualhealth.Jesus openly manifested his omniscient knowledge by saying to his former fallendisciple: “Thou hast had five husbands.” This mental miracle was performed toconvince a fallen disciple who, in a former incarnation, had already shown herfaithfulness to the Master.A Master very seldom attracts a new Soul by a mental miracle other than by theexpression of the love of God, but everything is right in its own place. Thewoman of Samaria witnessed this omniscient power of Jesus because she confessedto a Master, and the Master, out of compassion, let her know that what she toldhim was in safe hands. This is the reason why Jesus spoke out and proved to herthat He already knew what she told him and that he was satisfied with herveracity, and that she had passed the test of true discipleship.No matter how sinful a disciple is, he can be saved if he is sincere and loyalto his Master. This display of a miracle was not performed by Jesus in order tosatisfy the mental curiosity of a stranger, but to lift a fallen disciple. Thus,the witnessing of the miracle had a salutary effect on the woman of Samaria."},{"pageContent":"THE INNER JERUSALEM“The woman saith unto him, ‘Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. Our fathersworshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place wheremen ought to worship’.”(John 4:19-20)Thus the woman of Samaria was convinced that Jesus was a prophet of the God, andthen she asked Him if Jerusalem or the mountains where her forefathersworshipped was the right place to worship.“Jesus saith unto her, ‘Woman, believe me, the hour cometh when ye shall neitherin this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. Ye worship ye knownot what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. But the hourcometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spiritand in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: andthey that worship him must worship Him in spirit and in truth’.”(John 4:21-24)Herein Jesus spoke of the inner Jerusalem of Self-Realization, the sacredmountain of meditation, where true Souls, devout devotees of God, worship Him inthe temple of true Spiritual communion. Though the quiet top of mountains andholy places, sanctified by the presence of Masters, are also fit places ofworship, yet they are of no use to restless, materially-minded people. Manyworldly people have built temples on hilltops and lived in places of pilgrimageonly to make those places dens of matter-worship. That is why Jesus said thattrue worshippers find God in the temple of omnipresence and worship Him not inthe imaginary communion of Silence, but in the true communion of Spiritualperception.Millions of people today worship God in temples and churches, and in holycities, without ever knowing Him. The reason is obvious. God can only be foundin the temple of true intuition, the tabernacle of deep meditation. Jesusdistinctly spoke of the difference between the theological priestly ceremoniousworship God and the saintly way of worshiping God in the temple of intuition. Agorgeous temple worth millions of dollars could not lure God by its display ofwealth, although it might draw an audience of aristocratic people who love toworship God in the comfort of flesh on cushioned velvet seats.The omnipresent God, who lives in the temple of the Cosmos, with the star-deckeddome of Eternity, illumined by suns and moons, cannot be lured into thepride-created atomic church of man. In fact, thousands of ministers are soengrossed by church property and the church business of keeping the religiouscustomers together that they forget to meditate and thus establish the church ofGod within themselves.To worship God on mountains or in holy places is useless unless one really findsHim in the Spirit. Though God is manifest everywhere, He is in essence presentbehind the veil of Nature. The devotee has to lift the veil of Nature and seeGod first that way. After that, the devotee can see God behind Nature. So Jesussaid that most people do not know what they worship, but that true devotees, whoworship God in the temple of meditation, truly commune with His omnipresentSpirit, and therefore they know what He is and where He can be communed with.Jesus also said: “GOD IS A SPIRIT: AND THEY THAT WORSHIP HIM MUST WORSHIP HIM INSPIRIT AND IN TRUTH.”SPIRIT signifies the unmanifested Absolute present in the darkless dark and thelightless light. In the unmanifested Absolute even the categories of space,time, and dimension are non-existent. There abides only ever-existing,ever-conscious, ever-new, blissful Spirit. The word GOD means the manifested,transcendental Being beyond Creation, but existing in relation to Creation. WhenCreation is dissolved into God, then this God becomes Spirit, the unmanifestedAbsolute.Jesus said that as long as a devotee is conscious of manifested Creation and ofthe delusive things, such as mountains and holy cities, and has the desire tomeditate in them, he has not yet attained the ultimate state of enlightenment,and that true worshippers are the reflections of God, the Father, of materialCreation. God, manifested as the guiding intelligence of Creation, is the Spiritin the unmanifested state, when Creation is dissolved.Man, being a reflection of God, is a reflection of the unmanifested Spirit.Hence, a true worshiper, if he wants to know the truth about God and himself,must know that God and his Soul are reflections of the unmanifested Absolute.That is, the Spirit, being unmanifested Absolute, wants all His true devotees toknow that they are Its emanations. A devotee, unless he knows that the Father ofCreation, or God, can exist in the Absolute unmanifested state as pure,ever-conscious Bliss, without the shadows of imperfect Creation, does not knowthe whole truth about noumenal substance, but is deluded by phenomena, or by theappearance of Truth in Creation.All devotees who worship God as the manifested intelligence of Creation aregradually taught by Him to worship Him as the unmanifested Absolute, or Spirit.That is why Jesus said: “BUT THE HOUR COMETH, AND NOW IS, WHEN THE TRUEWORSHIPPERS SHALL WORSHIP THE FATHER IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH: FOR THE FATHERSEEKETH SUCH TO WORSHIP HIM.”God is Divine Intelligence in Creation. Spirit is Divine Intelligence withCreation dissolved in Him. Hence, any devotee who can only see God as the Fatherof Creation, of Nature, mountains, and so forth, is still in delusion. The truedevotee must learn that God is Spirit, unmanifested Absolute, and mustunderstand the truth about Him as being the ever-existent, ever-conscious,ever-new Bliss without the delusion of a material Cosmos. It is then that thedevotee finds emancipation and becomes one with the Spirit.To truly worship God is to worship Him in Nature and beyond Nature, to worshipthe substance and the delusive phenomena in it, to worship the ocean of God andits delusive waves of Creation. Since the waves of Creation in appearance, notin essence, distort the ocean of Creation (God), the true vision of God lies inthe perception of the Spirit-Ocean without the waves of Creation—to see asunmanifested Spirit and the only existing substance, Truth, without experiencingthe delusion of matter or phenomena. It is only by worshipping God and Nature,and then by worshipping God as unmanifested Spirit that the devotee reaches thefinal state of emancipation, from which there is no fall.Hence, worshippers who see God as Spirit and the only true substance existing,become emancipated. Under the sunlight, you may close your eyes and create adarkness of your own and live and move in it. When you open your eyes, darknessis no more. So, the consciousness of matter is due to our closing the eye ofwisdom. When the wisdom eye is opened, the consciousness of relativity of thepleasure, good and evil, and so forth, disappear, and the Spirit, asever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Joy is perceived as the only existentsubstance. Then all Creation, with all the attending evils, are found to becreated by ignorance, and all darkness and fears are created by closing the eyesand not by the absence of the light, which always knocks at the closed gates ofthe eyes to get in.Modern ministers should learn to worship God in the temple of super-communion,or Samadhi, where the Cosmos, like the shadow of darkness, appears non-existentwith the opening of the Eye of Wisdom before the light of the only existingSpirit.“The woman said unto him, ‘I know that the Messias cometh, which is calledChrist; when he is come, he will tell us all things.’ Jesus saith unto her, ‘ITHAT SPEAK UNTO THEE AM HE.’“And upon this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with the woman:yet no man said, ‘What seeketh thou?’ or, ‘Why talkest thou with her?’ The womanthen left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,‘Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this theChrist?’ Then they went out of the city and came unto him.“In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, ‘master, eat.’ But he saidunto them, ‘I HAVE MEAT TO EAT, THAT YE KNOW NOT OF.’ Therefore, said thedisciples one to another, ‘Hath any man brought him aught to eat?’ Jesus saithunto them, ‘MY MEAT IS TO DO THE WILL OF HIM THAT SENT ME, AND TO FINISH HISWORK.’”(John 4:25-34)When the woman of Samaria said: “I know that the Messias [Notes: The word“Messias” comes from the Hebrew word “Mashiakh” or “Anointed,” the expected Kingand deliverer of the Hebrews—Christ. (Christ, Latin, Christus, Messiah.)]cometh”, and so on, she had unconsciously received the telepathic message of Godand Christ’s presence as to who Jesus was.Most of the time, great Saints purposely remain hidden, and unless they choosesomeone to know of their greatness, they cannot be recognized even by peopleintimately mixing with them. In this case, God wanted to declare the glory ofJesus through the woman of Samaria, who was being made a test case of theSpiritual healing of Souls. (This woman of Samaria, who had had five husbands,was healed of her evil life through the Spiritual healing of Jesus.) Jesusconfirms and thereby reinforces her telepathic message by letting her know thetruth about Himself."},{"pageContent":"THREE KINDS OF HEALINGThe body is infected with bacteria, poison, and accidents, which involvephysical suffering. To free man from bodily ailments constitutes physicalhealing. The mind of man is infected with fear, worries, melancholia,psychological nervousness, greed, anger, temptation, and jealousy, which causemental suffering. The healing of psychological diseases is called mentalhealing.The Soul of man is haunted by ignorance, which produces mental, physical, andall kinds of suffering. Ignorance creates inharmony between mind and body, Godand Soul, and in addition creates every other trouble. Jesus knew the relationbetween mind and body, and God and Soul. That is why he controlled the atomicstructure of his bodily cells, and that is why he carried out his saying:“Destroy this body, and in three days I will rebuild it again.”In fact, ignorance produces in man the consciousness of the body. Divine Souls,who have healed themselves of ignorance, behold the body as a “dream of God,” or“frozen mind of Divinity.” Body and mind, being the image of God, can reflectperpetual youth and everlasting peace. Not to know this is to be spirituallyignorant and to be subject to all kinds of physical and mental aliments.If you close your eyes and enter a palatial room, you see darkness instead ofthe presence of beautiful things in the room. When you open your eyes and removedarkness, you forget the existence of self-created gloom and behold only lightand the beautiful things in the room. So, also, when the eyes of wisdom areclosed, you are submerged in the gloom of ignorance, witnessing physical andmental agonies, but when you open the eyes of knowledge by meditation, youbehold the presence of God’s light and all the beautiful experiences of lastingyouth, everlasting peace, immortality, and so forth.The world has yet to discover the highest human achievement, which Jesus and thegreat Saints are enjoying even today, and have been enjoying ever since theyfreed themselves from mortal ignorance, and they will enjoy that celestialblessedness to the end of endlessness.It must be noted that physical suffering does not always bring mental agony ifthe mind is strong. Martyrs have smilingly been burned at the stake, but mentalsuffering usually brings physical suffering. When the Soul is sick, the body andmind are automatically subject to physical and mental suffering. Therefore,ignorance is the greatest of all suffering and must be removed."},{"pageContent":"HEALING OF THE SOUL IS THE GREATEST GOODThe greatest of all healing which Jesus wanted to perform was the healing ofSouls. Everyone, by holding to the after effects of meditation, and by steadilylooking into the eyes of recipient Souls and strongly wishing them to be healedof mortal ignorance, can bring God into the lives of men, but one must be healedin his own Soul first before he can aspire to heal others. That is why Jesusspoke of becoming the “fishers of men”. That means the art of fishing Souls outof the sea of ignorance by catching them in the net of wisdom and bringing themto the table of God’s immortality.The one purpose that Jesus had in declaring Himself as Christ to the woman ofSamaria was that He wanted her to know that He had the all-healing ChristConsciousness in Him, that He was omniscient and knew of her morally sick Soul,and that He could heal her. Jesus could not be accused of self-laudation, nor ofrevealing His power of mind reading. He had one object in view in His talkingthus to the woman of Samaria, and that was to heal her Soul, and that is why Hedid not wait to be introduced to her but saw her alone. Jesus, considerate as Hewas, did not want to embarrass the woman before His disciples by telling herthat she had had five husbands.God has given to each Soul the right to hide his thoughts and to fight hisbattles in secret instead of before others’ curiosity and prying, which wouldcause sarcasm and hatred. If there were not invisible walls between ourthoughts, we could do nothing and think nothing in peace, nor would we have theright to receive our own knocks and score our own victories.We get little inklings of the thoughts of others in the expressions of theirfaces and eyes. That makes our lives all the more mysterious and interesting. Somany times we jump at conclusions about the thoughts of others and make horribleblunders, and many times we learn to read their thoughts correctly. Our blundersin such psychological reading teaches us to be cautions and preventsself-sufficiency, which arises from our correct reading of the thoughts ofothers.The disciples marveled when Jesus talked to such a common woman, yet the purevibrations of Jesus could not bring any criticism from the disciples. That iswhy nobody asked: “Why talkest thou with her?”The woman of Samaria was so overwhelmed with the Soul-healing power of Jesusthat in her Divine Joy she told of all her moral blemishes and the wonderfulSoul-healing which she received from Jesus. She, being healed, also became thefirst messenger to declare Jesus the Christ.“Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. In the mean while hisdisciples prayed him, saying, ‘Master, eat.’ But he said unto them, ‘I HAVE MEATTO EAT THAT YE KNOW NOT OF’”.(John 4:30-32)The mind of Jesus was filled with Christ Consciousness and the Soul-healing thathe had accomplished in the woman of Samaria, so He laughed at the idea ofsupplying the body with food, when He knew that He was a Soul, and the only meatit eternally nourished itself on was the blessedness and eternal wisdom of God.Jesus was trying to heal His disciples of the delusion of ignorance, whichcaused them to think that He had to eat in order to live. Jesus said oncebefore: “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedethout of the mouth of God.”“And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of thewoman, which testified, ‘He told me all that ever I did.’ So when the Samaritanswere come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and heabode there two days. And many more believed because of his own word; and saidunto the woman, ‘Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heardhim ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of theworld.’”(John 4:39-42)The above paragraph shows the way a prophet like Jesus Christ became known tothe public. The one real way by which a Saint should become known is by thetestimony from the lips of benefited students. Many people believed in Jesusbecause of the testimony of the woman of Samaria. Honest, true testimonials ofstudents as to their Master’s real qualities, may not to be of any Spiritualbenefit to him, but they enable him to become known so that through his power ofwisdom he can serve the people, if he wants to serve, and if the spirituallyneedy want to receive his help.A flower needs no advertisement, and yet, its fragrance experienced by a few,may be told to those who did not experience its sweetness. The fragrance blossomof a Spiritual man hiding in a cave, selfishly enjoying God alone, is born toblush and die unseen, without benefiting others with the solace of acquiredwisdom.Consciously developed Spiritual Souls, no matter how they love seclusion, neveract like the inert beautiful blossom which dies in an unknown nook withoutmaking anybody happy with its sweetness. Great saints who experience theintoxicating joy of God-contact always love to share their Divine happiness withothers, and demonstrate their Spiritual healing powers to worthy Souls. Thisserves a double purpose: the worthy souls are benefited, and when they feelbetter, they sincerely tell of their teacher’s ability to serve and to heal.The teacher should advertise through example and not merely by words, or by bothexample and advice. If it is right to advertise chewing gum, it is better toadvertise real wisdom and thoughts which people can chew mentally, andassimilate for their highest Spiritual nourishment. It is only deplorable whencommercial teachers, without practicing what they preach, try to impart theirknowledge to others, and glaringly advertise it with only one end in view—thatof making money. To advertise untruth is harmful, but to draw the attention ofpeople to a usable, beneficial, Spiritual Truth, or to a good teacher, isadmirable. A flower even advertises by its fragrance, calling people to comenear and bathe in its fountain of sweetness. So, a Spiritual man draws eagerSouls to himself by the perfume of his own qualities.The woman of Samaria told of the telepathic power of Jesus, which hedemonstrated to her, not for the sake of satisfying her curiosity, but for thepurpose of lifting her from the pitfalls of error. A Spiritual teacher of highstanding only demonstrates the power of the mind in order to glorify God, nothimself. He turns the attention of his students, not to the delusive desire ofacquiring miracles, but to God alone. In the course of planting the seed ofGod-Wisdom in a Soul, a Master Mind is entirely guided by God as to whether heshall draw the student to truth by the demonstration of miracle, or by the puremagnetic power of undiluted God-devotion. Those teachers who demonstratemiracles without consulting God usually love to advertise their own littlepower, and thus fall away from concentrating upon the mightiest miracle of allmiracles—God.Jesus, actuated by Divine Will, tried to uplift the woman of Samaria by thedemonstration of a miracle. Most people are attracted to a teacher through thetestimonial of benefited students, but there are others who have the keenperception to recognize and believe in a teacher by tuning in with his emanatingSpiritual vibrations. There were others who believed in Jesus, not through thetestimony of the woman of Samaria, but after they heard Him and felt HisSpiritual vibrations within them. It is all right to believe in the testimony ofa student about a teacher or a Truth, but it is better for real students tosatisfy their own hearts by trying out the Truth, or by contacting the teacher,and thus place their convictions on the indestructible foundation of wisdom, andnot on the shaky basis of doubt."},{"pageContent":"TELEPATHYMany people may wonder how Jesus knew about the woman of Samaria’s life history.Did Jesus read her thoughts from her subconscious, conscious, or superconsciousmind? If a person holds the mirror of his mind absolutely still, free from theoscillations of restless thoughts, he can reflect within him the thoughts whichpass through the consciousness of another person. This is only possible when oneis versed in the art of remaining without thinking as long as he wants to. Whenthis attained, then, on the virgin, unexposed plate of his mind, he canphotograph any thought that is present in the conscious mind of anotherindividual.It entails greater mental power to know the buried subconscious thoughtexperiences of others. Subconscious thoughts usually do not remain in theconscious mind, but are hidden behind its doors. By consciously projecting thesubconscious mind of one person into the subconscious mind of another person,one can know the tabloid of thought experiences hidden there. It is possible todo this when one can go into his own subconscious mind by concentrating and canfeel the experiences hidden there without being intruded upon by the thoughts ofthe conscious mind.In the third still greater way, a Master Mind who has control of his all-seeingeye of deepest concentration can transfer his consciousness to the deepestregion of Bliss of the superconscious mind. The superconscious mind hides behindthe restlessness of conscious life and the fanciful dream state of subconsciouslife, and knows everything, not by reason or sense perception, but by the directall-knowing power of God-given intuition. This intuitive power can be developedby learning the step-by-step methods of Self Realization, and by deepestmeditation.When this superconscious intuition is developed, it can instantly feel all thatis going on in the consciousness of another individual, all that is lying hiddenin his subconscious mind, and all his pre-natal experiences of formerincarnations. Jesus had this usable, controlled power of superconsciousintuition, with which he instantly knew everything that lay hidden in theconscious, subconscious, and superconscious mind of the woman of Samaria."},{"pageContent":"FAITH—THE HEALING POWER OF THOUGHT—JESUS HEALS THE SON OF THE NOBLEMAN OFCAPERNAUM“Now, after two days, he departed thence, and went into Galilee. And he taughtin their synagogues, being glorified of all.”(John 4:43; Luke 4:15)“So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. Andthere was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. When he heardthat Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besoughthim that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.“Then said Jesus unto him, ‘Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will notbelieve.’ The nobleman saith unto him, ‘Sir, come down ere my child die.’ Jesussaith unto him, ‘Go thy way; thy son liveth.’ And the man believed the word thatJesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.“And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, ‘Thyson liveth’. Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And theysaid unto him, ‘Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.’ So the fatherknew that it was at the same hour, in which Jesus said unto him, ‘Thy sonliveth’: and himself believed, and his whole house.”(John 4:46-53)Before Jesus healed the son of the nobleman, he observed the general mentalityof the people, in that they never believed in God until they saw signs andwondrous miracles. In a way, Jesus was telling the nobleman, whose son was atthe point of death in Capernaum, that it was not His custom to perform miraclesin order to make people believe in God.Jesus preferred those people who loved God as a result of their own innatereasoning and perfect accord, rather than those who were compelled to believe inGod as a result of the awe and fear they felt at the display of miracles. Inother words, Almighty God prefers to have His children use their own free willand reason to love Him rather than be led to love Him through the force of Hismiraculous powers. Jesus wanted the nobleman of Capernaum to believe in Himwithout the performance of the miraculous healing of his son. However, when thefather insisted, through true faith, Jesus at last said: “Go thy way; thy sonliveth.”After this, the nobleman believed, or rather sensed, the vibratory healing powerof Jesus and went home. On his return home, the nobleman was greeted by hisservant, who happily announced to him that his son had been living since daybefore at the seventh hour. In absent healing the word of healing has to bespoken by the healer. If songs can float through the ether, ready to be caughtout of the ether by a radio, so it is that broadcasted healing vibrations can bepicked up by sensitive Soul radios."},{"pageContent":"HOW THE LAW OF HEALING OPERATESIn this healing it must be remembered that the nobleman’s son became wellimmediately when Jesus spoke; that is, when Jesus set in motion Hiswill-impregnated healing Soul force in the ether. Jesus broadcasted theGod-given healing vibrations and they were received by the nobleman, who relayedthem to his son, just as songs, broadcasted as 7 A.M., from Los Angeles, reachNew York at exactly the same time. This happens because sound is carried byinfinitely fast-moving omnipresent electrons in the ether.If sound waves can be carried through the ether, then sounds impregnated withhealing Soul Force can also be transmitted through the ether. Ordinary songs andspeeches, received through the radio, produce some mental effect upon thelistener, but words, impregnated with Soul Force, remain in the ether, everready to work.Jesus impregnated His utterance with His Almighty healing power. Ordinary songsand thoughts transmitted over the radio give only momentary inspiration, but thewords of Jesus, “Thy son liveth,” contained in them the all-accomplishing,invisible healing power. As the energy in the body can be directed by the willto move any part of the body, so also, by omnipresent Divine Will, any atomicchanges can be initiated in any body, in any thing, and at any place, no matterhow far distant.God had a reason for creating the Cosmos, then He willed it, and light or energycame. Then He willed that the light become flesh and earth. Hence, the Universe,being a product of Divine Mind, can be changed by Divine Mind at any time.Matter, although it has dimensions, is not different from thought, for materialobjects are nothing but the frozen thought of God. Hence, the body and the lifein it, are dream products of God’s will and thought. The dream Cosmos, with theearth and the living Beings on it, are sustained by God’s concentrated thought.If He should dissolve His dream, the Universe, with all things in it, would meltaway like a dream. If the Cosmos is made of the frozen thought of God, then thehuman body is also made and sustained by the same Divine Thought. Hence, God’sthought, being the Creator of the thought-body, can create changes in it throughthe power of Divine Will.Jesus realized that, since God brought the body of the son of the nobleman intoexistence through His thought, so also His Almighty Power could produce thedesired change in it. God’s will and thought created all things, and thosepeople who are in tune with God’s will and thought can produce any desiredchanges in matter or in human bodies instantaneously, merely by concentratedthought.The nobleman thought that his son was sick, but Jesus thought differently, andso the son recovered. Jesus was able to displace the dream of sickness in theson by a dream of health, because He knew that the entire Cosmos was made of thetissue of dreams. Ultimately, all disease is found to be psychological, so astrong mind, fostering thoughts of health and perfection, can displace astubborn thought of illness in another person.Most people cannot heal themselves because their own thoughts are poisoned bythe habit of thinking of chronic sickness. It is strange that the people who arealways well never seen to believe that they can become sick, but if they happento become sick after having enjoyed fifty years of good health, and are thenunable to keep well for three months, they believe that they can never get wellagain. Right at this time, if a strong mind can revive the will of the patientwho is paralyzed with sickness, then he himself can change his thought andenergy, and thus heal himself. No one can heal us except through the hiddenpower of our own thoughts.Thought is the brain of the cells and units of Life Force present in everyparticle of bodily tissue. Hence, a disease thought upsets the entire governmentof the Life Force in the cells, whereas, the thought of health corrects anydisorder in the cellular system.It must be remembered that I am speaking of the concentrated Divine Thoughtwhich can heal and not of the fanciful thought of imaginary people. In order tomove Divine Thought, the ordinary man must know the relation of thought, LifeForce, and body without denying the existence of the body thought. The body isthe frozen energy of God, nevertheless, man cannot realize this until he knowsthat thought is frozen into energy and energy is frozen into the body of man.Many people try to explain away the body delusion.First, it must be realized that the body is made of invisible electrons, andthat electrons are made of the invisible thought of God. Instead of saying thatthe body does not exist, one should say: “The body is not want we think it is.It is not anything but the frozen thought and energy of God, and cannot begained by fanatic fancy, or by strong orthodox belief, but only by tuning inwith God and by waking up His consciousness, to find that the Cosmos is nothingbut His frozen dream.”"},{"pageContent":"POSSESSION—THE MAN POSSESSED BY AN UNCLEAN DEVIL“And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil,and cried out with a loud voice, Saying, ‘Let us alone: what have we to do withthee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thouart; the Holy One of God.’ And Jesus rebuked him, saying, ‘Hold thy peace andcome out of him.’ And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out ofhim, and hurt him not.“And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, ‘What a word isthis! For with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and theycame out.’”(Luke 4:33-36)The human body and mind are subject to various kinds of diseases. Jesus, as thetrue minister of Self-Realization, not only knew how to preach and win peopleaway from Satanic ignorance and bring them into Divine vibrations, but He knewhow to heal them of various kinds of maladies. While preaching in the synagogue,(a place where people usually go for their Souls to be healed by the salve ofinspiring sermons) Jesus found a man possessed by an unclean devil. ForthwithJesus started to heal this stricken man.In modern times people would laugh at the idea of anybody being possessed by anunclean devil. Devils seemed to be plentiful in the days of superstition andcandlelight, but now, in the electrical Age, the devils seem to be scared away.However, psychiatrists can tell of the many cases of mental obsessions by fixedideas, but very few know that many people suffer from actual possession byunclean devils.Why should it be considered so amazing, when devils and devilish Souls existright on this side of life, that they may exist also on the other side of life?If Souls are immortal, then according to the law of cause and effect, it islogical to expect that when a devilish Soul sheds the mortal coil and passesthrough the door of the mortal change called “death,” into the other side oflife, he continues to be a devil and does not become an angel. Only an angelicSoul who has been on earth can continue to be so after crossing the gulf ofdeath and entering the finer atmosphere of Heaven.Unclean devils are those Souls who were murderers, robbers, and other criminalson earth, and who did not cleanse themselves of their evil propensities beforedeath. Even the greatest sinner, if he cleans his subconscious mind and memoryby contacting the superconsciousness in meditation before death, does not gointo a sphere beyond death as a wicked Soul who has not purged itself of itsevil and spiritually unsanitary tendencies.As a good boy turned to evil ways can be called as devil, so a Soul gone wrongbecomes devilish in its behavior. Such wicked Souls, after they die, passthrough many strange experiences. As people of calm disposition usually havedeep soothing sleep, so good Souls, when they sleep the sleep of death,experience a soothing death-sleep, free from the nightmares of evil visions.But, when people of evil-disturbed disposition die, according to the law ofcause and effect, they experience, during the great death sleep, only horriblenightmares of evil.As people walk in sleep or cry out during a bad dream, so, during the sleepafter death, unclean Souls can move about in the ether crying out for relief.Most of these tramp Souls begin to move about during the sleep of death and tryto get hold of some passive bodily vehicle through which to express their agonyand wicked tendencies. As a sleepwalker does many strange things, so thesesubtle sleepwalkers of the Astral land perform many strange antics. By means ofintuitive feelings they try to possess vacant, ignorant minds. They can neverinfest brains occupied with intelligent thinking, or people with strong willpower, or vibrations of Spiritual perception. That is why the minds ofspiritually advanced people cannot be occupied by devilish Souls, but thesepeople can invoke saintly Souls by use of the proper technique of Astralintuition. One must learn the right technique from one’s Guru. Evil Souls invadevacant, passive minds without invitation.Beware of dwelling long in absent-mindedness and never try to invoke disembodiedSouls by remaining in a passive state if you do not know the right technique.If you know what you are doing and keep your mind entrenched and barb-wired byhigh Spiritual vibrations, no evil, unclean Spirits can get in. The word“Spirit” should only be used in connection with the unmanifested Absolute and itis a crime to use it in connection with disembodied Souls. However, the word“Spirit,” as used commonly, signifies physically disembodied Souls.It must be remembered that there is a lot of difference between the conditionsof a Soul acting under a hypnotic spell, and the obsession of a subconsciousidea, or auto-suggestion. Men and women, under the influence of hypnosis orstrong obsession of the subconscious mind, can be made to play the part ofeither a noble or a devilish Soul. Real obsession is not an idea introduced by ahypnotist or by the subconscious mind which infests a Soul, but it is due to theactual presence of a Soul who has cast off its physical garment. One human bodyusually cannot reside of another except in the case of a mother carrying achild, but a passive Soul can be occupied by an active, disembodied Soul.It is true that like attracts like. So, this sinful man in the synagogue, due tothe attraction of his own wrong vibration, drew unto himself an unclean Spirit.Jesus, possessing Cosmic Consciousness, could feel exactly what was going onwithin the body of the obsessed man. And the unclean Soul, being in touch withthe Astral world, knew that the Christ Consciousness in Jesus was the Lord ofall Creation, which pervaded all forms of life, and therefore it has controlover all life.So, this disembodied, unclean, devilish Soul could see Jesus, and through itsintuition could feel the power of Jesus. (Disembodied Souls have only the sixthsense of intuition but, in a developed state, they can use it alone to performthe functions of vision, audition, smell, taste, touch, and so forth.) But theunclean, wicked Soul saw Jesus through the eyes of the obsessed man, and usedhis voice to cry loudly: “Let us alone; let us have the freedom to do anythingwe please, good or evil.”The evil Spirit was afraid that Jesus, with His Christ Consciousness, havingcontrol over all life, would stop him from having an unauthorized, forcedoccupation of the obsessed man’s mind. This wicked Soul kept the Soul of theobsessed man in a state of suspension, neutrality, and sub-hypnosis, so that theinstruments of consciousness—senses, brain, and body—could be used withoutinterruption. As tramps steal rides in unlocked automobiles left by the waysideand ruin them, so also, tramp Souls steal rides by entering the bodies ofpassive Souls, and usually wreck the brain-engines.Jesus, fearing the advent of insanity in the obsessed man if the unclean devilremained too long, by His life-controlling will power spoke: “HOLD THY PEACE ANDCOME OUT OF HIM.” That is, stop the devilish work of wrecking obsessed brains;hold on to the inner peace of the Soul hidden behind the veil of self-createdpast evil propensities, and do right again by coming out of the body which youhave forcibly and unethically occupied.In obsession by unclean devils or disembodied Souls who are bent upon forciblyoccupying passive Souls on earth, great mischief is done to the brain, mind, andsense organs of the obsessed individual. During obsession, an individual may ormay not be unconscious, just as a person under hypnosis may manifest theunconsciousness of sleep or the superficially normal state of the consciousmind.In modern times many people think that the idea of obsession is a myth. It isnot so. There are many simple-minded and absent-minded people who, due to theirmental emptiness, invite the advent of unscrupulous Souls within their bodies.Many real cases of obsession are spoken of as brain-derangement, or as a stateof hallucination, or as spells of hysteria. On the other hand, many cases ofhysteria and fits have been erroneously described as spirit obsession byhysterical, credulous spiritualists.Only Spiritual experts can distinguish cases of true spirit obsession, becauseby their psychic powers they are able to behold the Astral bodies of theinvisible visitors lying side by side with the Astral bodies of the personsobsessed.If you find a haunted individual who shows symptoms the same as in the abovementioned test, then remember, by strong concentration and will power, you toocan dislodge the evil spirit. By the constant whisper of “Aum” in the right earof the individual, the evil spirit is bound to leave. In obdurate cases ofspirit possession, which do not yield to the influence of the above methods, thepower of a Master in the path of Self-Realization must be sought.The only way a layman can detect a case of spirit possession is by analyzing thedifferent states of paroxysm and of wild behavior which an obsessed person issubject to. The evil spirit-obsessed person usually displays unusual physicalstrength, bloodshot eyes, uncanny expression, and general lack of normalbehavior.The utterance of holy names and especially Aum, Aum, Aum, into the ear ofobsessed individuals usually brings forth a quick, frightened reply from theobsessed individual like: “I am going; don’t utter that holy word,” whichindicates spirit obsession.So, Jesus, being in touch with the Cosmic Vibration, (Aum sound) which iscontinuously roaring throughout the Universe, commanded, with an Aum-impregnatedvoice, the devil to come out of the body of the obsessed individual. The devil,unwilling to obey Jesus, fought against the powerful vibration and thus createdconvulsions in the body of the obsessed man. The Cosmic Vibration, like apowerful current, was vibrating in the obsessed individual, trying to dislodgeand shake out the intruding evil Astral-spirit. After causing some bodilyconvulsions, at last it came out of the body violently, leaving the man limp andshaken but not hurt.As has been said before, the tramp evil spirit could have wrecked thebrain-engine of the obsessed man, but it was not able to do so due to theintervention of the Divine policeman, the all-powerful Jesus Christ. So the evilspirit came out without causing any physical injury.The people who beheld this miracle of the unclean spirits obeying Jesus Christwere extremely astonished and believed in His Divine authority. Even as Jesuswas the perfect image of God, we also are potentially perfect manifestations ofthe Spirit of God. When we become aware of this, we also can perform themiracles that Christ performed."},{"pageContent":"POSSESSION—JESUS CASTS OUT LEGION OF DEVILS INTO THE SWINE“And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over againstGalilee. And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certainman, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in anyhouse, but in the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down beforehim, and with a loud voice said, ‘What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Sonof God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.’ (For he had commanded theunclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and hewas kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and wasdriven of the devil into the wilderness.)”(Luke 8:26-29)Such madmen are also to be found in present times in the lunatic asylums, lockedup in padded cells. All lunacy is not due to derangement of brains; sometimesbrains are possessed by evil spirits who can be exorcised or driven out by menlike Christ. When this lunatic saw Jesus coming, the evil spirit in himrecognized Christ and in fear implored Him not to dispossess it.To this, Jesus said, “O thou disembodied soul and reflection of Spirit filledwith unclean evil karma, you should give up your unlawful possession of thisman’s body; you have converted him into a lunatic.”It has been explained before that a tramp soul is usually a disembodied soul ofa murderer or a man who has committed suicide. Because of his disregard for lifehis own karma condemns him to an existence like a nightmare in the astral world.These souls, not finding much-desired rebirth, often possess demented minds withbad karma. Masters who can distinguish between spirit possession and ordinarybrain derangement have the power to consciously command these tramp souls todepart from the human bodies they unlawfully possess."},{"pageContent":"MEANING OF DEEP“And Jesus asked him, saying, ‘What is thy name?’ And he said, ‘Legion:’ becausemany devils were entered into him. And they besought him that he would notcommand them to GO OUT INTO THE DEEP.”(Luke 8:30-31)Jesus, being omnipotent, knew everything that was going on in the astral worldwhere millions of good and bad souls remain after death. The evil souls are allcontrolled by Satan and they all have distinctive features and names. That iswhy Jesus asked the name of the spirit. The leader of the spirits replied thathis name was Legion—that is, many devils, which signified that many wickeddisembodied souls were crowding and disordering the one mental house of thismadman. As many thoughts can remain in one mind, and various moods and variouspersonalities can be displayed by the same actor, so various disembodiedspirits, being subtle, can occupy and possess the same mind and the same body.Just as many people can live crowded in a room, so many disembodied souls canpossess the same brain, crowding it.These disembodied souls, being in the astral world, consciously knew theinfluence of Jesus Christ’s consciousness in the astral world. They knew thepower of Jesus over the evil spirits, so they begged Him that they should not becommanded to roam again without the consciousness of physical bodies into thedeep ocean of black space where they were tormented and choked with their ownvisions of a nightmare existence without a light to guide them.These disembodied souls crowding the brain of the individual were highlydelighted and ran riot, enjoying the sensations of sound, light, taste, smell,touch and the perceptions of a world full of definitive objects through thebrain of this possessed individual. That is why the disembodied spirits wereafraid of being denied a further ride in the fleshly motor-car racing through aland of physical sensations and sceneries and of being thrown back into theHades and nightmare of dark subconscious existence. That is what is meant by theword, “deep.”“And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and theybesought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.“Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herdran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.”(Luke 8:32-33)Since Jesus Christ, by His Divine power, was compelling the unclean spirits toleave the body of the madman, therefore they wished to enjoy the lessersensibilities in the bodies of a nearby herd of swine. These wicked disembodiedspirits preferred a transition from the feeling of human sensations to thefeeling of animal sensations in the animal bodies rather than suddenly bewhirled back into the dark subconscious state of eternal space where they werecondemned to stay by the evil karma of their past lives.Jesus permitted them to do so. The unclean spirits then left the brain of thepossessed individual and entered the bodies of the whole herd of swine who,being possessed by these unclean disembodied spirits, began to act like maniacsand ran violently into the lake.These evil spirits with great difficulty had found one wicked individual astheir suitable medium and had crowded into his brain and tortured him by makinghim do things he did not want to do. They ran riot with his body and did notcare what happened to it so long as they could enjoy life through itssensations. In trying to work out all their violent emotions through one brainthey deranged it. Being denied by Jesus this much-desired, yet crowded dwellingplace of one brain, the disembodied spirits through the help of Jesustemporarily went to feel the joys of animal existence in the bodies of a herd ofswine.When the disembodied spirits entered into the bodies of swine, the animal brainsbecame deranged; the evil spirits within them were so excited with animalpleasure that they did not know what they were doing and ran violently into thewater and were drowned. The unclean spirits with the souls of the swine weredriven back into the regions of dark space where wicked souls live with soulsthat have come out of animal bodies."},{"pageContent":"THE GADARENES REJECT JESUS“When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it inthe city and in the country.“Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man,out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, andin his right mind: and they were afraid. They also which saw it told them bywhat means he that was possessed of the devils was healed. Then the wholemultitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to departfrom them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship,and returned back again.”(Luke 8:34-37)It was foolish of these ignorant people to be afraid of Jesus and not afraid oftheir own ignorance. Had they realized the all-redeeming power of Jesus, insteadof being afraid of him they would have asked Him how they could be free frombeing possessed by the devil of devils—ignorance. Even in modern times manyeducated people, seeing some master in ecstasy with God, with his body in astate of suspended animation, foolishly feel afraid of him as one who is underthe influence of witchcraft or black magic and who may be teaching the art ofunconsciousness or possession by disembodied spirits or who may be practicingself-hypnotism. Similar uncomprehending fears, about Jesus, were felt by theignorant Gadarenes two thousand years ago.It must be remembered one has to die in order to separate his soul from hisbody. In ordinary death a soul is separated from its body so that the soulcannot re-enter its own body again. But a master teaches how to conquer death byconsciously taking the soul out of the body at will and putting the soul backinto the body again. By this process, instead of going out in ecstasy into theafter-death state and not being able to come back, a soul learns that the bodyis his material dwelling place. He can remain there as long as he wants andafter living in it enough he can quit it at will without suffering physical painor mental pain due to attachment, and go to his omnipresent home in God.But the ordinary person does not know that he lives in the body as a prisoner ofhis own past karma. Due to his long residence in the bodily prison, vulnerableto its accidents and death, he grows to like it and when his karmic term ofbodily confinement is over and he is commanded to depart from the body by thecompulsion of disease, the individual hates to leave the prison house of thebody. Most people do not know why they come into the body or why they go out ofit.The Yogis say that since the bodily confinement is due to the karmic term thesoul should learn of its oneness with Spirit and by meditation get himselfparoled from the dictates of karma and have the power to go in and out of thebodily prison as he wants to by getting hold of the key of the mystery of lifeand death by yogic meditation and the art of self-realization.So, no sane individual should foolishly fear a master or condemn hisall-emancipating technique of meditation even as the men of Gadara werefoolishly afraid of Jesus and instead of asking salvation from Him commanded himto depart from their shores.“Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might bewith him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, ‘Return to thine own house, and showhow great things God hath done unto thee.’“And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great thingsJesus had done unto him.“And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly receivedhim: for they were all waiting for him.”(Luke 8:38-40.)It is remarkable to note how Jesus was without ego. He did not speak of his ownpowers of healing but of the divine power which manifested through him. Hebelieved that the demonstration of divine power needed publicity through aliving example that other afflicted souls might seek help from the unlimiteddivine power. When publicity is used for material gain it yields materialresults. Publicity is useful to broadcast divine demonstrations for the guidanceof afflicted souls, but self-laudation is pernicious and repugnant to thespiritual man."},{"pageContent":"LAYING ON OF HANDS—JESUS REBUKES THE FEVER IN SIMON’S WIFE’S MOTHER“And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into thehouse of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. And Simon’s wife’s mother wastaken with a great fever; and anon they tell him of her; and they besought himfor her. And he stood over her; and REBUKED THE FEVER; and he came and took herby the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and shearose, and ministered unto them.“And at even, when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with diversdiseases brought them unto him; and them that were possessed with devils: and helaid his hands on every one of them, and healed them, and all the city wasgathered together at the door.”(Mark 1:29-33; Luke 4:38-40)All disease germs have a dormant intelligence and are directed by the misguidedArchangel of God, Satan. All evil has some intelligence, for it works itselfinto the minds of the people through false reasoning. Vice takes the cloak ofvirtue and fools the gate-keeper of reason, and thus enters the forbiddensanctum of virtue. Fever is caused by the evil actions of man as well as bydisease which is intelligently controlled by Satan. Whenever a persontransgresses physically, mentally, or spiritually, a portal for a specificdisease is opened, according to the nature of the transgression, to enter thebody. Jesus knew all the evil forces which create havoc in people and was able,through His all-powerful Cosmic Consciousness to talk in the language of thefever and command it to get out of the body of the stricken woman. That is whatis meant by Jesus “rebuking the fever.”The rebuking of the fever signifies that diseases are due to the lack of properoperation of the conscious forces which govern the body, and are also due to theevil forces which consciously allow the evil of disease to spread in the body.Some diseases are brought about by physical transgressions against the laws ofhealth, but disease germs are also created by an evil force which tries todestroy the beautiful creation of God—the human body. When the actions of anindividual become very bad, evil vibrations are generated, attracting diseasegerms, which are the agencies of evil.Jesus could see the evil force which was responsible for the introduction offever into the body of Simon’s wife’s mother, and thus he rebuked it away andrestored the harmony of health. Jesus commanded the predominating evil force todepart from the body of the stricken woman, thus reinstating the consciousAstral forces which govern normal health.Jesus exercised his supreme healing power to heal everyone who came to Him. Hecould heal all those who came unto Him at that time because all of them hadpower of recipiency and faith. Faith is the soil, and the power of God flowingthrough the healer is the seed. True healing requires the true soil of faith inthe patient and the powerful seed of healing in the healer or God.Jesus could not heal everybody in the place where He was born because, evenpowerful as He was, He could not sprout the seed of his healing power on therocky soil of disbelieving minds.In healing, the power of the healer, great or small, is limited as compared tothe unlimited healing power of God. Hence, all healers, instead of commandingtheir own powers in healing, should invoke the unlimited Divine power of healingto flow through them and work certain healing. Man’s power may fail, but God’spower can never fail. Even though God has unlimited healing power and though ourFather does not want to see us suffer from disease, yet He cannot heal us untilwe open the gates of our own willingness to be healed. God has given us freechoice, unlike the animals, and by misusing it we can keep God out of our lives.By using it properly, we can allow God to heal us.In order to be sure of God’s healing power, one must know and feel Him deeply inmeditation daily. When sure of the Divine Communion, one should completelyabsorb oneself in God preceding every healing which one tries to perform. Whenadministering Divine healing, the healer must act as a perfect medium in orderto let God’s unlimited power flow through without obstruction. Egotism and louddeclaration, and self-laudation, such as, “I healed her,” and so forth, shouldbe strictly avoided both in speech and mind, in order to let the all-knowing Godperform the healing.About the laying on of hands, a great many explanations are necessary. The bodyis surrounded by intelligent Cosmic Energy and this energy recharges theoriginal vitality of the body when it becomes depleted due to hard work. Food isthe distilled water of the body battery, but the inner life of the body batterydepends upon the Cosmic Energy which is drawn into the body through the mouth ofthe medulla (antenna) or by the tuning power of the human will. All the energyderived from the Cosmos through the ether, and the energy derived from food,becomes concentrated in the head and is poured into the entire body batterythrough the six sub-dynamos in the spine. The brain and the six Centers in thecerebro-spinal axis send energy into the hands, feet, eyes, lungs, heart, liver,spleen, and all body parts. So, from each body part, namely, eyes, hands, feet,heart, navel, nose, mouth, and every projection from the body, there emanatescurrent.Since we use our eyes and hands constantly, they radiate more nerve-current thanother parts. The right side of the body is a positive pole and the left side isa negative pole. The right side is stronger than the left side because moreattention is paid to it and more use and more exercise develop it. The leftside, by use and attention, can be developed into the positive pole, as is shownin left-handed people.However, this Life Force passing through the hands, is more or less powerful,according to the power of the will. Masters, like Jesus, who have infinitecontrol of their will, can radiate the all-creative healing Ray through anyorgan, especially through hands, feet, or eyes. Simply laying on the positiveand negative poles of the hands, which carry energy from the body battery, doesnot heal. It is the power flowing through the hands which is the real cause ofhealing. This Life Force creates, integrates, disintegrates, crystallizes,metabolizes, and produces the complex body out of the cells. This Life Force isintelligent but is out of control in weak, ego-identified minds. Those who haveidentified themselves with their Souls know that the intelligent Soul controlsthe intelligent creative Life Force.One who knows his Soul knows how to work miracles through the master of life anddeath, the Life Force, by sending it down through the hands like a healingX-Ray, to burn out disease germs in any stricken person.The Spirit of Jesus had control over Cosmic Energy. He commanded His will toconnect Cosmic Energy with the energy in His brain and send it down through Hishands in ever-flowing, germ-burning rays to the body of the diseased person."},{"pageContent":"FORGIVENESS OF SINS“And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, ‘Thou art Christ, theSon of God.’ And he, rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knewthat he was the Christ. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias,the prophet, saying, ‘Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.’And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, anddeparted into a solitary place, and there prayed. And Simon, and they that werewith him followed after him. And when they had found him, they said unto him,‘All men seek for thee.’”(Luke 4:41; Matthew 8:17; Mark 1:35-37)As has been said before, Satan, the Cosmic Evil Intelligence, has his satellitesin those Souls who have lost in the moral and Spiritual battle. Satan worksthrough such lost Souls on earth while they are living and also through thoseSouls that are roaming in the Astral world. As evil-possessed Souls do mischiefon earth, so these Satan-obsessed Astral Souls do all kinds of mischief in theAstral world as well as in the physical world. They launch themselves into evilSouls through their evil vibrations. They intelligently possess and punishearthly evil Souls according to the term of Astral punishment which arises fromspecific transgressions in worldly life. Jesus, being omniscient, knew how Satanand his evil forces worked in torturing human Souls. That is why, when Jesuscommanded the spirits in the possessed bodies to depart, they knew who Jesuswas.In regard to the prophecy of the prophet Esaias: “Himself took our infirmities,and bare our sicknesses,” there is an important explanation. Powerful Souls likeJesus could only wipe away the effects of evil in an individual according to thelaw of cause and effect, which governs Karma (action). If anyone, through wrongeating, is carrying a load of poison in his body, a counteracting medicine candestroy the virus in the system. So Jesus, by His powerful consciousness, couldcounteract the evils acquired and accumulated in Soul, but no one, not evenJesus, can break the law of cause and effect created by God, but Jesus couldstop the impending result of an evil action by astrally taking the result of theevil action upon Himself, and thus sparing the person guilty of the evil action.You will ask now how that can be. Well, if you angered John, and he suddenlyraised his hand to beat you, and I suddenly came between his fist and you, thenyou would be spared the hurt and I, being stronger, might not be affected at allby the fistic display of John.So, also, when an evil action was perpetrated by Peter, according to the law ofcause and effect he had to suffer, but, if a powerful Soul like Jesus wanted tosave Peter, he could deflect the havoc caused by the evil action and work it outand spend its evil force within himself. Some saints have been known to actuallytake into their own bodies the diseases of wicked persons, and thus cause thesufferers to be relieved. This does not mean that every healer has to suffer ifhe wants to heal someone by Spiritual law. Only extraordinary Christ-likehealers can take on the sufferings of others resulting from mental disease andSoul sickness, and work them out in their own bodies.The sins of the disciples, and many other Souls, according to the law of causeand effect, were powerful enough to deal death to the evil doers, so Jesus tooktheir sins upon Himself and let His body be crucified. But this crucifixioncould not touch Jesus, for He had said long before His physical death: “Destroythis temple and I shall build it again in three days.”Jesus prayed in the morning and went to a solitary place for prayer. This showsthe way people in general should learn to pray. There is a time for everything.We eat three times a day at certain hours. This nourishes the perishable body.People work eight hours or more a day to make money to maintain themselves andothers who are dependent upon them. In childhood, eight hours a day, plus a fewhours at home, are spent in nourishing the mind. Mental education gives eachindividual at least the common sense by which he knows what methods to adopt inorder, to uniformly perform all the physical, mental, and Spiritual dutiescalculated to bring real happiness.That education is fruitless which makes an individual one-sided, eitherintellectually or spiritually. No duty should be performed by starving out otherduties. One-sidedness brings unhappiness. Those who follow health laws usuallyenjoy good health, but if one spends all day long in the pursuit of health andneglects to be prosperous or Spiritual, he will encounter the miseries arisingfrom poverty and ignorance.Of course, if you are naturally healthy and rich due to an inheritance, youshould spend all of you time in cultivating your Spiritual life. Also, the richdo not realize their Spiritual poverty and, as a result, foolishly spend theirunique opportunity in indulging in the most insecure happiness of the senses.The rich should spend their time exclusively with God. That does not mean thatone has to be rich before being Spiritual, or before knowing God. Anyone whoperforms the highest duty of knowing God automatically has performed all otherlesser duties, for God, once attained, makes one rich with imperishable life andeternal riches. So it is right to seek God first by ignoring everything else.Only, it is disastrous to seek prosperity at the cost of health or to seekhealth by entirely forgetting to strive to be prosperous. Since God is thesource of all power, it is all right to seek Him first by ignoring all otherduties, for, with God, health and prosperity are added, but with the acquirementof health and prosperity alone, God cannot be attained. Besides, the prosperitygained by human effort is perishable, whereas the prosperity which comes afterthe attainment of God is imperishable.Man should use the proper time and the proper place for performing his differentduties. Just as sleep is performed in a quiet bedroom from 6 to 8 hours, and asbusiness is carried on in an atmosphere of business from 8 to 10 hours, and justas intellectual studies are carried on in the morning or at night in a quietlibrary, so, meditation, or contact of God, should be performed in a quiet,solitary place, at early dawn or late in the evening before retiring, for anhour longer.In the depth of the night, or in the early morning, or at any time if in asolitary place, the results of peace realized from meditation are easilyobtained due to lack of noise and lack of wrong vibrations of restless peopleworking around you. Restless thoughts silently pass through the body of themeditating individual and keep his released energy rushing toward the sensesinstead of toward God. However, if a person makes a super effort of will, he canconcentrate in spite of all noise.To meditate on quiet occasions and in solitary places, if available, is veryhelpful to the beginner. On holidays, at least, instead of wasting time withrestless people, walk to a quiet, lonely place and meditate there. By deeplymeditating on the Infinite, and, once the Infinite is contacted, no outwarddisturbance can bother the Soul.As the nighttime is used for sleep and the daytime for business, so spiritualdevelopment is best cultivated during the earliest hour of dawn, from 5 to 8a.m. (any time during that period), from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. To meditate any timeduring these periods is very beneficial.All the laws of attraction and repulsion which govern the body are moreharmonious during the above periods, and thus help an individual to withdraw theLife Force from the sense-telephones of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch.This frees the attention from all sense disturbances and allows it to marchtoward God without interruption.“All men seek for thee” signifies that Jesus was sought by the spirituallyhungry Souls of His day. Just as the fragrance of flowers draws the bees, soSouls like Jesus, who are fragrant with God, automatically draw spirituallyhungry Souls unto themselves."},{"pageContent":"FORGIVENESS OF SINS—HEALING THE LEPER“And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold, there came a manfull of leprosy to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, worshippedhim, and fell on his face, and besought him, saying, ‘Lord if thou wilt, thoucanst make me clean.’ And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, andtouched him, and saith unto him, ‘I will; be thou clean.’ And immediately hisleprosy was cleansed.’”(Luke 5:12-13; Matthew 8:2-3; Mark 1:40-41)A leper worshipped Jesus and prayed to be healed. “I WILL,” spoken by Jesus,signifies the human will tuned in with God’s all-powerful will. Jesus, by theword “I,” did not refer to the limited human ego, but He referred to His soul asunified with the Spirit. Human will is circumscribed by the body. It can doanything to the body; it can keep the body well or plunge it into the abyss,destroying it. The human will, by application, can work changes in the world ina limited way, but when the human will identifies itself with God’s will inecstatic meditation, then it becomes God’s omnipresent will, able to work in allthe channels of force and the avenues of power which govern the universe. It isthen that the devotee, with his magnified will, can work any change in hisextended cosmic body of the universe, even as a man can will to work through allthe nerves and muscles of his own body.Jesus, being one with the omnipresent Father and cosmic energy, felt Hispresence in the body of the leper. And with His omnipresent will, whichcontrolled cosmic energy, He willed the energy in the leper to change theleprous body into a healthy body.The human body is condensed energy and the will of Jesus, being in control ofall omnipresent energy, could effect the change from a leprous condensed energy,or leprous body, to a perfect condensed energy, or perfect body. He willedcosmic energy to clean out all imperfections and to rearrange the lifevibrations and create atomic changes into a perfect body. The leper was healed,and Jesus said to him:“See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, show thyself to the priest,and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimonyunto them.’”(Mark 1:44)Jesus told the leper not to waste time telling everybody about the divinehealing, but to tell only the hypocritical priests who commercialized religionand did not live it in daily life. Jesus, in a way, through His miracle ofhealing the leper, hinted to the priests what they could do if they were reallyspiritual and did not merely profess being so. Jesus believed in the greatnessof Moses and so he asked the leper to offer to the temple those cleansing thingswhich were commanded by Moses, as a testimony of God’s healing."},{"pageContent":"FORGIVENESS OF SINS—JESUS HEALS THE MAN OF PALSY“But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter.And great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of theirinfirmities, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, butwas without in desert places: and he withdrew himself into the wilderness, andprayed. And they came to him from every quarter. And again he entered intoCapernaum for some days: and it was noised that he was in the house. Andstraightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room toreceive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word untothem.“And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there werePharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out every town ofGalilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present toheal them.“And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy, which wasborne of four. And they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in, nigh unto him,because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and uncovered the roofwhere he was: and when they had broken it up, they let him down through thetiling with his couch wherein the sick of the palsy lay, into the midst beforeJesus. When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, ‘Son, beof good cheer: thy sins be forgiven thee.’”(Mark 1:45; 2:1-5; Luke 5:15-20)The healed leper became the best publicity agent of Jesus, that great multitudessought to be healed by Him. Jesus could no more openly enter cities and so Hewithdrew Himself into the wilderness of the desert, and into the wilderness ofHis inner Being, where no restless thoughts ever dared to disturb Him—and thereHe communed with God.When He came to Capernaum for seven days, people heard about Him and His roombecame overcrowded. Many Pharisees and doctors of the law from Galilee, Judaea,and Jerusalem came to see Jesus, and four men, being unable to get to Him, brokeopen the roof of the house where He was and let down the man suffering withpalsy. Jesus, seeing their faith, said unto the sick man: “SON, BE OF GOODCHEER: THY SINS BE FORGIVEN THEE.”Son, be delighted in Spirit, for thy sickness (which is due to some pre-nataland post-natal sins, consciously or unconsciously practiced by thee, but unknownto thee now, and which are forgiven by the mercy of God) is healed.Every sinful action leaves a sinful seed or tendency in the brain, which latersprouts into some mental or physical calamity when the conditions of evilactions are favorable.Just as a needle, when it strikes the grooves of a record, plays a certain song,so also, the needle of an evil action, when it touches a grooved evil tendencyin the brain, brings forth the corresponding song of evil experience.Every experience, good or bad, if intense, leaves a mental and physical recordin the brain. This mental and grooved physical record in the brain can be playedat any time by the suitable needle of specific association of ideas.Divine men, like Jesus, can with will and cosmic energy burn from any man themental and physical records of sin which keep on singing the fruition of sinfulcalamities. With the burning of the inner sinful records, the misery-producingsongs of evil experience disappear also. This is what Jesus meant by“forgiveness of sins,” when He healed the man stricken with palsy.“And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason in their hearts, ‘Why doth thisman thus speak blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God only?’ And immediatelywhen Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he,knowing their thoughts, said unto them,“Why reason ye these things? Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? Whether itis easier to say to the sick of the palsy, thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say,arise, and take up thy bed and walk? But that ye may know that the Son of manhath power on earth to forgive sins,’ (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) ‘Isay unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.’”(Mark 2:6-11; Luke 5:21-24)The human consciousness of the materially-minded people could not understand howGod-identified Jesus could forgive the results of evil actions. When a gluttoneats too much and suffers from acute indigestion, he cannot forgive or relievethe reactions of his greedy actions. If he follows the advice of a doctor, hecan relieve himself of stomach trouble.So, in the spiritual world, the psychologically sick person can be forgiven orfreed from the painful results of his actions if he follows the advice of thereal spiritual teacher to whom all spiritual errors must be disclosed(confession) for the sake of spiritual diagnosis and the finding ad prescribingof the proper remedy. But the sinful priest, who has not found forgiveness orrelief from his own sins, cannot possibly forgive or relieve other error-makersfrom sin.Sin consists of pursuing erroneous ways which lead to physical, mental, andspiritual unhappiness under the lure of happiness. Sin promises happiness andimparts unhappiness. Virtue promises no immediate happiness but positively,ultimately gives lasting happiness. Besides, the sons of God have power like Godto relieve us from all the suffering of our bodies, minds, and souls.A spiritual and mental healing current can be offered invisibly to offset theeffects of evil Karma, or actions, lodged in the brain cells. As acids candissolve a record, so the mental and physiological grooves in the brain cells ofan error-stricken individual can be obliterated by the transmission of LifeForce. Erroneous habits can be changed to good habits in individuals. God, whois the maker or souls, minds, and bodies, originally made human beings after thepattern of His Perfect Image, but they chose to desecrate and distort thatdivine image into a mortal image by the misuse of God-given independence.Ordinarily, human beings in general think that God alone, the Almighty Maker,can change an ignorance-distorted mortal man back to his original perfect divinestate as God’s perfect image, but materially-minded people fail to realize thatthe God-knowing saint is one with God. Jesus had often asserted the real truth:“I and my Father are One.” And Jesus, being One with the Father, could doeverything that God can do. That is why Jesus gave life to Lazarus.Jesus, being present in the bodies of the doubting scribes and Pharisees, felttheir thoughts and replied to their doubting feelings. Jesus asked the doubtingPharisees: “Why are you concerned about my forgiving the sins of men? Why do youthink it is evil to relieve people of their miseries by the power of God actingthrough Me, or by My power given unto Me by God?”Jesus signified his complete unity with God, and that He was free from allillusive egotism. Therefore, Jesus explained why He could say to the sickeither, “Thy sins be forgiven thee by God,” or, “Arise and take up thy bed andwalk,” or, “I (as the conscious reflection of the power and true image of theHeavenly Father) say unto thee, arise and take up thy bed and go thy way intothine house.”The ordinary person, not one with God in Self-Realization, even though humble,can have the undetected ego hiding in him, even if he humbly says to the sick,“Be healed by God’s power.” But the superman, who is one with God, does not feelhis separating egotism even when he says, “I say unto thee, arise and behealed.” Here “I” signifies the “God alone” which the true devotee feels withinhimself.True devotees, true Gurus (Preceptors), never feel themselves to be preceptors,for they behold in themselves none other than the pure God. The Guru is theawakened God, awakening the sleeping God in the disciple."},{"pageContent":"THE DIVINE LAW OF HEALING—JESUS HEALS THE IMPOTENT MAN“After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Nowthere is at Jerusalem, by the sheep market, a pool, which is called in theHebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude ofimpotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled thewater: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was madewhole of whatsoever disease he had.“And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case,he saith unto him, ‘Wilt Thou Be Made Whole?’”(John 5:1-6)During a feast time Jesus went to Jerusalem and came to the pool of Bethesda,where a crowd of stricken people waited to bathe when the waters were troubledby an inner healing force (an angel). At certain periods, this pool vibrated andemanated healing earth currents (electrical), and those who bathed in the poolat that time were healed.Also, the belief in the healing power of the water caused a mental reactionwhich healed many of the people. The mind controls the body. A person who issick for a long time becomes mentally weak and his will is so paralyzed withsickness that he cannot throw off the trouble. However, faith in anything oranybody may revive his all-healing, all-powerful will to release the nascentbrain energy and effect the healing of any diseased part of the body.Jesus saw a man, who had been afflicted for thirty-eight years, lying by thepool unable to get into it by himself when the waters moved. Filled withcompassion, and knowing the superiority of mind power (which could heal byitself without depending upon any outside factor), He asked, “WILT THOU BE MADEWHOLE?”“The impotent man answered him, ‘Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled,to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down beforeme.’ Jesus saith unto him, ‘Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.’ And immediatelythe man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day wasthe Sabbath.”(John 5:7-8)Jesus knew the divine law of healing, which requires the proper soil of faith onthe part of the patient and the proper seed of mental healing power on the partof the healer in order to grow the three of healing. So Jesus prepared the soilof faith by creating in the stricken man the desire to be healed by divine law.When Jesus found that the sick man desired very much to be healed, He said,“RISE, TAKE UP THY BED, AND WALK.” He meant that the stricken man need no longerwait to be healed by the waters of the pool of Bethesda (by an outside physicalcondition), but that he should realize the unlimited power of God hidden withinthe human mind, and he would be healed at once.The man was instantaneously healed by (1), the uninterrupted flow of theunlimited, all-healing energy of God through the mental transparency of the lifeof Jesus; and (2), by his own awakened faith and the revival of his paralyzedwill, which served as the antenna for charging the all-healing combined cosmicenergy from Jesus and the latent life energy of his own brain.“The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, ‘It is the Sabbath day: it isnot lawful for thee to carry thy bed.’ He answered them, ‘He that made me whole,the same said unto me, ‘Take up thy bed and walk.’ Then asked they him, ‘Whatman is that which said unto thee, ‘Take up thy bed and walk?’ And he that washealed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitudebeing in that place.”(John 5:10-13)The hypocritical Jews did not want to express their amazement at the healingperformed by Jesus, for that would be an acknowledgment of His superiority overthem, so they began to display a sham zeal for the laws of the Sabbath day.The healed man replied to the Jews that the man who had healed him had commandedhim to carry the bed. He did not want to say it was Jesus, who had disappearedin the multitude.“Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, ‘Behold, thou artmade whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.’”(John 5:14)Jesus told the healed man that his sickness had been the result of his ownpre-natal and post-natal evil actions and that was why he should not continue topursue evil ways. Jesus told him also to free his power of independent actionfrom the influence of the seeds of past evil actions. He said that if evilactions were continued, all the evils of his past actions and the evils accruingfrom new actions would act like a casual Karmic bomb which would explode andcause worse troubles.Traces of evil actions lie hidden like mental bombs within the brain until theycan be ignited by freshly kindled evil actions. Hidden bombs of past eviltendencies can be destroyed by soaking them in the waters of fresh,newly-acquired wisdom.When you become physically sick, remember that sickness is the result ofbreaking some mental or physical law, either in this life or in a pastembodiment. If, then, you are healed by spiritual or healthful living, or by thehealing power of some divine being, you should not again pile up more traces ofevil actions to explode later as greater physical or mental maladies.The Hindu Scriptures say that it is difficult to get away from the effectsarising from physical, mental, moral, or spiritual errors made in this life orin past lives. Many people lead mechanical lives without taking account of theamount of evil or good they have stored up in past lives. The results of goodand bad actions are stored in the subconscious mind like seed tendencies whichgerminate and grow when the specific suitable opportunity arrives.In this world it sometimes happens that a good man suddenly becomes a bad one.The reason for this change is that a hidden bomb of pre-natal evil explodes whenhe touches the fire of evil environment. Likewise, a man who is habitually badman suddenly become good due to the germination of hidden seeds of pre-natalgood actions. Of course, a person may become good or bad due to his own freechoice, but in most cases it is found that sudden changes in the habits of aperson can be ascribed to pre-natal causes or hidden post-natal effects ofactions."},{"pageContent":"SIN NO MOREWhen Jesus said: “SIN NO MORE LEST A WORSE THING COME UNTO THEE,” He signifiedthat our sufferings are directly or indirectly caused by sinful actionsperformed in this life or in past lives. Jesus meant that He had, by His greatwill power, overcome the sufferings resulting from the sick man’s past sins andthat the man should not sin again lest worse evil overtake him. Jesus clearlysignified that the rewards of sin or virtue do not come from unknown causes orfrom an act of God, but that they are the result of human wrong or good actions.Jesus knew the law of cause and effect, or action, which governs the life ofman. Ordinary people, who do not lead scientific lives, think that all goodfortune or misfortune is caused by an inscrutable, whimsical destiny. Theyshould give up this conception and try to govern their lives by wisdom. Wheneveryou find that you are suffering from a physical or financial ailment, rememberthat it is caused by an error committed in the present or in a past life.Instead of moaning over your fate and blaming destiny, you should try to adoptthe counteracting antidote of good actions to mitigate and lessen the effect ofpast evil actions.In the healing of the sinful man by Jesus we find the lesson that when a personis overburdened by the effects of past sinful actions, he can get release byfollowing the counsel of a real spiritual doctor, who can, by his will power,partially or completely heal the patient if the latter chooses to cooperate withthe spiritual doctor and follow his divine prescriptions.The Hindu Scriptures say that all lives are governed by the law of cause andeffect. That is why some people are born blind or ignorant and some are bornhealthy, wealthy, and wise. If pre-natal causes did not operate to create thedifferences in the lives of men at birth, then God could be blamed forpartiality in equipping one with the brain of a moron and another with the brainof a wise man. If God ordained an infant to have the brain of a moron, Hecertainly could not make that child responsible for his ignorant actions.Whereas, a child who is equipped with a good brain will naturally act wisely.From the above example of healing by Jesus and from His saying, “Sin no morelest a worse thing come,” it is distinctly evident that Jesus knew that not onlyare our lives governed by the law of action, but that reincarnation alone canexplain the inequalities and seeming injustices which visit human beings attheir birth. In this healing it is evident also that all ills and allvisitations of sins in the beginning of life, or later, are due to man’s ownactions. Jesus makes every man responsible for his own suffering. Another lessonthe above example of healing teaches is that a chronic physical, moral, ormental sickness can be healed in one of two ways; either by contacting aspiritual man and taking his advice, or by adopting the counteracting antidoteof good actions to minimize or destroy the effects of past evil actions."},{"pageContent":"SABBATH DAY“The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made himwhole. And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him,because he had done these things on the Sabbath day.“But Jesus answered them, ‘My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.’”(John 5:15-17)When the man departed and told the Jews that Jesus had healed him on the Sabbathday, the Jews tried to persecute Him. The Jews mechanically observed the Sabbathand their ethics of living whereas Jesus followed the spirituality of rules,often ignoring the superficiality and formality in following them. It ispossible on the Sabbath day to do nothing but be conscious of the idleness ofthe material body. Many people who outwardly observe the Sabbath day are stillliving identified with the material consciousness of the body. Such people, whoover-emphasize the inactivity of the body, often forget to follow the spirit ofthe Sabbath, which consists in remaining identified with Spirit by discardingmaterial engagements. Those hypocritical Jews, who followed only a materialSabbath consisting of cessation of physical activity without spiritualcommunion, did not realize that Jesus could perform a material act on theSabbath day without being material.To Jesus every day was a Sabbath day. He lived every day in wisdom andGod-consciousness, and needed no special Sabbath day. Special Sabbath days arenecessary for the people who are entangled continuously and who do not take anytime for God. Besides this, the act of healing a person is not material work anddoes not contradict the spirit of the Sabbath day. The Jews knew this in theirhearts and, in order to ease their conscience about their hypocriticalobservance of the Sabbath, they wanted to persecute Jesus, who apparently hadbroken the inactivity of the Sabbath day by healing the sinful person.That is why Jesus said: “MY FATHER WORKETH HITHERTO, AND I WORK.” He meant thatwhatever work He did here was actuated by His consciousness of the Father andthat He was not actuated by evil. He was guided by the intuitional consciousnesswhich He received from God."},{"pageContent":"ACTIONS ARE FREEEvery devotee, no matter what he does, feels that his actions, will, and reasonare free but that they are guided by the wisdom of the Heavenly Father. Devoteesare not slaves of God but they act wisely by their own volition and in that waythey find themselves being guided by God’s wisdom, for all wisdom comes fromGod. God never commands His devotees to do anything, but those who feel thepresence of God, know Him as wisdom and they prefer to be guided by thesuper-wisdom of God rather than by their own egotistical will. That is why Jesussaid: “Verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing himself but what he seeththe father do.” In the above sentence, Jesus told exactly how He worked. Heshowed that He was in love with God and with such wisdom and love of God He sawGod and God’s actions, and as He saw the Heavenly Father act and as He feltGod’s actions, He acted likewise of His own free choice.This did not involve enslavement of the will of Jesus, but it meant that Jesusfound that a man’s wisdom-guided will is identical with God’s wisdom-guidedwill, since all wisdom is His alone."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 15: The Divine Task—The Will of The Father“Therefore, said the disciples one to another, ‘Hath any man brought him aughtto eat?’ Jesus said unto them, ‘My meat is to do the will of him that sent me,and to finish his work. Say not ye, ‘There are yet four months, and then comethharvest?’ behold I say unto you, ‘lift up your eyes and look on the fields, forthey are white already to harvest. And he that reapeth receiveth wages andgathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapethmay rejoice together.’ And herein is that saying true, One soweth and anotherreapeth. I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other menlaboured, and ye are entered into their labours.’”(John 4:33-38)The disciples erroneously thought that Jesus had already had some food when Hesaid: “I have meat to eat that ye know not of.” Ordinary food temporarilynourishes the perishable body and gives it a passing pleasure arising from thesense of taste. Jesus was telling his disciples that to human eyes, although hisbody needed food, his real Self tasted the ever-satisfying, eternally-nourishingmanna of Divine Wisdom and Celestial ever-new Bliss. The disciples did not knowhow to nourish their Souls.I often find in homes comprised of materially-minded members that most of themembers wake up in the morning with the consciousness of a cup of coffee, toast,and ham and eggs, and go to sleep at night thinking of beefsteak. In spiritualhomes, the home members think first in the morning of drinking the cool nectarof Peace from the bowl of deep contemplation, and at night they think of thevoice of Divine Peace singing softly, inviting them to rest on the bosom ofDivine Peace.Upon wakening in the morning and at night before going to sleep, and atmealtime, people should fumigate their material consciousness with the thoughtof God. The idea is to remain in the world but not to be of the world. To remainunattached, like the dewdrop on the lotus leaf, is to be really happy, ready toslip the consciousness into God. The dewdrop cannot slide on a blotting paper,so the average Soul cannot keep the mind free to slip into God if he associateswith materially-minded people who are attached to things.Jesus repulsed the idea of food, not because He thought that it was unnecessaryfor Him to eat, but because He wished to show to the disciples that theconsciousness of man should be predominantly on God, the ever-satisfying food,and not on a material diet.Jesus said that, as meat is loved by most people, so His relish consisted indoing the will of God cheerfully and not like a puppet. Prophets have come forthe distinct purpose of filling a world need according to the Cosmic Divineplan. Jesus knew how long He was to stay on earth, and realized the possibilityof being crucified. He was aware of the stupendous mission He had to perform onearth while He lived. “TO FINISH HIS WORK” signifies the finishing of the DivineTask which was His part to carry out during His incarnation as Jesus, and notthe work of redemption which He has to carry throughout Eternity."},{"pageContent":"THE SPIRITUAL HARVESTJesus used the parable of the sower, the laborer, the harvesting time, and theharvest to illustrate the superior law of the Divine Harvester. In ordinaryfarming there is a great deal of labor, and the harvest comes in about fourmonths after planting, but Jesus said that the Spiritual harvest is not a matterof waiting, laboring, and then acquiring the Spiritual harvest, but it is amatter of knowing that one already, in a latent form, possesses in his DivineImage all the inheritance of the Divine Father. When this knowledge comes, thecontact of God instantaneously manifests itself in the Soul from beneath thewisdom-seared veil of ignorance.Jesus said that all one has to do is to lift the consciousness from the play ofmaterial vibrations to the ever-ready harvest of wisdom, glistening on thefields of pure white Cosmic Consciousness. Human wisdom has to be acquiredgradually through the medium of the limited senses and intelligence, but DivineWisdom can be grasped instantaneously through the medium of Intuition, which isdeveloped by meditation.The idea is that if one closes his eyes, he shuts out the light, and the minuteone opens his eyes, he perceives light. In the same way, the minute one openshis eyes of wisdom, he beholds the light of God. This is a great consolation,for the mortal law is governed by the law of “as you sow, so shall you reap.”To reach perfection as a mortal through this law, one has to travel throughendless incarnations, which is almost an impossibility, but to know oneselfthrough meditation as the Son of God is to claim instantaneously the forgottenDivine Inheritance.As human beings, we need to acquire everything; as children of God, we do nothave to acquire, but we need only to realize that we already know everything.The human harvest has to be sown and reaped, and then enjoyed for a short time,but the Divine Harvest has only to be reaped and enjoyed throughout Eternity.Jesus said not to waste time becoming materially rich, only to lose what you getthrough great effort, but He said to just make the effort to know what you haveas a Divine Child by taking off the death-mask of mortal consciousness from theImmortal face of the Soul, and to enjoy the eternal harvest of Bliss in God.Some people may say: “Well, it takes great effort to be Spiritual.” I say: “No.”The only effort we have to make is to forget our unspiritual mortalconsciousness, and as soon as that is done we know we are gods. He who reapsDivine Wisdom through meditation receives the wages of Eternal Wisdom, and thegathers the forgotten fruits of ever-new Bliss as the result.“That both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together,” signifiesthat God, as the Sower of Wisdom in Souls, is pleased when He finds that Histrue children reap the harvest grown by Him and not the harvest of evil sown andreaped by mortal ignorance.“ONE SOWETH AND THE OTHER REAPETH” signifies that God is the only Sower, theonly Source of Wisdom, and that we, as Him children, must reap what He hasalready grown for us.Jesus says that God sent people to reap the harvest of Wisdom and Bliss stackedin their Souls for which no human effort was made. We have, by meditation, onlyto rise above our self-created nightmares of human miseries, that is all, thenwe shall instantaneously remember our forgotten image of God. In the world, justforgetting poverty does not make us rich. We have to acquire riches, but asGod’s children we immediately become Divine, endowed with all powers, the minutewe forget our self-created mortal consciousness by deep meditation.It is easy for all of us to be a Jesus Christ in one life by proper meditationbecause we are potentially already Sons of God, made in His image, but for allof us try to become rich like Henry Ford is almost an impossibility because ofthe limitations of earthly life.“Other men labored and ye are entered into their labors” means that other mortalSouls labor for perishable material things and you foolishly imitate them andstruggle on for something you cannot have. Rather, by meditation and calmness,open your age-long closed eyes of wisdom, and in the light of awakening findyourself as the owner of the entire Cosmos."},{"pageContent":"JESUS HONORS THE SABBATH“And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was,he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read. Andthere was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he hadopened the book, he found the place where it was written, “The Spirit of theLord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor;he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to thecaptives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that arebruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.” And he closed the book, andhe gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them thatwere in the synagogue were fastened on him. And he began to say unto them, “THISDAY IS THIS SCRIPTURE FULFILLED IN YOUR EARS.’”(Luke 4:16-21)Jesus went to his native land of Nazareth and in the synagogue, on the SabbathDay, He stood up to read. Jesus believed that every man should recharge hisvitality by the restful silence of the Sabbath. Eating heavy meals on Sundaysdoes not produce rest, but bodily discomfort. Hence, light meals, fruit orvegetable dinners, or even fasting, is good on Sundays. Fasting, or lighteating, gives the motors of the stomach and heart rest from their heavy weeklywork. Too much eating keeps the mind busy with the body and diverts theattention from God.The worldly man saturates his Soul with worries throughout the week and loadshis body with excessive food and unassimilated food poisons. Hence, a day ofintrospective silence gives each individual a change to think things over andreorganize a balanced mode of living. Sunday sermons and periods of silencerecharged the peace-hungry Soul. This Sunday peace, if deeply recharged into theSoul of the businessman, may last him throughout the week and help him to battlewith his restless mental moods, temptations, and financial worries. If theworldly man gives a whole week to money-making pursuits, eating, and amusements,he should at least give one day to the thought of God, without whom his verylife, brain, activity, feeling, and entertainments are impossible.Sunday worship may not have been necessary to Jesus because every day was to Hima Sun’s Day, or Divine Wisdom’s Day. However, great men always show goodexamples in order to help others who imitate them. If Jesus, Spiritual as Hewas, thought it necessary to go to the Temple on Sundays, why shouldn’tsense-habit-driven people do likewise? Sunday prayers recharge the Soul of theaverage person until, at the end of the week, those Sunday influences begin towear off; therefore, it is necessary for everyone to recharge his Soul-batterywith Sunday silence at least once a week.The average person usually finds the influence of material habits predominantthroughout the week and can seldom retain sufficient of the sacred influences ofSunday worship to last until the following Sunday. Of course, a dime is betterthan no money at all. Even weekly Sunday sermons suggest to thematerially-minded person the necessity of acquiring the peace-producinginfluence of Sunday silence, but to feel appreciably the predominating influenceof Sunday peace one ought to consider early morning, noontime before lunch,evening before dinner, and especially the quiet time before sleep, as Sundays orreal times in which to cultivate habits of peace through meditation. If anyone,even twice, during the earliest hour of dawn and in the depth of night, worshipsGod in the church of meditation for fifteen minutes to one hour, he will findthat the Spiritual habits of peace will predominate over his worry-producingmaterial habits.Of course, the man who is busy with perishable things (such as stocks, bonds,and so forth, which cannot pass through the fiery gates of after-life) untildeath, must at least make his best effort to worship God in some real church. Hemust remember not to keep his body in the church and his Soul away concernedwith his business worries. He must worship with a calm body and a quiet mind. Ifhe keeps doing this, he may eventually be inclined to meditate every day.Jesus meant that the peace-church to attend is one hour’s deep silence everySunday, which may be at any time of the day, whenever one wishes to cultivatewisdom or bask in the daylight of the Sun of Wisdom and silence—Sunday. Besides,doing certain things at certain times creates the willingness to perform thoseactions. The body assimilates food better when breakfast, lunch, and dinner areserved regularly. To go to church regularly on Sundays develops the habit ofthinking of religion or of God at least once a week.Regular eating, regular efforts at business success, regular church-going, andregular meditation, develops specific habits. When material or Spiritual actionsare regularly repeated, either daily or weekly, they are bound to createphysiological, and consequently psychological habits. Most people are ruled bytheir bad material habits. Bad habits cannot be destroyed by mere willingness toeradicate them, but only by adopting the antidote of good habits.Many people wonder why, in spite of their continued willingness to get rid ofbad habits, they are still swept down that current. Willingness is not enough;one must act according to that willingness, not only once or twice, butrepeatedly and consciously, then he can expect to get rid of bad habits. Hence,achievement lies in continued activity.Knowing the above-mentioned law of habit which governs human nature, Jesus setthe example by going to the synagogue on the Sabbath day. His sermon began withthe reading of the Book of the Prophet Esaias. Jesus purposely read from thebook of Esaias those portions which tallied with the kind of work He wasdestined to do.“The Spirit of the Lord (or the Intelligent power of Christ Consciousness whichdirects all Creation) is upon my Soul.” When one unlike mortals feels that hisSoul is united to the vast Spirit, he is baptized with inexhaustible Spiritualwisdom, and thus he can ably and fittingly preach the Gospel, or God’s intuitivewisdom, to the poor or to humble recipient minds. God-saturated Souls alone canput together the hearts of men broken by material desires. When the human heartis broken by the false promises of material happiness, then nothing can satisfythat Soul except the matchless, unending Divine happiness.As immortals, we are sent on earth for entertainment, but when we forget thatand become enmeshed in material desires, we begin erroneously to expect unendinghappiness from perishable matter, and hence we become brokenhearted. ThenGod-known Souls can come to the rescue by reminding us of the unending happinessof Spirit, which remains hidden within our own Souls. God-empowered Souls,finding all power coming from Him, can, by the exercise of matter-controllingDivine will, remodel even the disorganized atoms in a blind man’s eyes. SuchDivine Souls can also heal the Spiritual blindness of individuals.God-perceiving Souls alone can free other Souls who are bruised by worries andby the faithlessness of so-called friends.The purpose of Jesus in reading the above passages from the Book of Esaias wasdistinctly meant to show that His coming had already been prophesied. This showsthat, in spite of the apparent invisibility and secret presence of God, Hesometimes reveals His plans to the world through the meek but true words ofprophets. Of course, charlatans use passages of the Scriptures to serve theirown nefarious ends, but Jesus knew that God had asked His saints to prophesy thecoming of His beloved Son through the Scriptures. Jesus, in his meek way,declared through the words of Esaias that He was not baptized with water by man,but that He was bathed in the Ocean of Spirit, which inspired Him to be aGod-chosen minister.Some people read a little about the Scriptures, or get a Doctor of Divinitydegree through the virtue of memorizing the Scriptures, and then they think thatthey are qualified to stand in a pulpit and pour out to others their imaginationabout scriptural Truths. Of course, such self-elected ministers do little goodin the world. People let their unlived sermons in through one ear and outthrough the other, but when one who has been a devotee for years meditates uponGod and succeeds in pleasing HIM, then He chooses that devoted Soul to bringothers back to His mansion. These advanced Souls are saturated with the Spirit,intelligence, and power of God, and anyone physically, mentally, or spirituallysick, coming in contact with them, becomes really healed.In modern churches there is very little real beneficial relation between theminister and his church members. The minister, instead of giving holy sermonssimply to create a vague devotion in the minds of his people, must be able toheal their physical, mental, and, above all, their Spiritual sickness ofignorance. Jesus, knowing the prevalence of false prophets, declared that He wasnot a self-elected, useless minister, but one who had been taught by God andempowered by Him to heal His children. Besides, Jesus showed that God haddeclared in the Scriptures the coming of His special messenger, or Son.The usual custom is to develop gradually from the physical and intellectual tothe Spiritual, and then from the Spiritual people fall back to the physicalagain. During the material state of world civilization, when misery invades man,God from time to time sends His Christ-like devotees to redeem men. That is whysome Souls are ordained to act as reformers chosen by God. That is why Jesussaid: “This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears,” that is, in realityJesus came to declare through His own words His coming, which had been writtenin the Scriptures a long time before. As God chooses a special manifestation ofHimself to redeem the world from its special state of darkness, He also worksthrough His devotees at all times to redeem His erring children."},{"pageContent":"JESUS REVEALS HIS PAST INCARNATION AND HIS KNOWLEDGE OF DIVINE LAW“And all bear him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceededout of his mouth. And they said, ‘Is not this Joseph’s son?’ And he said untothem, ‘Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, ‘Physician, heal thyself:whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.’“And he said, ‘Verily, I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his owncountry. But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days ofElias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great faminewas throughout all the land; But unto none of them was Elias sent, save untoSarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. And many lepers were isIsrael in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, savingNaaman, the Syrian.”(Luke 4:22-27)All those who heard Jesus were amazed at the prophetic words which gently flowedout of His sacred mouth, and they perceived the ring of Truth in His words. Andyet, while they were marveling at His profound utterances, they suddenly doubtedin the mortal way and began to say: “O, how could the son of our Joseph, one orour fellow mortals, prophesy and heal people?”As soon as Jesus heard this, He began to furnish reasons for the behavior ofprophets, who only act according to the will of God and not like ordinaryself-willed mortals.Jesus spoke to the people in the following way, revealing the grand secret ofHis past incarnation: “My dear people, you expect me to heal here just as Ihealed the sick at Capernaum, and you may wonder why, as a Spiritual physician,I can heal foreign people and cannot heal my own people in my own country. Doyou realize that a prophet is not usually accepted in his own country?Acceptance signifies faith, and without the good soil of faith, no healing seedcan be fruitfully sown by even a man of God. The Almighty subjects His prophetsto his inculcated Spiritual laws. Since God gave independence to man, man couldshut out Divine power out of his life or bring God’s power to shine through thewindow of faith.”Divine Healing is based on the law of reciprocity. Here in my own country thepeople are used to me. They know me as a mortal man and have consequently nofaith in me, and without faith, neither God nor I could heal, because accordingto the Divine decree of the gift of free will, man can successfully resistDivine influences as well as the influence of all saints. There can be nogreater healer than Omnipresent God. He is trying to heal His mortal childrenfrom all troubles, but He cannot do so, because man shuts Him out.”Besides, dear people, don’t you know that the Scriptures are full ofillustrations where prophets, like Elias, (Elijah) and my former Self as theprophet Eliseus, (Elisha) healed only those who spiritually deserved it and whowere thus ordained by God to be healed?”Jesus knew that John the Baptist, in a former life, had been Elias, (Elijah) theGuru-Perceptor of His long past incarnation. One attracts Spiritual teacherswhen he is desirous of Spiritual training, but a Guru, or direct messenger ofGod, is sent only when the disciple is extremely determined to know God. Goduses the speech, mind, and wisdom of the Guru to teach and redeem the disciple.Jesus mentioned Elias, (Elijah) and Eliseus, (Elisha) in the course of his talkto the people, because He knew that His former Guru-Preceptor, Elias, andHimself, as Eliseus, had been supremely endowed with healing powers, yet wereallowed to heal only in accordance with Divine laws.So Jesus said to the people: “I TELL YOU OF A TRUTH,” that is, “I tell youtruthfully, as I remember from my past incarnation, that during the existence ofmy Guru-Preceptor, Elias, due to the accumulated evils of bad actions of peoplein general, and their destructive vibrations, Heavenly laws controlling allforces of Nature were prevented from proper functioning, resulting in greatfamine. Elias and God were helpless and could not free the people because theyexercised their own misguided free will to shut out the Divine powers.”Thus Jesus said that famine resulted from the accumulated evils of people, andwhen they did not exercise their free choice to cultivate faith they had to gothrough the ravages of famine for three years and six months. Of course, theirpunishment was brought on by themselves, because their wrong actions and theirvibrations disrupted the finer Astral forces which control the ultimate forces,climatic conditions, and so forth, which govern the earth.Jesus was not speaking of fatalism, but He was emphasizing the idea that manmust suffer the consequences of his actions if he misuses his free will, and ifhe does not invoke God’s aid when he is fallen. Thus, Jesus said that not evenHis past Guru-Preceptor, Elias, nor God, could do anything to stop the famine inIsrael. Jesus also pointed out that there were many needy widows in Israel atthat time, but there was only one widow in Sarepta, a city of Sidon, who madeenough Spiritual effort to deserve the God-ordained Spiritual aid from Elias.Then, with a dramatic prophecy, He subtly and incidentally spoke of Himself asthe Eliseus of yore, who was not ordained by the Spiritual laws to heal all thelepers who existed then, but only one named Naaman. This reference of Eliseus isvery significant. This Truth has remained veiled since Jesus spoke of Eliseus.This is the first time that this great Truth as to who Jesus was in the time ofElias has been revealed. Read about Eliseus, or Elisha, and you will find thathe raised the dead and fed one hundred people with twenty loaves of bread, evenas when he appeared as Jesus He raised Lazarus from the dead and fed fivethousand people with five loaves.In the above passage, Jesus said to the people: “My dear people, you do notunderstand how Divine laws operate, and that is why you ask me why I cannot healin my own country. Now you know that it is nothing new that when I, as theprophet Eliseus, raised one from the dead and healed one leper, but did notraise all the dead people, nor heal all the lepers in Israel in my time. I,Eliseus, did only what the Spiritual laws influenced me to do.”In the above passages Jesus described the Divine law which works justly insecrecy and not in a sensational way before the curious-gazing eyes of people,and, incidentally, Jesus described His past as the prophet Eliseus, the discipleof Elias. It is for this reason that Jesus said that Elias had come already asJohn the Baptist. It is for this reason that he asked Elias to anoint Him andbaptize Him with Spirit and with water.A Guru-Preceptor, being ordained by God, is sent to the extremely anxious, andgenuinely seeking disciple. Then the Guru-Preceptor and the disciple enter intoa vow of eternal, unconditional friendship and pledge to redeem each other andhelp each other until final emancipation is gained. Human friends part throughmisunderstanding, forgetfulness, and death. Divine friendship, though born inmutual Divine usefulness, still is unconditional and continues beyond theportals of death. Sometimes the Guru-Preceptor falls down, only to be lifted upby the advanced disciple, as Jesus uplifted the fallen Elias, or John theBaptist, who could only baptize with water. Most of the time, the Guru-Preceptorfollows the disciple through all necessary incarnations, until he is redeemed.“And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled withwrath, And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow ofthe hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.But he, passing through the midst of them, went his way.”(Luke 4:28-30)Those who heard Jesus flawlessly expound the Divine Law were filled with wrath.The people wanted Jesus to operate the Divine Law of healing as if He wereperforming in a circus. They tempted Him to go against the will of the Father bysaying: “Physician, heal thyself; whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, doalso here in thy country.”But Jesus cut them short by saying that Elijah and Eliseus were great prophets,who did not do what they wanted to do, but who did what God directed them to do.Even though they had healing power, and could heal thousands, yet they healedonly those who were commanded by God to be healed.The people were frustrated in their attempt to dislodge Jesus from hisconsciousness of right action and from exhibiting an open display of DivinePowers, so they became filled with wrath and thrust Jesus out of the city andled Him to the brow of a hill, to cast Him down headlong.But, strange as are the decrees of God, Jesus was protected by Invisible DivinePower. God, being present in the Souls of all, secretly cast oblivion in thehearts of the adversaries of Jesus, who forgot to take the final step in the actof throwing Him down the hill."},{"pageContent":"JESUS FULFILLS THE SCRIPTURES AND PREACHES REPENTANCE“Now, when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed intoGalilee; And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon thesea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim; That it might be fulfilledwhich was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, ‘The land of Zebulon, and theland of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of theGentiles; The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them whichsat in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung up.’ From that time Jesusbegan to preach, and to say,“‘REPENT: FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND.’”(Matthew 4:12-17)Jesus went to Galilee. Leaving Nazareth, He dwelt in Capernaum, which is uponthe seacoast at the border between Zabulon and Nephthalim, that the prophecy ofEsaias, the prophet, might be fulfilled. Great prophets predict the coming ofgreat Messiashs, who, from time to time, are sent to earth. So Esaias, orIsaiah, happened to be the mouthpiece of God to declare the coming of St. Johnand Jesus.“For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, ‘The voice ofone crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his pathsstraight.’” (Matthew 3:3)When the words of prophets come true, it should be a glaring testimony, to thedisbelievers, of the consciously initiated plan of God in the world. In spite ofthe mystery of events and strange happenings in the world, once in a whiledefinite prophecies, veiled in complex language, are given to the world so thatpeople may awaken to the realization of the subtle presence of God in the world.Jesus consciously knew about the declaration of the prophet Esaias, and wasdivinely guided to go into Galilee to preach the gospel of the Lord. The peoplewho sat in the darkness of ignorance beheld the great all-revealing light ofChrist-Wisdom.In the Hindu Scriptures we find mentioned that the Saints live in so-calleddarkness of material poverty and in the light of Eternal Wisdom, whereas mostpeople are living in the imaginary light of material prosperity enveloped by thethick darkness of unspirituality. Here darkness signifies Spiritual ignorance.Just as a thousand years of darkness lodge in a mountain cave is dislodge by alighted match, so the vibrations of the gathered ignorance of Ages in a city canbe dispelled by a Saint who bears the invisible torch of God’s wisdom.There are two kinds of people, those who sit in the darkness of ignorance andlove it, and those who become conscious of the gloom of ignorance and want toget out of it with the freeing light of wisdom. Through knowledge andsubconscious memory in the Soul, the latter kind of people remember theirexperience with light and therefore abhor the pit of dark ignorance into whichthey find themselves fallen through their own wrong actions. So, in Galilee,only those people who realized their dark ignorance, and were inwardly clamoringfor the light of wisdom, felt the great wisdom vibrations of Jesus.Those also who were steeped in spiritual ignorance and had been going throughthe mysterious death-like changes of life, were relieved of their inner gloom bythe very presence of Jesus and His luminous wisdom. Usually Souls who are underthe influence of this Cosmic dream behold life and shadowy death and alldualities, but when they wake up in the light of wisdom, they behold nothing butthe Oneness of God’s Light.Krishna, in the Hindu Scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, speaks of this earth as theaggregate of delusive mysteries and the ocean of affliction. In the ChristianBible Esaias speaks of the worldly people as sitting in the shadow of death orconstantly changing temporal events of this earth. How could changeless,permanent happiness be wrung out of the imperfect earth surroundings, mixed withthe changeful events of sorrow and joy, disease, and health?People are foolish to look for Paradise in earthly things. They should look forParadise within themselves while living on earth. The earth conditions, beingborn of delusion, will always be more or less defective, and that can only beovercome by the contact of the unchanging Light of Wisdom perceived inmeditation. Jesus made people open their closed eyes of wisdom and dispel theself-created darkness, so that they perceived the Fountain of Light springingfrom the broken soil of darkness.To fulfill the words of the prophecy, Jesus, from that time on, began to preachthe gospel, or God’s pronouncements or commandments, and the laws about theKingdom of Heaven and its happiness. There is time for everything. The wholeCosmos is mathematically adjusted by God and His angels so that it runs like aclock. Esaias had prophesied the coming of Jesus in Galilee, and as soon asJesus reached there, He felt the Divine Vibrations of the Cosmic Cycle and Heput His heart and Soul into giving God to all. At this auspicious time, Jesuswas filled with the Holy Ghost, or Cosmic Holy Vibration, and was baptized bythe Spirit, and from then on He began to declare the Truth of God’s Kingdom asHe perceived it.Many people look for the vast Kingdom of God as a point of space in the clouds,far away from the noxious, sinful vapors of the earth, but they forget that thevast eternal land of God’s omniscience is near at hand. Whenever you close youreyes, you shut out the land of finitude and matter, and the land of Eternity isfound to lie tier upon tier in endless vistas before the inner vision of man.If man repents of his folly of constantly gazing at the finite Cosmos, andcloses his eyes and constantly meditates, he perceives the land of Infinitywithin him. Repentance signifies seeing the folly of life in keeping theattention turned upon matter. The wise man repents because he knows the miseriesresulting from the contact of matter. Then he makes up his mind and firstbelieves in the Kingdom within, and then, by constant meditation, he perceivesthe Kingdom of Eternity lying close at hand within him.First, one must believe in God’s message as sent through His Saints, and repentof the folly of matter-attachment, then he must meditate ceaselessly and he willbe sure to find the Kingdom of God within, which Kingdom he was looking for inthe clouds.“Repent; for (the time is fulfilled, and) the kingdom of heaven (God) is athand. (Repent ye, and believe the Gospel)”(Matthew 4:17)“The time is fulfilled” signifies the Divine Plan of sending Jesus on earth at adefinite time. Just as motion picture directors plan the time for filming apicture, so also, God and his Angels plan the time for the projection andmaterialization of certain great events in the Cosmos.When the darkness of ignorance, like an inky mist, encircles the minds ofmundane people at certain times, then God sends great saints to redeem thesin-submerged Souls. Jesus knew He was empowered by Heaven to give Spirituallight to all men, so He said that the Kingdom of God, which lies very near, justbehind the darkness of closed eyes, could easily be found through His help. Thewords “at hand” signify the nearness of Heaven within the consciousness of man,as well as the ease with which people could find God through the meditation ofJesus. “Repent ye” signifies the withdrawal of the principal attention frommatter to God. Every Soul, upon Spiritual awakening, should repent of its follyof expecting permanent happiness from fleeting sense-pleasures. The poor tastefor sorrow-producing evil should be displaced by the superior inclinations forjoy-producing good.Unless one is sorry about his evil ways, he cannot find pleasure in pursuing thepath of purity. Repentance does not mean crying over spilled milk constantly,but it means to so impregnate the mind with consciousness of the after-effectsof evil that one will automatically shrink from even thought of evil deeds, notto speak of evil deeds themselves. Unless the mind learns to abhor evil actions,it is very difficult to keep it proof against the subtle allurements oftemptation. One must repent, not only of following unprofitable ways of living,but one must desist from all evil actions after every repentance.To steal during the week and repent on Sundays would not provide remission fromthe evils of theft. If one finds that he has been a thief for a week, he mustrepent of his wicked deeds on the eighth day and, after his repentance, he mustforever relinquish the habit of stealing. Repentance is not a cure for theresults of evil actions. It serves only to keep the mind consciously acquaintedwith the results of evil deeds, with the hope of keeping it from repeating evilexperiences. Many people, who think repentance is a cure for evil habits, keeprepenting after each evil deed, expecting thereby to receive Divine amnesty fromsin. Jesus exhorted the people, saying that the time to receive Divine Glory waswithin their easy reach, and that they should first repent of their evil waysand not blindly enjoy them as before.After repentance, it is necessary to believe in the Gospel, or “God’s spell,” orGod’s pronouncement of Truth, through the meditative intuition of the devotee.Belief is that conditional receptive attitude of mind preceding an experiencenecessary to cognize it. If one refuses to believe in a thing long enough toexperiment with it, he cannot possibly know about it. If a man is thirsty and isadvised to quench his thirst with the water from a nearby good well, he mustbelieve in the water in that well, and must make the effort to go to it beforehe can satisfy the demands of his thirst. But if a thirsty man questions thepurity of the water in the good well the minute he hears about it, there is noway of showing him the good quality of the water in that well.Therefore, Jesus emphasizes the fact that each truth-seeking Soul must repent ofthe foolishness of following unsatisfying material ways of living, and must actat a suitable time to believe, not in imaginary things, but in the Truthsexperienced by Him through God.To be an Orthodox, unquestioning believer in any Spiritual doctrine, without thescrutiny of experimentation, makes one ossified with dogmatism. Belief shouldnot be wasted on false doctrines, but should be exercised only on the Truthpoured out to man through the authority of Saints.Jesus did not ask the people to believe anything, or any false doctrines, asfalse prophets do, but He asked His people to keep faith only in DivineRevelations, with the assurance that if the people kept on unceasingly believingin, and hence concentrating upon, the Gospel, they would surely and ultimatelycome to experience the truths revealed in it."}]
