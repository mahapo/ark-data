That volume contained also deeply insightful commentarieson one of the great scriptures of the world, containing, as the \"Gita\" does, theessence of the Upanishads, which in their turn offer the essence of the timelessVedas, the scriptural lore of ancient India.Included in this edition are a few verses that were omitted from that largerbook. They include most of the first chapter (which that book only summarized),and the first ten verses (slokas) of Chapter Two.I found it expedient to the flow, when writing the larger volume, to omit theseslokas. As the reader studies them in this compendium of the entire Gita, I hopehe will understand why I only summarized this material at first. These omittedverses form, in themselves, an almost complete dissertation.I should add that it was owing to these first verses, particularly, that Iconceived from the beginning an intense enthusiasm for my Guru's furthercommentary.I urge any reader who feels benefited by these pages to take the trouble(assuming he has not done so already) to read the much larger volume, mentionedabove. As my Guru, after finishing his mammoth work, stated to me with deepbliss: \"Millions will find God through this book!\""},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE[img0010.jpg]INTRODUCTION[img0011.jpg]the Mahabharata, and the Bhagavad Gita of which it is a part, isnot literal history. Rather it is a deep spiritual allegory, woven upon aframework of history. The main characters in the story did actually live, butthey became essential reference points around which the story was developed.Most of the characters are inventions. They trace their names to Sanskrit roots,which supply their psychological meanings.Arjuna was, in fact, a very high soul; Krishna, later in the Bhagavad Gita,calls him \"Prince of Devotees.\" Yet in this short, but very profound, scripture,and especially so in this first chapter, he plays the role of mere spiritualbeginner starting out on his spiritual search. The device can prove confusingfor readers, sometimes, especially for those who are already fully aware ofArjuna's greatness.The characters listed in this first chapter are not, as must at first seem, amere catalogue of warriors arrayed against one another in preparation for thecoming war. Instead, they symbolize psychological traits and states ofconsciousness, each of which plays an important role in the devotee's struggleto rise above worldly delusion and to reclaim his true state of Sonship to theInfinite Lord.Because some of these states of consciousness appear only as the devoteedevelops further, and even highly, on the spiritual path, it can seem confusingfor them to be listed also in this first chapter. Yet the teaching here would beincomplete if they were omitted. I have therefore shown them as only latentlypresent, rather, in the devotee's consciousness. Samadhi, for example, is notsomething the beginner experiences; it appears, usually, after many years on thepath, and therefore long after the initial doubts and discouragement of thebeginner which Arjuna expresses in this chapter. Those higher states receivecareful treatment in later chapters of this great scripture.[img0012.jpg]THE VERSES:1. (King) Dhritarashtra [the blind, or undiscerning mind] posed this question toSanjaya [introspection]:On the battlefield of Kurukshetra [and of dharmic confrontation, Dhar-makshetra], my sons [the Kurus (Kauravas), or adharmic (unspiritual) tendenciesand qualities] and those of Pandu [the Pandavas, or spiritually elevatingaspects of human nature] stood ranged against one another, eager for battle.What was the outcome (of their struggle)?2. Sanjaya replied:(Prince) Duryodhana [material desires], on beholding the Pandava army (opposinghim) in full battle array, (anxiously) approached Dronach- arya [habits, pastsamskaras or mental tendencies-Duryodhana's \"guru,\" since material desires aredirected by past habits'], [index_split_024.html#page0176] and spoke as follows:3. Behold, 0 Teacher, this great army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed for battleby your own gifted student [Dhristadyumna, or awakened in tuition; the calminner light, which appears also owing to the \"guidance\" of past spiritualtendencies], the son of Drupada [dispassion toward sense enjoyments].4. Ah! See those mighty heroes, bowmen as great as Bhima [the power to upliftthe body's energy] and Arjuna [fiery self-control], Virata [ecstatic identity ofthe egoic self with the indwelling soul], and Drupada [dispassion toward senseenjoyments], mighty charioteers [controllers of the senses], all.5. Behold, too, Dhrishtaketu [the inner power of resistance to temptation (theyamas of Patanjali*)] [index_split_024.html#page0177] Chekitana [buriedspiritual memories], Kashiraja [northward, or upward, flowing discrimination],and also Purujit [inclination toward internalizing the mind (pratyahara)],Kuntibhoja [steady, upright bodily posture (asana)], Shaibya [inner power ofadherence to virtue (the niyamas)], (all these) foremost among men.6. Lo, too, mighty Udhamanyu [control over the inner life force (pranayama)],brave Uttamaujas [ojas, spiritual luster and power, developed through sexualself-control], the son of Subhadra [Abhi- manyu, self-transcendence], and thesons of Draupadit-all [index_split_024.html#page0178] these also maharathis(formidable charioteers) [masters of the senses].7. Hear also, in balance, 0 Flower of the twice-born, those leaders in my ownarmy who are outstanding.8. These number thyself (Drona); Bhishma` [index_split_024.html#page0180] [theconsciousness of being a separate, ego-identity]; Karnat[index_split_024.html#page0180] [outward attachment]; and Kripa [not (in thiscase) mercy or divine grace, as it is usually understood, but personal asopposed to cosmic delusion]; Ashwatthama` [index_split_024.html#page0181][attrac tion (likes)]; Vikarna [repulsion (dislikes)]; the son of Somadatta[Bhurishravas, the impulse toward outward, material activity]; and Jayadratha[bondage to continued separate existence; not included in every version of theGita, but subtly distinct from outward attachment, or Karna].9. And numerous others-heroes well trained forbattle, and armed with manyweapons, (all of them) ready to lay dowtheir lives for my sake [in defense ofegoic material desires]. [index_split_024.html#page0186]10. Our forces, guarded by Bhishma, are numberless [for the pathways intodelusion are multifarious], but their army, defended by Bhima [the power touplift the body's energy], is numerically constricted [because focused andpowerful].11. All of you, therefore, placed in your proper stations, do (everything youcan to) protect Bhishma t [index_split_024.html#page0187]12. Grandsire Bhishma then, glorious and powerful among the Kurus, anxious toencourage [wavering] Duryodhana, blew his conch with a mighty blast![index_split_024.html#page0188]13. There followed at once a great tumult, as conches, kettledrums, tabors(small drums), and horns sounded in a mighty uproar (of support).14. And then (it was that) Madhava (Krishna) and Pandava (Arjuna), stationed intheir magnificent chariot drawn by white horses [five in number, representingthe five senses], blew mightily on their celestial conches.*[index_split_024.html#page0190]15. Hrishikesha (Krishna) blew his Panchajanya [AUM and the united sound of allthe chakras]; Dhananjaya (Arjuna) sounded his Devadatta [literally \"gift of thegods\" or, \"that which gives joy\": the sound of a plucked string instrument inthe manipura chakra]; and Vrikodara (Bhima) of mighty deeds [associated withpowerful vayu; air, one of the five primary\"elements\"] (blew) his great conchPaundra [producing the sound of a deep gong].16. Then Prince Yudhisthira [divine calmness] the son of Kunti [spiritual force;intense longing for God] blew his Anantavijaya [complete control over the innerprana]; Nakula [the sacral, or swadisthana] and Sahadeva [the coccyx, ormuladhara] blew, respectively, their Saghosha [a flute sound, like that whichKrishna as a boy played in Gokula] and Manipushpaka [a deep buzzing sound].17. Then, the king of Kashi [\"northward,\" or upward-flowing discrimination],excellent archer; Sikhandi [the will and the understanding to perform only good,self-elevating actions, and, for this reason:] a mighty charioteer [controllerof the five senses]; Drishtadyumna [the calm inner light, or the intuitive senseof its hidden presence]; Virata [literally, \"majestic\"; a sense of oneness withSpirit'], [index_split_024.html#page0191] and invincible Satyaki [truthfulness];18. Drupada [extreme dispassion]; the sons of Draupadi [see above] and themighty-armed son of Subhadra [self-mastery]: all these, 0 Lord of the Earth,blew (loudly on) their conches.19. That mighty tumult, reverberating through heaven and earth [penetrating thedevotee's astral and physical bodies] pierced the hearts of Dhritarashtra's sons[shaking, thereby, the devotee's faith in the attractiveness of materialenjoyment].20. Beholding the clan of Dhritarashtra (the Kauravas) arrayed (before him) forbattle, Pandava (Arjuna), whose flag bore the monkey emblem [this symbol ofrestlessness, when raised by straightening the spine, indicates control over theever-active mind'], [index_split_024.html#page0192] took up his bow [symbol ofcorrect meditative posture: the body erect, the bowstring indicative of astraight spine], and addressed Hrishikesha (Krishna):21-23. Arjuna said, 0 Changeless Krishna, I (respectfully) ask Thee to guide mychariot between the two armies, that I may see them opposed in full battlearray, (there to) observe the (warriors) with whom I am to contend. Let me study(those warriors) who willingly support Dhritarashtra's son (Duryodhana).24-25. Sanjaya then told Dhritarashtra:O Descendent of Bharata! On hearing these words of Gudakesha (Arjuna),Hrishikesha (Krishna) drove that best of chariots to a point between the twoarmies. There, before Bhishma, Drona, and that great horde of opposing chiefs,he declared: \"Behold, Partha (Arjuna), this mighty gathering of the Kurus!\"26. Partha (Arjuna) then beheld before him [his own relatives:] grandfathers,fathers, fathers-in-law, maternal uncles, brothers and cousins, sons andgrandsons, and comrades, past friends, teachers;27. Observing that far-flung array of his own kith and kin before him, the sonof Kunti (Arjuna) was filled with pity, and spoke sorrowfully:28-30. 0 Krishna, seeing these, my own relatives, gathered together ready tofight us, my strength fails me; my limbs quiver; my mouth becomes parched; mywhole body trembles; my hair stands on end [all these being signs of innerconflict]! The sacred bow Gandhiva slips from my grasp [as, with bent spine, heslumps forward in discouragement], and my skin is on fire [a hint of reawakened,latent desires]. I cannot remain upright, and my mind loses all focus.31. 0 Keshava (Krishna), I behold (in this upcoming war) only omens of evil!Indeed, no good results can come from slaying these, my own family members.32. 0 Krishna! I crave no victory (against these, my kinsmen), nor kingdom, northe rewards (of victory), nor even life itself. Of what use (indeed, to us)would be these (hollow gains)?33-34. Those ranged before us are our own [past] teachers [inclinations toward,and hopes for attaining, false, worldly desires and ambitions], fathers[begetters of past sense inclinations], sons [sense pleasures themselves],grandfathers [sense tendencies from past incarnations], uncles, fathers-in-law,grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other kinsmen [more distant influences: global,national, social, environmental, and familial].35. 0 Madhusudhana (Krishna)! How can I consent to kill these (relatives), evenif their own desire is to kill me? I would rather relinquish sovreignty(self-mastery) itself over the three worlds [the causal, astral, and physicaluniverses]-what to speak, then, of conquest over this little earthly kingdom [myphysical body]?36. What happiness could we find, 0 Janardana (Krishna)! in destroyingDhritarashtra's clan? Sinful though they be, would not we, too, incur sin (byslaying them)?37. There can be no justification, surely, in killing our own cousins,Dhritarashtra's sons!38-39. Even if they, blinded by greed for possession, see nothing wrong inkilling us (their own relatives), and in betraying their own friends, ought notwe, who (knowing right from wrong) see the evil involved in annihilating a wholedynasty-ought not we, for our part, to avoid this great crime?40. With the disintegration of a family, its ancient traditions are lost. Whensuch a great disaster occurs, the whole family is deprived of any purposefuldirection, and cannot but succumb to sin.' [index_split_024.html#page0195]41. 0 Krishna! With the loss of religion [individual and family traditions], thewomen of the family become corrupt [the devotee's feeling quality may lose itscoherence, and descend to a chaos of confusion].'[index_split_024.html#page0196] From there, intermixture of the varnas (castes)cannot but be the outcome.t [index_split_024.html#page0197]42. This admixture [confusion as to one's proper direction in life] plunges downto hell both the family's destroyers [those deeds and qualities which undermine,or disrupt, a person's carefully developed \"family\" of consciousness] and thefamily itself. The family's ancestors [the individual's inheritance, from formerlives, of subconscious tendencies] will be forsaken`[index_split_024.html#page0201] owing to the withholding of traditionalofferings of rice-balls and water [symbolic of the concern and energy with whichpeople feed their latent tendencies].43. By such wrong doings, those who disrupt the family [by removing a person'scarefully gathered self-definitions], and create an admixture of the castes [byconfusing one's established, and heretofore normal-seeming, self-identity], theage-old sense of personal reality will be destroyed.44. 0 Janardana (Krishna)! Often have we heard that men who lack all sense offamily religious rites [one's traditional sense of individual function andpurpose] are forced to reside indefinitely in hell.*[index_split_024.html#page0202]45. Alas! actuated by (mere) avarice to possess a kingdom, we (are gatheredhere) ready to kill our own kinsmen [those tendencies in ourselves which, thoughharmful to our very peace of mind and inner happiness, are, for all that,members of our own \"family\" of consciousness]. This act, surely, will involve usin great sin.46. I would therefore prefer that Dhritarashtra's sons, their [sense] weapons inhand, destroy me! Only (by such passivity), so it seems to me, can I (hope for)happiness.* [index_split_024.html#page0203]47. Thus declared Sanjaya [introspection, to Dhritarasthra, (the blind orpassively receiving) mind]:Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, his mind inupheaval owing to his grief and mental turmoil, set down his bow [abandoned hisfirm meditative posture] and slumped back onto his chariot seat.[img0013.jpg]Thus ends the first chapter, called \"The Despondency ofArjuna on the Path ofYoga, \"of the Upanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between SriKrishna and Arjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO[img0014.jpg]1. Sanjaya continued his address to Dhritarashtra:Madhusudana (Krishna) then addressed him (Arjuna), overwhelmed as he was with(self-)pity and entirely disheartened, his eyes dim with tears.*[index_split_024.html#page0204]2. The Lord said:Whence, 0 Arjuna, your despondency in this hour of decision? Such behavior isunseemly in (such) a noble soul. It will not lead to heaven, and here on earth,moreover, it will bring you disgrace.3. Yield not, 0 Partha (Arjuna), to unmanliness! It ill befits you. Cast offthis weakness of heart, 0 Scorcher of Foes! Arise!4. Arjuna replied:O Slayer of Madhu and Destroyer of Foes (Krishna)! How can I make war, shootingarrows [of concentration] against Bhishma [my own deep-seated ego-reality] andagainst Drona [my own \"preceptor\" of past tendencies, which have always definedme as I was (and perhaps am)]? Those great warriors deserve (only my) respectand reverence!* [index_split_024.html#page0205]5. I would find even a life of begging preferable to slaying (these, my ancientand self-defining realities), preceptors of all that I have ever been and known.Even if they are wrong, they have nevertheless been my teachers. What happinesscould I find if, in seeking it, I (stooped so low as) to shed their blood?6. Which is better: that they conquer us? or we, them? How can we (even) wish tolive after slaying (these, our cousins) the sons of Dhritarashtra, even though,ranged before us, they (threaten us with war)?7. My very being is stricken with the weakness of uncertainty. Please help me toknow for certain what I must do. What is my right path? I am Thy disciple: Itake refuge in Thee.8. (For) I see no way out of my dilemma. This affliction pounds my senses; itwould persist (I am certain) even were I to attain untold riches and dominion.It would endure (surely) even were I to be placed in kingship over the gods (andhence given a seat of glory in heaven).9. Sanjaya then said to Dhritarashtra:Having thus addressed Hrishikesha (Krishna), Gudakesha-Paran- tapa (Arjuna)declared further to Govinda (Krishna), \"I will not fight!\" Thereupon, he fellsilent.10. 0 Bharata (Dhritarashtra), to him who, placed between the two armies, sat inlamentation, the Lord of the senses (Krishna), as if smiling,*[index_split_024.html#page0206] spoke the following words:11. The Blessed Lord said:With words of love (and seeming wisdom) you have been grieving over those whodeserve no lamentation. The wise mourn neither for those who live on earth norfor those who leave it.12. Nor are we here in this world for the first time. I, you, these royal oneswhose (possible) death you lament: None of these has not lived here before, norshall any of them ever cease to be.13. As the ego keeps the thread of self-awareness unbroken through infancy,childhood, youth, and old age, so also the embodied soul (which gaveconsciousness to the ego) maintains its awareness uninterruptedly, not onlythrough the stages of earth life, but through the appearance of successivebodies.14. 0 Son of Kunti, sensations such as heat and cold, pleasure and pain aregenerated through the senses in (their) contact with the world. They are ideasonly: transitory, each with its beginning and end. 0 Descendent of Bharata, bearwith them patiently (the way of wisdom is to be non-identified with anythingoutside the Self)15. 0 Flower among Men, one who is calm and even-minded, never ruffled duringpain and pleasure: he alone gains consciousness of his eternal existence.16. That which is unreal does not exist. That which is real cannot cease toexist. Those who possess wisdom know the final nature of reality: of what is,and what is not.17. He alone, the Unchangeable Spirit, pervades all, and is imperishable.Nothing can destroy His eternal reality.18. That indwelling Self is ever changeless, imperishable, and withoutlimitation. Only these fleshly garments can be destroyed. Therefore, 0 Offspringof Bharata, accept your duty (in this body), and fight!19. One who considers his true and eternal Self to be the slayer (of anything),and who believes that he himself, in essence, can be slain, does not know thetruth. The true Self can neither slay nor be slain.20. This Self is not born, nor does it perish. Self-existent, it continues itsexistence forever. It is birthless, eternal, changeless, and ever the same. TheSelf is not slain when the body dies.21. How can one who knows the true Self to be imperishable, everlasting, unborn,and unchanging imagine that this Self can cause destruction to another Self? 0Partha (Arjuna), who is slaying whom?22. Just as a person removes a worn-out garment and dons a new one, so the soulliving in a physical body (removes and) discards it when it becomes outworn, andreplaces it with a new one.23. Weapons cannot cut the soul; fire cannot burn it; water cannot drown it;wind cannot wither it away!24. The soul is never touched; it is immutable, all-pervading, calm, unshakable;its existence is eternal.25. The soul cannot even be pondered by the reasoning mind. It (the Self) isunmanifested and formless. Realize this truth, and abstain from lamentation.26-27. Even, however, if you prefer to think of the Self as perishable, whygrieve? What is born must die. Whatever dies must be born again. Why lament thatwhich cannot be avoided?28. (The periods) before birth and after death are veiled from your gaze. Youare conscious only of that which is visible to your senses. Why lament a thingyou can't see?29. Some (people) behold the soul in amazement. Others describe (the experienceof it) as marvelous. Still others, hearing it, listen, and proclaim itwonderful. The rest, even if they hear all about it, comprehend it not at all.30. 0 Bharata (Arjuna), there is one Self dwelling in all. That Self isinviolable. Grieve not, therefore, for anything (that occurs) outwardly in themanifested world.31-32. Even when viewed personally, from a standpoint of one's dharmic duty,there is no occasion for (either) grief or hesitation. Nothing is morepropitious than for a Kshatriya, whose duty it is to fight for righteousness, tobattle for what is right and true. Blessed and fortunate are you, if you mustgive even your life for such a cause. Such a death will open to you the gates ofheaven.33-34. But if you refuse this opportunity for righteous combat, in rejection ofyour duty, you will incur sin. Other people (far from honoring you) will heapyour name with ignominy. To a man of self-respect, dishonor is, verily, worsethan death.35-36. Other warriors will assume that you have avoided fighting out of fear.Those who have thought highly of you heretofore will come to regard youslightingly. Your foes will speak your name with contempt, and will ridiculeyour prowess. Could anything (for a warrior) be more painful?37-38. If you are killed in battle, you will attain heaven. If you win this war,you will obtain earthly glory. Arise therefore, 0 Son of Kunti (Arjuna).Determine to fight! Be even-minded in the face of pleasure or pain, gain orloss, victory or defeat. In this way, you will incur no sin.39. I have thus explained to you the ultimate wisdom of Shankhya. Now hear thewisdom of Yoga, equipped with which, 0 Partha, you will break the shackles ofkarma.40. In this path (of yoga action) there is no danger of \"unfinished business,\"nor are there latent within it the opposite, canceling effects of duality. Evena little practice of this religion will free one from dire fears and colossalsufferings (which are inherent in the unceasing cycles of death and rebirth).41. In this yoga there is only that one direction (with no polar opposite). Thereasonings of the undecided mind, caught up as it is in duality, are endlesslyvariegated and ramified.42. 0 Partha (Arjuna), fixity in the state of samadhi cannot be theirs who clingto personal power and sense-pleasures. Those whose discrimination is blunted bythe specious promises of teachers who, ignorant themselves, promise heaven asman's highest reward, imagine that nothing higher exists.43. Vedic rituals (and other outward practices) lead not to oneness with God,nor do promises (or the hope) of superior pleasures in the astral world. Allthese lead, rather, to repeated earthly rebirths.44. Those who, incapable of discriminating between right and wrong, seekpersonal power and superior sense-pleasures (whether on earth or in the astralworld after death) by the practice of Vedic rituals, deepen theirego-attachment. They cannot achieve the inner equilibrium that comes throughmeditation, and miss also the (one) true goal of life: union with God.45. The Vedas teach that the universe is a mixture of three basic qualities, orgunas. Your duty, Arjuna, is to free yourself from all three, as well as fromthe dualities of Nature. The way to this achievement is to remain ever calm inthe Self, free from any thought of either acceptance or possession.46. To the knower of Brahman (the Supreme Spirit) the Vedas are of no more usethan a well when the land all around is in flood.47. Action (in this realm of vibration) is a duty, but let not your ego cravethe fruits of action. Be not attached to either action or inaction.48. 0 Dhananjaya (Arjuna), immerse yourself in the thought of yoga (union withGod), inwardly non-attached and even-minded in both success and failure. Perfectevenness of mind and feeling is itself the definition of yoga.49. Action performed with desire for the fruits is greatly inferior to actionguided by wisdom. Therefore, 0 Dhananjaya, seek in everything to be guided bywisdom. Misery attends actions performed for their fruits.50. One who lives united to cosmic wisdom passes beyond the effects of bothvirtue and vice even while living in this body. Therefore devote yourself,through wisdom, to achieving the oneness of yoga. Such alone is right action.51. Those who have mastered their thoughts escape the confines of the mind andbecome engrossed in cosmic wisdom. They (realizing the illusory nature of ego)become freed from the chains of rebirth, and attain that state which transcendsall suffering.52. When your perception pierces the dark mists of delusion, you will becomeindifferent to everything you have heard about this world and the next.53. When your discrimination is no longer tossed about by opinions, but abidesunshaken in soul-bliss, then you will attain final union with God.54. Arjuna said: \"0 Keshava (Krishna), what are the signs of one who hasattained calm wisdom and is established in union with God? How does he speak,sit, walk?\"55. 0 Partha (Arjuna), one who has put away all desires, being wholly contentedin the Self, may be considered settled in wisdom.56. He whose consciousness is unshaken by affliction and is not excited by goodfortune; who no longer hungers for earthly affection and is without fear andanger: such a man qualifies to be considered a muni of steady discrimination.57. He who, under all circumstances, is without attachment, and is neitherelated by goodness nor depressed by evil, is a man of established wisdom.58. When the yogi, like a tortoise withdrawing its head and limbs into itsshell, is able to withdraw his energy from the objects of senseperception, hebecomes established in wisdom.59. The man who (merely) abstains from sense enjoyments may forget them for atime, but the taste for them will linger. That person, however, who beholds theSupreme Spirit loses the taste for anything but the Infinite.60. 0 Son of Kunti (the power of dispassion), Arjuna, even the wise man, devotedto self-control, may sometimes be swept away by theturbulent senses.61. He who, having subjugated his senses, becomes united with Me remainsengrossed in the infinite Self, knowing it as the Supremely Relishable. Onlymastery of the senses can bestow the steadfastness of true wisdom.62-63. Dwelling mentally on sense objects breeds attachment to them. Fromattachment arises craving. From craving (when frustrated) springs anger. Angerproduces delusion. Delusion causes forgetfulness (of the Self). Loss of memory(as to what one is, in truth) causes decay of the power of discrimination. Fromloss of discrimination ensues the annihilation of all right understanding.64. The man of perfect self-control is able to act in this world unaffected byit. Inwardly free from attraction and repulsion, he has attained unshakableinner calmness.65. With the attainment of soul bliss, every vestige of sorrow disappears. Blissgives perfect discrimination, and soon establishes one's consciousness firmly(in the Self).66. Those with unsettled consciousness have no discrimination. Those who areunmeditative cannot know peace. And for those who lack peace, how is happinesspossible?67. As a boat moving on water may be swept off its course by a gale, sodiscrimination may be swept from its path by the vagaries of sensory influence.68. Therefore, 0 Mighty-armed (Arjuna), withdraw your sense-faculties (the powerto see, hear, etc.) from the senses themselves, and from sense-objects. Thuswill your wisdom become firmly established.69. That which is night for the unenlightened is day for the yogi. And thatwhich is day for ordinary people is night for the yogi-seer (who perceives theinner reality).70. Contentment is his who, like the ocean, calmly absorbs into himself all therivers of desire. One (on the contrary) whose desires trickle outward (as iffrom a pond) is soon drained (of energy).71. That person knows peace who, relinquishing all (energy-draining) desires,and fully satisfied with his state of desirelessness, no longer sees himself asa separate, individual ego.72. 0 Partha (Arjuna), this state is known as Brahmisthiti: absolute onenesswith the Infinite. Anyone who achieves this state will never again fall intodelusion. Even at the moment of death, if one concentrates whole-heartedly onthis state, he attains perfect, eternal Bliss.[img0015.jpg]Thus ends the second chapter, called \"Shankhya Yoga, \" of the Upanishad of theholy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna discussingyoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE[img0016.jpg]1. Arjuna said: \"0 Janardana (Krishna, the Divine Liberator), if (as it seems)You consider understanding superior to action, why, 0 Keshava, have You beenurging me to this terrible action?2. \"This apparent contradiction confuses me. Please tell me clearly: Which pathwill help me toward the highest good?\"3. The Cosmic Lord said, \"O Sinless One, at the beginning of creation, Iestablished two means by which man could achieve salvation. The first was bywisdom; the other was by right action.\"4. Actionlessness cannot be attained by mere inaction. One who forsakes work (inthe name of divine aloofness from activity) cannot reach perfection.5. No one can remain actionless for even a moment; all are compelled (byNature), whether willingly or unwillingly, to be active, driven by the gunas(the three qualities) of Nature.6. The person who restrains his organs of action, but in whose mind rotate thethoughts of sense objects, is (rightly) regarded as a hypocrite, and isself-deluded.7. That man, however, succeeds supremely, 0 Arjuna, who disciplines his sensesby an effort of mind, who remains inwardly non-attached, and who engages hisorgans of activity in God-reminding activities.8. Perform those actions which your duty dictates, for action is better thaninaction. Without action, indeed, even the act of maintaining life in the bodywould not be possible.9. Actions performed for selfish gain are karmically binding. Therefore, 0 Sonof Kunti (that is to say, of dispassion), perform your duty without attachmentin a spirit of religious self-offering.10. Prajapati (God in the aspect of Creator) brought mankind into manifestation,and in so doing gave man the potential for selfoffering into a higher (thanhuman) awareness (through yagya). Along with this gift He enjoined mankind,\"Whatever you desire, seek it by offering energy back to the source of allenergy. Let this sacrifice (yagya) be your milch cow of fulfillment.\"11. (Prajapati continued:) \"With this offering, commune with the devas (shiningangels), that they may commune also with you. Through such mutual communion youwill arrive at the highest good.\"12. (Prajapati concluded:) \"By communion with the devas you will receive fromthem the (earthly) fulfillments you desire. He who enjoys the gifts of the godswithout returning due offering (of energy) to them is, verily, a thief.\"13. Spiritually minded people, offering up the food they eat to its source indivine energy (the devas), incur no sin. Those, however, who make no suchoffering (eating only for taste and pleasure) are verily feeding on sin.14. Creatures require nourishment from food; food must be nourished by rain;rain is sustained, in turn, by fire (heat from the sun, which causes bodies ofwater to evaporate), and heat is produced by the vibration of AUM.15. Know this divine vibratory activity to have been produced by Brahma, thecosmic creative force. Yagya, or sacrificial self-offering, brings the greatcycle of cosmic manifestation back (at last) to itself.16. Whoever resists this great rotating cycle, living in sin and preferring the(ego-centered) enjoyment of the senses, lives in vain.17. For him whose only love is the Supreme Self, who delights in the Self andrests contentedly in the Self, no duty remains.18. Such a person has nothing to gain by performing action in this world, noranything to lose by not performing it. He is dependent on no one and nothing(outside the Self).19. Therefore, strive conscientiously during the performance of all actions,whether physical or spiritual, to act without attachment. By activity withoutself-interest, one attains the Supreme.20. By the path of right action alone, (Raja) Janaka and others like him (karmayogis) attained perfection. To offer guidance to others, you, too, should beactive.21. Whatever the superior being does, lesser beings imitate. His behavior setsthe standard for right living in the world.22. 0 Son of Pritha (Arjuna), no further duty compels Me. There is no state leftfor Me to attain, and nothing in the three worlds (material, astral, or causal)for Me to gain, yet still I work on for the upliftment of others. There, whereall uplifting work is done, am I.23. 0 Partha (Arjuna), if I were to cease acting in creation for even a moment,man, too, would imitate My inactivity.24. If I were to cease being active in cosmic creation, the universe itselfwould cease to exist. Confusion would result, and mankind would be brought toruin.25. 0 Descendent of Bharata (Arjuna), as foolish people, out of attachment toego, act in hope of rewards, so should the wise also (even if wisdom has liftedthem out of any personal need to be active), act with dispassion andnon-attachment, glad to be of service to others as their guides (on the path toenlightenment).26. Never should the wise condemn the ignorant for the ego-motivation theymanifest. Instead, being themselves enlightened, they should seek only toinspire others in the direction of preferring to perform right, dutiful action.27. The universal impulse toward activity springs from the three gunas, orqualities of Nature. Man, however, deluded by egoism, thinks, \"I am the doer.\"28. 0 Arjuna, he who understands how the gunas work in human nature, and whoknows therefore that (even) what the senses perceive depends on their indwellingpower of perception, withdraws his mind and removes his attachment to things atthe very source of his perception.29. The man of perfect wisdom should not bewilder the ignorant with his higherperception of the nature of reality. (He should bear in mind that,) deluded asthey are by the gunas, they have no choice but to act under that influence.30. Offer to Me your every deed. Devoid of egotism and desire, inwardly centeredin the soul, (ever) calm and free from worries, be dutifully engaged in thebattle of life.31. True devotees, focused on practicing My precepts and (the true teachings of)others, achieve freedom from all karma.32. Those, however, who scoff at this teaching of Mine and refuse to practiceit, deluded (by ego) as to the nature of wisdom, know such persons, in theirrejection (due to ignorance), to be courting doom.33. Even the wise act according to the dictates of their own nature. All livingbeings obey the dictates of Nature. Of what avail would be mere suppression?34. Attraction and repulsion (regarding) sense objects belong to the natural ebband flow of duality. Beware equally of them both, for they are man's greatestenemies!35. To do one's own duty even unsuccessfully is better than to do someone else'sduty successfully. It is better to die while trying to accomplish one's own dutythan to settle for another's duty (though safer and easier). That course isfilled with danger and uncertainty.36. Arjuna said: 0 (Krishna), by what is one impelled, even against his will, todo wrong, as if (he were being) forced to do so?37. Krishna replied: It is desire; it is anger, both of which are impelled byrajoguna. Know these to be mankind's greatest enemies.38. As fire is obscured by smoke; as a mirror is covered by dust; as an embryois enveloped by the womb, so is human understanding obscured by the threequalities.39. 0 Son of Kunti (Arjuna) ! The unquenchable flames of inner desire are theconstant enemy even of the wise.40. The senses, mind, and intellect are declared to be their stronghold. Desire,through these (three), deludes the embodied soul and eclipses its wisdom.41. Therefore, 0 Best of the Bharata Dynasty! begin by disciplining the senses(withdrawing your energy from them into the spine), then destroy desire (bycasting it from your heart). Desire is the sinful destroyer of wisdom and ofSelf-realization.42. The senses are declared to be superior to the body (since they conveyperception); the mind is superior to the senses (both inner and outer, since itis the perceiver); the discriminating intellect is superior to the mind (sinceit understands what it perceives); and the Self is superior to thediscriminating intellect (since it is both perception and understanding).43. 0 Mighty-armed (Arjuna)! thus cognizing the (indwelling divine) Self assuperior to intellectual understanding, discipline your lower self (the ego) bydwelling in the true Self, and (thereby) overcome the foe who, wearing the armorof desire, is ever difficult to conquer.[img0017.jpg]Thus ends the third chapter, called \"Karma Yoga,\" of the Upanishad of the holyBhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna discussing yogaand the science of Self-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR[img0018.jpg]1-2. The exalted Lord said to Arjuna: I gave this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvat(the sun-god); Vivasvat passed on the knowledge to Manu (the Hindu law-giver);Manu taught it to Ikshvaku (founder of the solar dynasty of the Kshatriyas).Thus, handed down in orderly succession, the Rajarishis (royal rishis, or sages)knew it. With the long passage of time, however, 0 Scorcher of Foes (Arjuna),this knowledge of Yoga has become greatly diminished on Earth.3. Today I have taught you, My devotee and friend, that ancient science of Yoga,the secret to the highest blessings for mankind.4. Arjuna said: Vivasvat lived in far-off antiquity, whereas You are of recentbirth. How am I to take this statement that it was You who first taught thissacred Yoga to mankind?5. The Blessed Lord said, Many have been My births, and many also yours. Iremember all of Mine, though you remember yours not.6. Though I (a fully liberated soul) am the Lord of all creation, and am in Mytrue Self-and abiding (ever) in My Cosmic Nature-forever unborn, yet I, by Myyoga-maya, assume (from time to time) an outward form.7-8. 0 Bharata (Arjuna)! whenever virtue (dharma) declines, and vice (adharma)is in the ascendant, I incarnate Myself on earth (as an avatar). Appearing fromage to age in visible form, I come to destroy evil and to re-establish virtue.9. One, 0 Arjuna! who by intuition comprehends the truth of My divinemanifestations and selfless deeds in this vibratory universe, will never again,after he leaves his body (at death), need to incarnate in outward (egoic) form.(Soaring in freedom,) He will attain Me.10. Purified by ascetic wisdom, released from attachment, fear, and anger, andcompletely absorbed in Me, many have attained (oneness with) Me.11. 0 Partha (Arjuna)! In whatever way I am approached, in that way do Irespond. All men come, by whatever path, to Me.12. Those who work to fulfill their earthly desires worship the gods (which areideals in various forms; they are not idols!), aware that success of this kindcan be reached with relative ease.13. An admixture of the three gunas (the essential qualities) with the diversekarmas of individuals produces the four castes. Though I am active in creationthrough these influences, know that I (in My Self) am ever actionless andunchanging.14. Though acting, I am without attachment; nor do I desire any particularoutcome from (any) activity. He, similarly, who is one with Me, and identifiedwith My nature, is unfettered by (the slightest) desire for the fruits ofaction.15. Understanding this (the nature of right action), the wise since earliesttimes have acted dutifully. Be like them (acting without desire for the fruitsof action).16. What, indeed, are action and inaction? Even the wise (can become) confusedon this point. I will explain the distinction, (armed with which knowledge) youwill be freed from all evil.17. The nature of action is difficult to comprehend. To understand it, know thedifference between right action, wrong action, and inaction.18. He is a yogi of true discernment who sees inaction in action, and action ininaction. He is wise among human beings, for he has attained the goal of (all)action (and is free).19. He who never acts motivated by personal desire, whose (ego-binding) karmahas been consumed in the fire of wisdom: such a one (alone) may be consideredwise.20. The wise, having relinquished attachment to the fruits of action, (being)ever contented and free (in the Self), do not (really) act even if they appearto be intensely busy.21. Even in doing physical labor (as opposed to meditative work) one incurs no(karmic limitation) who has renounced all sense of possession, who is withoutpersonal desires, and whose feelings (chitta) are controlled by the inner Self.22. He is free from karmic involvement who is contented with whatever comes tohim uninvited; who is even-minded and untouched by duality; who is without envy,jealousy, and animosity; and (finally) who views success and failure withequanimity.23. All the effects of karma (action) are nullified (in oneself), and oneachieves liberation, when ego-attachment ceases, when one becomes centered inwisdom, and when all one's actions are offered up (in sacrifice) to theInfinite.24. For such a person, (both) the act of self-offering and the offering itselfare, equally, aspects of the one Spirit. The fire (of wisdom) and the personmaking the offering are both Spirit. In this realization, the yogi, freed fromego-identification, goes straight to Brahman (Spirit).25. Some yogis there are who make sacrifices to the devas (deities); others seesacrifice (yagya) as an offering of the self into the cosmic fire of Spirit.26. Other spiritual seekers offer their inner power of hearing and of theirother senses into the fire of self-control. Still others offer whatever theyhear or experience through their senses into the fire of a higher understanding.27. Others, by discrimination, offer up their sense activities, and the energywithin those activities, in the fires of self-control. (They ask themselves,\"Who is seeing? Who is hearing? Whose energy is activating the experience ofthese sensations?\")28. Some offer up their possessions as oblations; some, their actions; othersconcentrate on withdrawing their energy by yoga meditation (offering it up as anoblation); and still others, holding strictly to a vow of self-restraint, offerup all their thoughts to God, practice introspection, and seek wisdom throughstudy of the scriptures.29. One practice of yoga offers the incoming breath (prana) into the outgoingbreath (apana), and the apana into the prana, thereby, through prana-yama(control of the energy), rendering breathing unnecessary.30. Some, regulating the flow of energy in the body by correct diet, offer alltheir energies into the fire of that (upward) flow. All the above seekersunderstand the meaning of self-offering (yagya, or sacrifice), the inner firewhich consumes all the seeds of karma.31. By eating the \"blessed food\" (prasad) left from any of these spiritual firerituals, one attains Brahman (the Infinite Spirit). Even the blessings of thisworld come not to him who gives nothing of himself How, then, can he hope forhappiness in a better world?32. The many ways of offering up the ego are declared in the Vedas (as if)through the \"mouth of Brahma.\" Knowing their true purpose (which is an upwardself-offering), you will be freed from all karmic bondage.33. The inner, spiritual fire ceremony of raising awareness is superior, OScorcher of Foes (Arjuna), to any outward act of self-offering. In this wisdom(alone) is all action (karma) consumed.34. Understand this (above all): By surrender (of self-will to the wise), by(sensitive inward and outward) questioning (of the wise), and by service (to thewise), those who have realized the truth will (be able to) convey their wisdomto you.35. Having (fully) received that wisdom from a true guru, 0 Pandava (Arjuna)!you will never again fall into delusion, for you will behold all creationcontained within your (expanded) Self, and then (behold it) in Me (beyond allcreation).36. Even the worst of sinners can, using the raft of wisdom, safely cross theocean of delusion.37. 0 Arjuna, as fire burns wood to ashes, so does the fire of wisdom burn toashes all one's karma.38. Verily, there is nothing in this world so sanctifying as wisdom. In duecourse of time every devotee who is successful in his practices will realize inhis own Self the truth of this statement.39. The person of devotion who is engrossed in the infinite, having brought hissenses under control, achieves wisdom, and gains that which he knows at once tobe perfect peace.40. The ignorant, the person who lacks devotion, the doubt-ridden: all thesemust perish. The man of vacillating temperament finds no happiness in this worldor the next. For him, supreme bliss is not possible.41. 0 Winner of (true) Wealth, Arjuna! one who has dissolved all his karmas inoneness with God, and has obliterated his every doubt by wisdom, becomescompletely self-possessed. (Ego-free,) no further action can entangle him.42. Arise therefore, 0 Descendent of Bharata (Arjuna): Arise! Take shelter in(this greatest science of) yoga. Slash (to pieces) with the sword of wisdom thedoubt you feel in your heart as to the nature of the Self (and of who you are,in reality).[img0019.jpg]Thus ends the fourth chapter, called \"Gyana Yoga (Union Through Knowledge of theDivine),\" of the Upanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue betweenSri Krishna andArjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE[img0020.jpg]1. Arjuna said: 0 Krishna, You speak of renouncing action, yet at the same timeYou recommend it. I would like to know for certain, which of these two is thebetter path?2. The Blessed Lord answered: Both action and non-action, (when rightlyunderstood,) lead to salvation. Of the two, however, right action is better.3. 0 Mighty-armed (Arjuna), only that person deserves consideration as a truerenunciate who finds freedom from entanglement easy-having no likes or dislikes,and no attachment to duality.4. It is the ignorant, not the wise, who speak of the paths of wisdom (Shankhya)and Yoga as being different from one another. One who is truly established ineither receives the benefits of both.5. The state attained through wisdom (Gyana Yoga, the path of discriminationknown as Shankhya) is the same as that attained by action (the science of yoga).The two paths lead to one universal realization.6. Renunciation, however, 0 Mighty-armed (Arjuna), is difficult to achievewithout God-uniting activity (yoga). By the practice of yoga, the muni (whosemind is absorbed in God) soon attains the perfection of oneness with theAbsolute.7. No taint (of karmic entanglement) remains for him who has been purified byright action and, engaged in divine communion (yoga), has dissolved his ego (ininfinity), achieved victory over the senses, and realized himself as one withthe Self of all.8. He who, in the state of union with God, has cognized the truth fullyunderstands: \"I (myself) do nothing at all,\" though he sees, hears, touches,smells, tastes, moves about, sleeps, breathes, .. .9. . . . speaks, excretes, grasps (with his hands), opens or closes his eyes.Such a person knows at all times that (these) are but the senses engaging their(sense) objects.10. As the lotus leaf is untouched by water, so the yogi who acts withoutattachment, self-offered to the Divine, is not affected by sensory experience(whether gross or subtle).11. For purification of the ego, yogis merely work with the body, mind,discrimination, and sense organs: (They are) never attached to them.12. The God-united yogi, relinquishing attachment to the fruits of action,attains unshakable inner peace. That person, however, who does not direct hisenergies (upward) toward union with God is ruled by desire. Attached to thefruits of action, he lives in (perpetual) bondage.13. When once the embodied soul has controlled the senses, and, mentallyreleasing every attachment to activity, remains blissful (and secure) in the\"city of nine gates\" (the physical body), he (himself) no longer acts, nor doeshe impose action on others (or on his outer senses).14. It is not God, the sovereign Self, who creates in mankind the consciousnessof acting in this world. God neither causes people to act, nor entangles them inthe (karmic) consequences of their actions. It is maya, the cosmic illusion,which acts through them.15. The All-pervading is not concerned about people's sins or virtues. Wisdom(although the natural state of every man) is eclipsed by cosmic delusion.Mankind thus becomes bewildered (as to the difference between right and wrong).16. In those, however, who have banished ignorance by wisdom, the true Selfshines forth with effulgence like the sun.17. Their thoughts immersed in that One, their souls united with it, theirentire devotion and allegiance absorbed in it, their being purged of the poisonof delusion by the antidote of wisdom-such (liberated) souls achieve the stateof no return.18. Such (freed) souls view with equal gaze a pious priest, a cow, an elephant,a dog, and an outcast.19. Even on this (earthly) plane of existence the relativities (birth, death;pleasure, pain) are overcome by one who views everything even-mindedly. Thosewho can do so are verily enthroned in the unblemished,incapable-of-being-distorted Spirit.20. Such sages, established in the one Supreme Being and unwavering in theirdiscrimination, are neither jubilant when confronted by pleasant experiences,nor depressed when confronted by painful ones.21. Feeling no attraction to the sensory world (either subtle or gross), theyogi lives in the ever-new joy of his own being. United to Spirit, he attainsthe perfection of Absolute Bliss.22. 0 Son of Kunti (Arjuna)! because sense pleasures spring from outside theSelf, they all have a beginning and an end and bring only misery. No one of anyunderstanding would seek happiness through them.23. He is truly a yogi who, while living on earth, and up to the last moment ofhis earth life, can master every impulse of desire and antipathy. He (aloneamong mortals) is a happy human being.24. Only one who possesses inner bliss, who is firmly centered in the innerSelf, and who is illumined by the inner Light (dependent for his understandingon nothing outside the Self) attains complete liberation (both while he livesand after death).25. His doubts (and hesitations) removed, his karmas all obliterated, his sensessubdued, delighting only in the good of all, he (the sage) attains emancipationin Spirit.26. Renunciates who are without desire or anger, controlled in mind, andSelf-realized are inwardly free whether living in this world or merged in theInfinite.27-28. The muni (one for whom liberation is the sole purpose of life) controlshis senses, mind, and intellect, removing himself from contact with them byneutralizing the currents of prana and apana in the spine, which manifest(outwardly) as inhalation and exhalation in the nostrils. He fixes his gaze inthe forehead at a point midway between the two eyebrows (thereby converting thedual current of physical vision into the single, omniscient vision of thespiritual eye). Such a one attains complete emancipation.29. He finds peace who knows Me as the Enjoyer of all offerings (yagyas) andausterities, as the Infinite Lord of creation, and as the Dearest Friend of all.[img0021.jpg]Thus ends the fifth chapter, called \"Freedom Through Inner Renunciation,\" of theUpanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna andArjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX[img0022.jpg]1. The Blessed Lord said: The true renunciate and the true yogi are those whoperform dutiful actions without desiring their fruits, not those who, eschewingself-offering, act with ego-motivation, nor those who (in the name ofrenunciation) eschew action.2. Understand, 0 Pandava (Arjuna), that what the scriptures call sannyasa(renunciation) is the same thing as yoga. Indeed, without renunciation ofselfish motive (sanka pa) one cannot be a (true) yogi.3. The muni, aspiring to the (spiritual) heights through (scientific) yogaaction (karma), on achieving his goal finds perfect, vibrationless peace.4. He who has overcome attachment not only to sense objects but to (sensory)activity, and who has achieved freedom from all ego-motivated planning, is said(by the wise) to have attained yogarudha: the firm union of soul and Spirit.5. Let man uplift himself by his own effort, and let him not debase himself.Indeed, one's self is his own greatest friend-or (if he so chooses) his owngreatest enemy.6. For him whose (lower, egoic) self has been conquered by the (higher, soul)Self, that Self is the friend of his (lower) self. The true Self, however, isnot friendly to the false self, and is (in many ways) its enemy.7. The tranquil sage who has conquered the (lower, egoic) self abides ever inthe Supreme Self. He views with equanimity all the dualities: cold and heat,pleasure and pain, praise and blame.8. That yogi who is blissfully absorbed in the wisdom of the Self is known asbeing unshakably united to Spirit. Unchangeable, the controller of his senses,he views with equal mind a clod of earth, a stone, and a bar of gold.9. He is a supreme yogi who gazes equally upon patrons, friends, enemies,strangers, peacemakers, thosewho cause trouble, relatives, the virtuous, and theungodly.10. Free from the hopes (engendered by) desire, and untouched by any craving forpossession, the (waves of feeling in his) heart controlled (by yogaconcentration), the yogi, retiring alone to a quiet place, should try to unitehis little self with the Supreme Self11. The yogi should have a firm, clean seat, neither too high nor too low. Heshould cover his seat first with kusha grass, then (cover that with) a deer ortiger skin, and then (place upon that) a (wool and/or silk) cloth.12. Seated firmly there, with one-pointed concentration of the mind, and neitherroaming mentally nor reacting to sense stimuli, let him seek self-purificationby yoga practice (using the techniques prescribed by his guru).13. Holding the spine, neck, and head firmly erect and motionless, let the yogifocus his gaze at the starting point of the nose (nasikagram) between the twoeyebrows; and let him not gaze elsewhere, but keep his gaze calmly one-pointed.14. Serene and fearless, steadfast in his vow of brahmacharya (sexual control),his mind controlled, and his attention centered in Me, the seated yogi shouldmeditate on Me as the ultimate goal (of all striving).15. The self-governed yogi, his mind fully controlled, attains the peace ofsupreme nirvana (the state of individual extinction) in union with My spirit.16. 0 Arjuna! Yoga is not for him who eats too much or who fasts too much, whosleeps too much or who sleeps too little.17. One who is temperate in eating, recreation, working, sleeping, andwakefulness attains yoga, which destroys all suffering.18. When the chitta (feeling) is completely calmed and centered inwardly in theSelf, the yogi, freed from every attachment and desire, attains the state knownas union with God.19. A candle flame burns steadily, protected from the wind. Even so is theconsciousness of that yogi who has subdued his chitta (feelings).20. The state of complete inner tranquility, (which is) attained by yogameditation, wherein the little self (the ego) perceives itself as the Self,enjoys itself as the Self;-21. that state in which bliss, transcendent above the senses and accepted assuch by intuitive intelligence, can never be expunged;-22. the state which, once attained, is considered the treasure beyond all othertreasures: In that state (alone) does the yogi become immune to grief even (inthe face of) the greatest tragedy.23. That state is known as yoga, the condition in which one becomes immune toany pain. The practice of yoga should therefore be followed resolutely, withundaunted feeling.24. Relinquishing without exception every self-willed longing; restrainingmentally all sensory involvement in the world;-25. patiently calming the intuitive intelligence, and absorbed in the Self, theyogi, relinquishing all other thoughts, gradually attains perfect peace.26. Each time the fickle, wavering mind wanders from its course, let himwithdraw it and redirect it toward (the task of) bringing it under control.27. The yogi who has completely calmed his mind, whose passions (rajoguna) areat rest, and who is freed from every impurity truly attains oneness with theSpirit, and supreme blessedness.28. The yogi, freed from imperfection, ceaselessly engaged in (activities thatlead to) divine union, easily attains the state of blissful union with Spirit.29. United to the Supreme Self by the practice of yoga, he beholds his Self inall beings, and all beings in that one Self.30. He who beholds Me everywhere, and who beholds everything in Me, never losessight of Me; nor do I lose sight of him.31. That yogi rests forever centered in Me who, whatever his outward way ofliving, sees Me at the heart of all beings.32. 0 Arjuna, the best yogi is he who feels the needs of others, their sorrows,their joys, as though these were his own.33. Arjuna said, 0 Madhusudana (Krishna), owing to my restlessness I've achievedno lasting results in the attempts You've taught me to steady the mind.34. Verily (Arjuna continued) the mind is restless, tumultuous, madly stubborn!0 Krishna, I consider it to be as difficult to master as the wind!35. 0 Mighty-armed Arjuna, the mind is undoubtedly fickle and unruly, but it canbe controlled by yoga practice, and by the exercise of mental dispassion.36. Here is My promise: Yoga, though difficult for the ungoverned mind toattain, can be reached through proper methods if one strives (earnestly) toachieve self-control.37. Arjuna said: 0 Krishna, what happens to one who is unsuccessful in yogapractice: who tries devotedly to meditate but finds himself unable to bring hismind under control?38. Does he not become like a riven cloud, scattered and dispersed: unable tofind Brahman, and equally unable to return to the delusory world he rejected?39. Please release me permanently, 0 Krishna, from these doubts! Who else butYou can banish my uncertainty?40. The Blessed Lord answered: 0 Arjuna, My son! One who performs right actionscan never be destroyed. Whether in this world or the next, his fate will neverbe evil.41. A fallen (but sincere) yogi gains entry (after death) into the world of thevirtuous. He (may) remain there for many years. Afterward, he is reborn on earthinto a good and prosperous home.42. On the other hand, he may reincarnate on earth in a family of enlightenedyogis. Such a birth in this world, however, is difficult to attain.43. (In his new family) he recovers the yogic discrimination he attainedformerly, and sets himself with even greater zeal to achieve (final) spiritualliberation.44. The power of former yoga practice is sufficient to impel, as it were, thereborn yogi on his upward path. Even one who seeks only a theoreticalunderstanding of yoga is more highly advanced than one who is dedicated tooutward scriptural (Vedic) rites.45. Diligently following his (chosen) path, and cleansing himself thereby of allsin (karmic debts), the yogi after many births attains perfection, and enters atlast into the Supreme Beatitude.46. The yogi is greater than those ascetics who (strive for spiritual perfectionthrough) discipline of the body, greater even than those who follow the path ofwisdom (Gyana Yoga) or of action (Karma Yoga). Become, 0 Arjuna, a yogi!47. He who, full of faith and love, becomes fully absorbed in Me, I regard asbest attuned to My path to perfection.[img0023.jpg]Thus ends the sixth chapter, called Dhyana Yoga (Union Through Meditation),\" ofthe Upanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri KrishnaandArjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN[img0024.jpg]1. The Blessed Lord said: 0 Partha (Arjuna), hear how, by following the path ofyoga and absorbing yourself in My consciousness, and taking shelter (wholly) inMe, you will realize Me wholly as I am (both in My Infinite, unmoving Self, and,outwardly, with all My attributes and powers). (Knowing Me thus,) you willtranscend every possibility of doubt.2. I am about to unfold truth to you in its entirety, both as theory and asintuitively realized experience. (Armed with this understanding,) there will benothing left for you to know in all the world.3. Among thousands of men, scarcely one strives for spiritual perfection; andamong those blessed ones who seek Me, scarcely one (out of many thousands)perceives Me as I am.4. Earth, water, fire, air, ether, the perceiving mind (manas), discernment(buddhi), and causative self-awareness (ahankara): such are the Eightfolddivisions of My manifested nature (Prakriti).5. Such is My lower nature (Aparaprakriti). Understand now, 0 Mightyarmed(Arjuna)! that My other and higher nature (Paraprakriti) sustains the soul(jiva), which is individual consciousness, and sustains also the life-principleof the universe.6. Know that all beings, (both) the pure and the impure, are born of thistwofold Prakriti. I (alone) beget and dissolve the (whole) universe.7. 0 Arjuna! There is nothing above Me, nor beyond Me. Through all things, asthrough the gemstones of a necklace, runs the thread of My all-unifyingconsciousness.8. 0 Son of Kunti (the quality of dispassion), I am the fluidity of waters; I amthe light of the moon and the sun; I am pranaba (AUM) in the (teachings of the)Vedas; I am (the \"silent\" roar of cosmic) sound in the ether (the subtlevibrations of space); I am the manhood in man.9. I am the wholesome fragrance of earth; I am the radiance of fire; I am thelife of every creature; in holy ascetics, I am their austerity.10. Know Me, 0 Son of Pritha (Arjuna) to be the seed of all creatures! I amintelligence in the discerning; in those who are glorious, I am their glory.11. Among the powerful, 0 Best of the Bharatas (Arjuna)! I am power withoutpersonal ambition and attachment; I am that sexual desire (kama) in men which isin keeping with dharma (righteousness).12. Know that all manifestations of sattwa (the elevating), rajas (theactivating), and tamas (the darkening quality) emanate from Me. They exist inMe, though I am not apparent in them.13. Deluded by the three qualities (gunas) of Nature, mortal beings do notperceive Me, ever changeless and beyond all qualities.14. It is indeed difficult to waken from My cosmic hypnosis, instinct as it iswith the three gunas (qualities) of maya. Only they who take shelter in Me canfind freedom from the wonderful power of illusion.15. Evildoers (in whom tamas predominates), lowest of human beings, dull-wittedand bereft of understanding by (the power of) maya, failing to take shelter inMe, partake of the nature of demons.16. Those who seek shelter in Me, 0 Arjuna, are of four types: those who are indistress; those who seek understanding; those who seek power (in this world orthe next); and those who are (already) wise.17. Outstanding among the wise is he whose devotion is constant and one-pointed.I am, above all things, dear to that sage, and he, of all beings, is dearest toMe.18. All of the above (four kinds of virtuous) men are noble (for the directionof their consciousness is upward), but the sage who has established himselffirmly in Me as the highest goal, him I look upon as indeed My own Self.19. After many incarnations, the sage realizes Me in My true nature. A person soillumined that he sees Me as all-pervading is rare (and hard) to find.20. Those, however, who prefer (to follow) their own will (rejecting the path ofinward communion with God), whose discrimination has been vitiated by thiscraving or by that, and who (perhaps) feel inclined toward cultish teachings,seek lesser gods.21. Whatsoever the form a person worships (a saint, a master, a deity-whetherreal or imaginary), it is I who (uplift his heart) and make his devotionsteadfast and true.22. Absorbed in his devotion, intent on worshiping that form, he derives true,spiritual benefits, and has his desires (his prayers) fulfilled. The blessingshe receives come from Me alone.23. Men of meager understanding, however, (in limiting their worship to thelesser gods) receive limited results. Devotees of the lower gods go to thosegods. Devotees who worship Me (the Infinite One) come to Me.24. Men who lack wisdom think of Me, the Unmanifest, as limited (when I appear)in a bodily form. They comprehend not My higher nature (which is) changeless,unutterable, supreme.25. Hidden by My veil of yoga-maya, I am invisible to mankind. Humanity,therefore, bewildered (by appearances), sees not that I am (in essence) everunborn, and ever deathless.26. 0 Arjuna, the past, present, and future of all beings is known to Me. Me,however, no man knows (so long as he knows himself as only human).27. 0 Descendent of Bharata, Scorcher of Foes (Arjuna)! Birth in a body subjectsall beings to the power of delusion with its dualities, which produce attractionand repulsion. (Such is the storm of maya on the surface of My ocean ofconsciousness.)28. Righteous men, however, their sins expiated, and no longer subject to theoppositions of duality, worship Me steadfastly.29. Those who, clinging to Me, seek release from (the debilities of) old age andfrom (the finality of) death become true knowers of Brahman (the Absolute), ofAdhyatma (the Overself), and of all the secrets of karma.30. Those who perceive My presence within their physical (Adhibhuta), astral(Adhidaiva), and spiritual (causal, or Adhiyagya) bodies, their hearts united toMe, retain their perception even at the time of death.[img0025.jpg]Thus ends the seventh chapter, called \"The Yoga of Knowledge andDiscrimination,\" of the Upanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialoguebetween Sri Krishna andArjuna discussing yoga and the science ofGod-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT[img0026.jpg]1. Arjuna said: 0 Best of the Purushas (Krishna)! Please tell me, what isBrahman (Spirit)? What is Adhyatma (the Kutastha Chaitanya underlying allmanifestations, which is individualized as the souls of all creatures)? What isKarma (action-cosmic and individual-born of AUM)? What is Adhibhuta (theconsciousness immanent in physical creatures and the physical cosmos)? And whatis Adhidaiva (the consciousness manifest in astral bodies and in the astralcosmos)?2. 0 Slayer of (the demon) Madhu (Krishna)! What is Adhiyagya (the SupremeCreative and Cognizing Spirit), and in what manner is Adhiyagya (the soul'sself-offering) possible in this body? How, finally, at the time of death, arethe self-disciplined to know You?3. The Blessed Lord replied: Brahman is the Indestructible and Supreme Spirit.Adhyatma is Brahman's manifestation as the essential soul of all beings. Cosmickarma is AUM (the Cosmic Vibration), which causes the birth, sustenance, anddissolution of all creatures, and also the diversity of their natures.4. 0 Supreme among the Embodied (Arjuna)! Adhibhuta is the basis of physicalexistence; Adhidaiva is the basis of astral existence; and I (the Spiritmanifested ideationally, both macro- and micro-cosmically) am Adhiyagya.5. He who, at the hour of death, thinks only of Me enters unquestionably into MyBeing.6. 0 Son of Kunti (Arjuna)! the uppermost thought in a person's mind as he diesdetermines his next state of existence.7. Therefore, remember Me (throughout life), and fight the battle (of rightaction)! Surrender to Me your mind and understanding. In so doing, you willwithout a doubt come to Me.8. That person attains the Supreme Effulgence, 0 Partha (Arjuna), who, his mind(by long practice) firmly fixed on Me, thinks of Me only.9-10. The yogi, at the time of his death, attains that supremely effulgentstate: provided that, with deep love and with focused power through the practiceof yoga, he succeeds in penetrating his conscious energy through the Kutasthabetween the eyebrows (the seat of the spiritual eye); and if he maintains hisattention unwaveringly on that Being who, beyond all delusions of (gloom and)darkness, shines like the sun-whose form is subtler than the finest atom, who isthe Ultimate Support of all (existence), and the great Ruler (of all), eternaland omniscient.11. I will now relate to you briefly that truth, and the method for attainingit, which Vedic seers declare to be Immutable, and which sannyasis (renunciates)gain by dissolving their attachments through a life of self-discipline andtranscendence of all passion.12-13. That person reaches the highest goal who closes the gates (openings) ofthe body, sequesters the (receptive) mind in the heart center, channels all hislife force to the brain, and engages steadfastly thereafter in the practice ofyoga: Such a one, established in AUM-the Holy Word of Brahman-is able toremember Me at the final moment of his emergence from the body.14. 0 Partha (Arjuna)! I am reached easily by that yogi of single heart (theheart's feeling focused and uplifted) who daily, continuously keeps Me in hisconsciousness, wholly focused on Me.15. Those great souls who love Me and (out of love for Me) merge in My spirit,achieve the highest success (the only kind worth courting). They need neverreturn again to this ephemeral, grief-stricken world.16. Those living in every world, from the highest to the lowest, are subject torebirth. (Only) on entering into My consciousness do they gain release (fromkarmic bondage).17. They truly know \"day\" and \"night\" who comprehend the Day of Brahma, whichendures for a thousand mahayugas, and the Night of Brahma, which endures foranother thousand mahayugas.18. At the dawn of Brahma's Day, all creation, remanifested, emerges from its(night) state of unmanifestation: At the dusk of (approaching) Brahma's Night,all creation sinks back into its (previous) unmanifested state.19. Again and again, O Son of Pritha (Arjuna)! the same people throng back toearth to be reborn. (The cycle of) reincarnation ends for them only temporarilywith the descent of Brahma's Night. It resumes again with the dawn of Brahma'sDay.20. Beyond the unmanifested state (known as the Night of Brahma) there is theAbsolute Unmanifested, forever immutable, which remains eternally untouched bythe recurring cycles of creation.21. The (aforesaid) \"Absolute Unmanifested, forever Immutable\" is (what sagesspeak of as) the Supreme Spirit. Those (only) who attain it by self-effort gaineternal freedom from obligatory rebirth.22. Singlehearted devotion, 0 Arjuna! is what lifts one to that supremelyunmanifested state. Only the ever-conscious, Omnipresent Spirit is the(ultimate) repository of all (things, and all) beings.23. I will now declare to you, 0 Best of the Bharatas (Arjuna)! the two pathsopen to departing souls: the one, the way of the yogi, which leads to (eternal)freedom; the other, the way to rebirth.24. Fire, light, daytime, the bright half of the lunar month, the six months ofthe northern course of the sun: pursuing this path at the time of death, theknowers of Brahman go to Brahman.25. Smoke, night-time, the dark half of the lunar month, the six months of thesouthern course of the sun: following this path at the time of death, oneattains only the lunar light and so returns to earth.26. These two paths of exit (from the body) are eternal alternatives: the way oflight leads to freedom; the way of darkness, to rebirth.27. No true yogi, understanding these two alternate paths, is ever deluded (intofollowing the downward way). Therefore, 0 Arjuna! Keep yourself firmly at alltimes in a (state of) yoga.28. He who knows the (hidden secret of) these two paths goes beyond any merits(with its fruits of good karma) gained from study of the scriptures, or from theformal practice ofyagyas, austerities, or gifts in charity. That yogi attainshis (self's) Supreme Origin.[img0027.jpg]Thus ends the eighth chapter, called \"Union with the Absolute Spirit,\" of theUpanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna andArjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINE[img0028.jpg]1. The Blessed Lord said: To you, who have overcome the carping spirit, I nowreveal the sublime mystery (the immanent and transcendent nature of God). Armedwith this (intuitive) wisdom, you shall escape all evil.2. (The way to this) realization is the highest of sciences, the (secret of)secrets, the essence of all dharma (right action). Through (yoga) methods, easyto perform, this way bestows the direct perception of truth.3. Men who lack faith (and even interest) in this dharma, (seeking theirfulfillment elsewhere) do not attain Me, 0 Scorcher of Foes (Arjuna)! Again andagain they take the path of samsara (delusion) and mortality.4. I, the (eternally) Unmanifested, pervade the entire universe. All creaturesabide in Me, though I abide not in them.5. Behold My divine mystery! All beings seem not to exist in Me, nor I in them:Yet I am their sole Creator and Preserver!6. Think of it thus: As air moves through space, but is not space, so do allcreatures have their being in Me, but are not I.7. At the end of a cycle (kalpa), 0 Son of Kunti (Arjuna)! all beings return tothe unmanifested state of My Cosmic Nature. At the beginning of the next greatcycle, I cast them forth again.8. By reawakening again and again My own emanation, Prakriti, I repeatedlyproduce the vast host of creatures, all subject to Nature and to her finitelaws.9. These activities do not bind Me, 0 Winner of Wealth (Arjuna)! for I,remaining aloof from them, am forever non-attached.10. 0 Son of Kunti (Arjuna), it is My impregnating essence alone that makesMother Nature give birth to (both) the animate and inanimate. By My power alone(through Prakriti) do the (very) worlds revolve.11. The ignorant, oblivious of My transcendent nature though (I am) the Creatorof all, are blind also to My presence within (themselves).12. Blind to all (valid) insights, vain in their aspirations, deeds, andthoughts, human beings (who were made for a nobler purpose) may partake of thenature of monsters and demons.13. Great souls, however, expressing in their human nature the higher qualitiesof divinity, pay undeviating homage to Me, the Imperishable Source of all life.14. Constantly absorbed in Me, prostrating to Me with love, steadfastly resolutein their high aspiration, they worship Me with (unceasing) adoration.15. Lesser beings also, offering Me themselves with clear discrimination,discern Me first in the manifested many, and then as the One (behind the many).16. I am the sacrificial ritual; I am the sacrifice itself; I am the oblationsoffered to the ancestors; I am the (medicinal) herb; I am the sacred mantras; Iam the ghee (clarified butter, which is offered in ritual worship); (I am also)the fire (and) the very act of offering.17. Of this world I am the Father, Mother, Forefather, Preserver; I am He whosanctifies; I am the Object of all Knowledge; I am the Cos- micAUM; I am thelore of the three Vedas (Rig, Yajur, and Sama).* [index_split_024.html#page0207]18. I am the Ultimate Goal, the Upholder, the Lord, the Witness, the Abode, theRefuge, the One Friend. I am the Origin, the Dissolution, the Foundation, theCosmic Storehouse, and the Imperishable Seed.19. I bestow heat; I send or withhold rain. Immortality am I, and mortality aswell. I am both Being and Non-being (Sat and Asat).20. Those who follow Vedic (or other) rituals, cleansing themselves by the Somarites, or worshiping Me by prescribed yagyas, doing (all these) to win heaven,succeed in going there, and (may) attain the realm of Indra (lord of the gods),where they enjoy the delights of heaven.21. After enjoying those lofty regions for a time, and when the merits they haveacquired (that have brought them) there have been exhausted, they return toearth. By following the scriptural regulations in their desire for celestialrewards, they (endlessly) repeat the cycle of ascent and return.22. To those who meditate on Me as their very own, (their hearts) ever united toMe by incessant (inward) worship, I supply their deficiencies and make permanenttheir gains.23. 0 Son of Kunti (Arjuna), even the devotees of other gods, if they sacrificeto them with faith, are worshiping Me alone, however improperly.24. For I alone am in truth the Enjoyer and Lord of all sacrifices. Those,however, (who worship Me in lesser aspects) perceive Me not in My true nature,and so eventually they fall.25. Those who worship the gods go to them; those who worship their ancestors goto the abode of ancestors; those who worship the nature spirits go to them; butthose who are My devotees come to Me.26. Whenever anyone, with a pure intention, offers Me (even) a leaf, a flower, a(piece of) fruit, or water (whether poured out or held up in a vessel), I accepthis offering (as symbolic of his love).27. Whatever action you perform (with dispassion), 0 Arjuna! whether eating, orperforming spiritual rites, or making gifts in charity, or in austerities(self-discipline), dedicate that action inoffering to Me.28. In this way, nothing you do will bind you to either good or evil karma.Firmly anchored in Me by self-renunciation, you will achieve freedom, and willcome to Me.29. I am impartial to all. No one is (specially) hateful or dear to Me. Those,however, who give Me their hearts' love are in Me, as I am in them.30. Even an evildoer, if (in his heart) he rejects all else and worships Mealone, should, because of that resolution, be counted among the good.31. (Such a one) will soon become virtuous, and will achieve lasting peace. 0Son of Kunti (Arjuna), know this for a certainty: My devotee is never lost!32. Taking shelter in Me, all can achieve Supreme Fulfillment-whether they be ofsinful birth, or women (the preservers, traditionally, of family values andtherefore of samsara), or Vaishyas, or lowly Shudras.33. How easy it is, then, for (true) Brahmins, who know God, and for Rajarishis(true Kshatriyas, whose sole desire is to serve God in all) to attain Me. Ah!You who have come into this transient world, full of misery: Worship Me alone!34. Keep your mind fixed on Me! Be My devotee! In ceaseless worship andadoration, bow to Me! Thus, becoming one with Me and knowing Me as your highestgoal, you shall (ever) be My very own![img0029.jpg]Thus ends the ninth chapter, called \"The Sovereign Lord of All,\" of theUpanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna andArjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TEN[img0030.jpg]1. The Blessed Lord said: 0 Mighty-armed (Arjuna), hear now My supremeutterance: Speaking for your highest good, I will say more to you, who havelistened with joy.2. Neither the multitude of gods (angels) nor the great sages (in their humanstate) know Me in My Unmanifested state. I am their Source and Origin.3. Whoever realizes Me, however, unborn and without any beginning, as well as(even now) the Lord of Creation, has conquered delusion, and is sinless thoughhe inhabit a human body.4-5. Discrimination, wisdom, calm clarity, forgiveness, truthfulness,sense-control, inner peace, joy, sorrow, birth, death, fear, courage,harmlessness, equanimity, serenity, self-discipline, charity, fame, notoriety:these states, vastly diverse as they are, derive from My one Self: They aremodifications of My one (essential) nature.6. The seven great rishis, the Primeval Four, and the (fourteen) Manus are allmodifications of My nature, born of My (projected) thought, and endowed with(creative) powers like Mine. From these (progenitors) come all the life forms onearth.7. He who realizes the truth of My prolific manifestations, and the creative anddissolving power of My divine yoga, is unshakably united to Me.8. I am the Source of everything. From Me all creation emerges. Realizing thisgreat truth, the wise, awe-stricken, adore Me.9. Their thoughts engrossed in Me, their beings surrendered to Me, enlighteningone another and conversing of Me, they are ever contented and filled with joy.10. To those who are attached only to Me, and who worship Me with love, I impartthat discernment of wisdom by which they attain Me completely.11. Out of pure compassion (that is, out of the selfless gift of love, with noadmixture of compulsion), I, the Divine One who dwells in all, set alight intheir (hearts) the blazing lamp of wisdom, which banishes their darkness ofignorance.12. Arjuna said (in adoration): 0 Lord, Thou art the Supreme Spirit, the SupremeShelter, the Supreme Purity, the One, Self-manifested Being, the Causeless, theEternal, the Omnipresent!13. Thus do all the sages-the divine seer Narada, Asila, Devala, Byasa, and YouYourself, Krishna-declare.14. (Arjuna continues:) 0 Keshava (Krishna)! I consider all that You haverevealed to me to be the eternal truth. Neither gods nor demons (can) know Your(multifarious) manifestations.15. 0 Supreme Person (Arjuna continues), Origin of beings, Lord of allcreatures, God of gods, Sustainer of the world! verily You alone are SelfKnowing.16. Please expound fully to me Your perfect powers by which, being omnipresent,You sustain the universe.17. 0 Supreme Yogi (Krishna), how shall I meditate on You, to know You as Youare? In what forms and aspects can I most accurately think of You?18. 0 Janardana (Krishna), tell me at length of Your yoga powers andmanifestations, for I never tire of listening to this nectar-like speech ofYours.19. The Blessed Lord said: 0 Best of Princes (Arjuna), I shall willingly relateto you something of My manifestations-but I'll relate only those which areoutstanding, for there is no end to My variety.20. 0 Gudakesha (Conqueror of Sleep-Arjuna), I am the true Self dwelling in theheart of all creatures. I am the beginning, the continuation, and end of theirexistence.21. Among the Adityas (Vedic gods), I am Vishnu; among luminaries (in the sky),I am the sun; among the wind gods, I am Marichi (the most beneficial wind);among (nocturnal) luminaries, I am the moon.22. Among the Vedas, I am Sama Veda (on account of its musical beauty); amongthe gods, I am Indra; of sense-perceptions I am Mind (the perceiver); increatures, I am their intelligence.23. Among the Rudras (the intelligent life forces) I am Shankara (theirempowering intelligence); among Yakshas and Rakshasas (astral abstractions ofhuman desire) I am Kubera (the god of wealth); among Vasus (the vitalizingforces) I am Pavaka (Agni, the god of fire); among mountain peaks, I am Meru.24. Of priests, 0 Son of Pritha (Arjuna), know Me to be Brihaspati (guru of thegods); among generals, I am Skanda (Kartikeya, the god of war); among bodies ofwater, I am the ocean.25. Among great rishis, I am Bhrigu; among words, I am the syllable AUM; amongyagyas (sacred rituals) I am japa yagya (silent, superconscious chanting); amongthings unmoving, I am the Himalaya.26. Among trees, I am Ashvatta; among the divine seers, I am Narada; among theGhandharvas (gods of music), I am Chitraratha; among perfected beings, I amKapila (the exponent of Shankhya).27. Among horses, I am the nectar-born Ucchaisravas; among elephants, I am(Indra's white elephant) Airavata; among men, I am the monarch.28. Among weapons, I am the thunderbolt; among cows, I am Kama- dhuk (thefulfiller of desires); in sexual desire, I am procreation; among serpents, I amVasuki.29. Among the Naga serpents, I am Ananta (endless); among water beings, I amVaruna; among departed ancestors, I am Aryama; among those who maintain law andorder, I am Yama.30. Among the Daityas, I am Prahlad; among measurers, I am Time; among animals,I am their king (the lion); among birds, I am Garuda (\"lord of the skies\"; inclassical symbology, the vehicle of Vishnu).31. Among purifiers, I am the wind; among wielders of weapons, I am Rama; amongaquatic creatures, I am Makara (vehicle of the ocean god); among rivers, I amJahnavi (the Ganges, holiest of rivers).32. Among all manifestations, 0 Arjuna, I am their beginning, middle, and end;among the various branches of knowledge, I am the wisdom of the Self; amongdebates, I am the clearest reasoning.33. Among all letters, I am the first in the alphabet; among compounds, I am theconnecter; in time, I am the immutable; in creation, I am the Omnipresent, andever turn My face in all directions.34. I am all-dissolving Death; I am Birth; I am the origin of things yet to be;among feminine manifestations (the qualities of Prakriti, or Mother Nature), Iam fame, success, the illuminating power of speech, memory, intuitivediscrimination, firmness in loyalty, and patience.35. Among hymns, I am Brihat-Saman; among poetic meters, I am Gayatri; amongmonths, I am Margashirsha (the auspicious winter month); among seasons, I amKusumakara, the flowerbringer (spring).36.

Whatever being is endowed with power, prosperity, or glory, know thatendowment itself to be only a spark of My effulgence.42. What need have you, however, 0 Arjuna, for these manifold details? Know thisonly: I, the Unchanging and Everlasting, permeate and sustain the entire cosmoswith but a fragment of My essential being.[img0031.jpg]Thus ends the tenth chapter, called `From the Unmanifested to the Manifested,\"ofthe Upanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri KrishnaandArjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVEN[img0032.jpg]1. Arjuna said: In Your compassion You have revealed to me the secret wisdom ofthe Self, and have thereby banished my delusion.2. 0 Lotus-eyed (Krishna)!

And yet, 0 Purushottama! I long to behold You for myself, in Yourinfinite form.4. 0 Master, Lord of Yogis! If You deem me fit, reveal to me Your Infinite Self!5.

You cannot grasp my vision with mortal eyes, however. Now, therefore, I giveyou divine sight. Behold My supreme yoga power!9. (To Dhritarashtra) Sanjaya said: With these words Hari (Krishna), the exaltedLord of yoga, revealed to Arjuna his Supreme, Divine form.[index_split_024.html#page0208]10-11. Arjuna saw the Supreme Deity, infinite in variety, omnidirectional inradiance, all-pervading-as if adorned on all sides with celestial robes,garlands, and ornaments; the divine weapons (celestial powers) upraised (asthough ready for use); fragrant with exquisite essences, and with faces and eyesseemingly everywhere!12. Were a thousands suns to appear together in the sky, their brilliance couldsuggest but dimly the splendor of that exalted Being.13. There (in that vision) did Arjuna behold the vast universe with its endlessdivisions, all united as one, within the form of the God of gods.14. Then Dhananjaya (Arjuna), wonder-struck, the follicles of hair on his armsrising in awe, prayerfully joined his palms together and, bowing his head to theLord, exclaimed, marveling:15-31: Most wonderful Lord, adored of gods!Within Thy cosmic form I behold the vast universe of beings, saints and sagesdivine sequestered in remote caves, their serpent nature (Kundalini), formerlyvirulent, now tamed, raised by love on the rod of awakening.Lord Brahma, God of gods, seated on the head of each sage, his seat the shininglotus of a thousand rays!O Cosmic-bodied Lord of all worlds, I behold Thee everywhere, and in everything!Innumerable bodies, faces, eyes reveal Thy energy! Inscrutable to me are Yourorigins, Your reigns, Your endings. O Blazing Effulgence! Overwhelming Light!The glory of Thy name spreads everywhereto darkest corners of the universe!Diademed with stars, wielding the mace of sovereign power, Your discus ofwhirling vortices of light dazzling, illuminating, thrilling all! Immortal,Supreme Brahman, Supreme resting-place of all created forms, Guardian of eternallaw: high wisdom's throne, Thy Self-born luster shields Thy devotees from harm,Protecting all beings, and calling them to wakefulness in Thee.O Sovereign One, the beings of earth, the astral gods-all, awe-stricken, withfolded palms offer Thee adoration; with prostrations enter Thy cosmic temple,and offer Thee their love, their hearts' devotion: raising hymns to the starrydome of heaven, they worship Thee, and Thee alone.The lights of heaven-blazing suns, the \"lamps\" of consciousness-hermits, sages,emperors of benign rule, noble heralds of Thy peace, the strong, the powerful,the desire-filled, the ambitious, bow in wonder before Thy radiant throne, orfall, otherwise, before Thee, fear-filled, vanquished, their petty livesconsumed in the cosmic fire.Thee I behold!

Moths, drawn to a flame, there perish: So dohuman lives, drawn by ambition, ever hopeful, but ever doomed to devastation,the fog of passion obscuring from them Truth.Who art Thou, Lord? What is Thy cosmic will? What is Thy purpose? To what endhas all this been done?32-34. The Blessed Lord said:I am Kala: I am Time. Disguised as Endless Doom I come. I seize; I obliterate.Even were you not to fight, these foes you gaze upon at Kurukshetra wouldperish, Arjuna, slain by My mighty will. Indeed, I slew them long ago: You arebut My instrument. Your destiny is to carry out My will. I need you not: It isyou, Arjuna, who have need of Me! I know the past, present, and future of allmen. Make war for Me, if you would embrace eternal life, and victory, and bliss!35. Sanjaya said: Thus hearing, Arjuna, with folded hands, trembling in awe,prostrated before Krishna and spoke these words:36. 0 Krishna, rightly does the world rejoice in Thy glory! The demons,terrified, in vain seek refuge from Thy wrath. And the multitudes of perfectedbeings bow in the surrender of true worship.37. Ah! how could they not pay Thee homage, Thou more-than-exalted Lord? Greaterart Thou than Brahma, who created all! 0 Infinite Being, God of gods, Shelter ofthe universe-Thou the Imperishable, the Manifested and Unmanifested, theUltimate Mystery!38. Thou art the First of Gods, the Primal Person, the refuge of the world. Thoualone knowest all there is to be known. Thou art the Supreme Goal. By Thee isthe universe pervaded, 0 Thou of infinite form!39. Thou art Vayu (the wind). Thou art Yama (the destroyer, and god of death).Thou art Agni (god of fire). Thou art Varuna (the sea god). Thou art Sasanka(the moon), and Prajapati (the grandsire of all). Hail, all hail to Thee athousand times! Hail, and hail to Thee again, and yet again!40. Hail to Thee in front, behind, and everywhere. Boundless in power andimmeasurable in might, Thou art in all, and therefore Thou art all!41. For whatever disrespect I may have shown Thee in jest, addressing Thee as\"Friend,\" \"Companion,\" \"Krishna,\" \"Yadava\" (Krishna's family relationship toArjuna), speaking carelessly, though with affection-42. and for any irreverence I may have shown Thee lightheartedly, O UnshakableLord! while eating, resting, walking, when we sat together by ourselves, or inthe company of others: for all such unintended slights-ah! never intended!-OIllimitable Lord, I beg Your forgiveness.43. Father of all beings, Thou: of animate and inanimate alike. None is worthyof worship but Thee, 0 Guru Sublime! Unequaled by anyone in the three worlds,who can surpass Thee, 0 Lord of Incomparable Power?44. Therefore, 0 Thou Infinitely Adorable! I cast myself abjectly at Thy feet,imploring Thy pardon. As a father to his son, as a friend to a dear friend, as alover to his beloved, do Thou, beloved Lord, forgive me!45. Overjoyed I am by this cosmic vision, never before beheld. Yet, I confess,my mind is not free from terror. Be merciful to me, 0 Lord of gods and Shelterof the worlds! Show me Thyself once again in Thy (limited, human) form.46. I long to see Thee (0 Krishna!) in the form that is familiar to most: asfour-armed Vishnu, diademed, his mace and discus held aloft. 0 Lord of athousand arms, for the reassurance of many, appear to me now in that knownshape.47. The Blessed Lord said: By My grace, exercising My yoga power, I haverevealed to you-as to none other-this Supreme form of Mine: radiant, infinite!48. No mortal man-save thee alone, great hero of the Kuru dynas- ty!-has lookedupon My universal form: Not by sacrifices, nor by gifts in charity, nor by nobleworks, nor by pious study of the Vedas can that vision be attained.49. Be not fearful, nor bewildered by this vision of the wholly impersonalaspect of My being. Take comfort; be glad at heart, and behold Me in this, My(humanly speaking) reassuring aspect.50. Sanjaya said: Having thus addressed Arjuna, Vasudeva (Krishna) appeared onceagain to his disciple, comfortingly, in his own (human) form.51. Arjuna said: 0 Granter of all Boons (Krishna)! Viewing You once again in thehuman form I love, my mind is pacified and I feel I am once more myself.52. The Blessed Lord said: Very difficult is it to behold, as you have done, thevision of the divine universe. Even the gods yearn to see it.53-54. Its revelation, however, is not attained by penances or by faithfulnessto scripture or by charities or by formal worship. 0 Scorcher of Foes (Arjuna)!only by single-hearted devotion, achieved through deep yoga practice, is itpossible to behold Me, and to become one with Me, as you have done, in My cosmicform.55. He who serves Me alone, who makes Me his only goal, who lovingly surrendersevery thought of \"I\" to Me, who releases all attachment to aught else, and who(beholding Me in all) bears no ill will toward anyone-he, 0 Arjuna!, enters Myvast being.[img0033.jpg]Thus ends the eleventh chapter, called \"The Divine Vision, \"of the Upanishad ofthe holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjunadiscussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVE[img0034.jpg]1. Arjuna said: Between those who worship You with steadfast devotion, and thosewho concentrate on the Absolute, which is better versed in the yoga science?2. The Blessed Lord answered: Those who, with minds fixed on Me, are ever unitedto Me in pure devotion, are in My eyes the best versed in yoga.3-4. Those, however, who aspire to the Indestructible, the Indescribable, theUnmanifested, the All-Pervading, the Incomprehensible, the Immutable above allvibration, who have subjugated the senses, are even-minded, and devotethemselves to the well-being of all-verily, they, too, attain Me.5. Those who make the Unmanifested their primary goal make the path moredifficult for themselves. Arduous is that path for embodied beings.6-7. For those who venerate Me only, offering to Me all their actions, theirminds concentrated on Me by yoga practice, and their hearts' feelings upliftedto Me in devotion: Such devotees I rescue from the ocean of mortality.8. Immerse your consciousness in Me alone; direct all your discrimination towardfinding Me: Beyond any doubt, then, you shall come to Me.9. 0 Dhananjaya (Arjuna), if you cannot absorb your thoughts in thecontemplation of Me, then practice the techniques of yoga, intended to helpdevelop concentration.10. If, however, you find yoga practice too difficult, then perform every actionin the thought of Me. By this means, too, shall you achieve final success.11. But if even, while active, you cannot think of Me, then give Me yourintentions. Ever striving to discipline your mind, offer to Me the fruits ofyour every labor.12. Perseverance in pursuing Self-knowledge, and (sincere) aspiration to(experience) it through meditation, is better than the possession of theoreticalknowledge. Offering up to Me the fruits of action, moreover, is better thanone-sided but restless meditation. Action, coupled with renunciation of thefruits of action, brings inner peace, which makes it possible to meditatedeeply.13-14. He who bears no ill will toward anyone; who is kind and friendly to all;who has no consciousness of \"I\" and \"mine\"; who is evenminded during pain andpleasure, forgiving toward all, inwardly contented, steadfast in his (yoga)meditation practices, and selfcontrolled; who tries faithfully (through yogapractice) to unite his soul to Me; who is firm in determination, and whose mindand discrimination are surrendered to Me: such a one is dear to Me.15. One who doesn't disturb others, and is not disturbed in return, who neverexults in anything, is never jealous, fearful, or worried-such a one is dear toMe.16. One who is free from worldly expectations; pure-minded; prompt in action;unconcerned and unafflicted by circumstances; who is without egomotivation: he,My (true) devotee, is dear to Me.17. He who neither rejoices in good fortune nor grieves when things go wrong;who judges matters as neither good nor evil; who is devoted only to Me: such aone is dear to Me.18-19. He who treats friend and foe alike; who is even-minded whether(receiving) honor or dishonor; who calmly, without attachment, accepts warm andcold, pleasure and pain; who is the same under praise or censure; who isinwardly tranquil and contented; who is attached to no abode and is ever calmand devout: such a one is dear to Me.20. But those who, filled with devotion, pursue the deathless dharma I havedescribed, ever engrossed in Me, are above all dear to Me.[img0035.jpg]Thus ends the twefih chapter, called \"The Path of Bhakti Yoga, \" of theUpanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna andArjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEEN[img0036.jpg]PREAMBLE:Arjuna said: 0 Keshava (Krishna), I long to know the (mystery) of Prakriti andPurusha (Intelligent Mother Nature and transcendent God, the Father); of kshetra(the body) and kshetragya (the inner perceiver); of knowledge and its object(that which is known).1. The Blessed Lord replied: 0 Son of Kunti (Arjuna), those who know truthperceive this (human) body as kshetra (the \"field\" where good and evil karma arereaped), and the knower of the field (the soul) as kshetragya.2. Know Me also, 0 Bharata (Arjuna), as the silent Knower (Perceiver) in allkshetras (bodies evolved out of the cosmic creative principle and Nature). Iconsider true wisdom to be the understanding of kshetra, the field, and of itsrelation to kshetragya, the perceiver of the field.3-4. Hear now briefly about the field, its attributes, its cause-and-effectprinciple, and its distorting influences; also what He (the kshetragya) is, andthe nature of His powers-truths which have been sung by sages in many ways: inchants of the Vedas and in well-reasoned, conclusive aphorisms of theBrahmasutra.5-6. Succinctly stated (quoting scripture), the kshetras are composed of (both)undifferentiated and differentiated Nature, their differentiated nature beingthe gross \"elements\" (earth, water, fire, air, ether), the ten senses (the fiveorgans of knowledge: the ears, skin, eyes, nose, and tongue; and the five\"objects\" of sense-hearing, feeling, sight, smell, and taste), and the fiveorgans of action (the hands, feet, mouth, anus, and generative organ); the onesense-conscious mind, intellect, ego-consciousness, the distortions of chitta(attraction/aversion, pleasure/pain), the body itself, consciousness, andpersistence.7. The true insight bestowed by wisdom is revealed in the following qualities:humility; unpretentiousness; harmlessness; forgiveness; integrity; service tothe guru; purity (of mind and body); steadfastness; self-control;-8. indifference to sense-objects; lack of emphasis on one's own self; perceptionof the sufferings and evils inherent in birth, illness, old age, and death;-9. non-attachment; non-identification of the ego with one's own children, wife,and home (and with everything that these entail); equal acceptance of bothfortune and misfortune;-10. unswerving devotion to and identity with Me, through yoga practice; love ofsolitude; disinclination for worldly society;-11. perseverance in the pursuit of Self-knowledge; aspiration toward truewisdom, which is the goal of all learning. Qualities opposite to these virtuesare the signs of ignorance.12. I will now tell you what knowledge one should pursue: true knowledge, whichbestows immortality. Hear (what I have to say) about the Supreme, BeginninglessBrahman: He who cannot be said either to exist or not to exist (since existenceimplies a coming into being).13. He dwells, however, omnipresent in the universe, pervading all: heads, eyes,ears, faces everywhere;-14. shining in all the sense faculties, yet transcending them; the mainstay ofeverything, yet attached to nothing; above the (three) gunas (qualities), yetexperiencing (everything) through them;-15. within and without all that exists, both animate and inanimate; the \"nearestof the near,\" yet so subtle as to be imperceptible;-16. He, the indivisible One, appears divided into countless beingsmaintaining,then destroying their forms, then manifesting them anew;-17. the Light of lights He is, beyond all darkness; all knowledge, (whether)knowable or aspired to: He is (forever) seated in the hearts of all.18. I have briefly described here the field (kshetra); the nature of wisdom, andthe object of wisdom. Possessed of this insight, My devotee enters into Me.19. Know that both Purusha and Prakriti are without a beginning. Know also thatall the modifications and qualities (gunas) of Nature are born of Prakriti.20. Material cause and effect are the product of Prakriti. Joy and sorrow (themental experience of those effects) are the product of Purusha (the soul) inman.21. Purusha, acting through Prakriti, and the soul acting through the body: Bothexperience (impersonally) the gunas, born of Nature. It is attachment to thegunas which causes men to return (to earth) in good or in evil wombs.22. The Supreme Spirit, manifested in each body as the soul, is the detachedwitness; it is (through man's conscience) the counselor who, though acceptingall, offers guidance, if asked. The soul is the Sustainer, the one whoexperiences (but doesn't react with feelings of either pleasure or pain), theGreat Lord and Supreme Self.23. Whatever his mode of life, one who (by realization) understands therelationship between the Spirit (also, his individual soul) and Nature (and, onan individual level, the body) with its threefold gunas, even though he engagesoutwardly in the activity of this life, need never again undergo rebirth.24. To behold the Self in the self (the purified ego) by the self (the clarifiedmind), some seekers follow the path of meditation, some that of knowledge, andsome the path of selfless activity (service).25. Some men, ignorant of these three paths, heed the instructions of theirguru; accepting what he teaches as their supreme refuge, they approach the truthworshipfully, and thus cross over (the river of) death.26. 0 Best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), whatever is in existence, know it to havebeen born of the union of kshetra (Nature and the body) and kshetragya (Spiritand the soul).27. He sees truly who perceives the Supreme Lord present equally in all beings,the imperishable within the perishing.28. Beholding the Divine Presence everywhere, he no longer harms himself bySelf-ignorance. (Thus,) he attains the Supreme Goal.29. That man sees truly who perceives that all actions are performed by Nature(Prakriti) alone, not by the Self (which is above all action).30. When (the yogi) sees all beings as contained in the One, having expanded hisconsciousness (and sympathy) to include all living beings, he merges intoBrahman.31. 0 Arjuna! The Supreme Self, having no beginning, (no ending,) and noattributes, even though it dwells in a body (as a realized master), neither actsnor is touched by any action.32. As the subtle, all-pervading ether is unaffected (by what moves through it),similarly the Self, though pervading the whole body, is never affected by it.33. 0 Bharata (Arjuna), as the sun illuminates the whole world, so does the Lordof the Field (God and His reflection as the soul) illuminate the whole body (ofNature, and of man).34. They go to the Supreme who perceive with the eye of wisdom the distinctionbetween the kshetra and kshetragya, and understand how beings can becomeliberated from (involvement in) Prakriti.[img0037.jpg]Thus ends the thirteenth chapter, called \"The Field of Battle,\" of the Upanishadof the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjunadiscussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEEN[img0038.jpg]1. The Blessed Lord said: I will declare to you once more that supreme wisdom,higher than any knowledge, in the realization of which all sages have, afterdeath, attained the Final Perfection.2. Those who attain this wisdom and become established in Me are never againreborn, even when creation itself is re-manifested. Nor are they troubled at thetime of Pralaya (cosmic dissolution).3. The great Prakriti is My womb in which I plant the animating seed which givesbirth to all life.4. 0 Son of Kunti (Arjuna), whatever form issues from any womb, its (true) womb(and cosmic source) is Great Prakriti, and I am its seed-implanting Father.5. 0 Mighty-armed (Arjuna)! What binds the imperishable soul to the body are thethree gunas, brought into manifestation by Prakriti.6. 0 Sinless One (Arjuna)! Of these gunas, the pure quality of sattwa bestowshealth and understanding, but (still) causes bondage to the body by making manattached to happiness and (intellectual) knowledge.7. Know (the quality of) rajas as imbued with passion, which activates strongdesires and attachments and binds one to the body by the intense expectations itdevelops in him, through his restlessness.8. 0 Bharata (Arjuna)! Know the (darkening) quality of tamas to produce(spiritual) ignorance, which deludes the mind and makes people lazy, heedless,and excessively attracted to subconscious sleep.9. Sattwa attaches one to happiness; rajas, to activity; and tamas, by stiflingdiscrimination (which gives \"solution-consciousness\"), submerges one indifficulties.10. In some persons, sattwa is predominant, holding rajas and tamas in abeyance;in others, rajas prevails rather than sattwa or tamas; and in still others,tamas obscures both sattwa and rajas.11. When the light of discrimination shines through all of a person's sensegates, it is clear that sattwa predominates in him.12. When a person displays greed, restless activity, and selfish motivation,rajas predominates in his nature.13. When a person's consciousness is dark, lazy, neglectful of duty, andinclined to understand nothing rightly, tamas is his dominant guna.14. A person who, at death, has sattwa predominant in him rises to those highregions where dwell the knowers of truth.15. A person who at death has rajas predominant in him is reborn among thosewith strong egoic attachment to activity. One, however, who at death ispermeated with tamas is reborn in the womb of someone who is steeped in delusion(and in the family, environment, and objective circumstances that promotedelusion).16. It is said (by sages) that the fruits of sattwic action are harmony andpurity (of heart and mind); that those of rajasic action are pain and suffering;and that the fruits of tamasic action are the vari ous manifestations ofspiritual ignorance (dullness of mind, slothfulness, stupidity, and generalhelplessness in confrontation with life's difficulties).17. Wisdom arises from sattwa; lust and avarice, from rajas; and (the darknessof spiritual) ignorance, from tamas.18. Those established in sattwa rise upward; those immersed in rajas remain inthe middle regions; those steeped in tamas sink to the lower spinal centers.19. The seer who perceives no other active agent in the universe but the threegunas (that is, who sees human action as motivated by the gunas rather than byindividual choice), and perceives that (unmoving consciousness) which is higherthan the gunas, enters My being.20. Having transcended the three qualities of Nature, which are the cause ofphysical embodiment, one is released from the suffering (attendant upon) birth,old age, and death, and attains immortality.21. Arjuna said: What signs distinguish one who has transcended the three gunas?What is his behavior? In what ways does he reveal his transcendence?22. The Blessed Lord said: 0 Pandava (Arjuna), he neither dislikes nor longs forany manifestation of the gunas, whether illumination (upliftment), unceasingactivity, or dull ignorance;-23. unconcerned either way, unshaken (by any expression he sees of thequalities), viewing them as active throughout the universe, he remains evercentered calmly in the Self.24. Unaffected (personally) by joy or sorrow, praise or blame, apprais ingequally a clod of earth, a stone, and gold, he doesn't distinguish among others(according to) whether they treat him well or badly.25. Uninfluenced by honor or dishonor, equally (gracious) toward friend and foe,free from any motivation of personal ambition: these signs accompany one who hastranscended the (three) qualities of Nature.26. He who serves Me with undeviating love and devotion transcends the gunas,and is qualified to become (one with) Brahman.27. For I am the basis of everything there is: the Imperishable Brahman, in whomreside the eternal Law and unending Bliss.[img0039.jpg]Thus ends the fourteenth chapter, called \"Transcending the Three Gunas,\"oftheUpanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna andArjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEEN[img0040.jpg]1. The Blessed Lord said: They (the wise) speak of the imperishable Ashvattatree, with its roots above and its branches below. Its leaves are the Vedichymns. Whosoever understands this tree of life knows (the meaning of) the Vedas.2. Its branches extend below and above, nurtured by the gunas. Its buds are thesense objects. Small roots extend also downward into the world of men, impellingman to action.3-4. The true nature of this tree-its beginning, its continuity, its endcannotbe understood by ordinary men. The sage, having felled his Ashvatta tree at itsroots with the axe of non-attachment, thinks, \"I seek refuge only in thePrimeval Purusha, from whom issues all creation (rather than under theprotection of any tree).\" He seeks the Supreme Goal, from which there is no needto return.5. Those reach the eternal goal who crave no human honor; who, having severedthe bonds of attachment, are free from infatuation; who are untouched by thepairs of opposites such as pleasure and pain; and who are established in theSelf within.6. Where shines neither sun nor moon nor the light of fire, there lies My abode;those who reach it pass beyond birth and death.7. An eternal part of Myself, manifesting as a living soul in the world ofhumanity, attracts to itself the six senses, inclusive of mind, all of whichrest in Prakriti.8. When the Lord as the jiva (the individualized soul) takes on a body, he takeswith him (into it) the mind and the senses. When he leaves the body, he takesthem with him and departs even as the breeze wafts scents away from theirdwellings (as in flowers).9. Thus, he still (possesses and) enjoys the senses of sight, hearing, smell,taste, and touch.10. His departure from the body, like his abiding in it, is not perceived by theignorant (who see only the effect of his presence: the body itself). It takesthe eye of wisdom to perceive him (as he is).11. Yogis who strive for liberation see His reality in themselves, but thosewho, even though striving, have not purified (their hearts) and lack discipline,see Him not.12. The light of the sun which illuminates the world, of the moon, and offire-know that their radiance comes (ultimately) from Me.13. Permeating the earth with My effulgence, I support all beings; through thewatery moon, I nourish all plants.14. I am the flame of life in all living creatures. It is I (alone) who manifestas prana and apana, and digest their food.15. From Me, seated in the hearts of all beings, come all memory and knowledge,and also the loss of these. I am the Goal of knowledge in the Vedas. I am alsotheir Author, and He who knows them.16. Two beings (purushas) there are in the cosmos: the destructible and theindestructible. Creatures are the destructible. The Kutastha Chaitanya is theindestructible.17. There exists, however, Another-the supreme Self who, permeating the threeworlds (the causal, astral, and physical planes), is their Sustainer.18. I (the Supreme Lord) am beyond the perishable (Prakriti) and am higher thanthe Imperishable (Kutastha Chaitanya). Therefore, in the (three) worlds and inthe Veda (which reflect perfect, intuitive perception) I am proclaimed asPurushottama, the Uttermost Being.19. Whosoever, freed from delusion, thus knows Me as the Supreme Spirit, knowsall (there is to be known), 0 Descendant of Bharata (Arjuna). He worships Mewith his entire being.20. Herewith, 0 Sinless One (Arjuna), I have taught you this deepest of allwisdom. Comprehending it, one becomes a sage, having successfully fulfilled allhis duties, (even if) he yet continues to perform dutiful actions (in theworld).[img0041.jpg]Thus ends the fifteenth chapter, called \"The Yoga of the Supreme Person,\" of theUpanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna andArjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEEN[img0042.jpg]1. The Blessed Lord said: Fearlessness; purity of heart; perseverance (in theacquisition of wisdom and in the practice of meditation); (sattwic) charity;self-restraint; the performance of holy rites (symbolic self-offering to God andto the devas), service to holy persons, and agnihotra (pouring oblations intothe sacred fire); study of the scriptures; self-discipline;straightforwardness;-2. harmlessness; truthfulness; freedom from anger; renunciation; tranquility;disinclination toward faultfinding; kindness to all; non-covetousness;gentleness; modesty (not calling attention to oneself); steadfastness ofpurpose;-3. radiance of character; forgiveness; fortitude; cleanliness; absence ofmalice; absence of self-conceit: these qualities, 0 Descendant of Bharata(Arjuna), are the endowments of those who are divinely inclined.4. Vainglory, arrogance, self-conceit, wrathfulness, harshness, andignorance-these, 0 Pandava (Arjuna), mark the person whose nature is demonic.5. Divine qualities lead to liberation. Demonic ones lead to (continued andincreasing) bondage. Fear not, however, Arjuna, you are endowed with divinequalities.6. There are two types of men in this world: the divine and the de monic. I havedescribed at length the divine. Now hear Me, 0 Son of Pritha (Arjuna), on (thesubject of) the demonic.7. The demonic do not know the meaning of right action, and do not know when torefrain from acting.8. They say: \"The world is without fundamental morality. There are no abidingtruths. There is no God. There is no system in the universe; it is allaccidental. There is no aim in life, apart from lustful pleasure.\"9. Feeble of intellect, such self-ruined men cling to their (darkened system of)beliefs and commit countless atrocities. They are the enemies of mankind,devoted to its destruction.10. Abandoning themselves to insatiable desires; hypocrites; pretending a noblepurpose; filled with self-conceit; insolent (to anyone who disagrees with them);their concepts (assuming they have any) twisted by delusion; their actionsprompted solely by impure motives;-11. convinced that the fulfillment of physical passion is man's highest goal;confident that there is no world (and no life) but this one: such persons areengrossed until the moment of death in earthly cares and concerns.12. Bound by the fetters of hundreds of selfish hopes and expectations, andenslaved by passion and anger, they strive by unlawful means to amass fortuneswith which to purchase sensual physical pleasures.13. \"This much,\" they say, \"I have acquired today, (putting me in a position to)attain this desire. I have this much money at present; my goal, now, is toacquire more.\"14. (Or they say:) \"(Today) I have slain this enemy. Next, I shall slay more.What I've wanted, I possess. I am successful, powerful, and happy!\"15. (Again they say:) \"I am wealthy and well-born! Who can rival me? I will showmy greatness by giving alms and making public sacrifices. I will rejoice (in myglory)!\" Thus they boast, befuddled by their own lack of wisdom.16. Addled in thought, caught in (a spider's web of) delusion, craving onlysensual \"delights,\" they sink (in life, and even more so after death) to a foulhell.17. Vain, (heedlessly) obstinate, intoxicated by pride in wealth, hypocriticalin whatever sacrifices they perform, careless of scriptural injunctions,-18. egotistical, ruthless, arrogant, lascivious, prone to (fits of) rage, theseevil-intending persons despise Me (though for all that) I dwell in them, as inall beings.19. These cruel perpetrators of evil, filled with hatred, worst of the humanrace, I hurl again and again into demonic wombs on their return to earth.20. Cursed and fallen, filled with delusion life after life, (far from)attaining Me, they sink to the lowest depths.21. Lust, anger, and greed for gain: these are the three pathways to hell,leading to the destruction of soul-happiness. In man's own interests he shouldavoid them all.22. 0 Son of Kunti (Arjuna), by avoiding these three ways down into the realmsof darkness, man acts for his own highest good, and sets himself on the (upward)way to the highest state.23. One who ignores the commands of scripture and follows his own ego-drivendesires finds neither happiness, nor fulfillment, nor the supreme goal of life.24. Take (true) scripture, therefore, as your guide in determining what shouldbe done and what should be avoided. With intuitive understanding of theinjunctions in holy writ, perform your earthly duties.[img0043.jpg]Thus ends the sixteenth chapter, called \"The Nature of the Godly and theDemonic,\" of the Upanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue betweenSri Krishna and Arjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEEN[img0044.jpg]1. Arjuna said: Those who set aside scriptural rules, yet sacrifice (to God)with devotion-what, 0 Krishna, is the status (of their sacrifice)? Is itsattwic, rajasic, or tamasic?2. The Blessed Lord said: (The issue involves) the quality of faithexercised-whether it is in fact sattwic, rajasic, or tamasic. Hear My words onthis point.3. Each one's faith depends upon his nature. As a man is, so is his faith. Ashis faith is, so is the man.4. Sattwic reverence is given to the devas; rajasic reverence is offered to theyakshas and rakshasas; tamasic \"devotion\" is the fascination some people feelfor ghosts and (astral) spirits.5-6. Tamasic devotion also takes the form of trying to show off by theperformance of terrible austerities, unauthorized by the scriptures; byhypocritical displays, ego demonstrations, (the expression of) lustful passionsand attachments, and power madness. Senselessly (those with this kind ofdevotion) torture their body-elements, thereby offending Me, who dwell in theirbodies.7. Even the taste for food is, variously, sattwic, rajasic, or tamasic. So alsothe preferred types ofyagya, or sacrifice, the penances, and the ways ofalmsgiving. Hear these distinctions.8. Foods that promote longevity, vitality, endurance, health, a cheerfulattitude, and a good appetite; that are pleasant-tasting, mildly flavored,nourishing, and agreeable to the body: such foods (give sattwic enjoyment and)are preferred by sattwic people.9. Foods that are bitter, sour, heavily salted, excessively hot, pungent, sharptasting, and burning (give rajasic enjoyment and) are those preferred by peopleof rajasic temperament. Such foods produce pain, discomfort, and disease.10. Foods that are nutritionally worthless, tasteless, putrid, stale, thrownaway as garbage, or (otherwise) impure (give tamasic enjoyment and) arepreferred by tamasic people.11. That yagya (sacrificial rite, or performance of duty) is sattwic which isoffered without any desire for (personal) gain from the deed, which is performedin accordance with (the teaching of) scripture, and with firm belief in itsrightness.12. Yagya performed with the hope of reward, 0 Best of the Bharatas (Arjuna),and in a spirit of ostentation, is rajasic.13. That yagya, finally, is declared tamasic which is not motivated by regardfor scriptural injunctions, makes no (suitable) gifts of food or money, isperformed without the offering of sacred chants or prayers, and is withoutdevotion (to God).14. Veneration of the devas, the priestly, the gurus, and the wise; purity (ofheart and deed); straightforwardness; sexual restraint; harmlessness(non-violence): these are considered the austerities of the body.15. Speech that is pleasant, beneficial, and truthful without being offensive,the repetition of japa and recitation of the scriptures: these are called theausterities of speech.16. Even-mindedness, cheerfulness, kindliness, serenity, self-control, purity ofheart, meditative communion with the true Self-these are said to be theausterities of the mind.17. This threefold austerity (of body, speech, and mind) is sattwic in nature;it is practiced by persevering seekers (blessed with) deep devotion, who desirenot the fruits of their actions.18. Those austerities which are performed for the sake of gaining respect,honor, and a good name-done, therefore, for the sake of show-are mereostentation, fitful and transitory. These are what are called rajasic.19. Tamasic austerities are performed without reasonable purpose(perhaps) forself-injury, or (perhaps) to inflict harm on others.20. (In the matter of gift-giving) to give sattwically is to give without athought of receiving in return; to give because it is right to do so; and togive appropriately, at the proper place and time, and to one who is deserving.21. A gift is deemed rajasic if it is given, perhaps reluctantly (in the thoughtof what one is losing), in the hope of getting something in return.22. A gift is tamasic if it is given inappropriately: at the wrong time orplace, or to an unworthy person, or contemptuously, or with ill will.23. AUM, Tat, Sat: This has been declared as the threefold designation ofBrahman (God). From this power issued, in the beginning, the wise knowers ofBrahman, the (holy) Vedas, and the (Vedic) sacrificial rites.24. Therefore, scripturally sanctioned deeds-sacrifice, the giving of gifts, andthe practice of (the sattwic) austerities-are always (traditionally) begun withthe chanting of AUM.25. Those who seek (spiritual) liberation should perform all the rites of(ego)-sacrifice (true yagya), gift giving (sharing with others whateverblessings are received), and (the sattwic) austerities while concentrated on thehigher Self (the Christ consciousness, or Kutastha Chaitanya in oneself),without any wish for (specific) results.26. The word \"Sat\" is the designation of the Supreme Truth (beyond vibratorycreation) and of the supreme goodness emanating from it. Thus also this wordrefers to every higher form of spiritual action.27. Steadfastness in self-offering (sacrifice) to the Infinite, the austerities,and selfless sharing, and any activity connected with these purposes (for thesake of realizing the Supreme Self), is also spoken of as \"Sat.\"28. 0 Partha (Arjuna)! Whatever sacrifice is offered, gift bestowed, orausterity performed, if (it is done) without devotional faith it is calledasat-\"untruth.\" Both here and in the hereafter, it has no (spiritual) value.[img0045.jpg]Thus ends the seventeenth chapter, called \"The Three Levels of SpiritualPractice, \"ofthe Upanishad of the holy Bhagavad Gita, in the dialogue betweenSri Krishna and Arjuna discussing yoga and the science of God-realization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEEN[img0046.jpg]1. Arjuna said: I desire, 0 Mighty-armed (Krishna), Slayer of (the demon ofignorance) Keshi! to know the true meaning of sannyasa (renunciation), and alsoof tyaga (self-surrender), and the distinction between the two.2. The Blessed Lord said: The wise understand renunciation to be therelinquishing of any action performed with (personal) desire. They also declarethat it is not action itself which should be abandoned, but only that actionwhich desires the fruits of action.3. Some (theoretical) philosophers claim that all work should be forsaken as(being) tainted. Others insist that worthwhile activities (at least), such asyagya (sacrifice), philanthropic works, and (various) austerities should not berelinquished.4. Hear now therefore from Me, 0 Best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), for tyaga(non-attachment to the fruits of action) has been declared, 0 Lion among Men, tobe of three kinds.5. The activity involved in yagya (sacrifice), philanthropic works, and theausterities (listed in 17:14-16) ought certainly to be engaged in, and shouldnot be abandoned, for, when performed with wisdom, (they) purify the heart.6. Even these (self-uplifting) activities, however, ought to be perfor medwithout attachment (either) to them or to their fruits. This, 0 Partha (Arjuna),is My decided and final view.7. It is not (laudable, or) right to abandon dutiful action. To relinquish itwhen one is still in delusion is (in fact) considered tamasic.8. One who gives up a duty because he finds it difficult, or because he fears itwill cause him pain, relinquishes that action with rajasic consciousness(motivated by desire and attachment). He will never attain any reward from suchrenunciation.9. 0 Arjuna, one who renounces in a sattwic way performs dutiful action solelybecause it ought to be done, forsaking both attachment to it and the desire forits fruit.10. One who is wise in his renunciation is ever calm in himself, and is neverdoubtful. He has no aversion to unpleasant actions, nor is he attached topleasant ones.11. It is not possible for an embodied being to abstain from action altogether.Tyaga (self-surrender) is possible, however, by relinquishing the fruits ofaction.12. The fruits of action (for those who are attached to them) are threefold:pleasant, unpleasant, and mixed. They accrue after death (in the astral world,or in the next incarnation) to those who have not renounced them. For theself-surrendered, however, they do not accrue (to oneself).13. 0 Mighty-armed (Arjuna), hear from Me now the five causes of all action andits accomplishment, as chronicled in the supreme, Shankhya wisdom, and the meansof eradicating (the last vestiges of) karma.14-15. The five causes of all action-of right action as well as wrongperformedby man in body, speech, and thought are as follows: (i) the human body itself(as the seat of action); (2) the causative agent of action (the ego, orjivatma); (3) the various instruments of action (senses, mind, and intellect);(4) the various kinds of action (the power of speech and the motor activities ofhands, feet, and rectal and genital organs); and (5) destiny, which is theinfluence exerted by past karmas or actions, and is the \"presiding deity\" of allaction.16. Considering how many factors are influential in human action, anyone,lacking this awareness, who thinks of his ego as the sole doer of everythingaccomplished by him shows no understanding at all.17. He who is above the hypnosis of ego-motivation, and whose understanding isclear (because undistorted by false perception), is not the slayer on thebattlefield (of Kurukshetra), and commits no sin in the slaying.18. Knowing, knower, known: these three together constitute the impulse toaction: doer, awareness of the deed, and the deed itself.19. Awareness of an act, the accomplishment of that act, and the personaccomplishing it are described in the Shankhya system as being of three types,according to the gunas involved. Hear Me now about the manifestations of thesethree types.20. 0 Arjuna, understand that influence to be sattwic in which the oneindestructible Spirit is perceived (as residing) in all beings, (\"undivided inthe divided\") and not as separate in each of them.21. That influence, on the other hand, which is based on seeing the multiplicityof beings as real (in themselves) is, by nature, rajasic.22. That influence is tamasic, finally, which views every effect as though ithad no connection with any other, and which disregards as irrelevant the motive,whether valid or trivial, behind the act.23. That action is sattwic which is divinely inspired, performed with completenon-attachment, without any sense of likes or dislikes, and without any desirefor its fruits.24. Action is rajasic if it is motivated by desires, if it is performed withegoconsciousness, and if it produces a sense of great (stress) and effort.25. Tamasic action is performed heedlessly, without measuring one's ability, andin disregard of the possible consequences, (for example) failure, injury, orsome other disaster to oneself or others.26. That action is called sattwic which is without ego-motivation, which caresnot for either fulfillment or lack of fulfillment, success or failure, and whichis filled with courage and zeal.27. The instrument of action (the individual performing it) is called rajasic ifhe is full of attachment to and longing for its fruits, if he is full of greed,impure motive, and ruthless determination, and if he is jubilant or depressed inthe face of success or failure.28. Tamasic action is vacillating, vulgarly ostentatious, obstinate,unscrupulous, deceitful, (frequently motivated by) malice, lazy, andprocrastinating.29. 0 Winner of Wealth (Dhananjaya: Arjuna), I will now explain, at length andsingly, the threefold divisions of the gunas in their relation to people'scapacity for understanding and to fortitude.30. That intellect, 0 Partha (Arjuna), is sattwic which understands the natureof right action and knows when to refrain from (even right) action; which knowswhat should be done and what should not be done; which understands thedistinction between what ought to be feared (as wrong) and what ought to beembraced fearlessly (as right and dutiful), and between what constitutes bondageand what constitutes the path to liberation.31. 0 Partha (Arjuna), that intellect is influenced by rajas which causes one toperceive dharma and adharma (righteous and unrighteous action) distortedly, asalso (any) dutiful and undutiful action.32. 0 Partha (Ar)una), that intellect is tamasic which, enveloped in ignorance,thinks that wrong is right, and judges everything (not only dharma and adharma)distortedly.33. (In the matter of steadfastness,) sattwic fortitude depends on steadying themind by yoga meditation, and keeping the energy of (both) body and sensescontrolled by pranayama.34. Rajasic fortitude manifests itself in clinging fast-whether to duty, to theobjects of desire, or to possessions-and demanding (for oneself) the fruit ofevery effort one expends.35. Tamasic fortitude, 0 Partha (Arjuna), manifests as addiction to sleep,obsession with whatever one fears, utter absorption in grief, abandonment todespair, and overweening arrogance.36. Now hear from Me, 0 Best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), the three kinds ofhappiness, transcendent above which is Supreme bliss-the consequence ofcontinuous inwardness of mind (through meditation). In bliss (alone) does oneachieve the end of all sorrow.37. That (human happiness) which is called sattwic (is attained through what)seems in the beginning like poison, but in the end is like nectar, and leads tothe clear perception of the Self.38. That happiness is rajasic which arises from contact of the senses with theirobjects. It seems like nectar in the beginning, but in the end is like poison.39. That elusive happiness is termed tamasic which begins and ends in thedeluded stupor of oversleep, drunkenness, and slovenliness.40. There is no one in the material world (or in the material universe), noramong the gods in the astral heavens, who is free from the three qualities, orgunas, born of Prakriti (Cosmic Nature, the manifestation of God).41. 0 Scorcher of Foes (Arjuna)! the duties of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, andVaishyas, as also of Shudras, are (inborn and diverse) according to the gunasuppermost in their natures.42. The inherent duties of a Brahmin (the highest caste) are mind control(concentration), sense control (by the practice of pranayama), self-restraint,purity, forgiveness, integrity, wisdom, meditation to attain Self-realization,and faith in a higher truth.43. The natural duties of a Kshatriya are valor, vigor, fortitude,resourcefulness, skill in action, standing up firmly to the enemy (whatever kindof \"battle\" is involved), munificence, and leadership (of a kind that inspiresothers).44. The duties of a Vaishya by nature are tilling the soil, cattle breeding, andbusiness. Those of a Shudra are service to members of the higher castes.45. Each one attentive to his own duty, men rise toward the highest success.Hear now how, by devotedly pursuing his own duty, one may rise toward that finalend.46. One attains perfection by offering his own special gifts up to Him out ofwhom all beings were manifested, and by Whom the whole (universe) is permeated.47. It is better to fail attempting to follow one's own dharma than to succeedin following the dharma of another. One incurs no sin in trying to fulfill hisown duty.48. 0 Son of Kunti (Arjuna), one should not abandon the work dictated by his ownnature, even though (the work) contain some imperfection, for all undertakings(even the best) are marred by blemishes, even as a flame is (obscured) by smoke.49. That person comes closest to attaining perfection who keeps his intellectnon-attached to everything outside the Self, who reigns in victory over theSelf, and from whom (all) desires have fled.50. 0 Son of Kunti (Arjuna), hear from Me how he who attains such perfectionfinds the culmination (of all seeking in) Brahman.51. Absorbed in complete purity of the intellect, subjugating body and senses byresolute self-restraint, protecing oneself (as much as possible) from noise andfrom other sense-entanglements, relinquishing both attachment and repugnance;-52. abiding in a solitary place, eating lightly, controlling the body, speech,and mind; absorbing oneself in divine yoga meditation; dispassionate;-53. serene; self-surrendered; relinquishing (any lingering) attraction to power,vanity, lust, anger, possessions, and the consciousness of \"me\" and \"mine\": sucha person qualifies to become one with Brahman.54. One attains supreme devotion to Me, and can be absorbed in Brahman, who isalways inwardly calm, who never laments and is without desire, and who beholdsall beings with equal mind.55. By supreme devotion to Me he can quickly realize Me in My true nature: whatand who I am. Knowing these truths, he can unhesitatingly enter into Me.56. Over and above the faithful performance of all one's duties, and takingshelter (completely) in Me, he must still be received by My grace.57. Mentally devote your every action to Me. See Me as your Supreme Goal. Uplifttoward Me every discernment of your intellect. Thus, with love, absorb all yourheart's feelings in Me.58. With heart absorbed in Me, you shall (also) by My grace overcome everyimpediment. If, however, with any (lingering) thought of ego, you do not fullyheed Me (by absorbing My consciousness into yours), you may (even then) bethrown down again to your destruction.59. If, indulging your ego, you should determine, \"I will not fight,\" you wouldhave to fight anyway, obliged to do so by Nature (your own, as well as cosmic).60. 0 Son of Kunti, that (momentary) delusion-the ripened fruit of a pastkarma-which has now made you reluctant to fight will be snatched from you byanother (good) karma, and you will find that you have (no choice but) to fightanyway.61. 0 Arjuna, the Lord is lodged in the hearts of all beings. His cosmicdelusion compels them to revolve as though they'd been mounted on a machine.62. 0 Arjuna, make Him (alone), with all eagerness of heart, your refuge. By Hisgrace you will attain the uttermost peace, and find shelter for all eternity.63. Thus has wisdom, the most secret (and sacred) of all secrets, been given toyou by Me. Reflect on it. Then do as you feel to do.64. Again, hear now My supreme word, the most secret (and sacred) of all.Because you are dearly beloved by Me, I offer it now for your highest benefit.65. Absorb yourself in Me; be wholly devoted to Me; worship and bow to Me alone:So shall you undoubtedly reach Me. This I promise you faithfully, for you aredear to Me.66. Forsaking all other dharmas (duties), remember Me alone. I will free youfrom all sin (even from that of not fulfilling other, lesser duties). Do notgrieve!67. Never share these truths with one who is without self-control or devotion,nor with one who won't share with others in a spirit of service, nor give themto one who is indifferent to them, or who finds fault with Me.68-69. Whosoever will, with supreme devotion, impart this supreme, secretknowledge to My devotees, shall without a doubt come to Me. No one among menperforms a more priceless service to Me. Nor is there in all the world anyonemore dear to Me.70. Whoever studies and (intuitively) understands this sacred dialogue betweenus will worship Me by the sacrifice (self-offering) of wisdom. Such is My holydeclaration.71. Even that person who, full of devotion and without skepticism, merelylistens to this holy discourse, and heeds its teachings, shall become free fromearthly karma and shall be blessed to dwell in the high realm of the virtuous.72. 0 Partha (Arjuna)! Have you received this wisdom with wholly upliftedconsciousness? Has your delusion-born ignorance, 0 Dhananjaya, now beendispelled?73. Arjuna answered: My delusion has been demolished! I have, by Your grace, 0Krishna, regained the memory of my soul. I stand firm now, all my doubts andquestions answered and dissipated. I will act according to Your word.74. Sanjaya said: Thus have I listened to this wondrous discourse betweenVasudeva (Krishna) and high-souled Arjuna. It has caused the hair on my body tostand up (so greatly have I been awe-stricken and thrilled with joy).75. Through the grace of Byasa (the author of the Bhagavad Gita), this supremesecret of yoga has been given to me, imparted directly to my consciousness byKrishna himself, the great Lord of yoga.76. 0 King Dhritarashtra, as I recall over and over again this wonderful, holydialogue between Keshava (Krishna) and Arjuna, I overflow repeatedly with joy.77. And, 0 King Dhritarashtra, as often as I remember the cosmic manifestationof Hari (Krishna, \"Thief of Hearts\"), I am overwhelmed with amazement, and amever and again renewed with joy.78. (Sanjaya concludes:) Such is my faith now that, wherever Krishna ismanifest, and wherever is Partha (the true devotee, Arjuna), expert wielder ofthe bow of self-mastery, there (I know) will be success, victory, the attainmentof (all) power (needed for any accomplishment), and the manifestation of allglory and righteousness. Such is my firmest conviction.[img0047.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHOR[img0048.jpg]Paramhansa Yogananda was the first yoga master of India to permanently live andteach in the West.

Together, these forces havehelped create a spiritual vacuum filled with substantial confusion anduncertainty about the true teachings and meaning of Christ's life.
