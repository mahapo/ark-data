There has been given to humanity a greatgift. It is a spiritual treasure to cherish deep in the heart, and to pass on tochildren for generations. I am speaking of the extraordinary book, Revelationsof Christ: Proclaimed by Paramhansa Yogananda, presented by his disciple, SwamiKriyananda.For longer than any of us can remember, the words and teachings of the greatMaster, Jesus, have been guiding lives upon the earth. Yet those words and thoseteachings have in too many cases been interpreted and understood in ways thatmay have distorted, however inadvertently, their original meaning. Because theMessages of Jesus are so profoundly important, it is essential that they beembraced with only the deepest love for, and loyalty to, God and truth, not anyinstitution or religious tradition. For spiritual truth lies outside ofinstitutions and traditions and can only reside within the fullness of a humanheart that is united with the soul in the purest yearning for the bliss of trulyknowing the Divine.The sadness of some religious institutions and traditions is that, sincerelymotivated though they surely are, often their own inner political maneuveringsand mechanical workings stand in the way of simple, true, and uncompromisedreligious experience and spiritual knowledge. Now this remarkable andmagnificent new book by Swami Kriyananda glides us gently past thosemaneuverings and workings, bringing us to the doorway of a deeper, richerembracing of Eternal Truth. In a text that is at once crystal clear andwonderfully insightful, we are invited to move through that doorway into a placeof gloriously larger views of Jesus and God and of Life Itself than many of ushave ever been blessed to behold.My heart pounded with soft excitement as I turned each new page, and now itsings with praise and gratitude to Swami for this astonishing gift to the soul.I believe with all my being that these are the words of Jesus as they were meantto be relayed and understood. I am humbled to have been touched by this sacredenergy.Without adequate words to express my thanks, I am . . .Neale Donald Walsch"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONHow is one to understand the life and teachings of the great master Jesus, whosetitle “the Christ” meant the “anointed of God”? Tradition offers us twoapproaches: one, the authority of the Church; the other, that of historicalanalysis, which Christian scholars lately have been applying to certain recentlydiscovered texts.There is another approach, less widely known but more reliable than any other:It is to study the writings and sayings of, or better still to live with andstudy under, saints who have communed directly, in deep states of ecstasy, withChrist and God. Such persons are true spiritual masters. They have lived inevery country, and have belonged to every religion and every social level. Theyhave taught the Truth from their own deep realization. When they’ve been free tospeak out, their impact has been widespread and profound. Often, unfortunately,freedom of speech has been denied them; they’ve had to submit to the control ofreligious superiors, who considered their own authority a supreme right bestowedon them by God.All true saints—those, in other words, who have reached the highest spiritualattainments—have endorsed the teachings of Jesus Christ either directly orindirectly, by stating the same truth similarly. Christian saints want tosupport their Church, and usually consider it their duty to sow seeds ofharmony, not of dissension. There have been times in history, on the other hand,when a saint was divinely commissioned to correct one or more serious errors.The difficulty saints have endured under church authority has beendue—understandably, but at the same time unfortunately—to officials who wereadministrators but were rarely, if ever, themselves saints. Such authoritieshave insisted that their approval was needed before anyone—particularly anyoneof merit—could preach spiritual truth. The very fact of any Christians beingalso saints has been perceived, at least during their lifetimes, as a threat toinstitutional authority. For what the authorities want first of all to ascertainis whether some “saintly upstart” is preaching truth or heresy.Saint Francis of Assisi, whose sanctity was certainly due to his own deep lovefor God and to his deep, inner communion with Him, has been acclaimed by theCatholic Church as a true son of the Church, which takes credit for his holinessand attributes it to the saint’s humble obedience to Church authority.Any saint in Christian history who ever spoke, or even hinted at, truths thatweren’t sanctioned by the Church was punished and, in many cases,excommunicated. An example of an excommunicant was Meister Eckhart in Germany,who (fortunately for him) died before notice of his punishment could reach him.Saint Joseph of Cupertino, to whom even crowned heads in Europe came forinspiration and blessings, was orthodox in everything he said and did. Herepeatedly, however, performed the miracle of levitation, an act whichembarrassed his less-than-saintly superiors. After fifteen years of virtualincarceration in an apartment of the Basilica in Assisi, he was carted off inthe dead of night—not once, but repeatedly whenever his whereabouts becamepublicly known—to a succession of small, distant monasteries.A Claretian monk of my acquaintance in Los Angeles, California, developed areputation for bilocation (appearing in more than one place at a time). He wasquietly transferred to a distant house of the same Order in Spain. Catholicsthemselves describe this practice of quiet removal as “sending one to prison.”Therese Neumann, the great Catholic stigmatist in Bavaria, Germany, wasprohibited for a time by her bishop from even seeing people.And Padre Pio, in southern Italy, was also for a time forbidden from performingmass in his capacity of priest. Regarding this saint, an Italian friend of minein Rome once visited him, and, during his confession, stated that he practicedKriya Yoga (a meditation technique brought to the West by my great Guru,Paramhansa Yogananda).“Oh, hush!” the saint warned hastily. “You mustn’t speak of these things.” Thenhe added, “But you are doing the right thing.”There are two major disadvantages to having a church as the supreme authority.The first is that the churches are committed—necessarily so—to giving priorityto their own supremacy as Christ’s representatives. Therefore they cannot beobjective concerning any concept they perceive as a threat to that supremacy.The second disadvantage follows from the first: Church authority, if too firmlyexercised, reduces religious teachings to a faint echo of the divine truths itproclaims. Water cannot flow higher than its source. When religious institutionsappoint themselves as the only source of truth—though in fact, such truths asthey utter can only flow through them—they block that flow. Of course, theynever state that they are that source; all of them claim to be representingChrist’s Truth. Nevertheless, the teachings they promulgate wane in power from amighty waterfall to a gurgle.My purpose in writing this book is to present the teachings of Jesus Christ asthey were proclaimed by one of the great saints and spiritual masters of our owntimes, Paramhansa Yogananda, who was sent by God to the West with the commissionof restoring the teachings of Jesus Christ to their full and original glory.There is another, urgent reason why this book is being written. Christendom hascome under attack not only from theological dilutions, which it has long enduredand has at least succeeded in surviving; and not only from those familiarenemies of religion, the materialistic sciences: but also from a new andseemingly formidable (though in fact spiritually toothless) source. For, sincethe discovery in hidden places of ancient documents, some of which seem to castdoubt on traditional perceptions that have come down from early times, scholarshave been attacking the very foundations of Christianity. Works of fiction have,more recently, attacked with false invention some of the basic deeds andutterances of Jesus Christ, which they have twisted out of all recognition.Only a declaration of certain deep truths in Christ’s original divine teachings,proclaimed once again by a truly enlightened spiritual master, can bring theauthority that is needed in the world today to counter these hornet-swarmsattacking from all sides. Since the saints in Christendom have been debarredfrom freely speaking their own perceptions of the Truth, it is urgentlyimportant for an enlightened spiritual master to come from outside Christendom,and to proclaim once again clearly, forcefully, and unfettered by outsidecontrol, speaking from the highest level of perception, the revelations ofChrist.Within the Catholic Church, loyalty to its authority has always been rewarded.On the other hand, disobedience, disagreement, and disloyalty have been punishedas severely as the times permitted. Praise, preferment, and even promotion, bothin religion and in the world, were frequently the rewards of loyalty. Thereforepeople felt an incentive to demonstrate, with ever-increasing fervor, thefirmness of their loyalty. Jesus Christ gradually became promoted in people’sunderstanding from the status of a great spiritual master to someone higher thananything even imaginable: the Absolute Master, the “only Son of God.”Few dared to contest this claim. Protests even by sincere Christians wereeliminated by the all-powerful Church, and were finally dropped by the writersof Church history. Indeed, it was a foregone conclusion from the start thatdogmatism would eventually win out.Lest anyone think, from what I have written so far, that my own view of JesusChrist is detached and disinterested, let me affirm unequivocally, here at theoutset, that I believe in his divinity with all my heart. I do, however, resistthe concept that he was the only Son of God, and therefore God’s uniqueoffspring. I will clarify what I mean by presenting the teachings on this pointof Paramhansa Yogananda, whose humble disciple I have the honor to be.Many subjects will be covered in this book as we proceed, for the teachings I’mgiving are Paramhansa Yogananda’s, and they address—profoundly andfar-reachingly—every facet of Christ’s teaching."},{"pageContent":" PART ONE: THE BASICS"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 1[../Images/flower.jpg]MAJOR DISADVANTAGESThere is a major disadvantage to keeping spiritual authority confined in ahierarchy of prelates. The disadvantage is that institutional hierarchies arecomposed of human beings, most of whom have at least a few of the flaws commonto mankind, among which must be counted pride, jealousy, personal prejudice,intolerance, vindictiveness, pettiness, and a tendency to be judgmental andunforgiving. Any one of these flaws is enough to obscure a person’s perceptionof higher truths. Claims may be (and of course have been) made that Jesus Christis guiding his Church to preserve it from serious error. The Roman CatholicChurch carries this claim to the extent of insisting that, when the Pope (as theChurch’s top pontiff) speaks “ex cathedra,” he is infallible. Other churches,though lacking historical precedence, insist to varying degrees on their ownauthority in matters of Christian Truth.The greatest problem all the churches face is the simple fact that the majorityof their leaders are only human beings, trapped in ego-centeredness (rather thansouls free in God). They are therefore, and cannot but be, fallible. (Arrogance,I should add in clarification, is only one manifestation of ego-consciousness,which is a fundamental human reality.) What, then, is the ego? It is like asliver of glass shining in the sunlight. It can reflect the “sun” of God, whoseconsciousness is the sole reality in existence, but the ego has no light of itsown. Individuality is a universal illusion. It exists wherever creatures havedeveloped sufficient clarity of awareness to reflect in themselves the light andconsciousness of the infinite Self.All living beings grow outward from a tiny center: from a seed, or from a cellcreated by the union of sperm and ovum. Creatures grow outward from their own,individual centers. Consciousness of separate individuality is developed mosthighly in human beings. Attachment to ego is the root cause of every humandelusion. People’s notions of perfection cannot but, therefore, be limited.High position in a church does not infuse unenlightened, ego-centered humanbeings “out of the blue” with divine or mystical insights. God can of course doanything, but the evidence of history shows that enlightenment comes only toindividuals, and as a result of personal merit. The individual must first seekGod personally, and also be pure in heart. Enlightenment never comes to peoplein batches like college diplomas to a “graduating class.” Neither—it must bestated—can belief in “papal infallibility” be viewed impartially as anything butwishful piety. (This dogma is a relatively new development in the CatholicChurch, having been declared only in 1869 as, one suspects, an act ofdesperation intended to ward off theological challenges from the Protestants.)All too often, what happens is that high position goes to a “superior’s” head.An inflated sense of his own importance draws a thick veil of self-involvementover any ability he might otherwise have had to perceive reality, whethermundane or spiritual, clearly. Hence the saying, “Pride goes before a fall.”How shall perfection be defined? In human beings, the root cause of imperfectionis ego-centeredness; it conditions one’s every perception. In smug self-esteem,and in people’s eagerness to be admired by others, they project personalambition outward, and often assume that institutional promotion raises oneautomatically to exalted personal importance. Promotion, however, doesn’t reallychange anyone inwardly. What happens all too often is that authority begetsarrogance. In church hierarchies, arrogance is followed by ego-boostingattitudes such as self-righteousness, insensitivity, irrational outbursts ofrage, and indignation (self-defined as “righteous”) at the misbehavior andshortcomings of others.Jesus Christ said, “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is inheaven is perfect.” (Matt. 5:48) Translators have not been able to imagine forhuman beings a state of absolute perfection. Often, therefore, they dilute themeaning of that counsel to fit a concept they consider comprehensible andtherefore more universally acceptable. Translations have appeared withtheological dilutions such as, “Be ye therefore good, even as God is good.”The very idea that human nature can be improved suggests, however, that Christwas teaching us to aspire to greater heights in ourselves, and to ever deeperawareness of God’s presence within us. Not all Christians are equally good,obviously. Some are better than others; some are worse; and some manage to bequite a lot worse. All this must be “perfectly” obvious to everyone.A further step in this logical progression, however, is not so obvious, and istoo seldom considered: namely, that goodness depends on inner standards, andabove all on humility and purity of heart. These qualities are determined muchless by outward criteria than by inner attitudes. They bear very littlerelationship, certainly, to a person’s rank or position. “God watches the heart”is a saying that should be kept always in mind. Divine qualities are certainlynot determined by the position one holds in a church. Promotion may come inrecognition of personal virtues, but it is not in itself any assurance of suchvirtue, since superiors, being human, can err, and even if they show wisdom inone choice, that choice will never in any case bestow wisdom.Indeed, promotion may also have unfortunate consequences. If the choice, in achurch hierarchy, lies between a competent administrator and someone who,although saintly, lacks administrative ability, the selection will certainly goto him who is competent. Thus, clerical hierarchies become almost inevitablytop-heavy, in time, with efficient but not particularly saintly administrators.Administrative types are attracted to others of the same mentality: efficient,executive, interested more in how to get things done than in why they need to bedone in the first place. “Birds of a feather flock together.” In religion, theadministrative mentality tends toward efficiency, and may even frown on what itconsiders excessive concern with the lofty spiritual outlook. Administrativetypes always, therefore, favor others for promotion whom they themselvesresemble: people also whom they personally like. If, moreover, a saintlycandidate has all the skills required of a good administrator, and someone elseis available whose nature is more closely akin to those making the appointment,then it won’t matter if this alternate choice lacks saintliness. Indeed, it mayhelp especially for him not to be too saintly. (Who, after all, wants his ownshortcomings exposed?) The “bird of the same feather” will almost certainly getthe job.If what I have stated is true—and everyone knows it is true—then it follows thatdecisions regarding spiritual matters should never be left primarily in thehands of high-ranking prelates. Still less, for that matter—though for adifferent reason—should they be left in the hands of merely intellectualtheologians. Moreover (to conclude my catalogue of spiritual ineptitude), sinceintellectual learning is often a breeding ground for arrogance, such decisionsshould never be made by anyone for whom scholarship is his primary credential.The skill of the intellect at distorting reality is notorious. (That is why wehave the saying, “Even the Devil quotes scripture.”) Indeed, the sharper theintellect, often, the more skillful a person is at distorting truth. As myGuru’s guru Swami Sri Yukteswar put it, “Keen intelligence is two-edged. It maybe used constructively or destructively like a knife, either to cut the boil ofignorance, or to decapitate one’s self. Intelligence is rightly guided onlyafter the mind has acknowledged the inescapability of spiritual law.”Those persons alone are blessed with true spiritual insight who have lived theirlives conscientiously by Truth, and who have done their best (as Christ said) toattain perfection in themselves.According to the highest tradition in Christianity—and the tradition exists aswell, for that matter, in all true religions—there do exist people who haveactually attained the truths proclaimed in the Bible. Most of the same truthsare proclaimed, indeed, in every great scripture. The people to whom I referhave communed inwardly with God; they have themselves become godly. Deep, innerexperience of the Divine has raised them to the realization of God as the onlyreality in existence.For the administrative type, which church hierarchies almost always attract,that divine reality is a distant consideration. Of more immediate and evenoverwhelming concern to them is how to meet their day-to-day exigencies.Thoughts of Eternity are, so to speak, “put on a back burner.” Sacred truths areleft to take care of themselves!In their own sphere of influence, church administrators function well enough.Few of them, however, are able at the same time to keep their hearts’ feelingsfocused on Eternal Truth.The true custodians of religion, in other words, are the saints, who alone canspeak with full spiritual authority. Whatever his outer position, a saint’sinner consciousness dwells on an exalted plane, which alone qualifies him tomake important pronouncements on any deeply spiritual matter. Out of the vastvariety in human nature, the saints form a class by themselves: They alone arethe knowers of God.In this sense it must be added, as a balance to my first criticism, that theRoman Catholic Church, alone among the vast variety of Christian churches, is ina position even today to transmit the true spirit of Jesus Christ. I say thisnot because the Roman Catholic is the oldest church, nor because the Pope is (asCatholics claim) the successor to St. Peter,[1] nor because of that purelyman-made dogma, “papal infallibility,” but because the Catholic Church continuesto uphold this highest spiritual tradition: man’s ability to achieve direct,inner God-communion, and thereby to be supremely blessed and “anointed” by theLord.The Protestant churches on the whole deny this possibility. Even those churcheswhich affirm it reduce its meaning to the lowest common denominator: They claimthat everyone who professes belief in Jesus Christ is a saint already!The Christian churches all insist that human perfectibility cannot in any caseequal the absolute perfection of Jesus Christ. Indeed, they proclaim man’sinherent sinfulness before God. Our destiny as souls, they say, is, after death,to suffer eternally in hellfire owing to the original sin committed by our firstparents, Adam and Eve. Our only chance for redemption is, according to them, toaccept Jesus Christ as our “only personal Savior.”What have the saints had to say on this subject? Do they speak of man’s naturalsinfulness? Do they agree that man cannot possibly do anything to save himself?The saints, it must be pointed out to begin with, have decried the spirituallydampening effect of the concept that no man may hope for perfection. St. Teresaof Avila told her nuns that their duty was to strive to become saints. All thesaints have said that divine grace is for everyone. Paraphrasing them, we maysay that grace is like the sunlight on a building: It can enter only into thoserooms which have their curtains drawn wide apart.Are the saints themselves, then, perfect? This matter will be probed in somedepth later on. The groundwork must be laid first, however, for an understandingof the true meaning of spiritual perfection. Let me emphasize, for now, thissimple fact: A true saint is as far above the goodness that defines theordinarily good Christian as is a skyscraper above the humble hut of a peasant.If one is charitable to all, does good works, and shuns vainglory, he deservesadmiration as a human being. So long as he remains centered in his consciousnessof egoic separateness, however, he should not be considered, in the highestsense of the word, a saint. For in his own eyes it is he himself who expressescharity, goodness, and all his other virtues. A true saint, by contrast, allowsvirtue to flow through him. He never sees himself as its source. Indeed, most,if not all, the virtues may be, and have been many times, expressed fully alsoin the lives of self-declared atheists. Christ’s message is much stricter. Hetold us to transcend ego-consciousness and behold ourselves, simply, asinstruments of God.In striking corroboration of this statement, I remember one time when Yoganandawas praised by someone for his humility. He answered with what might be called a“conversation stopper”: “How can there be humility,” he asked, “when there is noconsciousness of ego?”The criterion of what it means to be a good Christian has been diluted by whatYogananda called “Churchianity.” Nowadays, the usual criterion of a goodChristian is someone who merely believes in Jesus Christ, and accepts him as hisown “personal” Savior. A person may go regularly to church, be a good neighborto others, help the needy, and be kind to all, but does anyone tell him that hemust also be conscious of his inner need to know God? Spiritual half-heartednessis what Jesus Christ meant when he said, “Not every one that saith unto me,Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the willof my Father, which is in heaven.” (Matt. 7:21) In the preceding verse he saidalso, “By their fruits ye shall know them.”Is belief in anything really enough? People once believed that the world isflat: Did mere belief make it so? Science has demonstrated convincingly thatbelief is no guarantee of the truth of anything. Because belief has been madethe criterion of a good Christian, Christianity has been slowly sinking inpopular esteem to the level of a third-rate power.Belief is only the beginning of the search for knowledge. Belief is thehypothesis. It is needed to provide the incentive for verifying one’s hopes andexpectations. After hypothesis there follows the process of testing. Proof,however, comes only after a hypothesis (in this case, a belief) has been fairlytested.What actual proofs does religion offer? The promise the churches offer is themere hope of a happy, carefree life in heaven after death. Is that proof? It isonly a pious expectation, which invites rather the question: How many havereturned from heaven to report that they actually arrived there?Yogananda enjoyed telling a story he’d read in a book about Billy Sunday, theAmerican evangelist. Billy, after death, presented himself at the “PearlyGates.” Knocking loudly, he demanded admittance.Saint Peter appeared, heard Billy’s request, and leafed through the Book ofLife. “I’m sorry,” he announced, “but your name isn’t listed here.”“But that’s impossible!” expostulated Billy Sunday indignantly. “What about allthose people I sent up here?”St. Peter studied the book once more, then replied, “You may have sent them, butnone have arrived.”Religious truths can indeed be tested and proved. The proof consists in theyardstick of experience. If my statement seems simplistic, please reflect amoment: What does it mean, to test a spiritual truth? It means to excluderigidly from one’s life every vestige of ego-motivation. It means, in time, torealize that God alone IS, and that He alone DOES everything. Anyone who makesthis attempt seriously will soon discover in his seeking that the challenge hefaces demands of him, in fact, a spirit of heroism!Objective proof of the truth of Christ’s teachings lies in the impersonal lovemanifested by those of every religion who have transcended ego-awareness andhave, consequently, learned to love all beings equally. Such persons seeknothing in return, and consider it no sacrifice to retain nothing forthemselves. The definition of impersonal love is a love that is purelyself-giving, that wants nothing for one’s self, and that doesn’t hold ontoanything with attachment.The alternative way of seeking proof, and the proof that is usually proposed, isthrough the syllogisms of logic: the analytical, scholarly method. Truth,however, is not up for election. The modern mind, educated as people are totrust the proofs of material science, inclines to view rational scholarship asmore objective, and therefore as more valid, than dogmatism. A great fuss,indeed, has been made in recent decades over lately discovered manuscripts thatdate back to early Christian times. Scholars claim that those documents providefresh insight into the teachings of Jesus Christ and the origins ofChristianity. They have actually announced, on the basis of some of thosedocuments, that Jesus did not die on the cross, but survived his crucifixion andwent on to marry Mary Magdalene, the two of them producing a “bloodline” whichcontinues to this day.Jesus Christ himself, it must be noted, is quoted in the Bible as declaring,“There be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom ofheaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.” (Matt. 19:12)By these words, as well as by the well-known example of his life, Jesus made itclear that he was himself celibate. (Yogananda emphasized that Jesus did notmean, in this passage, that one should castrate himself “for the kingdom ofheaven’s sake.” “It would deprive you,” he told his monk disciples, “of theenergy you need to find God.”)Once the authority of the Gospels is challenged on such fundamental points asthese, Christianity itself might as well be thrown onto the rubbish heap—or elsethe Holy Bible preserved in a museum display case of encrusted antiquities,gathering dust. In this case, the religion of our forefathers could not butcease to offer perfection as an ideal to which all can aspire despite what Jesussaid, and would deserve rather to be tossed aside as bereft of any divinemessage. For Christ’s message must then be considered as containing nothing butpious platitudes.Human nature tends to seek the “easy way out.” Faced with Jesus Christ’sdoctrine to “Love thy neighbor,” one might find comfort in believing that he isstill perfectly free to hate his neighbor’s neighbor with frigid fury. Again,faced with the two clear-cut alternatives: heaven or hell after death, he mightthink, “Well, how could God, being good, condemn me to eternal hell for being—ifnot perfect, at least moderately good?” Gradually, in pursuing this line ofreasoning, he might well end up asking himself (as, in fact, many do), “Just howbad can I be and get away with it?”It has become usual for Christians, in their awareness of claims made by certain“new Christian” scholars that Jesus Christ was “only human,” to conclude that itis still possible to be a good Christian and have no spiritual aspirations atall. Alternatively—and this has been claimed also—it would be quite all rightsimply to dispense with Christianity and “all that religious stuff” altogether,and simply be a normal, decent, well-intentioned human being. And what ifself-interest remains a life priority? Well, can’t that be said of almosteveryone anyway? (And can so many people be wrong? This usual “take” on thatpoint is opposed, however, by the voice of experience, which has repeatedlyshown the truth of another statement: “The majority is always wrong; theminority has at least a possibility of being right.”)I once asked my Guru about someone who was good, kind, honest, and truthful, butwho had no interest in seeking God. His reply was surprising: “The road to Hadesis paved with good intentions.”The danger of intellectual scholars to religion is not merely theoretical.Surveys of present-day Christians show that a high percentage of them feelshaken in their faith by scholarly claims that challenge the very authenticityof the Gospels. Not a few such claims have been aired, without properauthentication, in works of pure fiction. Others have been made by scholars who,though serious, demonstrate a lamentable absence of spiritual insight. In bothcases, the claims to authenticity are based on the supposed antiquity of theirsources, supported by a skillful misuse of reasoning.Man’s highest faculty is not his intellect. All human beings possess the power,at least latently, of deeper, extrasensory perception. A person might know,quite unaccountably (when foreknowledge seems impossible), that something isgoing to take place, and it does. Or he may know exactly how to respondfittingly to some unprecedented threat to his person or to his financialsecurity. Again, he may be unaccountably aware of something that will happen insomeone else’s life, and not even be surprised, later, when it occurs. Or againhe may, without even a shred of evidence, see behind a person’s façade ofrespectability and recognize in him certain hidden, dishonest intentions.I offer these examples as commonplace. Such insights are like rents in the veilwhich separates the majority of people from one another, and fromsubtler-than-material realities. Yogananda defined intuition, ultimately, as“the soul’s power of knowing God.”Consciousness manifests on three levels: subconscious, conscious, andsuperconscious. Subconsciousness, the first level, depends on externalinfluences to which it reacts instinctively. It is on this level that the loweranimals function.“Man,” according to a classical definition, “is a rational animal.” Yet man is,in fact, neither entirely rational nor entirely an animal. That definition is amarvel of clarity in the sense that it serves whoever uses it as a premise forpursuing numerous lines of reasoning. It doesn’t take into consideration,however, man’s irrational moods, his unpredictable whims, his deep-seatedprejudices. It gives no recognition, moreover, to the human capacity fordeveloping spiritual insight, and for rising above his animal nature altogether.The conscious mind functions through the intellect. It compares things, thenanalyzes the comparison in order to achieve a more complete understanding.Usually, understanding that is arrived at by the intellect depends on theperceptions of the senses. This dependence renders the intellect, where highertruth is concerned, more or less incompetent.Superconsciousness is, universally, the highest level of cognition. At thislevel, man transcends his self-limiting human nature and becomes a child of God,free forever in his soul.One benefit that man has derived from modern science is the realization,intellectually at least, that reality is not confined to what the five sensesperceive. Indeed, matter is now known not to have any substance at all: it is aproduct of innumerable vibrations of energy. Science has greatly expanded ourphysical and mental horizons, too, with its probes into the vastness of spaceand into the intricacies of the microcosmic world.One result of that expansion has been the speed of travel to very distantplaces. One can even observe scenes now from around the world, flashinginstantaneously on his television screen. Almost everyone nowadays is aware ofcultures and countries distant and very different from his own. All of us knowthat the people who live in far-off countries are not essentially different fromourselves or from our near neighbors.We are also becoming ever more aware that many teachings of other religions arevery similar to, and even identical in meaning with, our own. Christiantheologians, most of whom still cling determinedly to the dogma that JesusChrist was superior to all others, try constantly to draw their readers’attention to any dissimilarities they can ferret out between Christianity andother religions. The differences, however, are all fairly superficial. Yoganandadescribed the hidden motivation behind such scholarly attempts as “mischievous,”for they misrepresent what the scholars are determined to view as the“opposition.” Where such issues don’t arise, it is notably true that humanbeings everywhere have basically the same needs: food, clothing, shelter, aswell as the same basic emotional needs: love, kindness, emotional security,happiness.People everywhere in the world have also (rooted most deeply of all) a spiritualdimension, which the great religions address more or less identically. No truereligion has ever taught people to hate, or to tell lies, or to inflict pain andharm on others. All of them urge people to behave in ways that will expand theirego-identity by including the realities of others. Every religion insists,moreover, on the need for all men to love unselfishly, and to develop thevirtues of truthfulness, kindness, compassion, forgiveness, and all the rest. Noreligion, moreover, recommends the creed of materialists the world over:“Me-firstism.”Nowadays, with increasing awareness that there may actually be a spiritualdimension in human life, it would surely show meanness of spirit to deprecateothers’ efforts to rise spiritually, each according to his own capacity andbeliefs. Any teaching that raises human consciousness—for example, by kindnessand unselfish love—can only be good. Why then, in the zeal to convert him, harpon how wrong he is, or on how much he lacks a true teaching? Sympatheticinterest in ways that are different from one’s own is becoming increasinglywidespread these days. People want to know how others eat, how they dress, howthey define gracious living. Given this natural and increasingly universalinterest, is it not right for people also to be interested in what others think,in how they define happiness, and in how they approach God?Dr. Radhakrishnan, who, when I visited him, was the vice president of India (helater became India’s president), said to me, “A nation is known by those personswhom its people look up to as great.” By that criterion, India is, and hasearned the right to be, known as the most spiritual country on earth. For peopleelsewhere mostly define greatness by political, literary, or—God helpus!—“sports hero” and “movie star” criteria. India’s principal standard, bycontrast, has always been its spiritual giants: its saints.I was once asked by a Christian missionary in India, “What do you mean when youuse the word, ‘saint’?”“My reference,” I replied, “is to the Sanskrit word, sant, from which our word‘saint’ is derived.” (Thus did I nip in the bud a blossoming theologicalchallenge!)The great figures in India’s past have always been men and women ofSelf-realization. Emperors, warriors, political leaders and other worldlyfigures in history, though admired and respected, have always been given asecondary status. Wisdom, moreover, has not been confused in India withscholarship or with intellectual brilliance. True wisdom is determined by aperson’s inner experience of God and by his consequent understanding of the truemeaning of life. The great masters of that country have seldom been theologiansor philosophers: men addicted to learning, in other words, each with his owncarefully pondered theory on Meaning. Superconscious realization has given thewise of India keen intellects, but what most distinguishes them is their mentalclarity. They live the high truths they preach. Superconscious experience hasgiven them a uniform perception of what is and is not real. Their deep insights,based on direct experience, could never have come to people who had merely keenintellects.Declarations by the great masters in all religions, though not always coincidingexactly, have shown a remarkable unanimity with respect to the highest truths.Any differences, in other words, between the statements of a Self-realized saintin one religion and those of another saint in some other religion are due simplyto differences of culture and environment and to people’s temporal needs.So great, on the other hand, is their agreement concerning spiritual truths thatwhen Christian missionaries first came to India, and encountered there a quiteunanticipated corroboration of Christ’s teachings in the teachings of Krishna inthe Bhagavad Gita (India’s favorite scripture), they decided that Krishna’steachings must have been borrowed from Jesus Christ. According to indigenoustradition in India, however, the “Gita” (as people fondly call it) is mucholder.When you really get down to it, the only essential difference betweenChristianity and, let us say, Buddhism lies in the names of their founders. Thedifferences in teaching can easily be explained by the different culturalexigencies encountered by those two great masters. Without what is claimed asthe “uniquely saving grace” of their own masters, the teachings themselves arebasically the same.The following pages will offer Christian truths (eternal and universal) from anew point of view. This book will be completely orthodox in its adherence toChristianity, but its orthodoxy will not always correspond to what is taught byChristian sects. It will not always conform, in other words, to “Churchianity.”I submit this humble effort, as I stated in the Introduction, in the hope ofhelping to reinstate Christianity on its fully deserved plateau as a foremostamong the great religions of the world (though not as the only great religion).I am writing in the sincere conviction that what I have to say, which I learnedfrom my Guru, Paramhansa Yogananda, is universally true. For truth is one andeternal. This book is a humble offering to you, the reader, of explanationsgiven by Paramhansa Yogananda, who opened the teachings of Jesus Christ to theworld. I write in the conviction that, though it may always be possible toimagine new facts, one can never create a new truth. Truth does, however, assumeever-new expressions, like the leaves of a tree which are generically all thesame, though every leaf is unique and different from all its fellows. Even so,differing expressions of the timeless truth are only outer sheaths for the oneand only, changeless and eternal Truth, which pervades the whole universe.[1] This claim determinedly overlooks the numerous gaps in that line ofsuccession, which have occurred in consequence of papal rivalries. Severalpopes, moreover, have been notorious for their moral and spiritual laxity, byexpressing which they have dishonored their holy tradition."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2[../Images/flower.jpg]A NAME FOR TRUTHSanaatan Dharma is a Sanskrit term meaning, “The Eternal Religion.” SanaatanDharma has for long ages been the accepted name in India for the universalTruth: God, Creator and Sustainer of the universe, every atom of which, being aconscious projection, is destined eventually to merge back consciously into theSupreme Spirit.“Hinduism,” the popular name for India’s ancient religion, was imposed on thatcountry, by foreigners, in relatively recent times. “Hinduism” is actually amisnomer. For one thing, Sanaatan Dharma belongs not only to India, for it isthe eternal Truth, which underlies all manifested existence. The religion itproclaims is universal, and must be considered to be as essential for a planetin some distant galaxy as for our own Earth. Sanaatan Dharma is basic to everytrue religion of man.It should therefore be understood that Divine Truth has nothing to do withseparative or sectarian beliefs. Sanaatan Dharma is not a man-made religion. Itexplains, rather, how God brought all things into manifestation, and how everysoul, each one a “Prodigal Son,” can return and merge back into Him.Sanaatan Dharma is not in itself a revelation, for it has to be expressedverbally, and words can be misleading. Rather, the Eternal Religion is the fruitof revelation, for it shows people how to achieve for themselves the innerrevelation of the highest truth. The fundamental truths of Sanaatan Dharma canbe perceived by everyone who has the willingness to offer himself up completelyto God, in deep humility and devotion.Sanaatan Dharma concerns, then, that divine revelation which all true saintshave described: Infinite Light, Sound, Love, Bliss, Power, Calmness, and Wisdom.They have described it also as St. Paul did when he spoke of “the peace of God,which passeth all understanding.” (Phil. 4:7)When St. Teresa of Avila announced once to her priestly confessor that she’d hada vision of “the formless Christ,” the priest, who until then had been herstaunchest defender, began to doubt her. His faith, however, in her deepspirituality impelled him to research the matter, and he was led at last todiscover, in the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, a surprising truth: Visions ofChrist without form, he learned, are indeed higher than any vision with form.Paramhansa Yogananda often cited this story. What can St. Teresa of Avila, andlater on Yogananda, have meant when they spoke of “the formless Christ”?If we think of the material universe as comprising the vast number of galaxiesscience claims—some one hundred billion of them!—the question must arise in theminds of even the most devoutly orthodox Christian: “How can God be like thepopular image of an old man with a long, white beard?” Another question followsnaturally: “How can Jesus Christ himself really have been God’s only Son?”Surely those concepts can be viewed only as quaint archaicisms. No form, howevervast, could have projected the universe as we now know it to be.Of course, no anthropomorphic God could have projected a universe even the sizepeople thought it was when Jesus was alive. The earth they knew then wasrelatively tiny, but even at that it was also infinitely complex, with countlessflora and fauna; with populous nations; with a relatively vast territory; withinnumerable, unexplained stars in the heavens; with shifting seasons, winds, andclimates in constant flux and repetition; and with the changing but constantlyrepeating positions of the constellations. The list might be stretched outindefinitely. Enough variety has been suggested here already, however, to showthat the reality behind everything could not possibly be some individual brain,however divine. It would have to be, if anything, a formless consciousness.I remember when I crossed the Atlantic Ocean with my family by ship, a thing wedid nine times during my childhood, back and forth between Europe and America.My father must surely have explained to me the phenomenon I observed, though Idon’t recall whether it was before or after my observation. (I assume it wasbefore.) I do clearly remember noting, however, that other ships, as theyapproached us from a distance, didn’t begin as tiny dots on the horizon thatgrew in size gradually on drawing nearer. What first appeared was the tips oftheir masts, which slowly rose out of the ocean instead of merely increasingslowly in size. Next, the whole ship rose out of the water until it became fullyvisible. The explanation for that almost abrupt appearance was, of course, thecurvature of the earth. I can only believe that this phenomenon cannot but havebeen observed thousands of times before me, and long before people realized thatthe earth is round. Why didn’t the people in the days of Jesus Christ, and forcenturies thereafter, ask themselves the reason for this sudden manifestation?The waxing and waning moon is something every human being with eyes to see hasobserved for thousands of years. How is it that no one, until recent times,related it to reflected light from the sun? Today, the solution seems to usobvious.Why didn’t anybody give reasonable thought to why the sun rises through theseasons at different points on the horizon—always repeating the same directionsof change, and always in the same sequence throughout the year? After all,brilliant men lived in those days. We today have no monopoly on intellectualacumen.I’ll discuss in a later chapter the strange fact that a veil of varying opacityseems to obscure even brilliant minds. Could it be that man simply wasn’t readyto perceive certain realities which, to us nowadays, seem so obvious? People forcountless centuries were also aware of the mold that appeared on bread, but itwasn’t until the 1920s that penicillin was discovered in that mold, and only inthe 1940s did its use become widespread.The same may be said of countless other discoveries: the facts may have staredall humanity in the face, yet man wasn’t ready to understand them, and perhapswasn’t even ready to observe them. Were people not sufficiently developedintellectually in those times to ask the right questions? Or did they make newdiscoveries simply because the facts themselves had piled up high enough to benoticeable, thereby making the questions inevitable?Whatever the case, another interesting phenomenon obtrudes itself also: Manyscientific discoveries have been made simultaneously by two or more people,sometimes at a distance from one another. I have read (though other researchI’ve done suggests otherwise) that if Charles Darwin had waited one week beforeannouncing his On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, AlfredRussel Wallace would have published a similar theory before him. From areligious point of view, Darwin’s “win by a nose” was perhaps unfortunate, forWallace’s outlook was more spiritual; he also believed in things less purelymaterial: for example, in psychic phenomena.Lobachevsky and Bolyai, in Russia and in Hungary respectively, discoveredspherical geometry simultaneously, and were ridiculed for a time as crazy, afterthey first announced their finding.One is at least free to suspect that inspiration either passes from brain tobrain, or is perhaps dropped by divine, and possibly angelic, beings into mindsthat are prepared and receptive.As I said, I’ll pursue later the curious phenomenon of man’s varying levels ofunderstanding during different historic eras. It is fascinating to think thatability may advance and decline cyclically, almost like the seasons, though indifferent rhythms. For now, however, my theme must be limited to the fact thatit is only recently—indeed, in my own lifetime—that people have come to knowenough to realize how vast the material universe is, and therefore to understandhow utterly impossible it would be for any anthropomorphic being to have createdit.We’ll have, as we proceed, to discuss how God could have created anything atall. In doing so, we’ll confront the fundamental scientific dogma of our owntimes, namely, that consciousness springs only from brain activity, which is tosay that nothing is really conscious, and inert matter is the bedrock reality ofeverything.Let us consider that last question first: Is consciousness really something eachof us “produces” by what scientists describe as a “movement of electrons througha circuit of nerves”?Some aspects of awareness in human nature, it must be admitted, are universallytrue and therefore cannot be individually created. A happy baby has no need tolearn how to smile. When it is distressed, moreover, it knows perfectly well, onits own, how to cry. These are very simple examples, but they show that at leastcertain tendencies in human nature are innate. Even dogs seem to be smiling whenthey wag their tails happily, and manage to look ferocious when they are angry.Any child, surely, knows that when a dog is wagging its tail it is beingfriendly.Many comparisons might be submitted to show how states of consciousness expressthemselves uniformly everywhere. When a person feels some positive emotion suchas happiness, he experiences a corresponding rise of feeling in the body and inthe spine, accompanied by outward signs of that upliftment: he sits up straight,looks naturally upward, and curves the corners of his mouth upward in a smile.When, on the other hand, a person feels a negative emotion such as unhappiness,he experiences a correspondingly lowered feeling in the body and the spine.Accompanying that “sinking feeling” is a tendency to slump forward, to lookdown, to let the shoulders sag—even to walk heavily.Human bodies all have basically the same features and attributes. Tastes in themouth are, it is fairly safe to say, more or less the same in all bodies.Sourness puckers the lips of everyone. And sweetness is all-but-universallypleasurable.“Man,” Jean Paul Sartre declared, “is radically free.” His declaration forcesthe question: Free from what? All human beings are born “equipped” with the samenervous system. They respond in ways that are basically uniform. The same thingssoothe or irritate their nerves.It has been scientifically demonstrated that electric wires react to stimuli inways very similar to stimulation of the nerves. In Out of the Labyrinth, a bookI wrote many years ago, I showed that even morality is rooted in certainuniversal realities of human nature. Why, for instance, are the words of JesusChrist, quoted by St. Paul in Acts, universally true? “Remember,” Paul wrote,“the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than toreceive.” (Acts 20:35)Is this statement founded in actual human experience, or is it simply a matterof blind belief? Experience shows, in fact, that the statement is universallytrue. One does indeed feel “blessed”—in other words, happy, and perhaps evenblissful—when his consciousness and feelings expand to include others in hisreality. On the other hand, when one excludes others from that reality, hisfeelings withdraw into himself, and his sensitivity to objective realityshrinks.The issue of consciousness is not itself limited merely to that abstraction,“consciousness.” It includes one’s feelings also. Indeed, our feelings are moreimportant to most of us than is our ability to reason. It is stated thatcomputers will someday be sophisticated enough to be conscious. The humbleearthworm, however, is as simple a creature as can easily be observed, and theearthworm is obviously conscious. It is also self-conscious: If pricked, ittries to squirm away. Feeling, on the other hand, is intimately connected withthe sense of self, whereas rational progressions are more or less mechanical,and can be performed by mere computers.Consciousness, obviously, is not in any case a product of brain activity. Itprecedes the ability to think and reason. Allied to consciousness are two thingswhich transcend even the ability to reason: feeling, and self-awareness.Sanaatan Dharma declares that the essence of the Supreme Spirit isSatchidananda: Ever-existing, Ever-conscious, Ever-new Bliss, as ParamhansaYogananda translated the term. When the question was posed in that ancientteaching, “Why did God create the universe?” the answer given was, “He createdit in order to enjoy Himself through many.”What is the essence of that enjoyment—of bliss? It is calm, limitless, unmovingyet ever-thrilling enjoyment of the essence of one’s own Being, ever-changingyet essentially changeless, ever-new yet eternally unaffected, Self-existent,uncaused, the Supreme Source of everything manifested, Absolute Perfection, afulfillment of perfect “enjoyment beyond imagination of expectancy.”[2] PureBliss is the fulfillment of selfless Love for the Infinite Self. God created theuniverse not merely out of His own consciousness, but out of His perfect lovefor the manifestations of Infinite Bliss in all beings.These are thoughts which science would never dare even to contemplate. Theyreveal the deep need of human beings for more than “Just the facts, please.” Weall need religion, if only because it stresses love above the countlessscattered bits and pieces of merely intellectual knowledge.Why should we ever imagine that anyone else is radically different fromourselves? The same desire for love, leading to perfect bliss, is inherent inevery human being. It could not be otherwise, for we all emerged, like theProdigal Son, at the beginning of our roaming in foreign lands far from theconsciousness of that one Bliss-God. How did God create us? That importantquestion will be addressed in a later chapter, but what He did essentially wasproject us from Infinite Consciousness as His superconscious “dream.”Jesus Christ was sent to earth to proclaim the Heavenly Father’s love for usall, and to awaken love for Him in our hearts. Science has shown us, however, auniverse too vast to have been created by any human Father figure. Science’sview too, for all that, is limited. Whatever, or Whoever, brought everythinginto existence created also human beings with human feelings, and withindividual appreciation for parental love, filial love, romantic and friendlylove. If that Infinite One is omniscient, then He certainly knows our innermostfeelings, no matter how often science, with its dry, factual outlook on reality,scoffs at the idea of a Being infinitely superior to the scientists themselves,far beyond their intellectual games, lambent with tenderest feelings of love forus all, unceasingly forgiving, and awaiting only our love in return to bring usback to Himself.A scientist once said to Paramhansa Yogananda, “The universe is nothing but anaggregate of protons and electrons.”“Granted,” that great sage responded. “Those protons and electrons are what wemight call the building blocks of creation. But if you dumped a pile of bricksonto an open field, would they form themselves into a building? Don’t you see?It takes intelligent design to build buildings with whatever materials are athand. And it takes Cosmic Intelligence to form the vast universe, with itsinfinite complexity at every level of manifestation.”How much more wonderful, this view of a universe vibrant with compassion andwith Cosmic Love, rooted in Infinite Bliss. Yes, of course there is pain andsuffering also for us, “Prodigal Sons” all. It is because in some way or anotherwe have flouted the perfect harmony of our own being. Man’s first reaction tosuffering is often to harden his heart against pain by telling himself, forexample, “I’ll never love again.” Bitterness may ensue; it is a distortion,merely, of essential feeling. Or else one may try simply to deaden his abilityto feel any emotion, in which case he becomes hardly more than a living corpse.For what is consciousness itself, without feeling? It can produce no more thanmechanisms. Such people were described by Jesus when he said—well, let me repeatthe story:“And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go andbury my father.“But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.” (Matt.8:21,22)How much more perceptive is that prodigal wanderer who says to himself, “What Itried didn’t work. Let me now try some other way.” Constantly seeking a positivesolution, he comes at last to realize that, after every disappointment, he haswithdrawn into himself to “regroup.” And the thought comes to him at last:“Maybe my answer lies, not ‘out there,’ but in myself!” He returns at last,then, to his “Father’s house,” and rejoices finally in his Father’s love andeternal welcome.Yes, of course there is more to life than an endless, dry desert, barren of anylife, of any love because all the plants have been pulled up out of the ground,dissected, and set aside for further analysis.“Intelligent design” has become a hot issue nowadays in the schools. I think theproblem may lie with how the term itself is defined. Surely it ought not even tobe a matter for debate whether the universe manifests conscious intelligence.The very fact that it takes considerable human intelligence even to demonstratethat the universe has no intelligence must itself be considered the undoing ofthat whole argument!A woman informed me somewhat proudly the other day, “Women are more intelligentthan men.” She wouldn’t hear any further discussion on the matter, so I washappy to leave the subject as she’d stated it. In this book, however, since I’min control, I can say what I would have liked to tell her: “It all depends onhow you define intelligence!” A long life has convinced me that women areindeed, in certain respects, more intelligent than men, and that men, in otherrespects, are more intelligent than women. Both types of intelligence areneeded. Only thus can mankind form a more complete picture of reality.A man and a woman may be walking down the street. The woman says, “What did youthink of those shoes?”The man answers, “What shoes?”“On the lower shelf of that window we just passed,” replies the woman, “to theleft, toward the front.”“What window?” the man asks.We need particulars; we also need abstractions. We need those things andconcepts which appeal to our feelings; we also need to understand the what andthe why of things. We need both feeling and reason, in other words. We needenjoyment as well as understanding. Both are necessary. As Yogananda said,“Feeling must be kept in a state of reason; otherwise it becomes fanatical.”Either aspect of our nature without the other would leave us incomplete.The question of “intelligent design” can be settled quite simply by deciding,first, what we mean by “intelligent.” George Gaylord Simpson, the eminentbiologist, when discussing intelligent evolution according to his own definitionof the term, considered anomalies of design in certain creatures as faulty froman engineering standpoint, and wrote (this is a paraphrase), “Would it not beimpious to impute such fumbling to the Creator?” Well, the answer is that hisdefinition of “intelligent design” is altogether simplistic. (So also, for thatmatter, are the typical explanations advanced by many religious“fundamentalists.”)Let us assume something that human arrogance usually rejects out of hand: anintelligence infinitely wiser than man’s. God is both infinite andinfinitesimal. The fact that omniscience can embrace the vast universe in no wayprecludes it from embracing also every individual atom. And if omniscience canembrace the atom, why not embrace also the feelings of—well, if feelings can’tbe visualized as existing on an atomic level, then at least the feelings ofhuman beings?Why is it so difficult to believe that God, in His love for mankind, shouldincarnate among men as a man, himself? Jesus Christ himself described his innerconsciousness as infinite. He said, “Where two or three are gathered together inmy name, there am I in the midst of them.” (Matt. 18:20) He didn’t say he’d getto all of them in time. He said, “There am I.” Christians “sell short” the veryman they think of and pray to as their Savior. Jesus was, and is, the Christ.These are, I grant you, deep waters. We’ll explore them further as we proceed.For now, let me present Yogananda’s explanation: Jesus was not only a man: hewas also God. And, as God, he dwells forever in the hearts of all men.Another question raises its serpent hood, ready to inject us with the mentalpoison of doubt if we neglect to address it honestly. The question becomes morepressing, the farther back in time science pushes history: Did God really waitall those millennia before deciding to bring to mankind His supreme revelationthrough the teachings of Jesus Christ? If so, how can anyone fail to ask, Was itquite fair of God? For in this case, countless generations passed before mancould be given “a true teaching” on how to reach heaven (which Jesus, as weshall see later, equated with God). Is this a true dogma? If so, doesn’t thedogma contradict any claim of divine compassion?Christ’s revelation was, above everything else, that God loves each one of us,His children. If God really does love us, why did He wait so long to tell us so?For it is now evident that human history didn’t begin a few centuries, merely,before the Christian era. Archaeologists have pushed human history back many,many thousands of years. Indeed, a discovery was made in the twentieth centuryof the imprint of a sandal in sandstone, dating back—one assumes—millions ofyears. Another astonishing discovery was a nail found not long ago in America,embedded in a block of coal. That block was formed many millions of years ago;yet within it was a man-made nail. Is all this, as certain fundamentalistChristians would have us believe, merely the “work of Satan” to confuse us?Surely, if we want to achieve any insight into God’s ways, we must at least tryto use what intelligence He has given us!Many Christians convince themselves that when the members of other religionsexpress devotion to God, or when they speak of God’s love for man, they expresssentiments quite different from those felt by devout Christians. “Pagans,” weare told, cannot experience “Christian love.” Well, do they think love for Kalior Krishna has in some way to be different from “true” Christian devotion toMary or Jesus?After Yogananda’s visit to Therese Neumann (the story is presented inAutobiography of a Yogi) he described having beheld also, through her eyes, thevision she received of the Passion of Christ. An article in a Catholic magazine,which appeared several years later, sneered, “As if a Hindu yogi could have atrue Catholic vision!”The truth is that even the bodily experiences aroused by deep yoga practice—ascience related to universal human realities, discovered in India millenniaago—correspond exactly to human nature everywhere. The upliftment ofconsciousness in the deeply meditating yogi is exactly the same as the ecstasiesof St. Francis of Assisi and St. Teresa of Avila. Sincere truth seekers in everyage have loved and communed with God. It simply cannot be that Jesus Christbrought a completely new and unique revelation to mankind. Had he done so,indeed, his very teaching ought to be suspect. For Truth is Sanaatan: Eternal.Christian theologians notoriously rush in with the caveat that “Christian grace”is somehow special and quite different from anything “pagan,” which, accordingto them, is merely physical and not the result of divine grace. “Mischievous” isthe word Yogananda used to describe such attempts to denigrate other religions.As scientists in Germany, America, China, and India work with universal materialrealities, which never change from country to country, and would not change evenfrom planet to planet, the Truth also, taught by Jesus Christ, Krishna, andBuddha, is universal and should be heard and studied everywhere with equal trustand confidence. It is a travesty to treat forms of truth that seem differentfrom one’s own like shop merchandise which a salesman, eager to secure a sale,compares with other products to their disadvantage.Perceptive is he who, when considering a new spiritual teaching, asks himselffirst, “Is this teaching realistic in terms of my own experience of life?” If heis perceptive, he will next ask himself, “Does it conform to the high Truthstaught through the ages by people of true wisdom?” If it fails on both counts,it should be tossed aside as scripturally worthless.If, on the other hand, it at least conforms to actual mundane experience, eventhough it is not true to the eternal verities, it may be considered from a pointof view, at any rate, of how helpfully it relates to actual human needs. If oneis seeking true wisdom and isn’t able to estimate the truth of a teaching fromhis own or from wiser experience, he should consider it cautiously. Probably, itis merely an invention.For as the electron (one of the ultimate “building blocks” of material creation)is basically the same everywhere, so life, aspiration, love, and fulfillment arethe same in all creatures, albeit more consciously so in human beings. Thetruths of consciousness everywhere must be universally the same, then, and—givenall that we know of life—must also be eternal.[2] From the poem “Samadhi,” by Paramhansa Yogananda, quoted in Autobiography ofa Yogi."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3[../Images/flower.jpg]TRUE, VS. FALSE, RELIGIONS: PART ONEPeople over many years have sometimes asked me my opinion of a certainwell-known book, published some years ago, which claims to be based on truerevelation. Even on my first perusal of this book I observed that it lacked atleast three of the vital ingredients of true scripture. First, its wordsconveyed no vibration of divine power. Second, I found in it littlecorroboration with my own life experiences. Third, it failed in basic respectsto correspond with the universal teachings of the ages, declared by every greatscripture in the world. For these reasons I have never considered the book agenuine scripture, and when people have asked me, have stated my opinion.“Ah,” some have protested, “but it speaks so beautifully of God’s love andcompassion!”“Well,” I’ve replied, “couldn’t any good poet write of those blessings asbeautifully? The issue is, Do those words convey the conviction born of personalexperience? To me, they do not.”Any statement of divine truth must also contain a certain sternness, almost analoofness, of self-abnegation and non-attachment, indicative of complete innerfreedom. It should seem almost to say, “This truth is something that should notbe trifled with.” God loves us all, and is unstintingly compassionate, but Hisoutpouring of grace is not for the faint-hearted. Rather it is, as the Bibleputs it, a “refining fire.” One who deeply wants to receive God’s love mustfirst be purified of every selfish desire—indeed, of every self-definitionexcept that of belonging utterly, completely, and forever to God alone.Any spiritual statement that falls short of this highest truth—for example, bydiluting it to make it more palatable to the average person’s taste (which issomething that book does), is either catering to people’s ego-defenses or is inflat contradiction of the Truth. If, for example, it says that man is inherentlyevil, that statement is simply false. Man, in his soul, is inherently divine,for he is a manifestation of Divine Consciousness. It is of course true that mancan express evil, but that is another matter and depends also, first, on how wedefine evil.Dilution comes when a teaching is too accepting of the ego as the central factof human existence, instead of trying to get people to follow determinedly theupward path to freedom from all egoic limitation. Flat contradiction comes,moreover, when a so-called scripture states an untruth: for example, that evildoesn’t exist, or (as some have averred) that “God does not know evil.” Evil orSatan is, as we shall see later on, a cosmic reality. Final salvation is,however, for all—yes, even, eventually, for Satan himself—who, as he merges backinto the Supreme Spirit, ceases to be satanic and becomes divine.Another teaching that flatly contradicts spiritual truth is a claim, which onehears sometimes, that the soul has a limited number of opportunities to beredeemed, after which it is destroyed forever. The fatal flaw in this teachingis that the soul, being a part of God, cannot ever be destroyed. As my Guru saidto me when I queried him somewhat fearfully on this point, “How can you destroyGod?”A very great error occurs when people insist—as some have done—that any personaleffort to commune inwardly with God is fraught with spiritual danger, for itleads to self-deception. This error is allied to the belief that divinecommunion—which is, certainly, a grace of God—is in no way the result of humaneffort. Were this really true, no scripture need ever have been written. As wellmight one say that nothing can be done to bring sunlight into a room, when theonly obstruction to it is the fact that all the window curtains have been drawnshut. God certainly wants us to commune with Him. It is we who shut Him out byour restlessness, material desires, and dull indifference. Meditation is, infact, the best way of removing all mental obstacles.Fundamental to the error concerned here is the mistaken belief that meditationinduces a sort of self-hypnosis. The difference between prayer and meditationcan be clarified very simply, however: Prayer means talking to God; meditationmeans listening silently for His answer.Is it possible to delude oneself that he is receiving answers, when in fact heis merely imagining them? Well, of course it is! The human mind houses averitable factory of fantasies, produced in the workroom of the subconscious.Certain tests can help to determine whether one is receiving true or falseinspiration and guidance. Christian tradition—especially the Greek Orthodox, onthe subject of prelest—contains many excellent pointers. I suggest the sincereseeker study and apply them. This subject cannot be addressed deeply here; itwould detract from my main theme. I will list a few such tests, however, fullyconfident that anyone who is sincere will not remain in delusion for very long,for God Himself will lead all “by the hand” who seek Him with full sincerity.“Seek,” said Jesus, “and ye shall find.” (Luke 11:9) Be not afraid. The veryfear of possible confusion due to meditation is placed in the heart by Satanhimself, usually suggested in the first place by church organizations in theirdesire to gather everyone under their protective wings, wholly dependent onofficial, carefully crafted dogmas.One very important test can be suggested here: See whether inner meditativeexperience brings you greater mental clarity, or progressive dullness. Aspiritually advanced disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda’s declared, “Your religionis tested in the cold light of day.” If meditation awakens in you a tendency toface the challenges of daily life vaguely, with a diminishing sense ofresponsibility, this is a sign that, during meditation, you are drifting aboutin clouds of subconsciously induced images instead of rising into the clearskies of superconsciousness. If you have visions that are cloudy and lackbrilliance, especially if they bring you no heightening of awareness, you mayknow that you’ve been allowing imagination to draw you down into a passivestate. There’s no harm done, but in this case try to inject more will power intoyour efforts at achieving inner calmness. Imagination is a diversion peoplesometimes encounter on their way to Superconsciousness. Whenever you find yourthoughts drifting, recall them calmly (not agitatedly), and mentally gird yourloins to dive deeper, ever deeper into the ocean of inner peace.A chant my Guru wrote begins with these words:Without meditation, mind,Hither, thither wanderest thou.Indeed there are false as well as true experiences in meditation. To avoidmeditating because of fear of the false ones would be like refusing to go out ofdoors from fear of being hit by a truck. In meditation, take care that yourefforts to surrender the ego to God involve openness to higher awareness, notthe false “openness” of a blank mind. Never, moreover, surrender passively tostray thoughts and fantasies. Inner surrender should be upward, toward thesuperconscious, not downward into subconsciousness.The clearest proof that you are meditating properly is when you find existingcobwebs in the mind being cleared away.Years ago, in my quest for God but before I found Paramhansa Yogananda, I readthe diary of the great Russian ballet dancer, Nijinsky. You might like, if youcan find that book—it is, however, quite rare—to read at least excerpts from it.It affords a very clear example of false, hallucinatory guidance. The author’sindiscriminate acceptance of every whim that chanced to enter his mind showsthat he was not consulting reason or common sense. His submission to vagueguidance from the subconscious clearly pointed to his own gradualdisintegration, which ended in madness.Divine grace is essential, certainly, to true inner communion. Nothing man cando will ever oblige God to respond. On the other hand, even trying to bringabout divine communion by will power alone betrays egotistical presumption: Itshows not the humility that comes with true openness of heart and mind. Most ofthe warnings against meditation, especially (in the West) against yogameditation, are based on the thought that meditation implies presumption. Thewarnings are either mischievous or simply ignorant.I have read statements to the effect that the bliss experienced in meditation is“addictive”—as if meditation were a kind of mental drug! Is it really possibleto become “addicted” to wisdom? Whatever false euphoria one might experience inmeditation, it would certainly not be wisdom. Nor could it be bliss, whichitself bestows wisdom of the highest order.Hallucinogenic drugs—LSD and the like—are indeed, to varying degrees, addictive,for they dull the mind and reduce one’s ability to cope with down-to-earth,daily realities. Worst of all, perhaps, they have a debilitating effect on thewill. Drugs like these may induce a delusive euphoria, but I have personallyobserved people, under their influence, unable to relate to anyone whose mindwas not drifting about in similar euphoric clouds. The “universal love” some ofthem claimed to feel had nothing to do with anyone else’s actual feelings. Theymight have felt just as “inspired” by the “beautiful” red blood on the vest of aperson who had just been stabbed by a knife.Superconscious bliss has nothing in common with ego-separative, subconsciouslyinduced “euphoria.” Without the practice of meditation, moreover, the mind willremain forever restless and incapable of receiving true inspiration from God.It is, then, an absolute fallacy to insist that meditation leads toself-deception. Meditation is, in fact, the best way of testing one’s religion.It is scientific, for it offers the test of actual experience.Imagination is not, however, in itself a bad thing. The ability to visualizesomething clearly is in fact helpful as a means of opening the mind to higherperceptions. To avoid “flights of fancy,” it is necessary to submit thoseperceptions to the tests of objective experience and common sense.During Yogananda’s early years in America, he was approached one day by a manwho informed him, “I go frequently into cosmic consciousness.”We all know the saying, “It takes one to know one.” Yogananda knew at once thatthis man only had an unusually vivid imagination. He also perceived, however,that it would not help the man to be told he was only hallucinating. Hetherefore invited the person to come up to his hotel room.In the room he asked his guest to be seated. He then said, “Now, please go into‘cosmic consciousness’ for me.” The man sat with flickering eyelids—a sureindication of mental restlessness—and began his visualization. Anyone observinghim would have seen that he was far from being uplifted into any exalted state.Finally the “meditator” could stand the suspense no longer. “Why don’t you askme where I am?” he inquired.“Very well then, where are you?”“On top of the dome of the Taj Mahal!” called the man, as if hallooing from agreat distance.“There must be something the matter with your own dome,” remarked the Master. “Isee you sitting right here before me.”“All right, all right,” conceded the visitor. “Test me again.”“If you are able to go so far away as the Taj Mahal, in India,” the Master said,“what about going somewhere we can verify easily? Why not go downstairs to therestaurant in this hotel, and tell me what you see there?”The man closed his eyes again. A moment later he said, “I see a piano to theleft of the door as you enter from the lobby. The restaurant is empty, but twocustomers have just entered through the street door.”Yogananda countered, “There is no piano in the room at all; three people areseated near the lobby entrance. No one is entering from the street, but thereare people seated at two more tables in the center of the room.”They at once went downstairs together. The scene the man had described bore noresemblance to the reality. What Yogananda had described was what they actuallysaw.“You see,” our Guru commented to us, “that man really believed he was seeingwhatever he visualized. I had to propose an objective test which would show thelack of validity in his visualization.”The man had to accept the testimony of his own eyes. Thus, he became convinced.Experience was the needed “reality check”; it finally convinced him.Many indeed are the ways of misrepresenting the Truth. The most important thingalways to keep in mind is that all Creation comes from God, and that everythingmust eventually merge back into Him no matter how long it takes. The ultimatedestiny of all men is to realize God’s bliss as their own true nature. He hashidden that Bliss in us all; it is what endlessly impels us to seek fulfillment,like Prodigal Sons, until we tire of wandering in this “foreign land” ofdelusion, and earnestly determine at last to return again to our true home inGod.There are other ways also to test the genuineness of a teaching. If it states,for example, “God gave us our bodies for us to enjoy them,” we may know at oncethat the teaching is false—not because God doesn’t want us to enjoy this world,but because He wants us to enjoy it in the right way: without ego-consciousness,and in a spirit of sharing our enjoyment with Him. Refined, spiritual enjoymentis possible only when the ego is completely surrendered to the Lord.The opposite concept—that we should hate our bodies—is equally false. Theproblem with both these concepts is that they are oversimplified and one-sided.The solution is to enjoy everything without attachment. Hatred, on the otherhand, is a negative emotion which pulls the energy in the body downward, toone’s lower nature. There is much groundwork I must lay, however, beforeclarifying this truth more fully.God certainly wants us to enjoy His creation. He doesn’t, however, want us toidentify ourselves, by either attraction or repulsion, with any part of it. Allemotional reactions, whether positive or negative, must be neutralized byoffering them up to inner soul-freedom in God. Even evil—which must be strictlyavoided for the spiritual disease it is—should be rejected in principle only,not hated.God wants us to enjoy life in the right way: not, that is, forego-gratification, but with His joy. The question may occur to some minds: “Butdoes God really want anything?” This is, however, a mere quibble. There are twokinds of desire: the one a contractive shrinking inward upon one’s self; theother, an expansive, outward sharing with all. The second is called a“desireless desire,” for it is self-liberating and is born of the nature of purejoy, which seeks in everything reflections of the higher Self. Divine joy isself-expansive. The reason we should offer up all our enjoyments to God is that,if we do not, egoic self-indulgence will lead to the very opposite of enjoyment:satiety, disgust, boredom, and, yes, suffering. In everything pertaining to theego, duality is the ruler. There cannot be pleasure without its correspondingopposite: pain.In an important book, The Essence of the Bhagavad Gita Explained by ParamhansaYogananda, Yogananda is quoted as telling a story (evidently a true one) about aman who wrote something he wanted people to accept as a genuine scripture. Heburied it under a tree, then left it untouched in the hope that, with age, itwould acquire a certain patina of antiquity. Years later that man, claiming tobe acting under the guidance of angels, returned to the tree, and there, toeveryone’s amazement, “discovered” buried underneath it a “divinely revealedscripture.”The main problem with this document, something few people have taken intoaccount, was that it failed in many ways to correspond to the timeless truthsGod has revealed through the ages to mankind. Its novelty, which believers tookas a sign that it contained true revelations, constituted in fact its majorflaw.Novelty is attractive to many people. The times we live in are filled withnewness and excitement. People want to keep on getting the latest “news.” Wheredivine truths are concerned, however, there is no room for ephemeralstimulation. Truth is eternal. It is more fundamental and enduring than the verylaws of physics. How could God ever declare truth once only, or through only onegreat master? And how could He, later on, contradict Himself through any othertrue master?Would it have been possible for that miraculous discovery beneath a tree to begenuine? It would, admittedly, be a marvel: the sort of thing people might liketo see happen. Besides, God can do anything, even something He has never donebefore. It wasn’t the novelty of the event itself, however, that condemned it.What did the condemning were the teachings that this “miraculous” documentcontained.I should mention in passing, moreover, that “angelic guidance” is far lesstrustworthy than the teachings of a great spiritual master whom God has sentdown to earth. Redemption comes through divine human channels, not throughangels. (Nor, it may be added, does any divinely new revelation come throughvisitors from other planets. I say this because books have been published inmodern times that claim to make such “revelations.”)As for that miraculously discovered book, the acid test of the truths itproclaimed would have been whether it corresponded to the eternal, Divine Truthsthat have been handed down through the ages by great masters to mankind. Thevalidity of true teachings has been demonstrated conclusively by the upliftinginfluence they’ve had on sincere spiritual seekers who, the world over, devotedyears to their practice. In the above case, it is evident that this manuscriptfailed to meet the supreme test of spiritual truth. No doubt the manuscript said“good things,” and spoke truths—such as, “Love others, and be generous tothem”—that are recognized and accepted by all. Many of the claims it made,however, were actually antithetic to Sanaatan Dharma.Truth is either knowable or not knowable. If thousands of otherwise truthful,reliable persons—saints and masters—who have been accepted through time asgreat, have stated from their own experience that a certain reality isfundamentally true to God’s ways and to the way the universe was made; and ifthis teaching, moreover, or something in harmony with it, has been expressed bytrue saints everywhere: then it must follow that anyone who contradicts thatteaching is either mistaken, or else needs very strong arguments to bolster hiscontradiction. The act of discovering a manuscript that has lain buried—how?when? by whom?—under a tree doesn’t come under any such heading as “a strongargument.”Truth can of course be variously presented, like the facets of a diamond. A truestatement may be phrased in such a way as to meet the needs of one particularsociety, but be differently phrased for the needs of another society. Oneparticular (and true) scripture may, for instance, lay special emphasis on thesupremacy of divine Law, and another, perhaps written for a society that isover-dependent on religious legalities, may insist on the transforming power ofdivine love and grace. True teachings all agree, however, on the fundamentals ofSanaatan Dharma, the Eternal Religion, as represented in every great religion.Were anyone, for example, solemnly to declare that God loves this group buthates that one, the declaration would contradict an eternal truth: namely, thatGod loves all equally. It is, however, true that the magnetism of true devotioncan elicit a greater expression of God’s love.Divine Love is impersonal and impartial. The seemingly conflicting belief thatthe Jews are “God’s chosen people” was clarified by Yogananda in these words:“God chooses those who choose Him.”Some aspects of true religion are accepted almost universally. Who, indeed,would deny them? Were anyone to declare that Jesus Christ’s real meaning in theverse, “Except ye . . . become as little children, ye shall not enter into thekingdom of heaven” (Matt. 18:3), was that we should all put on rompers and playon the beach with spades and buckets, he would be merely laughed at. To bechildlike is not the same thing at all as to be childish.Most followers of every religion fail, in certain basic respects, to understandwhat their founders really meant to convey. Many Buddhists, for example, insistthat the Buddha denied the existence of God, because he spoke of the goal oflife as the state of nirvana. That attainment, for most of his followers, meansutter and permanent extinction of everything—even of consciousness: in otherwords, eternal nothingness. Nothingness is by no means, however—so my Guruasserted—what the Buddha meant his followers to accept as the goal of life.Belief in unconsciousness as the highest truth—and this has to be what totalnothingness means—is simply an error. How could anything come out of nothing?How could the very compassion of the Buddha have sprung out of no feelings atall? Consciousness, so far from manifesting essential unconsciousness, is theone abiding reality underlying the entire universe. Consciousness cannot evencreate, in the human sense of the word: it can only manifest Itself. Thewell-known compassion of the Buddha, to repeat, could never have arisen out of atotal lack of feeling. The atheism asserted by Buddhists is simply amisunderstanding of their founder’s teachings.This misunderstanding exemplifies a host of errors that appear in everyreligion, simply because fallible human beings “get their muckers” on a truthand twist it in fumbling blindness. Thus, religion becomes corroded in time bythe acid influence of ignorance.In the case of Buddhism, the reason the Buddha did not speak of God was that hismission was to emphasize man’s need—a concept that was falling into desuetude—tomake a spiritual effort individually, rather than merely performing Vedicceremonies and waiting passively for divine blessings. In this respect,Yogananda once, in my hearing, urged a disciple to overcome a particulartendency in himself. The disciple replied, “I want to change, Master, but howcan I do so without your blessings?”“Well, my blessings are there already,” said the Guru. “God’s blessings arethere. It is your blessings that are lacking!”Nirvana doesn’t mean a total cessation of consciousness. It only means the endof delusive desires and self-limiting egoism. From initial emptiness which,Yogananda said, ensues after the soul wins final release from egoic bondage,there follows complete, eternal attainment of and absorption in Absolute Bliss.Swami Shankara, several centuries after Buddha, was sent by God to correct thismisunderstanding. Shankara defined divine absorption as Satchidananda:“Ever-existing, Ever-conscious, Ever-new Bliss.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 4[../Images/flower.jpg]TRUE, VS. FALSE, RELIGIONS: PART TWOSpiritual masters are repeatedly sent by God to correct human misunderstandings.For it is man alone, not the saints, who obscures Truth. No true master wouldever deny a deep truth declared by any other master who ever lived. Divinerealization is not a triumph of the intellect. Divine Truth is, moreover,figuratively speaking, as much higher than the comprehension of mere theologiansas the soaring Himalayan peaks are above the Gangetic plain. Truth can begrasped only by clear spiritual insight, which is to say, by divine intuition.Science, in its declarations concerning material reality, changes its mind onfundamental issues every few years. That vacillation demonstrates thelimitations of the intellect: never completely satisfied with any conclusion,and never completely certain of anything. True saints, who have found God andhave shown themselves great and wise human beings, have never (by contrast)contradicted or disagreed with one another on any basic issue.Thus it was that, when Paramhansa Yogananda visited Therese Neumann, the greatCatholic stigmatist of Konnersreuth, Germany, she at once recognized hisspiritual stature and sent a message: “Though the bishop has asked me to see noone without his permission, I will receive the man of God from India.”In the vision of God there can never be anything but agreement. The onlypossible alternative would be, of course, that the vision of God is not possiblefor mankind, and that everyone who claims to have seen Him is simplyhallucinating. True saints respect and honor one another. Instead of crowdingforward, moreover, like children eager for acclaim as the finders of a “new”truth, they themselves bow before the Truth itself, for they recognize that italone is. Jesus Christ stated during his Sermon on the Mount, “Think not that Iam come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but tofulfill.” (Matt. 5:17)Sanaatan Dharma would be as true if man had never discovered it—even as thebillions of galaxies predated their discovery by man. Sanaatan Dharma is verydifferent, however, from the dry facts that masquerade as truth in the materialsciences. What Sanaatan Dharma describes is the truth behind all appearances,whether gross or subtle. This is why one feels joy even in contemplating theeternal truths. People who, by contrast, seek to probe only the mysteries ofmaterial reality feel alternations of ego-satisfying exaltation andego-drenching disappointment.The ultimate goal of all seeking is Bliss-Consciousness, which resides at thecalm, unmoving center of all existence. This Reality is ever-conscious,omniscient, and self-aware. It is loving in both a personal and an impersonal,universal way: impersonal, because it seeks nothing for itself; personal,because it seeks supernal blessing, eventually, for every living creature.A fundamental aspect of Divine Truth is that all creatures are motivated,whether consciously or unconsciously, from within themselves to seek changeless,eternal bliss, which is the very essence of perfect Self-awareness. Bliss itselfis Self-aware, which explains why the divine Self is customarily written with acapital “S.” People who seek fulfillment through the senses are really, howevermistakenly, seeking divine bliss.That Bliss, being Self-aware, filters down consciously into human beings. Itbecomes restricted in the process by ego-consciousness. Sometimes, when anurgent need exists among men, Cosmic Bliss takes birth in the world as a savior.God has indeed, through the aeons of time, descended many times and lived as ahuman being among men in order to bring His children to eternal safety from allsorrow. Never does God descend, in “full power and glory,” however, as if tooverwhelm mankind with His majesty. Rather, He descends humbly, letting DivineLove and Bliss be the magnets to draw people. God comes dressed in the humanreality of great souls who at some time in the past overcame that “reality,”rising above every human limitation and attaining perfection in God. Such soulsknow from memory what it means to live in ego-limitation, for they have lived indelusion themselves. They therefore appreciate from their own experience theeffort needed to attain enlightenment. Eternally free souls remember their ownpast mistakes, and the suffering that was consequent upon those mistakes. Whatdraws them back to earth is the “desireless desire” to uplift humanity. Theirdivine mission is not ever to proclaim their own greatness, but only to convincepeople of man’s own potential for spiritual greatness. All human beings areequally children of God, manifestations of the Supreme Consciousness even ifthey themselves, at present, are barely conscious of that divinity.Thus, Jesus Christ, Krishna, Buddha, and many other great, liberated beings havereturned to earth again and again for the upliftment and salvation of mankind.Other people who, over incarnations, have become spiritually refined enough torecognize a true, divine manifestation, and to receive his expandedconsciousness in their hearts, attain salvation. For God is able, through Hisdivine messengers, to free from their ego-prisons all those who lovingly callfor help.The heavenly message is always essentially the same, for the Truth neverchanges. Only its outer forms from time to time assume new clothing, to conformto the fluctuating needs of mankind.None of those great messengers has ever been God’s unique creation, even iftheir followers have often made this claim, or similar ones. Christian dogmadefines Jesus Christ as the “only Son of God,” but it is Christ who is the Sonof God, not Jesus the man. Jesus himself is quoted in the book of Revelation assaying: “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, evenas I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.” (Rev. 3:21)This statement raises the important question: How, and what, had he overcome? Iwill explain Paramhansa Yogananda’s answer to this all-important question, lateron.There is a further problem, which has to do with the many wrong interpretationsthat have been made of true scriptures. Man is easily bewildered when heconfronts unfamiliar abstractions, which he finds utterly beyond anything he hasexperienced in his own life. Bewilderment pervades religion everywhere. AsYogananda put it, “Ignorance, both East and West, is fifty-fifty.”Let us consider these few examples from the New Testament:It is, as I’ve stated and as everyone knows, a dogma in Christianity that Jesusis “the only Son of God.” Paramhansa Yogananda declared this to be a truth. Healso said, however, that it is a deeply esoteric truth, and applies as much tothe foundation of the universe as to that divine human being who was born inBethlehem.God could never in essence, of course, be anthropomorphic; that is to say, Hecould never, in essence, possess a human (or any other) form. It isinconceivable that the Creator of a hundred billion galaxies, each with acomparable number of stars and planets, could have any intrinsic form at all. Itis even more inconceivable that such a God, needing help in getting His “job”done on earth, could have created one human being as His “only son.” ParamhansaYogananda stated that the dogma that Christ is God’s “only Son” is true only ifwe understand it in the deep sense expressed in the Eternal Truth, SanaatanDharma.The Star of Bethlehem is another example of people’s widespread misunderstandingof a deep truth. Could any star in the heavens really “stand over” a particularbuilding? Were we to go behind that building we would see it standing over someother building, or over a tree, or above the crest of a hill. This tradition,too, conceals a deep teaching, one that has been misunderstood because peoplelack familiarity with spiritual truths.The whole message of the Christmas story is deeply inspiring, and was intendedto convey the subtle message that Jesus was indeed a descent from the highestrealms of divine consciousness, charged by God with a divine mission. The “Starof Bethlehem” was not a comet or any other celestial phenomenon. This subject,along with the other examples I am giving here, will be explored later in thisbook.A final example may be offered. Jesus Christ said, “And as Moses lifted up theserpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:“That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.”(John 3:14,15)The words, “lifted up,” are interpreted by theologians as a veiled prophecy thatJesus would, in future, be “lifted up” on the cross to be crucified. Thesewords, however, convey a much deeper and richer meaning. This too is a passage(there are many others) which tradition has utterly misconstrued.A pressing need exists among Christians today for a fresh outlook on the holymission and teachings of Jesus Christ. Too long have his supposedrepresentatives—“authorities” in the churches, and scholarly theologians—offeredpale platitudes as substitutes for the Truth. Christian belief has becomecentered ever-increasingly in concepts that are rooted in ordinary humanunderstanding, and not in spiritual insight. It is urgent nowadays for Christ’smessage to be proclaimed once again in its thrillingly deep, radiantlybeautiful, and eternally wonderful Truth.It was partly for this purpose that Paramhansa Yogananda was sent by his line ofgreat gurus, and by God, to the West. They commissioned him to “bring back theoriginal yoga teachings of Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, and the originalteachings of Jesus Christ in the Bible.”Yogananda would sometimes remark wryly, “Jesus Christ was crucified once, buthis teachings have been crucified daily for the past two thousand years bypersons without spiritual understanding.”Much has been made by scholars recently of the Gnostic teachings. Indeed, fromeverything Paramhansa Yogananda said and wrote on the subject, there wereGnostics who did come much closer than the churches to the original teachings ofJesus Christ to his disciples. Those truths comprised what Yogananda called“original Christianity.”Not long after the death of Jesus, however, the Church perceived a need forresolving theological controversies in unanimous agreement. The Gnostics claimedthey were seeking (indeed, some of them claimed to have attained) direct, innercommunion with God. Certain Gnostics said they had been initiated into thesetruths through a line of direct succession from Apostolic times. They insisted,moreover—and Yogananda endorsed their statement—that Jesus Christ’s emphasis hadbeen on seeking personal verification by direct, inner experience of God.There was always a problem, however. It concerned which of the many claims tobelieve. For there were also inconsistencies and contradictions among theGnostics. Some of those who made the claims were—reason itself suggestsit—self-deluded. Valid tests can be applied to their claim that they experiencedhigher-than-ordinary perceptions. I’ve already listed a few of those tests.Chief among them is whether those making the claims seemed without anyego-motivation.It is possible, of course, for ordinary people to be fooled. A man lying by theroadside in a seemingly unconscious state might be asleep; he might be drunk; orhe might be a saint absorbed in divine ecstasy. How is one to know? A churchinvestigating committee might well lack the qualification for determining hisactual mental state. That is why committees inquiring into a person’s sanctitymake such a big issue of miracles, thinking (quite mistakenly) that miraculouspowers are proof of a person’s holiness. Miracles alone, however, areinsufficient for that purpose.I’ll tell a story later about Sadhu Haridas, a wonder-worker who lived in Indiaseveral centuries ago, whom some people considered a saint. There still remainedfor him, however, important spiritual lessons to be learned.A conscientious investigating committee, if in fact one is needed at all, has aneed to be skeptical. Skepticism, however, is an aspect of intellection whichjudges everything on a basis of external observation alone. The intellect mighteasily attribute that recumbent man’s mental state, for example, to catalepsy.The best person to judge whether he was in fact a saint would be another saint.A church would consider it necessary first, however, to appoint a committee todetermine the sanctity also of this judge. The whole process would become in theend so laborious, expensive, and for all that uncertain, that the authoritiesmight well ask themselves, “Is it worth it?” Perhaps the best “way out” for themwould be simply to drop the whole matter and let the committee members return totheir normal lives.The solution that evolved in India suggested this last decision. There,investigating committees in religion were never appointed in the first place. Itwas easy to avoid creating them, since there never existed, in India, a rulingbody of prelates to do the appointing!Early Western missionaries were amazed to find so little organized religion inIndia. E. Stanley Jones, a famous Protestant missionary from America, wrote ofan occasion when he was speaking about Jesus Christ to a crowd in Benares (thenew name for which is Varanasi). A pundit (priestly scholar) in the crowd, whohad been fidgeting restlessly, finally rose and approached Jones. He placed atilak (spiritual mark) on his forehead and then, before returning to his seat,declared with satisfaction, “Now you are a Hindu. I can listen to you with aclear conscience.”It does happen, and has indeed happened repeatedly, that some spiritualmountebank presents false teachings that, to many, seem credible. The mass ofevidence, however, accumulated over millennia as to the real teachings ofSanaatan Dharma has established such a firm tradition that false teachings, andfalse saints, are in time weeded out of that garden. Often, a merely understatedsmile by a true saint suffices to make the point so clearly that he doesn’t needto say anything.One who teaches Tantra as a path to enlightenment, but who recommends gleefulindulgence in the pleasures of the senses instead of calm inner detachment fromall pleasure, is soon discredited, and before long is forgotten. People look athis followers; they see in their eyes a depletion of spiritual power. After atime, everyone simply loses interest. It should be added that those teachers ofTantra who teach the deliberate enjoyment of sensual pleasure are suggesting notonly a dangerous path, but a false one. Mental non-attachment during moments ofpleasure is at least a right teaching, for it is realistic; people will seeksensory enjoyment, anyway. The idea here, then, is, Why not tell them how toescape, at least relatively unscathed, from the clutches of sense infatuation?This is, nevertheless, a lower teaching, one that is easily misunderstood, andone, therefore, that is not recommended by true sages. Most people, taking thisteaching as their path to God, only experience a spiritual fall.The Christian churches don’t trust their own members to sift truth from error.(So much for the quality of their teaching!) The problem with not doing so isthat when adults are treated like children, they find it difficult to grow up,spiritually. Richard Wurmbrand, a Protestant pastor who, because of hisreligion, was imprisoned in communist Romania, wrote impressive examples of howclearly people understood Biblical truths when they no longer, under thatrepressive regime, had pastors whom they could trust for spiritual guidance.Even a child who hears nothing but, “NO! NO!” may at last rebel and becomeunmanageable.Nature’s way is prolific. It would be absurd for any committee to try to limitausterely how she should behave. An oak tree drops numerous acorns, of whichonly a few sprout and become trees. Were a “nature committee” to be assigned thetask of choosing which acorns should be allowed to grow, the committee might endup allowing an entire forest to die, for the seeds it selected might all turnout to be barren.One might even say then, of India, that pure religion flourishes there exactlybecause India has allowed human nature simply to take its own course. In thatcountry, no priestly authorities meddle in people’s spiritual lives. Perhaps theprocess of stern selection is partly what Jesus referred to when he said, “Judgenot, that ye be not judged.” (Matt. 7:1)Going back to the Gnostics: It should be clear enough that, as all sorts ofpeople live on earth—a few of them wise, most of them foolish—so also there musthave been all sorts of Gnostics. Not everyone, after all, who picks up apaintbrush becomes a great artist. And not everyone who claims true spiritualinsight speaks from superconscious wisdom.The insights of a few Gnostics, however, must surely have been valid. Jesushimself said, “And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and yeshall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.” (Luke 11:9) No one couldseek God with full sincerity for many years and not find anything!Many Gnostics also, however—or so one suspects—were spiritual duds: wellmeaning, perhaps, but wandering about still in fogs of delusion. It can hardlybe doubted, moreover, that the self-proclaimed truths uttered by certainGnostics were born of imagination. Indeed, it must surely be ceded, in favor ofthe anxious churchmen of those days, that there was a need at that time for atleast some criterion to determine who was what. India’s religious traditionswere, like India herself, very ancient. Valid tradition from long ages past hadset down deep roots in that millennial soil.Christianity, unlike India’s heredity of Sanaatan Dharma, was, for many people,a new teaching. It wasn’t really new, of course, for what Jesus taught wereeternal truths. Nevertheless, to his followers it seemed new, and especially soafter orthodox Jewry had condemned Christianity and had driven its adherents outof their synagogues. There arose in the perceptions of Christians, therefore, aneed to get organized.Slowly there emerged an authoritarian Church, centralized and all-powerful. Assoon as the Church was in a position to do so, it declared a need for fixeddefinitions—that is to say, dogmas—to protect Christ’s teachings from numerousideological assaults. Dogmas were seen by the church authorities as the obvioussolution, because dogmatic definitions offered a safe and easy way of “refuting”error.In spite of everything, however, the wisest and best choice has always been toconsult the wisdom of true saints. How to find such persons, then, in a churchthat feared (and still fears) the possibility that they might feel inspired toutter inconvenient revelations? Not everyone whom the Church has declared asaint has been such in the highest sense of the word, though it seems safe tosay that all of them have been spiritually dedicated and sincere. It is best inany case to look even to lesser saints for right understanding of therevelations of Christ than to seek the highest guidance from ordinary priests,pastors, and ministers. At least those who live deeply dedicated lives inwardlyspeak from some level of personal experience, rather than from establishedpolicy. They may have wisdom to offer that can never be attained by intellectualtheologians and administrators whose knowledge is formed almost entirely by booklearning and institutional precedents.Paramhansa Yogananda belonged in a different category from those who have beendeclared saints by the Catholic Church. First of all, he was not a member of anyChristian church, but came from outside the Christian “fold” altogether.Yogananda loved Jesus Christ deeply and reverently. Moreover, he, too,participated in the wisdom that has been attained by the greatest Christiansaints, for he, too, had attained their level of divine, inner communion. Comingfrom outside the fenced enclosure of “Churchianity,” Yogananda was free, as thesaints within the church have never been, to speak the truth from his ownrealization. He had no need, moreover, to submit what he taught to churchdignitaries for approval. He lived in, and could speak from, God-consciousness.Christians who sincerely wanted to understand the true message of Jesus Christwere drawn to Yogananda wherever he went. Some of them came to him afterreceiving superconscious visions which told them to go to him. Others wereattracted by the radiant example of his life. And still others responded becauseevery word he uttered rang with divine truth. Yogananda’s divinely revealedinsights into the teachings of Christ converted many thousands also who hadbeen, until then, hardened skeptics.Once, during his first year in America, he received an unsigned lettercriticizing him for “promoting” Jesus Christ (as the writer put it) in the West.“Don’t you realize,” the letter stated, “that Jesus Christ never lived? He is amyth created to bring people under the control of religious authority.” Theletter was unsigned, as I’ve said. The young missionary from India—a trueChristian missionary, indeed, though one to a Christian land!—prayed that Godwould lead him to the writer.Several days later, Yogananda entered the Boston Public Library, where hesometimes went to do research. As he entered, he saw a stranger seated under awindow on a bench, and, going over, sat on the bench beside him.“Why did you write me that letter?” he inquired.“Wh-what letter?” the man demanded in amazement.“The one in which you told me that Jesus Christ never lived.”“But—how did you know I wrote it?”“Never mind how,” the Indian yogi replied with a quiet smile. “I have my ways.The reason I’ve sought you out is to tell you that the same power of God’s whichenabled me to find you has also shown me that Jesus Christ did live, and that hewas everything the Bible says about him.”More than once my Guru told us of a wonderful vision he’d once had. “As I waswriting my commentaries on the Bible,” he said, “I prayed to Jesus forconfirmation: Was what I had written true to his actual meaning? Jesus Christthen appeared to me, after which the Holy Grail also appeared, touched his lips,then descended and touched my lips. Jesus declared, ‘The cup from which I drink,thou dost drink.’”During worship services on Sunday mornings, Yogananda would proclaim deeptruths, first, from the Bible, then compare those truths with the sayings ofKrishna in the Bhagavad Gita. He also wrote a long series of articles called,“The Second Coming of Christ,” which appeared for many years in the magazine putout by Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF), the organization he’d founded todisseminate his teachings. His discussion of Biblical truths during thoseservices, and the articles he wrote for the magazine, were published—heavilyedited, unfortunately—in a compendium of two volumes titled, The Second Comingof Christ. I do recommend to the reader that he read that book, though I havefelt to add that caveat to be prepared for cumbersome editing.I have also written a work comparing passages from the Bible and the BhagavadGita. It is called, The Promise of Immortality.The present book is not intended to replace that first, much larger work. What Isay here will be limited to the essence of what Paramhansa Yogananda taught. Ihave come to feel, however, that there is a growing need today for my Guru’steachings on this subject, restated simply and clearly as he himself gave them.There is, as I’ve said, an urgent need for a fresh and authoritative commentaryon the true meanings of Christ’s teachings. I shall try to present the insightsmy Guru proclaimed, with his simplicity and clarity. My hope for this book isthat it will bring understanding to many who are Christians, but who feel readyto understand the teachings of Jesus more deeply.I myself am a direct disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda. I came to him in 1948,nearly sixty years ago, lived with him until he left his body in 1952, and havefollowed and practiced his teachings ever since. During the time I spent withhim, he told me that my work would include editing his writings and authoringother books to explain and present his teachings. He also told me to lecturewidely in his name.I worked with him in 1950 at his desert retreat, where I helped him with theediting of two commentaries especially: one, on the Bhagavad Gita, and the otheron a work which, he declared, is a true scripture: The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.He told me he wanted me to work on another of his commentaries also: hisexplanations of the teachings of Jesus Christ. Unfortunately, during the time Iwas with him we had less of an opportunity than I would have liked to discusshis Bible commentaries. During lengthy conversations that we had at his desertretreat, however, he gave me many insights into these teachings also. And heappointed me a minister in his organization, within which it was my privilege tobe active for many years, presenting his teachings to the public.It is without presumption, therefore, that I offer my version of his Biblecommentaries. I do so out of deep dedication to what he himself commissioned meto do, which was to transmit his teachings far and wide throughout the world."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 5[../Images/flower.jpg]THE PURPOSE OF RELIGIONMost people the world over, if they take their religion seriously, treat it evenat that as if it were more a social than a spiritual activity. They believe inGod and worship Him, but always their belief is in the broader context of theirnormal lives. If they go regularly to church, synagogue, temple, mosque, orvihara, and make customary devotional offerings of prayer, chanting, arati, orother pious acts, even so the main focus of their lives is on their own privateaffairs. Apart from formal acts of worship, when they address God in the secondperson—usually to beg favors of Him—they almost always think of Him in the thirdperson: “He,” not “You.”This much “faith” the Christian must grant people in other religions also. Withsuch a tepid approach to religion, there cannot really be any difference betweenone religion and another. Every religion teaches people to be honest, truthful,kind, and serviceful. No religion teaches them to be selfish or grasping. Nor doany of them tell people to ignore God when they haggle in the marketplace.The basic virtues are much the same, in other words, and perhaps even identical,everywhere. In Western countries one hears the term, “Christian humility.” WhyChristian? Humility is esteemed in every religion. Another term one reads inWestern religious writings is “Christian grace.” Again, why Christian? Theconcept of grace was common to humanity long before Jesus Christ came to earth;his word for grace wasn’t the first time that concept had ever been mentioned.To claim otherwise would be to show almost wilful ignorance. The ancientteachings of India contain a perfectly good word for grace, one that is veryoften used in that country, and in the same sense (though I have readtheological works in which the writers insisted that the concept is absent fromHinduism). The word is kripa.Most people in all religions feel a certain distaste for fanaticism. Themajority of Christians wince at least inwardly if, for example, some zealotsings hymns loudly in public places, obviously intent on drawing attention tohimself, or if he informs everyone he meets, lugubriously, that that person isdestined to eternal hellfire for his sins; or if, to show how holy he is, hesighs openly for the sins of others. No one likes the poseur. Jesus Christ putit well:“And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they loveto pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that theymay be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.” (Matt. 6:5)Incidentally, I have always enjoyed the humor in that last sentence. Accordingto Christian tradition, Jesus was “a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.”(Isaiah 53:3) His sense of humor, however, shows repeatedly in the Gospels,usually (as here) by sly innuendo.Certain characteristics of the fanatic are worth noting. Have you ever met afanatic who possessed a sense of humor? I haven’t—not kindly humor, at least.His body, especially his jaw, is tense, indicating the inward strain on hisnerves. He can hardly converse on any subject other than his own personalobsession. He demonstrates little or no sensitivity to the feelings and needs ofothers. And he is intolerant of opinions that don’t agree with his own.Most well-balanced people define the “good” Christian, Jew, Buddhist, Moslem, orHindu as someone who minds his own business, wishes harm to no one, has goodwill toward some, and is a responsible and useful member of society. The averageperson cannot imagine that God would want more of him than this (as he considersit) exemplary life. The heroic efforts that a few men and women have madethrough the ages to find God, and to achieve higher states of consciousness mayseem to him strange, perhaps even excessive in their piety—bordering onfanaticism. If he thinks about such people at all, however, he must notice thatthese seeming “overachievers” are at least inoffensive, and that they actuallyshow enviable qualities such as humility, compassion, non-judgmentalness towardothers, and even sympathy for them, and—well, yes, one supposes, wisdom. We are,of course, referring to those persons whom many religions describe as saints.Most people have little or no contact with saints. If they happen to hear ofthem, they may question whether they really exist.Protestant Christians, who lack the tradition of sainthood, often protest quiteseriously, “Why, we’re all saints!” A popular Protestant hymn begins with thewords, “Oh, when the saints go marching in”—giving thereby the impression thatevery sincerely believing Christian is a saint already. (The other imagessuggested by these lines are so patently unsaintly as to invite only smiles.)There come times in everyone’s life, however, when tragedy strikes: A baby isborn blind, or dead; a young mother dies while giving birth; a familywage-earner is unjustly fired from work, or contracts a fatal illness; peoplewhom one has trusted betray that trust cruelly. There are many kinds ofsuffering, but come suffering must to everyone sooner or later, in one form oranother.In the life of Buddha, a woman once approached him with the lament that her onlyson had just died. Would the Buddha, man of great spiritual power that he was,bring her child back to life?The Buddha, after expressing deep sympathy, replied, “If I am to do anything, Ishall need a special kind of oil.” (He specified which kind.) The woman, filledwith hope, was on the point of leaving when Buddha called to her and added thiscaution: “The oil must come from a home that has not seen death.”“That’s easy!” she thought. A week later, however, she returned, still mourning.“I have not been able,” she announced, “to find a single home that has not seendeath!”“My daughter,” the Buddha gazed at her commiseratingly, “now do you understand?Death is the lot of every being. Whether it come early in life or late, come itmust. The Dharma (Divine Way) I have brought to humanity cannot save people fromdeath. What it can do is help to prepare them for every vicissitude, so thatwhen death or any unexpected loss comes, they can face it calmly andacceptingly.”How much suffering people experience in this world! So long as a person ishealthy and prosperous, lives in a happy family, owns a nice home, and isrespected by others he is seldom concerned over other people’s tragedies. Yettragedy awaits him, also. Relentlessly it stalks his trail. It may lurk justaround the next corner, or over the next hill. How strange, that when peoplefind themselves plunged suddenly into a sea of suffering it isn’t long beforethey cannot imagine ever emerging from those waters again. Grief, to them, seemstheir eternal reality. Yet when their hearts again soar in happiness, they verysoon can’t see themselves ever weeping again. Life’s fulfillments anddisappointments, however, rise and fall constantly, like waves on the ocean.Everyone alternates repeatedly between grief and happiness. He lives betweentears and laughter, every joy being an interval between two sorrows; everysorrow being an interval between two joys. The trough of every wave of sorrowrises ever and again in relief, crests in glad fulfillment, then crashes againtoward the next moment in grief. Experiencing these unceasing ups and downs inlife, there piles up in his subconscious a growing burden of painful memories.Christianity officially rejects the doctrine of reincarnation. Many Christiansprivately, however, recognize reincarnation as a truth, and, after thinkingabout it, realize that the Gospels in several places, far from rejecting thisdoctrine, actually seem to suggest it. Many Jews in those days, apart from Jesushimself, seem to have accepted it. I mentioned earlier this passage inRevelation:“To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I alsoovercame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.” (3:21) Is not thissentence very suggestive?And we read a few verses earlier:“Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shallgo no more out.” (Rev. 3:12)There is also the famous passage in the Gospel of St. Matthew, where Jesus askedhis disciples, “Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? And they said, somesay that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one ofthe prophets.” (Matt. 16:13,14)Obviously, if there were people in those times who said Jesus might have beenone of the ancient prophets, they clearly meant that he might be theirreincarnation.In another passage the Bible states, “And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man whichwas blind from his birth. And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who didsin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?” (John 9:1,2)Whether philosophically or theologically, this was an important question for anydisciple to ask his teacher. It begged to be answered in a way that would applygenerically to all similar misfortunes. The fact that John’s Gospel describesJesus as responding only to this particular case is puzzling. What he said, ineffect, was, “This man was born blind so that I might later heal him with amiracle.” I find this reply quite unsatisfactory. It seems to suggest, indeed,that a claim made by modern scholars may have merit. They claim the Gospels weretampered with, later, to bring them into line with what the scribes thoughtshould have happened. And I ask myself, did that poor fellow really have tosuffer from blindness all the way to manhood, meeting Jesus at an indeterminateage after that, just so that he might at last receive a miraculous cure? (Andwho knows how much longer he still had to live? Perhaps he died only a few yearslater, balancing—let us say—twenty-five years of blindness against only ten ofmiraculously gained vision.)It is difficult to believe that this passage is stated just the way that eventhappened. Another example like it occurs when Jesus is reported to have said:“Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, andfollow me.” (Mark 8:34) At the time Jesus spoke those words, his audience wouldhave been utterly baffled. What did he mean by “taking up his cross”? TheCrucifixion was an event still way “beyond the horizon.” Jesus may have used asimilar expression, such as, “accept every hardship that comes.” For a scribe inlater years to change such an expression to, “take up his cross,” would notreally have been presumptuous, for it would have given the same message, andmight have seemed to the scribe, assuming he did make such a change, strongerand quite fitting.A more serious question concerns that man’s blindness. I can’t imagine theperson who, in later years, prepared this gospel for dissemination wouldactually have changed anything. I can imagine him, however, omitting somethingthat the church had already decided against: the teaching of reincarnation.We’ll see, later, that an entire section must have been omitted from the Bible:the “lost years” between Jesus as a boy of twelve and later at the age ofthirty, when he began his mission.Would Jesus, however, have simply passed lightly over his disciple’s question?We are told he said, “Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but thatthe works of God should be made manifest in him.” (John 9:3) I am willing toadmit the possibility, since I can’t really believe any later scribe would havebeen so bold as to add even that one word, “Neither.” Still, I have lived with agreat spiritual master myself, and to me this answer, given in thosecircumstances, carries an aura of unreality, even of unbelievability. Thequestion those disciples posed clearly points, of course, to the issue ofreincarnation. Maybe Jesus had indicated agreement with that doctrine enoughtimes not to feel a need to say anything more about it. The omission would havebeen especially noteworthy had the question been based on a spiritual error.Still, it is striking that in his quoted reply he is supposed to have saidnothing whatever on the subject.Many babies, after all, are born blind without the slightest karmic anticipationof a miraculous cure. A human being, as opposed to a master, might see theanswer to this very far-reaching question in terms of one individual, but thewisdom of a master would surely view even this situation as a doorway also to amore universal teaching. No wise spiritual teacher, with a duty to instruct hisdisciples in universal truths, could overlook the broader issues in a case likethis. If the disciples who asked him that question were wrong in suggesting thatthat man might have sinned before he was born, Jesus would have had a duty tocorrect that fallacy immediately. And if the disciples were touching on asubject that had already been explained by Jesus, he would surely haveacknowledged the fact (rather than sidestepping the issue altogether) beforepassing on to this particular case.From all evidence, reincarnation was at least discussed among the Jews of thosedays, and was believed in by some even if it was denied by others. Elsewhere inthe Bible, after the transfiguration of Jesus on Mount Tabor, the disciplesasked him, “Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?” Jesusanswered, “Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things. But I say untoyou, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not. . . . Then the disciplesunderstood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.” (Matt. 17:10–13)Again, Jesus said elsewhere, “For all the prophets and the law prophesied untilJohn. And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come. He thathath ears to hear, let him hear.” (Matt. 11:13–15)It was not my intention in this chapter to write at such length onreincarnation. This subject deserves to be treated as a separate issue. My book,The New Path, devotes a whole chapter to this subject, and contains much moreinformation than I’ve given here. I recommend to the interested reader that hestudy that chapter. I might also mention one more passage here, in passing,which shows the subtlety of insight Yogananda himself brought to bear on thesayings of Jesus in the Gospels.At the outset of Chapter Four in the Gospel of St. John, the words appear, “He[Jesus] left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. And he must needs gothrough Samaria.” (John 4:3,4) This seems a perfectly simple and straightforwardstatement based on the fact that Samaria did actually lie between Judaea andGalilee. Yogananda stated, however, that the words, “And he must needs go,”referred to a hidden truth also, one which the disciples of Jesus may havemissed altogether. (Masters don’t often disclose the deeper reasons for thethings they do.) Jesus also (Yogananda explained) had a particular reason forvisiting Samaria. He knew that a fallen disciple of his from former incarnationswas living there. This was the woman known simply through this account as “thewoman of Samaria.”Jesus posed several tests of her sincerity, and of her readiness to receive histeaching again. He asked her for water, then hinted that he had “living water”to give her. He then said, “Go, call thy husband, and come hither.” She answeredhim truthfully that she had no husband. In fact, Jesus answered, she had hadfive husbands, and the man she lived with at present was not even her husband.It was only after she’d given him this correct answer, and had truthfullyadmitted to an embarrassing reality, that Jesus was willing to accept her onceagain as a disciple.The soul goes through countless experiences before it wins its way to finalrelease, when it is free from ego-bondage and able at last to merge back intoGod. A simple glimpse at any crowd should suffice to show, clearly written uponthose variegated faces, the buried memories and tendencies of many lifetimes.The personality, through its many incarnations, endures countless ups and downs,victories and disappointments, joys and sufferings. In the life of one who hasreached the point at last where he yearns for release, it suffices to experienceeven a touch of suffering for the thought to arise in his mind, “Must thisprocess drag on forever?”Waves of hopeful expectation and painful disappointment rise and fallcontinuously. Life assumes at last an aspect, as Yogananda described it, of“anguishing monotony.” The subconscious memory of repeated sufferings, added toeven a slight touch of pain in the present life, awakens in the heart an intensedesire for release and eternal freedom in God.The doctrine of reincarnation is traditionally rejected in Christianity. TheGospels, however, as we have seen, give a number of clear hints (of which I’venamed but a few) that Jesus Christ, and also many Jews of his time, acceptedthis teaching. Surveys have shown that many Christians today acceptreincarnation privately as a fact, or at least as a perfectly reasonableexplanation. For one thing, the doctrine explains what must otherwise seem agreat injustice, and quite inexplicable if one posits only one lifetime onearth. Is not suffering, indeed, something experienced by all? Anyone who longsfor spiritual understanding cannot but ponder that fact and ask himself first,“Why?” And then, if he is thoughtful, he wonders, “Who, then, is safe?”Buddha’s destiny had been foretold when he was born: He would be either a mightyking, or a mighty teacher of Truth and a great renunciate of all worldly glory.His royal father did his best to influence the child to accept his royaldestiny, and to prevent him—especially after the child became a youth—frombeholding any instance of death and suffering. The king surrounded his son,therefore, with every luxury and with only people who were in the glow of youth.The young prince, in spite of everything his father had done, discovered hisalternate destiny, which was to seek enlightenment. What awakened these buriedmemories in his consciousness was, first, the chance sight of an old man. Later,he beheld a man who was ill. Finally, he beheld a corpse. These three encounterssufficed to awaken in him the keenest awareness of three inescapable truths oflife. All men are subject to extremes of calamity. Understanding dawned on theyoung man; it became his absolute imperative to find a solution by which allmankind would be enabled to escape suffering forever.Buddha lived two thousand five hundred years ago. For many people today, hisanguish may seem remote; some might even consider it irrelevant to “modern”life. Yet millions of people everywhere experience the same calamities everyday—by no means less so, nowadays, than millennia ago. History affords countlessexamples of men and women, also, who turned to God all the more urgently becauseof the suffering they beheld around them, or endured in their own lives. Suchdedicated souls were by no means “fanatics.” Nor can I recall that any of thembecame (an adolescent reaction) bitter or cynical. They were realists who, atthe same time, never doubted that God is basically good. What they came tounderstand, however, was that worldly desires and attachments are bound toplunge everyone, sooner or later, into what Yogananda described as life’s “oceanof suffering and misery.”Many Christians—Protestants particularly, whose doctrines leave no room for abeatitude higher than simple, “Christian” goodness—dismiss as exaggerated theurgency with which saints have sought direct communion with God.Let me become personal for a moment, that what I write may have more immediacyfor the reader. I myself received a good, normal, Protestant Christianupbringing. My mother was a devout Episcopalian. My parents sent me fromRomania, where my father’s work caused us to live, to a Quaker School inEngland. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, we moved back to our owncountry, America. There I was sent to Kent School in Connecticut, an institutionrun by Episcopalian monks of the Order of the Holy Cross. When I returned homeon vacations, I attended church on Sunday mornings with my mother, andparticipated in many church activities. The first college I went to was, again,Christian: the Quaker institution known as Haverford College, outsidePhiladelphia.It is customary for many people, when they’ve grown old, to describe themselveswhen young as “gay blades.” In my youth, it must be stated, I was basicallyquite serious and not at all frivolous. I had a certain aptitude for athletics,for I was a fast runner, and I also loved an occasional “good time.” I alsohungered deeply, however, to know the truth. And I felt I was not getting thetruth I sought at church, nor in my scholastic studies. I cannot remember a timewhen I was not constantly, and with increasing urgency, asking of Life thattimeless question: “Why?” My growing hunger for answers was forever unanswered.My mother did believe in the saints. She tried to get me interested in themalso. In this attempt she was, perhaps unfortunately, unsuccessful. I didn’tbelieve in the miracles of which she spoke so devoutly; I lacked the devotion tofeel inspiration in their works of piety. I was, I told myself, seeking truth,not sweet sentiments.For several years my search took me far afield. At first I sought it through thesciences, thinking (at the age of thirteen) to become an astronomer. Then Idecided that truth for human beings had to have a more human reality. I gavedeep thought to political solutions, and sought answers that might helpeveryone, not only myself. In time, I discarded this direction also as I came tounderstand that no system can ever make anyone better than he is, in himself.Realizing, then, that the truth I sought was something that would inspire, andnot merely inform or impose change from without, I decided to seek truth in thearts—particularly in music and literature, for both of which I had some flair. Ihoped by these means to inspire people with an understanding of truth. Thisaspiration, too, I forsook when I realized that, not knowing the truth myself, Iwould only be flooding the world with my own ignorance if I imposed my “art” onothers.My upbringing might have led me to seek Truth in the churches. Unfortunately,what I’d found in them was not inspiration, but self-righteousness, which onlystarved me for actual answers to my own burning desire for true, universalrightness.Early in my search I reached the conclusion that what I sought must providesatisfaction for the heart. Truth had to be deeper than mere facts. I discardedboth science and social theory, therefore, as incapable in themselves ofbringing anyone true happiness. At last it dawned on me that what I reallywanted, and what everyone wanted, really, was happiness—indeed, more thanhappiness (which is forever fragile and uncertain), but joy, expansive joy, aninspiration that was eternal. This ideal became, for me, the very essence ofeverything I was seeking.It was only after reaching this decision that I began to find myself veeringtoward a truth which (I was forced to admit at last) soared up to embracespiritual dimensions. Could there really be, I asked myself, a God, Creator ofall things? People sometimes ask this question casually. In my case, thequestion was urgent; the answer to it held the only possibility of purpose andmeaning that I could imagine in Life.I had been brought up in a well-to-do home, surrounded by a loving family andmany friends. I had lived in a succession of good neighborhoods. And I’d hadheld up before me all the dreams most people cherish: a comfortable home of myown, a loving and supportive wife, an interesting and well-paying job, happychildren, good neighbors.It was with growing desperation, however, that I listened when people describedthese goals. I saw no alternative to them, yet my heart rejected them all asempty of real meaning. Life, I thought, simply had to offer more than this palesubstitute for the ideals I cherished in my heart.Gradually, I came to realize that there is only one worthwhile goal in life.That goal is to find God. Was this, I asked myself, a sign that I was becoming afanatic? My companions thought me much too serious, but I at least kept my senseof humor, and tried always to see things in a broad perspective. I accepted thatothers had goals that, for them at least, seemed valid. Often, indeed, I wishedI could be more like them, rather than forever tortured in my own seeking.Inwardly, however, I was becoming increasingly convinced that life could neverhold any meaning for me unless it brought me closer to God, whom I defined in myheart as that final perfection which all men seek.To make a long story short, I finally came upon Paramhansa Yogananda’s greatbook, Autobiography of a Yogi. I read it avidly, then took a bus almost the nextday and traveled across the American continent to meet him. My first words atthat meeting expressed something I had never imagined myself addressing toanybody. I said, “I want to be your disciple.” It was at that meeting that heaccepted me.Through him I came to understand that I had been too mental in my searching. I’dimagined truth as something I could find by thinking my way to it. I’d beenover-intellectual. Paramhansa Yogananda showed me that the way to God is, as Inow understood, through the heart. Devotion is heartfelt yearning for Infinity.Devotional love is the selfless enjoyment of that aspiration.In time I found that everything I had thought of as Christ’s message was utterlyshallow. I had thought that Jesus wanted people to be ordinarily good,ordinarily kind to others, and to hold ordinary expectations of life. Those“Christian” expectations had been, I saw, but a scratch on the surface of thedeep, inspiring love and eternal wisdom of that great divine Teacher and eternalSavior of men."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6[../Images/flower.jpg]A QUESTION OF DEGREESDid Jesus Christ say that life has a specific purpose? or did he perhaps say (asif anticipating the modern, “fair-minded” professor) that life has (“Hmm, yes, Iimagine we should say”) several purposes? Of the statements attributed to Jesus,some of them are quite unequivocal.“Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these thingsshall be added unto you.” (Matt. 6:33)This statement is surely a powerful one. It denotes an absolute purpose. What domost orthodox Christians make of it? Well, given the outwardness of their owncomprehension of religion, the only thing they could possibly make of it wouldhave an outward direction also. The kingdom of God to which most of them lookforward is a visible, tangible, three-dimensional place. (When I was a child, Itheorized that world—solid and three-dimensional—as being located perhaps on theplanet Saturn, because of its beautiful “halo.”)Most Christians think of the kingdom of God as a place of heavenly beauty, wheresouls go who have lived a good life. In heaven, they visualize themselvesinhabiting bodies much like the ones they have now, enjoying beatific happinessforever. What they think Jesus meant was that, after living as we should onearth, we’ll be admitted into his “kingdom” after death and live there “foreverafter” amid surroundings where “cool breezes blow evermore,” stroll serenelythrough peaceful, shadowed woods, sit in undisturbed comfort beside gentlyrippling streams, and wander calmly through gay, flowery meadows in the blessedcompany of angels. Perhaps, like them, we shall have wings.Salvation for most Christians means living eternally in a body, amidsurroundings very different from what Jesus Christ himself described elsewherein the Bible:“The kingdom of God,” he said, “cometh not with observation: Neither shall theysay, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.”(Luke 17:20,21)This passage, for most Christians, is quite incomprehensible. It is one theykeep, therefore, as if in a drawer, out of sight and as much as possible out ofmind. Instead, the words of that Christian hymn, “Oh, when the saints gomarching in,” suggest something closer to the popular perception: that after agood life on earth the “saint” is led to a place into which he will be able(perhaps literally) to “march.”Entry into heaven means above all, for most Christians, that one is saved. Andwhat is one saved from? According to them, from the terrors of eternal hell.Damnation is, in fact, proclaimed as the soul’s inevitable destiny, inconsequence of the Original Sin committed by Adam and Eve when they ate “theforbidden fruit” and thereby disobeyed God. It was because of that act that theywere driven from the Garden of Eden. We have inherited their legacy—so we’vebeen taught—of sinful disobedience.The orthodox dogma—clearly specified in many churches—is that mankind istherefore naturally sinful, and doomed to hell.There is a “but” here, however: We can be redeemed by special grace if we“receive” Christ, who sacrificed his life for us on the cross. Christians areencouraged to think of Jesus Christ, through that penitential offering, as their“personal Savior.” Receiving him has always been understood as the essence oftrue Christianity because of those words in St. John’s Gospel: “As many asreceived him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.” (John 1:12)That word “received,” however, demands extra-cautious attention. Does “receivinghim” mean simply formal baptism—followed years later by equally formalconfirmation? Does it mean instead, perhaps, a single ardent act ofself-offering before the altar in a church? Considering any one of theseexplanations as a hypothesis, we should submit it to the test of experience. Dopeople really emerge from the first ceremony, or at least from the second one,purged and permanently changed? Is it enough even to make a single,emotion-charged self-submission? Again, thinking of Christ’s sacrifice as havingbeen made for all men, did human nature everywhere undergo a radicaltransformation after his crucifixion?In answer to the first question, I submit once more my own experience. I was ababe in arms when I was baptized; I don’t imagine I had the slightest idea whythey were splashing me at that baptismal font in Ploesti. The question of myconsent can be written off, therefore, as a clear nolle prosequi. It was, ofcourse, sweet of my parents to offer me up to Christ at such an early age, butas far as my own will was concerned the event cannot have had my willingconsent. My baptism had to have been an imposition on my free will, since my ownpart in that ceremony could, at best, have been only to struggle and cry inoutrage at the indignity of the whole proceedings.Later, at the age of thirteen, I was confirmed by the bishop at our Church ofSt. James the Less in Scarsdale, N.Y. What this meant was that my baptismaldedication to Christ received episcopal confirmation, lest any doubt existed inmy mind that I belonged to him. Again, this happened years before I reached thelegal age of consent. Was it the purpose of my Confirmation ceremony to catch mebefore I could register intelligent protest? (Only years later would I be deemedmature enough to get a driver’s license, to vote in elections, or to pledgemyself to another person in marriage.) Did these sacraments constitute, in anysense but the liturgical, “receiving Christ”? Surely not!Does “receiving him” mean, then, some emotional or even intellectual acceptance?The meaning must go deeper. Belief alone is not enough. Consider this: We maybelieve in someone, but does our belief in any way guarantee histrustworthiness?As for a single emotional conversion—popular among Fundamentalists—again, theEpistle of Paul to Titus states, “Not by works of righteousness which we havedone, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration,and renewing of the Holy Ghost.” (Titus 3:5) The implication here is continued“washing,” and repeated “renewing.”What about humanity as a whole? Judging at least from the gloating sadism of themobs at the Roman Colosseum, where gladiators did their best to disembowel oneanother, one must conclude that the Crucifixion was not followed by any notablemass upliftment.Well then, what about the great and growing body of Christian worshipers inthose days? Did Christ die to save at least them? Any heroism they showed infacing martyrdom calmly was followed, long years after the persecutions, byshameless bickering and dissension among the prelates. It all may be perfectlyunderstandable, and even excusable, but by no stretch of the imagination may wesay of the Christians in those days that they comported themselves like “sons ofGod.”Paramhansa Yogananda stated that to “receive” Christ means to receive Christ’spresence consciously and inwardly, on a soul level, which is to say, in a deepstate of ecstasy. Anything less than that is superficial and should not be takenseriously, since it produces no real or lasting change in a person’sconsciousness and no increase of spiritual power (such as one would expect of a“Son of God”).The Pope, some time ago, described what the Roman Catholic Church has to offer.He referred to it as, “the mystery of salvation.” Mm-yes. A mystery. I supposeit would have to be something like that.Dogmatism apart, ask yourself this question: Are most Christians notablydifferent from other religionists around the world? An unbiased gaze forces theanswer: No, by no means do they seem notably so.What about those words I quoted in an earlier chapter, “Be ye therefore perfect,even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect”? This commandment makes aseemingly impossible demand of human nature. Who, then, can be considered areally good Christian? What Christ’s call to perfection demands of us is that wetry to become like God! No wonder this saying is seldom, if ever, mentioned inany Sunday sermon in the churches.Omitted from most sermons are other key statements also, like the one Jesusrepeated from Deuteronomy 6:5: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thineheart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.” The Gospel of St. Mark(12:30) quotes the same statement, adding, “[Love God] . . . with all thy mind.. . . this is the first commandment.”Frank Laubach, the great Christian missionary, once launched a campaign to getmore ministers and preachers in America simply to mention God in their Sundaysermons.What, then (to repeat my question), is the kingdom of God? Where is it? How,moreover, can we be expected utterly to love Someone we’ve never seen, and ofwhose presence we’ve never had even an inkling? Obviously, devotion grows fromexperience of at least some kind.There are a number of other sayings attributed to Jesus that suggest truths toolofty for inclusion in the usual Sunday morning sermon, and too demanding to beurged upon the average Christian (lukewarm as he is in both his beliefs and hispractices). Yet those truths form, in fact, the basis of Christ’s teachings.They comprise also part of the ancient teachings of Sanaatan Dharma.Sukdeva, a great saint of ancient India, stated, “All time is wasted that is notspent in seeking God.”Will Christians say that their own religion falls short of the heights achievedby the ancient teachings of India? If they are honest with themselves, they mustat least admit that their experience of Christ’s teachings has not yet plumbedtheir depths.In fact, Christ’s true teachings are as lofty as anything ever taught in anyreligion. Jesus Christ fully expressed the Truth, which is to say, therefore,that no teaching can (or ever could) be higher than his. To speak of relativeheights would in fact be absurd, for God is Absolute. If truth is indeed one andeternal, the question is not even debatable: The message of Jesus Christ mustbe, and by every reasonable test is, as lofty as Eternal Truth itself.Can there be relativities in the exposition of that truth? Here the answer mustbe, “Yes, of course there can. How could there not be?” Even to state a truth inwords is to bring it down from Absolute Perfection into the world of relativity.For one thing, the meaning of every dogma (a word formula) depends partly onpeople’s varying ability to understand it. The effort of dogmatists to definewith exquisite precision what they think to be an “absolute truth” must stilldepend on their own human understanding, and on their human capacity, therefore,for misunderstanding. And, let’s face it, that capacity seems, sometimes, toamount almost to genius! The formulators of those dogmas, being only men, livedunder the very human misconception that it is possible to nail down a truth“absolutely” by encapsulating it in some mere formula.Abstractions are, necessarily, elusive. Love, as a word, means different thingsto different people. It covers a wide spectrum of meaning, from brutish lust tothe absolute purity of oneness implied in the Sanskrit word, prem.Peace, too, has many subjective meanings, all the way from a temporary cessationof conflict to the “peace of God, which passeth all understanding” (Phil. 4:7)—acondition possible only in inner communion with the Lord.Joy also, finally, can mean many things depending on a person’s own experienceof life. Some people equate joy with winning the lottery. Saints equate it withthe soul’s immersion in God.Truth is absolute, but man’s understanding of it is relative. Therefore is itsaid, “Even the Devil quotes the scriptures.”It is important to realize that people’s understanding of religion is limitedeverywhere by the narrowness of their capacity for understanding. Theircomprehension even of objective reality was, during the era of Jesus Christ’slife, narrowly circumscribed. For most people, it was simply impossible in thosedays to have any concept of universal realities, even on the material plane.Aristotle, wise though he was, declared that the air we breathe is—because wecan’t see it—nothing at all. The earth (flat, of course) was located in men’sminds at the center of a comfortably small cosmos. Matter was considered solidand substantial. Our Earth’s age was computed at a very few thousands of years.And human history was estimated in the hundreds of years.Civilization is still considered, even today, a relatively recent development.For most of Christian history, reality was more or less limited to what we nowthink of as the Western world. Truth itself was thought capable of encapsulationin short, pithy dogmas. Other religions were looked upon as pagan, and onlyChristianity was believed (by Christians, of course) to be based on divinerevelation. Indeed, this last belief is still waved by theologians like a flag,though the ship they travel in is now foundering on the rocky coast ofinconvenient discoveries, made as man becomes growingly aware of otherreligions.During the early Christian era, it was simply not possible to imagine a schemeof things that embraced timelessness and infinity: a cosmic reality in which wehuman beings might seem to have hardly more significance, objectively speaking,than that of any of the other fauna on Earth.Were it not for the fact of suffering, mankind might continue in “relative” easeto stroll through life satisfied with common fulfillments, and seeking nothingmore from life than self-gratification, until death draws its final curtain overthe whole scene. There might be no problem, moreover, with happily awaitingeternity in heaven after death, even if the regrettable alternative to thatbeatitude were the possibility of eternal life in hell (which, of course, no onewants). But somehow the question, “How bad can I be and get away with it?” keepspeople hoping for the best, since anticipation of either heaven or hellcomprises so minuscule a part of their present reality.The smug satisfaction they feel in contemplating this scheme of things, however,is undermined constantly by life’s very present uncertainties, disappointments,failures, and miseries. Suffering makes people question the justice of it all.Misery plunges them into a sort of mental darkness. These stark realities keeppeople from ever becoming too smug in their happiness.For everyone who is satisfied with life, there are countless others who hurl atreligion the mocking challenge: “What about suffering? Can God really love man,when He permits so many people to suffer? Is there even a way out? If youbelieve that, tell your hopes to the sufferers!”A cosmic view of truth, however, allows even for suffering, just as a broad viewof the ocean includes all the many moods that pass over it, each of them onlytemporary and perhaps, therefore, interesting. A narrowly human view, on theother hand, forces the question, “Why me? Why must I be the one to suffer? Andhow is it that others seem prosperous and happy?” There is little visiblecorrespondence between how good (or bad) people are and the punishments andrewards to which they are subjected on earth. The common explanation—the onlyone, really—is that God’s ways are inscrutable. Resignation is easier to achieveduring prosperity than during suffering.Modern science has provided us with a cosmic view. Many orthodox Christians,even today, find it difficult to adapt to that view, even though, of course,they now accept that the world is round; that there are other religions withrelatively lofty concepts, which contain at least some portion of “Christian”truth; that our Earth is by no means central in the great scheme of things; thatthe universe is inconceivably vast; that there may well be life elsewhere in it.They accept facts, at least, that have been scientifically proved. Still, theyfind it difficult to reconcile those facts with the teachings of Jesus Christ.Christianity retains, in their view, its erstwhile anthropomorphic concepts: aHeavenly Father seated on a throne in heaven, His “only begotten Son” seated toHis right.Little effort, if any, is devoted to reconciling the dichotomy betweenanthropomorphic images and abstract truths. Facts that have been scientificallyproved are no longer denied, but they can be, and still are, kept immaculatelyseparate from people’s religious beliefs, which people confine still, as mostother religionists do, within high-walled enclosures, even if those walls needconstantly to be raised in order to protect religious belief from desecration bythe ever-new discoveries science makes.Religiously inclined Christians still think of God as their Heavenly Father.Hindus still prefer to think of Him as Krishna or Rama, whom they, too, think ofas divine beings like Jesus, and whose beloved presence they keep in theirhearts. Religious groups tend to think of their own teachings as God’s only truerevelation to mankind. It is becoming increasingly difficult, however, tobelieve that one group of people alone is in possession of the only divinerevelation.If ever orthodox Christians succeed in breaking out of their mental limitations,which persuade them that their faith is the only truth, they will find bothinspiration and understanding in the fact that those same truths are declaredelsewhere. Narrow-minded Christians are naturally reluctant to accept the dogmasof other religions, many of which claim (with equal bigotry) that Jesus was lessenlightened than their own great founders. What, however, if unbiasedinvestigation were to show them that the teachings of Jesus Christ were muchbroader and more profound than anything Christians themselves ever imagined:that it was simply their own understanding that was limited?Indeed, the purpose of this book is to offer a glorious truth, deeply inspiringto anyone who really wants to know the truth:“If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;“And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” (John 8:31,32)That Truth is wonderful to contemplate. It is, indeed, life changing. It isalso, moreover, soul-liberating. Who indeed would say, merely because people’sunderstanding of reality was once narrowly circumscribed, that Jesus himselftherefore taught that narrow view, and nothing more exalted? Preposterous!The churches are, as I have said, centered in their institutional commitment.They cannot easily even speak of the vastness of infinite Truth. Scholars, whoare also in their way seeking truth, are limited by their notion that truth mustbe sought by a process of analysis and reasoning. Only people with spiritualvision are clearly aware that the intellect, though adept at forming anddefining ideas, lacks the ability, born of direct inner experience, actually toknow Truth and God.Christian saints have labored under the disadvantage of church control. Theauthorities in any church, moreover, few of whom have had deep spiritualexperience, cannot be relied upon to promote those deeper truths, even thoughthe truths are clearly stated in Jesus Christ’s message.India has had one definite advantage: Its religion has never been formallyorganized in an institutional sense. There are, of course, certain formalbeliefs in Hinduism, but there has never been a central authority to enforcethem, nor any person in a position to dictate how those beliefs must be stated.Had a board of scientists been appointed to determine which scientificdiscoveries were acceptable, and which ones should be rejected, the scientificway-showers—men like Galileo, Newton, Albert Einstein, and a host ofothers—would undoubtedly have been declared heretics by the establishment.Einstein’s Law of Relativity was so abstruse that, when he first announced it,there were hardly ten scientists in the world who could understand it.Fortunately, they were the right ten: highly qualified men of science withalready-established reputations in the eyes of their fellows. Only because theseten men accepted Einstein’s thesis was it hailed everywhere, eventually torevolutionize not only science, but many other aspects of modern thought aswell.The greatest Christian saints have been not merely pious, kindly, charitable,honest, and scrupulously truthful—the sort of persons, in short, whom mostpeople would think worthy of emulation. What particularly distinguished them wasthe depth of their love for God, and of their absorption in Him.What of the inner communion of those saints? Could it be verified? Many testscould be applied, both subjectively and objectively. I’ve already proposed a fewof them, which were designed to show, first, that the inner, divine communion ofsaints has demonstrated almost palpably their overwhelming love, bliss, andexpanded understanding. They have given outward evidence of being utterlyfulfilled, inwardly. Every true saint has declared, of his experience of God,that there remains in him no desire for anything else. They have in common anintense focus on God’s love and joy. And all of them agree that finding God isthe only truly worthwhile goal of life.Physically, during their state of ecstasy, saints have been observed withoutbreath, sometimes without heartbeat, and with little or no outward awareness ofwhat was going on around them. Far from being mentally dysfunctional, however,as a result even of months of inner withdrawal from their surroundings, theyalways return from that state greatly recharged both physically and mentally.The testimony of the saints regarding their uplifted state of joy, and theirgreater sense of reality in that joy, is universal. Truth, as we’ve alreadystated, is universal; it is “one without a second,” and cannot be fragmented.Truth alone is also Sanaatan: Eternal.That this is the true goal of life is explained in the Bhagavad Gita, wherelife’s purpose is declared to be the soul’s merging back into God. The greatChristian saints—whose lives have been completely transformed by divineecstasy—have also declared the same truth. Many Christian saints have describeddivine union as “marriage with God.” All of them have asserted that the true aimof life is complete absorption in the Lord.Saints in the Roman Catholic Church would have been excommunicated had theyopenly revealed everything they knew. And even assuming that some of them mightnot have been affected personally by that punishment, they would no longer havebeen in a position to serve others so openly. The majority of them, therefore,have been careful not to contradict church dogmas.Persecution has been inflicted on those also who have performed miracles.Indeed, persecution has come even to those who were only outstandingly holy, andhasn’t ended until they were safely dead. It is never convenient for aninstitution that relies on self-perpetuation through dogma to admit thepossibility of an anomaly to its carefully and precisely framed formulae.One can see this matter from the point of view of the clerical authorities.Priests are all supposed to be equally ordained by “Mother Church.” What to do,then, when someone—and a priest, at that—appears on the scene who is obviouslybetter ordained than others? Priests cannot afford to have their congregationsdrifting off to some other, more divinely ordained priest. What to do aboutsaintly priests, then, who seem to have received some kind of “extra-curricular”benediction? In the case of that Los Angeles priest whom I mentioned earlier,worshipers from other congregations were forsaking their churches on Sundaymornings and flocking to his services. What then—to repeat the question—can theauthorities do about it? The line of reasoning they followed was, in their eyes,the only practical course: They banished this priestly embarrassment to thedistant clime of Spain, hoping that his reputation for sanctity had not precededhim.Thus it befell, as I said earlier, in the case of St. Joseph of Cupertino. Thissaint’s inconvenient “habit” of levitating (by no means a unique phenomenonamong saints) was causing serious concern among the authorities in Rome. Personshighly placed in society were traveling great distances to visit him. One highlyplaced visitor simply took St. Joseph by the hand while the saint was at prayer,and both of them rose high up into the air! Joseph’s superiors, as we sawearlier, felt they simply had to intervene.Therefore did Padre Pio, in the name of discretion, enjoin my friend to silence.Indeed, Padre Pio had already been reprimanded by the Church, and severalattempts were made during his lifetime to silence him. (His staunch supporters,peasants brandishing pitchforks, loyally came to his rescue.)Although the Catholic Church usually, during the lifetime of those saints, hasmade it a practice to persecute them, it has at least canonized them once theywere safely dead. The Protestant churches, by contrast, have never consideredeven posthumous recognition.The mission of Jesus Christ has proved too powerful to be destroyed, althoughscientific challenges have been raised against it for centuries from all sides,and attacks have also come, more recently, from scholars, novelists, and anyoneelse who found it profitable to jump on the bandwagon of “reductionism.” Themore Jesus Christ’s message has come under attack, however, the more it showsits intrinsic power to stand firm.Nevertheless, many Christians have found themselves not standing so firm. Theirfaith has been shaken, and their perception of reality, confused. The churchestoday are in a state of serious crisis. For these reasons, there is an urgentneed today to bring to the attention of Christians everywhere the thrilling andinsightful commentaries of Paramhansa Yogananda. Because his deep insights havecome from outside the normal orthodox enclosure, they carry a freshness and aclarity which have been somewhat dimmed by centuries of theological debate,rendering it very hard to achieve understanding within the “fold” of “orthodox”Christianity.Paramhansa Yogananda pointed out that there is in many ways an oppositionbetween true Christianity and Churchianity. To be a true Christian means toadhere to the true teachings of Jesus Christ. True Christianity cannot beshaken, since its precepts are based on eternal Truths. Churchianity, however,was created in the minds of men, by no means all of whom were wise. The churcheshave long trembled before the onslaughts of science, even if centuries ofwarding off those attacks have given them a certain fortitude. Christendom isnow being destabilized once more by many of the new claims of scholarlyresearch. Finally, it has also come under attack most recently from novelists,whose fantasies, though lacking in valid scholarship, nevertheless by theirpretense at scholarship have shaken the faith of many Christians. The Christianreligion, resting as it does on realized wisdom, can never be destroyed. WhatYogananda urged, however, is becoming now a desperate need. As I stated earlier,he urged a general return to original Christianity.My aspiration in this book is to help Christians to recognize and understand thetrue depth of Jesus Christ’s teachings. Thus alone, I believe, will they developthe new and deepened faith they need today, more than ever, in his true and eversublime teachings, which are their centuried heritage."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7[../Images/flower.jpg]RELIGION AND THE HEARTDespite rational attacks on religious orthodoxy, and the inability of orthodoxyto respond with needed clarity, there remains a vitally important aspect ofreligion which the intellect alone can never touch. These are the feelings ofthe heart, feelings much deeper than mere sentiment. Devotional feelings areevoked by religious belief, and are then strengthened by religious experience.Without the quality of feeling, it may be seriously questioned whether one wouldbe even conscious. Certainly, one could not be deeply devout.I remember accompanying a Catholic priest—a dear friend of mine who later askedme to initiate him into Kriya Yoga—to the deathbed of an old woman. She spoke tous of the joy she felt while receiving holy communion. When she discovered thatI was not a Roman Catholic, she looked at me with deep concern and said, “Oh,you don’t know what you’re missing!”I sincerely appreciated the depth of her feeling, and would never have dreamedof offering her an alternative. Her loving statement did not tempt me, however,to change my practices. The devotional upliftment she felt in the Eucharist wassomething I too experienced in Kriya Yoga, and in my other spiritual practices.The sad longing for God expressed in the Gregorian chants is uplifting andheart-purifying. So also is the joyful utterance of mahamantra, the Vaishnavachant to Krishna and Rama. Self-uplifting devotion can be experienced in manyways. Sometimes it expresses what my Guru called the “romance of religion,”which is more an upward-flowing mood of exaltation than a deep, inwardcommitment. Beyond even the sweetest emotion, however, lies the actualexperience of divine states of love, joy, soul-expansion, and bliss.It is a pity that Christians generally deride as idolatrous the devotion ofHindus for their spiritual images. In fact, those images are not idols in thetrue sense of the word. They are personifications, rather, of the ideals peoplehold concerning God and higher aspects of truth. Instead of idol worship, then,the practice deserves to be named “ideal worship.” Without devotion, no one canfind God. And without concepts of some sort, few could progress beyond the fixeddogmas of orthodoxy to a state of transcendent awareness, and (for that matter)beyond form to formlessness. Images of Krishna are no more idolatrous thanimages of Jesus Christ on the cross, which every Christian sees as a reminder ofJesus Christ’s love for us. Those who think of Christ as verily present on thealtar and in the Eucharist are not at all idolatrous, either. The consciousnessof Christ is omnipresent, so why not focalize him in something tangible, inwhich omnipresence dwells also, that can remind one of him?Images of Kali, Ganesha, Saraswati, and the numerous other divine formsvisualized in Hinduism are equally meant, simply, as focal points of devotion.Ram Proshad, a great saint who lived in Bengal over two hundred years ago, wasan exalted devotee of God as the Divine Mother in the form of Kali. Yet in oneof his most beautiful songs to Her he said, “Thousands of scriptures declare myMother is beyond all form and infinite. Nevertheless, in this form it is that Iespecially adore You.” After the great pujas, or seasons of worship, moreover,the images of Kali, Durga, etc., are immersed in the Ganges to remind devoteesthat the forms they worship are only fancied, transient images of the Infinite,portrayed in human form to make them more comprehensible, and to help people todirect their ultimate devotion to God alone.God is Absolute Love. Very few people, however, would be capable ofunderstanding divine love if it were austerely divorced from everything theyknow already: the love they have for their mothers, for example, their fathers,their friends, or for other people beloved by them.Who will say, then, that the Hindu’s love for Vishnu, Lakshmi, Shiva, Krishna,and Rama is less truly meaningful than the love that old, dying woman felt forJesus in the Eucharist? Deep devotion is, in every religion, a gift of divinegrace. No outward form can ever encapsulate it, for the Divine Consciousness isinfinite.Someone once asked Yogananda if there is any end to evolution. “No end,” hereplied. “You go on until you achieve endlessness.” Why look to forms, if gracedoes it all anyway? Because grace is like milk poured out from the breast of theDivine Mother. One’s cup of expectation must be held up to receive it. Humanlonging for God receives that grace of love, and becomes true devotion (insteadof ego-inspired pleading for divine favors).No sincere truth seeker would ever deprecate anyone’s sincere devotion, whateverform it takes. Our images of God can assume numerous forms. Whatever uplifts ourhearts’ feelings is sacred. To make my point even clearer, fanatical emotiondoes not uplift the heart’s feelings: It narrows them, first, then lowers themowing to its deprecation of others. Even sentimental devotion may lead the heartoutward, rather than upward. The direction of energy-flow from the heart is anall-important issue.Although skeptics, excessively dependent on reasoning, may be willing to woundpeople’s faith in religion, and fanatics may gloat as they denounce any beliefsthat are different from their own, true devotion, being experienced in theheart, is discerned inwardly as a flow of energy rising from that point. Truereligious feeling cannot be affected by any outer influence.Truth also is perceived by the heart, and cannot be destroyed by intellectualdoubt so long as the heart is clear in its upward aspiration. It should beadded, however, that sincere devotion may be driven into the defensive mode,which can force the energy to flow downward and resurface, later, as fanaticism.In this age, indeed, the apologists for religion tend sometimes to expressthemselves fanatically. They shout their belief loudly, as if to silence thevoice of reason, and even persecute those who disapprove of their excessivereligious zeal. Thus, dry scientific investigation, and over-intellectual butspiritually arid scholarship, have damaged many people’s grasp on religioustruth even if they try to defend it.The most dependable defense of religion comes therefore not from devotionalardor, but from direct, inner communion with God. It is this inner communionwhich has made the saints in every religion the true custodians of the highesttruths. What ardent believer, regardless of his faith, comes even close tomatching the calm, unshakable conviction of those who have achieved innercommunion with, in the case of Christians, Jesus Christ? Saint Augustine said,“Lord, Thou hast made us for Thyself, and our hearts are restless until theyfind their rest in Thee.” Could even a sincerely devout, but in human termsquite ordinary, Baptist or Presbyterian come close to making a similar statementfrom his own inner experience?Saint Jean Vianney, a much-loved priest in France, once remarked, “If you knewhow much God loves you, you would die for joy!” How many Christians, regardlessof their sectarian affiliations, could utter such words with anything like asdeep fervor?It is surely time, and long past time, for someone to speak up from outside theconfines of Christianity: to voice Christian truths from a level, not ofdogmatic faith, but of divine realization. Once again the fact needs to beemphasized: Jesus Christ’s teachings embraced the whole of cosmic reality—farbeyond even the discoveries of modern science. It is time for his words to beproclaimed in the fullness of their true meaning, which embraces all that modernscience declares and much, much more besides. It is also very much time thatsomeone of divine insight put a stop to the nonsense being spouted by so manymodern scholars who are without superconscious insight, and by novelists andothers who lack even respect, but who treat religion and its followers as ifthey were fair game for any pot shot they may feel like taking. All thesespiritual outsiders claim that they are offering new information on what reallyhappened during and after Jesus Christ’s life on earth.It is time, in short, that serious religious errors, too long expounded by theignorant, be shown up at last for what they really are: spiritually speaking,the babbling of “idiot savants”!"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 8[../Images/flower.jpg]WHENCE THE CORRECTION?I have said repeatedly that the saints everywhere are the true custodians ofreligion. What is to be done, however, when those saints are muzzled by theirown church? when they are ostracized and excommunicated by it? when a vastnumber of Christians scoff at the very need to listen to them? In Christianityas it is officially practiced, sainthood is not, so to speak, “in the driver’sseat.” Its authority is reined in, obstructed, and, as frequently as not, deniedby church authorities and, perhaps, by the majority of Christians also.Great saints have indeed lived on earth, appearing in every country, in everyage, and in every religion. There are such saints on earth, true spiritualmasters, even in these materialistic times. But how much are they able to saywhen people turn away from them with comments like, “Your opinions seem sincere,but our experience of life is our own. Why should we listen to what you have tosay?” People of true wisdom never try to impose their insights on others. AsJesus Christ counseled, “Give not that which is holy unto dogs, neither cast yeyour pearls before swine.” (Matt. 7:6)(And Christian tradition, again, accords Jesus no sense of humor!)What follows is the voice of common sense as well as of wisdom. The true authorof the following commentaries, for whom I am (as I have already said) only amouthpiece, was Paramhansa Yogananda. For nearly sixty years I have been hisdisciple. He showed himself to me convincingly as the greatest human being I hadever, or have ever met. Yogananda more than once told us who lived with him whyhe had been sent by his great spiritual teachers to the West.“The first in my line of gurus,” he told us, “Babaji, a great master in theHimalayas, recounted the following event to his chief disciple Lahiri Mahasaya[Yogananda’s spiritual grandfather, so to speak]. Babaji stated that JesusChrist had appeared to him and declared, ‘What has happened to my religion? Myfollowers are doing good works, but too many of them have forgotten the essenceof my message of direct, inner communion with God. Let us together send again tothe West the secrets for achieving that communion.’ Babaji then told LahiriMahasaya, ‘What Jesus meant was the technique of Kriya Yoga, which helps thesincere seeker to unite his soul with God.’”Babaji, in communion with Jesus Christ, promised to send, through a disciple ofLahiri Mahasaya’s, a yogi for special training. That disciple, Babaji said,would disseminate once again in the West the true message of Jesus Christ to theworld.Swami Sri Yukteswar, Yogananda’s own guru, declared to him (as stated inAutobiography of a Yogi), “You, my son, are the one Babaji promised to send fortraining.”Yogananda’s message, as he often told us, was to bring back “originalChristianity.” His further message was to make the public once more aware of“original Hindu yoga, as taught by Krishna.” Babaji himself declared to LahiriMahasaya—as was conveyed to his disciples, and as Paramhansa Yogananda conveyedto us—that he himself was the reincarnation of Lord Krishna, the divineexpounder of the Bhagavad Gita.I was with Yogananda when he finished his commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita. Hedeclared to me personally, “A new scripture has been born! Millions will findGod through this work. Not just thousands: millions. I have seen it. I know!”There has always been a subtle link between the Sanaatan Dharma in India and theline of great Judaic prophets of whom Jesus himself declared that he was arepresentative.[3] I myself have sometimes wondered—perhaps not altogetherfancifully—whether an etymological connection may not be drawn between theBiblical name, Abraham, and the Hindu concept of Brahma.Less than a month after I met Yogananda and was accepted by him as a disciple,he invited me to join him at his desert retreat at Twenty-Nine Palms,California. There, he dictated a few lessons for his yoga correspondence course.One evening, to my amazement, he included the following information: “The threewise men who came to honor the Christ Child after his birth were the line ofgurus who later sent me to the West: Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, and Swami SriYukteswar.”Yogananda emphasized at the same time the basic oneness of all true religions.The fact that he placed particular emphasis on Hinduism and Christianity was notintended by him in any sense to imply exclusivity. I think he selected (or,rather, was commissioned to concentrate on) these two because there exists asubtle link especially between these religions. Hinduism and Christianity haveremained the purest of the mighty streams of truth that God has sent to mankind.Of the Semitic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), Christianity is thepurest in the sense that its spiritual traditions still include the saints, andthe saints—the truest representatives of Christian truth—have always emphasizedthe importance of direct, inner communion with God as the path to liberation inthe Infinite.Of the great Eastern religions (Hinduism and its several offshoots, whichinclude Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism), the Sanaatan Dharma in Hinduism hasbeen most emphatic regarding the need for inner, direct communion. Indeed—andmost importantly—it alone of all religions has emphasized the highest possibleattainment, the reality referred to almost always by Jesus Christ when he spokeof heaven and of the Kingdom of God: Kaivalya Moksha, complete soul-liberationand eternal union with God, the Infinite and Supreme Lord. Indeed, every truereligion (one that is not merely man-made, in other words) leads to KaivalyaMoksha, though few Hindus, even, are aware that this final, absolute destinyawaits them at the end of their long journey through the innumerable by-ways ofignorance.That certain religions are not valid in the highest sense should go withoutsaying, for human beings naturally try to figure out for themselves the meaningof life, death, and eternity. It seems eminently improbable, however, that Godshould have waited thousands of years—the length of time that civilizations, aswe now know, have been active on earth—before sending a true revelation. Indeed,any claim Christians advance as “proof” that what Jesus Christ brought was theone true revelation, whereas what all the great teachers of other religiontaught before him was merely the fruit of deep philosophical thought, is undoneby the fact that many of those teachers, and the religions they founded, meetevery test that can be applied to Jesus Christ.Miracles? In the eighteenth century, a holy man in India, Sadhu Haridas, wasrowing a boat on a lake. His passenger was a Christian missionary. Themissionary wanted to convert him to the Christian religion. Haridas suddenlychallenged him: “Is there any miracle your Jesus performed that others could notperform also?”The fact that they were in a boat, surrounded by water, inspired the missionaryto offer, as proof, the story of how Jesus walked on the water of the sea ofGalilee.“Is that all?” Sadhu Haridas retorted. He stepped out forthwith onto the water,and walked on it. Wherever he went (thus my Guru told me the story), the boatfollowed behind him.Miracles are not in themselves the proof of saintliness, however. Certain yogisin the East have been known to possess amazing powers, yet have not been trulydeep spiritually. Haridas himself later fell, my Guru told me—albeit onlytemporarily—from his spiritual attainments.The true proofs of spirituality are ecstatic absorption in the Divine, andselfless, impersonal love. Such spirituality is evidenced outwardly, as I statedearlier, by complete non-attachment to all things worldly, by unselfish love forall, by unfailing kindness, calmness, and forgiveness, and by the outwardmanifestation of unshakable inner bliss.Differences of national outlook must also be borne in mind. Indians, forexample, are more contemplative by nature. Americans are more inventive andpractical. Julius Caesar once, commenting on the different peoples of Europe,made a few fascinating observations: The Teutons (a Germanic tribe of thosedays) were, he said, highly capable and intelligent, and therefore rose rapidlyto the top in competition with other nations. They always failed in the end,however, because they became ensuingly proud of their accomplishments. Thus,they fell from those heights. Even today, after two thousand years, the sameassessment might be made.Of the Gauls (the modern-day French) Caesar said, “If five of them happen to betogether, and four of them agree on some point, the fifth will disagree onprinciple.” Amusingly, that assessment seems rather true of the French eventoday.Of the Romans, Caesar said, “They are fickle in their loyalties, and never clinglong to anything or anyone.” That, too, was a fair assessment which might beapplied as well to Romans even today.There is a story related of a group from different countries who were assignedthe task of writing about the camel. The American flew straight to Cairo, stayedin an expensive hotel, and went out casually to observe a few camels in thestreets. He also saw one camel striding along in the desert. Returning home, hewrote his paper based on that direct, but superficial, experience.The Englishman, more careful with his money, visited the London zoo and thereobserved one or two camels. He based his paper on that slightly more carefulobservation.The German went to the nearest library, studied whatever facts he could dig upabout camels, then wrote a learned treatise, complete with footnotes, butwithout ever seeing an actual camel.The Indian returned to his room, pulled down the blinds, sat in the lotus poseon the floor, and prayed that God would drop a well-composed paper on his lap.This amusing story was told me, I should add, by a Hindu friend from Calcutta,India.There is certainly some truth in the comments one hears about the differences innational characteristics. One should, indeed, be grateful that the differencesexist. They lend a certain interesting variety—“spice,” so to speak—to thepanorama of life.There is one such difference between the various nations that has been widelynoted, and that seems also to be generally true. The outlook of Westerncountries is basically more materialistic and outward, whereas, in the East andespecially in India, it seems to be more mystical and spiritual, in an inwardsense.The Eastern view of religion—especially the Hindu—is also inclined to be moreimpersonal. This view somewhat affects people in their own lives as well. Whenaffliction comes to people everywhere on earth, their tendency is to think, “Whyme?” In the East, however, and especially (again) in India, this thought isfollowed more naturally by the thought, “Ah, well—light and darkness, pleasureand pain, joy and suffering: such contrasts are the very nature of earthlyreality.”In the West, the natural reaction, after the thought “Why me?” is to decide,“Something has to be done about it!” A Westerner may universalize his reactionalso, as people do more typically in the East, but in his case his way of doingso may be to add (and by no means resignedly), “What can be done?”—or, betterstill, “What can I myself do to improve matters?”The Western temperament is by nature executive and more inclined to assumeresponsibility. The Eastern is more naturally open and accommodating. These twoattitudes should, ideally, be balanced, for balance leads to that cancelling ofduality which is perfection.It should be pointed out, however, that Jesus Christ was essentially anEasterner. His teachings contain definite undertones of what has been called“Eastern fatalism.” Consider his counsel, for example:“Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink?or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?“(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Fatherknoweth that ye have need of all these things. . . .“Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought forthe things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.” (Matt.6:31,32,34)(Incidentally, that last sentence is another example of his wry wit. One can seehim expressing it with a slight smile.)This counsel, be it noted, is very different from what one would expect from anAmerican chief executive (in other words, a “Gentile”!).Thus, I suggest again that a study of Eastern religions may provide evenChristians with a new, and perhaps deeper insight into their own religion. TheEastern view—perhaps particularly that which is known as Hinduism—tendsespecially, because of its impersonality, to be particularly receptive to thediscoveries of modern science. Indians have had no discernible difficulty withthe discovery of the vastness of the universe; with the great spans of cosmictime; with the relative insignificance of our planet Earth; and with man’sapparent unimportance in the great scheme of things. These relatively newscientific discoveries have not been the challenge to the Eastern—and perhapsespecially, again, to the Hindu—perception of reality that they have been to theChristian churches.The Hindu scriptures, particularly, have always described vast aeons of cosmictime. The statement by modern astronomers that the material universe is billionsof years old was fully anticipated in India, whose ancient seers held that a“Day of Brahma” (the time-span of one cosmic manifestation) lasts billions ofyears, and is followed by an equally long “Night of Brahma.” According to thoseteachings, these cosmic “Days and Nights” have recurred in endless succession.If we compare that claim with the Biblical account of Creation, in which Godcreated everything in six days (ending with a seventh day of “rest”), it soonbecomes evident why Hindus may, with their view of reality, have found it easierthan Christians to accept the actual age of the universe.A corresponding belief in Hinduism, which many Christians have rejected, is thedoctrine of reincarnation. Most Hindus take this doctrine for granted. It fitscomfortably into their perception of vast periods of cosmic time. (Is it notperfectly possible, in that great scheme of things, that the duration of our ownexistence is comparably vast?) Christian “authorities” formally insist thatreincarnation is not a Christian teaching. We have already seen, however, thatsome of Christ’s statements suggest this doctrine very clearly.One basic difference between the Western and the Eastern view of reality is theway each views cosmic creation. The executive side of human nature acts uponthings from without. In this mode, human beings mold or sculpt a statue; theycreate a painting by placing lines and layers of color on a canvas; they makemotors by molding pieces of metal, then screwing or welding them together. Life,by contrast, always grows outward from within. The Eastern view is morenaturally inclined to think of creation as a process of becoming.Consider how a human being is formed: first, by the union of two cells, thesperm and the ovum, which then subdivide, ultimately to produce the body. Plantsgrow from little seeds. Life, in other words, manifests altogether differentlyfrom the objects man produces. As the American poet Joyce Kilmer wrote, “OnlyGod can make a tree.”The Indian view of life accommodates itself more naturally to the concept thatall things are formed from within, rather than imposed on Nature from without.Ancient wisdom claims that God dreamed the universe into existence. In otherwords, He became the universe—without ever changing, even slightly, His ownaloof, ever-watchful nature.Christians have imagined God producing the universe as if out of a hat, like astage magician. Nowhere, to my knowledge, has the process of Creation beendeeply pondered. “He just made it. What more do we need to know?” These wordsdescribe most people’s way of explaining it all. The Hindu teachings, however,and (if you think about it) the New Testament also, give a virtually identicalexplanation for cosmic beginnings. The first verses of the Gospel of St. Johndescribe God as becoming the universe:“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.“The same was in the beginning with God.“All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that wasmade.“In him was life; and the life was the light of men. . . . And the Word was madeflesh, and dwelt among us.” (John 1:1–4,14)These verses contain much food for thought. Although St. John seems, at firstglance (because of those words, “. . . and dwelt amongst us”), to be referringonly to Jesus Christ, everything was, in fact, “made” that way: the vibration(word) of God’s consciousness which manifested the universe became it. It didn’tmold it: It may indeed be said to have become it from the inside out, from aninfinity of central points outward, to an infinity of artificially formedcircumferences.I’ll give Paramhansa Yogananda’s explanation more fully in a later chapter. Fornow, let us contemplate the increasingly pressing question: What is God?[3] “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets. I am not cometo destroy, but to fulfill.” (Matt. 5:17)"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 9[../Images/flower.jpg]WHAT IS GOD?Many Christians, it is said, visualize God as the venerable old man Michelangelodepicted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican. That famous workshows the Lord manifesting Adam, the first man, by pointing a forefinger in hisdirection. (Of incidental interest is the shape of one of Adam’s lower legs, theknee raised in an attitude of relaxation. Clearly suggested here is the body ofa woman, Adam’s wife, her breasts evident in two natural-seeming bulges on theknee; her body artfully suggested in the curve of his calf and shin bone.)Christians do commonly think of God, in fact, as their Heavenly Father, for sodid Jesus Christ address Him.On the other hand, because people simply cannot bridge the gap between what mustobviously be the impersonal Creator of such a vast universe and ananthropomorphic (human-shaped) being, they come up with concepts that seem tobe, according to their understanding, more logically satisfying. I mentioned oneof these brave attempts earlier: “The Cosmic Ground of Being.” People, insuggesting concepts like these, no doubt congratulate themselves on theirphilosophical nicety. They don’t stop to consider that they’ve provided no clearimage at all. If God is love—as everyone with direct experience describesHim—then such intellectual definitions deprive the Almighty of the only claritywe can have about Him.God is no mere abstraction: no force, merely, like the wind, or lightning, oreven energy. What has one understood, after sticking such a label onto theInfinite as “The Cosmic Ground of Being”? A bottle of strawberry jam may have alabel calling it that, but unless one knows what strawberries are and what jamis, the label won’t have any meaning for him. Can anyone say what is meant by a“ground of being”? Does it help anyone to call it, moreover, cosmic?All right then (one may ask), does the word “love” suggest a clearer meaning?Not unless we tie it down to something we have ourselves experienced. Otherwise,the objection of abstraction, here too, is valid. “Love” is nothing more than aword. To a Frenchman who knows no English, it is a sound without meaning. Werehe, on the other hand, to speak of “amour,” a Scotsman might think he wastalking about a moor with gorse on it. I hope I don’t sound too facetious. WhatI’m trying to say is that the only way to get some “handle of understanding” onany concept at all is to relate it to something we know already.That is why even the description of God as Love needs to be tied down tosomething comprehensible in human terms. In Spanish the expression, “I loveyou,” translates as “Te quiero,” which is to say, “I want you.” In Italian theexpression is, “Ti voglio bene,” which is to say, “I want the best for you.”Both cases imply the concept of desire. Divine love, however, is beyond alldesire. How can people even conceptualize divine love as it truly is?In Sanskrit, there are several words for love, prominent among which are kama(desire), bhakti (devotion), and prem (cosmic, selfless love, which beholds allbeings with kindest feeling as manifestations of the one Self). This last aspectof love is the most difficult of all for ordinary human beings to understand.The answer, then, is simply to start with whatever understanding we havealready. A “cosmic ground of being,” as a concept, offers no ground to stand onat all!Let us begin with that masculine pronoun: “He.” If we identify it exclusivelywith a male being we overlook, or even reject, the equal reality of thefeminine. If, on the other hand, we try to express ourselves exactly byreferring to God as “He/She,” we may perhaps satisfy some personal desire toavoid bias in the matter, but we won’t really clarify anything. God is bothmasculine and feminine, true, but God is also neither masculine nor feminine. Asa great woman saint in India, Ananda Moyi Ma, said of that InfiniteConsciousness: “It is and it isn’t, and neither is it nor is it not.” (Try tofigure that one out!)The commonly used masculine pronoun for God poses a problem only as long as onethinks of it as exclusively masculine. The word, “He,” however, is also, atleast in English, the impersonal pronoun. It spares one the redundancy ofrepeating “one” too often: “When one listens to music, he [not ‘one’; and not‘he/she’] likes to enjoy it.” “He” works better than “it” if one is trying todescribe a conscious being, to whom we can relate also personally. I myself liketo think of God as my Divine Mother. If I’m trying to communicate with others,however, I speak of God as “He”; in my mind that word embraces both themasculine and the feminine aspects, whereas “She” would stand out in my mind asartificially feminine.We are all human, and must think and communicate in limited terms for the simplereason that our human understanding is, itself, limited. “Father” is not anabsolute concept when referring to God. It shows shallowness even to try to beabsolute. Far simpler is it—and, because it is comprehensible, far cleareralso—simply to discard all attempts at intellectual preciseness and concentrateon concepts that uplift the heart’s feelings in an undefined but clearlyexperienced, loving aspiration toward the changeless Bliss for which all of us,consciously or unconsciously, yearn.The West has been conditioned to the Aristotelian method of reasoning, with its“either . . . or” alternatives. In India, a different—and perhaps also more“reasonable”—concept is in common use: “both . . . and.” This attempt to combineseeming opposites, though it is sometimes scoffed at as “woolly-minded” in theWest, offers a way out of the dilemma Christians face when they try to visualizea reality so vast and impersonal as to be, ultimately, incomprehensible.All saints who have experienced God describe “Him” (or Her) as Love Itself. Withalternatives that are mutually inclusive, instead of exclusive, there is agreater possibility of universality. My earnest plea to the reader is, Don’t getcaught up in the thought that you’ll ever be able to define God perfectly; tryto experience His presence in your heart. As that experience grows, it willgradually encompass more and more of the cosmic reality which God really is.The divine consciousness is simply beyond conceptualization. Jesus Christ said,“Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.” (Luke 12:7) His words leadinescapably to the conclusion that the Divine Consciousness is both vastlyinfinite and minutely infinitesimal: aware equally of the largest galaxy and ofthe smallest electron. Indeed, since the concept of omniscience has never beentheologically challenged, this concept demands that we think of God as bothimpersonal and personal.God wants nothing from us. In that sense, then, He is completely impersonal. Atthe same time, however, He is very intimately personal where we ourselves areconcerned, for He wants for each of us, His creatures, the perfection ofabsolute Bliss. Sanaatan Dharma (I prefer this ancient name for what is commonlyreferred to as Hinduism, which Christians falsely accuse of idolatry) offers ablend, one which, to reason itself, is perfectly acceptable, between God as bothimpersonal and personal.God, as Krishna explains in the Bhagavad Gita, and as I said earlier, dreamedeverything into existence. He couldn’t mold anything, outwardly, for there wasnothing “out there” to mold—nothing in existence anywhere but His ownconsciousness. As trees grow from seeds, and as animals develop from the unionof two cells, male and female, even so the Infinite Spirit brought everythinginto existence from an infinity of individual centers—dreaming outward, so tospeak, from the center of each of them.Artificial, man-made threads are solid all the way through. Nature-made threadshave a hole passing through their center, to allow the life force to passthrough them.Thus, Divine Consciousness was described by my Guru as “center everywhere,circumference nowhere.” This, surely, is what Jesus meant also when he said,“Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of Godis within you.” (Luke 17:21)Many teachings in the Bible are either allegorical or metaphorical. Thisstatement by Jesus, however, is more suggestive than allegorical. “Within what?”one asks. Kingdoms cover large expanses of territory. What could Jesus havemeant by this implication that God’s vast kingdom lacks any outward dimension atall? One hears of someone making a confession by “baring his breast,” but evenheart surgery hasn’t shown that any “kingdom” resides in there!Let us begin with the most literal explanation: God, residing at the center ofeverything, dwells at the heart of every atom. He knows us human beings from the“inside out,” and perceives the least flicker of our thoughts and feelings. In atrue sense, indeed, He is those thoughts and feelings.“Kingdom,” then? What can he have meant by that word? Only this, surely: Timeand space, in Divine Consciousness, are illusory. So also, indeed, is creationitself.Until recent times, mankind had to be satisfied with believing that God simplydid it all, somehow. His “magic” was quite beyond man’s power ofconceptualization. One might say that, in popular fancy, He produced theuniverse (as I suggested earlier) like a magician producing a rabbit out of ahat. Nowadays, however, with the expansion of man’s knowledge to infinity, andwith the subtle insights science has given us into the inner workings of theatom, it is possible at last to ponder a little realistically the “hows” ofCreation.Be warned, however: The explanation will take you farther afield than you mayexpect!Science, as I stated earlier, has discovered that matter is composed ofinnumerable vibrations of energy. Indeed, Yogananda said that vibrations ofenergy are only a part of the picture. On a subtler level, energy is projectedby vibrations of ideas, which in turn are projected by will, which is itself avibration of pure consciousness. The stillness of the Supreme Spirit’s awarenessis set in motion to produce cosmic ideation.Thus did Paramhansa Yogananda explain the whole of Creation. The Spirit—evercalm, ever motionless, Absolute Bliss—set in motion a portion of itsconsciousness. Since movement itself is not absolute, and always implies,moreover, in any direction, its own opposite, Infinite Consciousness had tomanifest the principle of duality—dwaita, in Sanskrit. Movement in any directionmust be compensated for by an equal and opposite movement. Thus, a tuning forkproduces sound when its tines are struck, as they move in opposite directionsfrom a state of rest in the middle.More suggestive even than the tuning fork is the image Paramhansa Yoganandaoften gave of an ocean, with its waves ever rising and falling. No rising wave,regardless of its height, can make the slightest difference in the overall oceanlevel, for every upward movement is matched by a corresponding downward one.Every crest is matched by a trough.The Eternal Spirit remains ever untouched and unaffected by cosmic creation. Theword, “vibration,” signifies opposite movements from a state of rest at thecenter. On this principle of vibration, called dwaita or duality, not only thematerial universe but all manifested existence was brought into being.Here we find ourselves suddenly stumbling upon a deep scriptural truth. TheChristian Trinity of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost (or Spirit) is,Yogananda stated, a fundamental and universal truth symbolically stated. In thetraditional human household, the father goes out from home to provide sustenancefor the family. Though he comes back in the evenings, he is less directlyinvolved with the family life than the mother. God the Father, similarly,remains aloof, in a sense, from His creation, though sustaining it. The mothersymbolizes the Holy Ghost, or Holy Spirit, which manages and maintains the home.The Son is the outcome of the union of these two.The Book of Genesis states:“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.“And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of thedeep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” (Gen. 1:1,2)Here we see the inspiration for Yogananda’s image of the ocean. God “moving”upon the surface of the vast ocean of consciousness, like the wind passing overit and raising waves, affords a clear image of how the Supreme Spirit vibratedits consciousness to produce the vibratory “waves” of manifestation.God, the Spirit, is those waves: He didn’t produce them out of nothingness. Theuniverse is a vibration of innumerable thoughts upon the surface of the infiniteocean of consciousness. That Holy Vibration constitutes, as I have indicated,what the Bible calls the “Holy Ghost,” or “Holy Spirit.” The word, Ghost,suggests an invisible, self-conscious reality. In essence, the Supreme Spirit isbeyond movement and therefore beyond all duality. Movement is not a createdreality. Rather, it is a manifestation of the Supreme Being, Existence Itself.Because creation depends on consciousness—indeed, is a manifestation ofconsciousness—that Supreme Spirit, untouched by all movement, is also presentthroughout creation. The cosmic Stillness is reflected in every vibrating atom.The still, unmoving consciousness is not only aloof, but is also present in allthings as a reflection, just as reflections of the sunlight appear in countlessslivers of glass. That reflected presence is omnipresent in creation. Thisomnipresent reflection of the Supreme Spirit in all creation is a cosmicreality. It is the one and only true Christ, for which “the only begotten Son”is but a metaphor.Jesus had attained that state. Therefore he was called the Christ. All souls whomerge consciously into the Infinite attain that all-pervading state ofconsciousness.I once asked my Guru, “To what state must one have attained to be called amaster?” He replied, “One must have reached Christ consciousness.”The Christ has no form, for it is omnipresent. As the ocean is present in eachof its drops, but no drop can be identified with the whole ocean, so theuniversal Spirit of Christ was manifested in Jesus, but could not be evenremotely defined in terms of his human form. All souls who attain the state ofoneness with the Christ consciousness lose, inwardly, their sense of fundamentalindividuality and become what are called masters. All of them are equals ofJesus Christ.Does what I’ve written here sound blasphemous? Please consider this importanttruth: Jesus was not born on earth to show people how great he was. He came toshow us the greatness of our own divine potential.When the Jews accused him of blasphemy for his statement, “I and my Father areone,” he answered them, “Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?“If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripturecannot be broken [gainsaid];“Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thoublasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?” (John 10:34–36)From what I have stated so far it should be obvious that countless layers ofmisconception need to be removed from popular understanding before these truthscan be widely understood. Consider this point, however: How could God, theInfinite Spirit, have produced one unique human offspring, a tiny human beingwho lived a mere thirty-three years on this little mud ball, our Earth—a single,tiny being in the vast universe, with its hundred billion galaxies. How couldone such being be, in some unaccountable way, unique?Imagine yourself living on a vast continent, educated into the universalrealities that modern science has revealed, but knowing nothing of the teachingthat Jesus Christ was the only son of the Almighty Spirit, Creator of the wholeuniverse. Then imagine a missionary arriving on that continent from a littleisland in the Pacific and trying to persuade you that the founder of hisreligion taught that he alone was identical with God. What would you think?Wouldn’t you say, “Your view is unbelievably insular”? And if he announced,further, that you could be saved only by accepting that one human being as theSon of God, wouldn’t your first question be, “Saved from what?”Imagine all this, I say, and then ask yourself, Would that missionary succeed inhis efforts to convert you? Surely not, if you were blessed with the slightestmeasure of common sense. To be converted from ignorance is desirable; to beconverted to it, however, seems absurd. And how else could that missionary’sefforts be described?There is no reasonable justification for insisting that spiritual and scientifictruths be kept in separate, airtight compartments. Yet that is what they simplymust be if one persists, in the name of religious truth, in making claims thatfly in the face of what everybody knows to be reality.These apparent contradictions can, however, be resolved. Paramhansa Yoganandawas sent to America to explain to Christians the truth that unites science andreligion. Indeed, what he taught soars high above the relatively pedestrianclaims of material science, for he showed that life everywhere is divine. Heshowed, further, that the mission of mankind (and, eventually, of all creatures)is to transcend the cosmic illusion and rediscover one’s own, eternal nature asever-existent, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss.A certain amount of spadework may be necessary for the layers of misconceptionto be removed, but let us see whether I can explain these things more clearly,next.Our question now must relate to who we, ourselves, really are."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 10[../Images/flower.jpg]WHO ARE WE?“And one of the scribes came, and having heard them [Jesus Christ and themore-or-less atheistic Sadducees] reasoning together, and perceiving that he hadanswered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?“And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is Hear, O Israel;the Lord our God is one Lord: And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thyheart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength:this is the first commandment.“And the second is like [unto it], namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor asthyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.“And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for thereis one God; and there is none other but he:“And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and withall the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, ismore than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.“And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art notfar from the kingdom of God.” (Mark 12:28–34)In my first full-length book (which still, to my mind, is one of my own majorworks), Out of the Labyrinth (subtitled, “For those who want to believe, butcan’t”), I quoted two contrasting statements: the first, by the French nihilistJean-Paul Sartre, and the second, from the sacred works of India: “Jean-PaulSartre [I stated] said it for the lower elements in human evolution when hewrote, ‘To be conscious of another means to be conscious of what one is not.’And the Taittiriya Upanishad of India said it for the highest with this ringingcry: ‘The Spirit Who is here in a man, and the Spirit Who is there in the sun,it is one Spirit and there is no other!’”Let us, from a point of view of simple reason, based on modern scientificknowledge, consider the question, “Who are we?” I say “based on,” becausescience of course, being fundamentally materialistic, thinks of consciousnessitself as a mere product of brain activity. Still, science has discovered thatmatter is only a vibration of energy. Several scientists have come,individually, to suspect that energy is only a vibration of thought. And fromthere it requires no great mental leap to see that thought can only be avibration of consciousness. The French philosopher René Descartes was mistakenwith his famous declaration, “I think; therefore I am.” His mistake lay in thefact that consciousness cannot but precede thinking; it cannot, therefore, be aproduct of anything. Deep awareness actually demands a suspension of mentation.It would be truer to restate Descartes in these words: “I am aware that I exist:therefore, I am able to think.”St. Teresa of Avila described the fourth stage of prayer as coming when the onewho prays, while intensely aware, is yet incapable of thinking at all. Thought,to repeat, is a lower level of conscious activity, and belongs only to theconscious mind, not to the Superconscious.Let us, then, address again a subject we touched on more lightly earlier. Ofpresent concern are two essential questions: first, How did God create theuniverse? and second, How did He create us human beings? Nothing existed, in thebeginning, except His consciousness. It was only out of that consciousness thathe could create anything at all. Consciousness itself is the fundamental realityof all creation. Whence, then, our own, human awareness? It could only be amanifestation of God’s Infinite Consciousness. (As that scribe we quoted said,“There is none other but he.”) And whence, finally, comes our self-awareness?This, too, had to manifest itself out of God’s consciousness. God alone is—andindeed, could not but be—our Infinite Self.Consciousness that is completely lacking in Self-awareness is possible only, ifat all, at very dim levels of awareness; the lack is impossible at higher levelsin more evolved creatures, what to speak of in Absolute Superconsciousness? Foreven though the sense of separate individuality must, at that highest level, betranscended in absolute oneness, there can only be, in that state, theconsciousness that one is still aware!Material scientists are shallow in their belief that consciousness is a productof brain activity. They even postulate the possibility that computers willsomeday become sophisticated enough to be conscious. Literary fiction in theearly twentieth century was fairly littered with science fiction accounts ofman-made machines that rose up in revolt against their human creators. Theearthworm, however, which displays a minimum of physical complexity, issufficiently aware, even so, to squirm away from a threat if it perceives one.Earthworms, moreover, have even been successfully trained to select one channelthrough which to move in preference to another, when a tempting reward wasplaced at the end of one channel, and an electric shock awaited them at the endof the other.Self-evidently, consciousness precedes brain activity. It is, indeed, present ineverything. It is the “bedrock reality” even of granite. All things are, in thelast analysis, emanations of Infinite Consciousness.Orthodox science tells us (strange, that anyone should be speaking already ofscientific orthodoxy!) that matter is composed only of vibrations of energy.Why, then, do rocks seem so hard and solid? Why do our bodies seem sosubstantial? And why is it that the air itself, though seemingly insubstantial,shows an awesome power to destroy during a hurricane?Consider once again the tines of a tuning fork. As they vibrate, they create theillusion that a certain mass exists between the outer limits of their movement.An airplane propeller in rapid rotation appears as a solid disk. An infinitenumber of vibrations can be understood, similarly, as producing the vast arrayof appearances in the world around us. All things are simply manifestations ofenergy at different rates of vibration.Energy, again, is only a product of the vibration of will, projected out of aninfinity of formative ideas. The inner flow also of energy to the body depends,Yogananda said, on the strength of the will.All, then, is consciousness. All is God. There is no other possible reality inthe entire universe.You and I may seem very different from each other, separated as we are by ourbodies, as well as by our personalities. But what if we hadn’t bodies andpersonalities at all to define us? We should still be self-aware, ifconsciousness is the cause of our bodies, brains, and personalities. We’d haveto be aware of having some individuality as long as there remained even theslightest degree of self-limiting definition: the thought, for instance, “I amhappy,” or, “I am sad,” or indeed any other self-defining concept that we’veadded to our accumulating burden of outward, human existence.What, then, if even the most nebulous self-definition were to disappear? Whatwould remain? What if there were nothing left but consciousness itself?This had to be the dilemma people faced who came after the Buddha, and who neverfully understood him. Once all human qualities have disappeared in the finalextinction of karma and, with that, of all individuality—which is the meaning ofnirvana—what can possibly remain? Well, for one thing, what remains isconsciousness itself.The ocean still exists, even when all of its waves subside. Consciousness is nota product of anything: It is self-existent. Consciousness is the One Reality outof which everything manifests.Many people ask the question, Who made God? The answer is quite simple: No one!No one possibly could have. Causation is possible only in this realm ofrelativity. God, the Supreme Cause, is beyond relativity itself. He is absolutebecause there is nothing else in existence except God; nothing, therefore, canbe in any relation to Him.One may ask, then, Is it possible to define consciousness beyond merely statingthat it exists? Do you see where I’m heading? My problem is how to explainmyself logically. Every human state of consciousness identifies itself with someoutward appearance—something identifiable with this realm of relativity. Peacesuggests something to which it can be contrasted: conflict, or turmoil, or thesimple absence of peace. Light suggests its opposite: darkness. A sense of powersuggests the existence of something over which power can be exerted. The conceptof energy suggests some kind of kinetic activity. Even potential energy suggeststhe possibility of eventual kinesis. Happiness, too, suggests contrast with itsopposite: unhappiness. Even love suggests an object of some kind. Bliss, indeed,may be defined as the fulfillment of love, but in itself Bliss alone isabsolute, implying as it does the perfection of calm joy. Otherwise, joy too isan emotion, and may be compared to a rising wave. Just as every rising wavesinks in time to become a contrasting trough, so every emotion alternates,wavelike, between itself and its opposite. Joy, too, sinks in time, to becomeits opposite, sorrow.At this point, logic itself becomes so finely drawn that one would need to viewit with suspicion until one had actual supporting evidence. For logic, too, mustbe based on something substantial. Of feeling one can say that it, too, mustarise from something: It cannot manifest itself from nothing. As consciousnesscannot arise out of unconsciousness, and as something cannot manifest itself outof nothing, so feeling, too, must be included in this syllogism. The fact thatfeelings exist means they must arise out of some actual “reservoir” of feeling,and not out of a total absence of any feeling at all! If absolute consciousnessexists, then feeling too must be an aspect of that consciousness.When the waves of feeling—which man experiences as ego-motivated emotion—becomecompletely stilled, they cannot but sink into a calm “reservoir” of feeling.They cannot be a product of unfeeling awareness.One question remains: What must be the nature of this vast feeling? Could it,even possibly, be misery? Absurd! Misery springs from an awareness of lack, andsimply could not exist were there no such awareness. Only absolute fulfillmentcould provide the sense of completeness that is absolutely satisfying. Thesimple fact that consciousness itself has to be self-existent and complete initself can only mean that conscious feeling, too, is absolute, self-existent,and complete in itself. Emotional joy, on the other hand, is not absolute, forit is inevitably accompanied by its opposite: sorrow. Bliss is what remainsafter every qualification of emotional ups and downs has been removed.So far logic is able to take us, pointing the way ineluctably to our conclusion.Logic alone, however, cannot ever satisfy us completely, for at best it can onlypoint to the doorway, beyond which lies Bliss. Bliss, then, must ever remain theone sublime truth which can never be proved, but can only be experienced. It canbe inferred by the process of logic, but this is all that logic can accomplish.Therefore the Shankhya philosophy states, “Ishwar ashidha”—“God is not proved[or provable].”Here again, therefore, we find ourselves thrust back upon the need forsuperconscious experience. The universal experience of all Self-realized saintsis the same: God alone, and God as Bliss!What of self-awareness? As human beings we are accustomed to thinking of “self”in terms of our bodies and personalities: our “little bundles ofself-definitions”—terms which admit the existence of selfhood also, butseparately, in others. Our underlying consciousness, too, is of an inner centerin ourselves, separate from other people’s centers. Where there is separatenessof any kind, there has to be a self-isolating circumference, which, in our case,consists of our self-definitions.What, now, if that circumference were completely removed?Paramhansa Yogananda described divine vision as “center everywhere,circumference nowhere.” If our delusive circumference of self-definitions wereremoved entirely, then either what remained, Conscious Bliss, would be aware ofitself or it would be aware of nothing at all.The term, Self-realization, means the discovery that we are, in our deepestreality, that eternal, absolute, infinite, ever-blissful Self.Swami Shankara, many centuries ago in India, confronted the Buddhist dogma ofatheism with the realization—common to every enlightened master, includingBuddha himself—of the supreme truth: God is Satchidananda—Ever-existing,Ever-conscious, Ever-new Bliss.All of us are individual reflections of Absolute Bliss. Therefore we all seek toavoid (or to be rid of) pain, and to find happiness. We are, as I’ve said,circumscribed by our self-definitions, but there must be something within usthat does the defining. Those self-definitions comprise our “circumference.” Andwhen all self-definitions are removed, the circumference itself disappears.Think of an onion. When it is peeled, nothing is left; the onion consists of itspeels. With us, however, there is something left, something real. That “realsomething” is conscious bliss. Everyone who has gone this route has discoveredfrom experience that this is, eternally, what remains: Bliss.Cosmic Bliss is also, of course, self-aware.Your ego and mine, stripped to their essence, have no individuality. We aremanifestations, both of us, of the Eternal Self: the Supreme Spirit. That is whythe goal of all spiritual endeavor is well described by that combined word:Self-realization.Everything in existence—including, as a logical necessity, every creature andevery ego-motivated human being—has its reality only as a manifestation ofBlissful Self-Awareness. The goal of all striving cannot be anything butreabsorption into that Infinite Self.Yogananda used the illustration of the flames on a gas burner. Every flameappears to be individual, but we know that it is a manifestation of the onereservoir of gas underneath. We can even imagine each flame as different inappearance—if, for example, a different chemical powder is sprinkled onto eachof them. All of them, nevertheless, manifest the same underlying gas.Each of us, similarly, is unique. “Every atom,” as Yogananda put it inAutobiography of a Yogi, “is dowered with individuality.” The Supreme Spirit isthe true Self of everything and everyone in existence. Being “centereverywhere,” moreover, the Eternal Reality exists individually, at the center ofeach appearance.What this deep truth signifies is that you, I, all beings, and everything in theuniverse are expressions of that one Reality. All of us, tiny bundles ofself-definition, must gradually strip away our separate identity and realizeourselves as the infinite, eternally blissful Self.To know everything about even one atom would be to know the secret of existenceitself. We can never know anything, however, outside ourselves—except as anextension of our own understanding. A turtle cannot appreciate the beauty of agreat painting. A sex addict cannot appreciate the inner freedom and mentalclarity that come from living a pure life. The only point in creation that canever be probed to its ultimate reality is one’s own self, one’s ego.To understand all that there is to know about a single drop of ocean water is,in a sense, to understand the whole ocean. Granted, one might not, with thisknowledge, know anything about the ocean’s vastness, or about the awesome powerof ocean water during a typhoon. Still, vastness and power exist only in therealm of relativity, and have no separate reality of their own. Where perfectunderstanding concerns consciousness, to be one with the ocean means to achieveAbsolute Consciousness.The apotheosis of all seeking can be achieved only by offering our little selfup to God in deep, prolonged meditation. When the soul succeeds at last, by deepspiritual effort, in merging into God, it becomes omniscient.There remains one further, important truth: In omniscience, one never forgetsthat he also manifested for a time as a particular, egoic reality. Thus we seeresolved the dilemma of how the deepest instinct in all life, self-preservation,can achieve that goal permanently by losing itself, and as it were “dissolving”itself, in God.Therefore did Jesus Christ say, “He that findeth his life shall lose it: and hethat loseth his life for my sake shall find it.” (Matt. 10:39) His reference inthe verse just prior to this one, to “taking up one’s cross,” must be understoodin the deepest sense of offering up more than physical life—which seldom bringsmore than temporary, and never completely satisfying, relief. It means, rather,offering up to God one’s limited self-awareness itself.In God, nothing is lost. God is our deepest reality—“Nearest of the near,”Paramhansa Yogananda used to call Him; “Dearest of the dear.” In the attainmentof divine omniscience, the soul never loses the memory of having once lived as aseparate, individual identity.Thus, when Jesus Christ was born it was he himself who came: not an abstractmanifestation of Infinite God, but a fully self-aware, individual expression ofGod’s Infinite Consciousness. Jesus could rightly say (as he is quoted as sayingin the Book of Revelation) “even as I overcame.” He was, as I’ve said, a livingexpression of that never-lost individuality, and was by no means a meremanifestation of the Abstract Absolute. Even though he had, in the deepestsense, transcended that individuality, he was that same being, returned to earthfor the salvation of mankind, who had lived on earth before. If he didn’t, infact, come “for the salvation of all mankind,” he came at least for thesalvation of “as many as received him.” (John 1:12)"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 11[../Images/flower.jpg]SALVATION FROM WHAT?What does it mean, to “be saved”? Someone once demanded of me, “Do you believeChrist died for your sins?”“How could God die?” was my reply.Of course, we all know what that man meant, and we all know what others meanwhen they ask, “Are you saved?” Their meaning is, “Do you accept Jesus Christ?”and, “Do you believe he died on the cross to atone for your sins?”The alternative to “being saved” is to be damned eternally to hell. Implied inthat damnation is the concept, moreover, that, without the Crucifixion, our“natural gravity,” due to the weight of our sins, is so great that it can onlysink us down, down, ever farther down among the damned.What, then, if we haven’t really been all that bad? What, in fact, if someonedies while he is still a baby, and hasn’t had time, therefore, to sin at all:what then? Or what if, as Yogananda put it, our good and bad deeds are so evenlybalanced when we die that we can neither rise nor fall: What then? The wholething seems like a puzzle wrapped in an enigma. How can intelligent peoplebelieve something so barbarous as the tenet that a loving God would damn anyone,even the greatest of sinners, to eternity in hell? But then, intelligent peopleused to believe that a round Earth would mean that if anyone were to try to goto the other side he would fall off into space. Intelligent people do sometimessucceed in holding many untenable beliefs!Paramhansa Yogananda once attended a revivalist meeting led by the famousevangelist, Aimee Semple McPherson. Thousands were present. At one point in herharangue she shouted, “You are all sinners! Get down on your knees.”Yogananda later commented, “I was the only one who remained standing, because Iwouldn’t accept that I am a sinner!”He was always fair, however; he saw things all-sidedly. When that sameevangelist, years later, became a focus of scandal, he wrote an article urgingpeople to remember all the good she had done.He used to say to us, “The worst sin is to call yourself a sinner! Why identifyyourself with your mistakes? Say, rather, ‘Naughty or good, I am a child ofGod.’” He also said, “A saint is a sinner who never gave up!” By emphasizing oursinfulness we only give ourselves all the excuse our egos want to go right onsinning! By emphasizing our potential for perfection, however, as Jesus did, westiffen our spines to go bravely on until we reach perfection.To accept one’s sinfulness is to affirm it. True, many do so from a wish to showhumility. Humility, however, is not self-abasement. If one bows continually tothe ground, casting dust onto his own head, his mind is focused on the ground,on dust, and on his head. If, on the other hand, a person stands out under theheavens at night, gazes up at the stars, and sees in them a reminder of his ownlittleness, particularly if then he thinks of the stars and not of his own lackof significance, he does well, for he passes beyond the thought of hisinsignificance to the thought of infinity. The secret of humility isself-forgetfulness. People who make a big issue of their humility makethemselves the big issue!I remember when I was new as a disciple, and was working hard to overcome atendency toward intellectual pride. I awoke one morning to the dismayingawareness that I was becoming proud of my humility!“Humility,” Yogananda used to say, “is not a put-up job!” It comes with simplynot thinking about one’s self. It isn’t what you say that matters. When greatsaints like Francis of Assisi have referred to themselves—as they have sometimesdone—as sinners, they’ve done so to deflect praise from themselves. In thatspirit Yogananda, too, never hesitated to refer to himself self-deprecatingly.In fact, however, his humility meant that his attention was always directed awayfrom himself, as a human being. As I mentioned earlier, I heard him say onetime, of himself, “How can there be humility, when there is no consciousness ofego?”Surely, from everything I’ve written so far, it is clear that salvation means tobe saved from the delusion of being a little, ego-centered dot in the universe,a human being separate from God for long aeons and condemned to live (for howmuch longer?) in a succession of little bodies. Christians imagine thatsalvation means living for eternity in heaven in a limited body. If thatdefinition of salvation means, however, that we remain trapped through eternityin these little bodies and personalities, one wonders: Can hell itself be muchworse?In truth, what it means to be saved is to be freed from ego-consciousness in therealization that God is the one, only, and eternal Truth: the sole realitybehind every deed, every thought, every feeling of every being and everyinanimate-seeming object in the universe. Our little, egoic selves will be withus until at last we break out of our enclosing walls of limited self-definition,and expand our consciousness to become one with the eternal, true Source of allbeing which is God, the Supreme Spirit: Ever-existing, Ever-conscious, Ever-newBliss.In eternal freedom, our self-awareness, as I have said, is never lost: It isonly expanded to infinity, to oneness with the Cosmic Spirit. In God, nothing islost. For although the ego is dissolved in Infinity, yet there remains always,in omniscience, the memory of that one, unique individual who lived for manylifetimes as your own, or as someone else’s, limited ego. When an enlightenedsoul comes back to earth, as Jesus did, with the pure purpose of upliftingothers spiritually, it is indeed that person himself who comes back, and notsome cosmic abstraction.Yogananda put it this way: God would never send to earth for man’s upliftment aspecial, eternally perfect manifestation of Himself, labeled God. What messageof hope, indeed, would that give us? It would be tantamount to saying, “I wantyou all to try, but it will of course be eternally impossible for you ever to bereally perfect like Me.” Doesn’t it make supreme sense that He would descendthrough souls who are already eternally enlightened, who have themselves laboredand achieved salvation in the past, and have attained perfection?This is what Jesus meant by the commandment, “Be ye therefore perfect, even asyour Father which is in heaven is perfect.” (Matt. 5:48)Salvation, then, does not mean salvation from that otherwise certain fate:eternal damnation in hell. Our true “fate” ought, rather, to be called ourdivine destiny. All of us must eventually be saved. How long it takes to reachperfection depends entirely on us. Saved we must be, in the end. The divinityinherent within each one of us will not leave us tranquil until we accept truefreedom at last, and surrender to it our very egos.Think of the commonly accepted alternative destiny: hell. Then imagine a boyborn and raised in a city slum, exposed to nothing better, and knowing no otherway of living. For him, life itself is a city jungle, a struggle to takeadvantage or be taken advantage of: to down others or be downed by them; to killor be killed. To him, it must seem perfectly natural to join a gang, if only forhis personal protection and security.Then let us say that at the age of eighteen he becomes involved in a gang war,shoots someone to death, and is then himself killed.Now, imagine the fate, according to orthodox Christian dogma, that awaits him.He is condemned to hell for all eternity. That is a long time! Christiantradition speaks glowingly of “the millennium” as if that meant something. Amillennium is a mere thousand years! In eternity, a billion years pass in theblinking of an eye.Now, then: Supposing, after a couple of billion years or so, someone says tothis ex gang member, “What are you down here for?” How would he respond?“Why,” one can imagine him saying, “now that you mention it, I don’t quiteremember! I just figure it must be what happens to everyone. In fact, by nowI’ve grown kinda used to it.”A finite cause cannot have an infinite effect.One day Paramhansa Yogananda, dressed in the orange robe of a swami, wastraveling by train in America. A fundamentalist Christian preacher, traveling inthe same carriage, saw this “heathen” as he considered him, strode over, anddemanded loudly, “Do you believe in Jesus Christ?”“Yes, of course,” Yogananda replied.Well, this wasn’t what the preacher expected to hear.“Do you accept Jesus Christ,” he persisted, “as your only savior?”“I accept God as my Savior,” calmly replied the swami, “and I believe He haseffected His salvation through many of His awakened sons, not only through JesusChrist.”This was more like it! “Unless you accept Jesus Christ as your only savior,” thepreacher thundered angrily, “you will go to hell!” (Everyone in the railroad carwas, by this time, listening intently.)“I may get there by and by,” the Christian missionary to a Christian countryreplied, “but my friend, you are there already!” From the wrath contorting theman’s face it was evident that he was indeed far, at that moment, from “thepeace of God, which passeth all understanding.” Everyone in that car burst intolaughter.As long as we live in ego-consciousness, and therefore define ourselves by ourlikes and dislikes, our attractions and aversions, our fulfillments anddisappointments, we cannot but live in a hell we ourselves have created.Ego-centeredness extends an open invitation to an endless succession of losses,failures, heartbreaks, and disappointments.Yogananda used often (quoting Krishna) to cry out to his audiences, “Get awayfrom My ocean of suffering and misery!”Jesus lamented, “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, andstonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thychildren together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and yewould not!” (Matt. 23:37)Those who think themselves wise or knowledgeable, but who know nothing of theirown spiritual nature, are condemned to an existence of repeated suffering untilthey learn their divine lesson at last: The ego is only a mask for the eternal,indwelling Self.It is foolish to insist that the whole of truth be contained in only onescripture. A Moslem caliph in the nineteenth century, firmly convinced that alltruth lies in the Koran, attempted to demolish the great pyramid at Giza, Egypt,with cannon fire. That ancient monument was, in his eyes, an offense against thesupposedly “complete revelation” of Mohammed. The great pyramid is so massive,however, that the caliph’s attempt to destroy it had to be abandoned at last.The disfigurements wrought by his cannons were so slight as to be almostunnoticeable.The purpose of religion is to bring people closer to God. If any revered ancienttext offers a new slant on teachings that are familiar to us in another context,then, instead of denouncing it, why not simply accept what it teaches withgratitude? Why denounce it? No civilization could, by any remotely possiblecontingency, be ever in a position to claim a monopoly on Truth itself! Theimportant thing is that Truth always be supportive of differently wordedstatements of the same truth.Again, if we accept that India’s scriptures, written (as is claimed in Indiantradition) in a higher age than our own, may have announced facts relating tothe universe that have only recently been corroborated by science, why notrespond, simply, “We’re happy to learn the truth wherever it exists, and bywhomsoever it is stated!”The geologist J.H.F. Umbgrove, in his learned treatise, Symphony of the Earth,wrote, “Nobody can foresee whether these modern speculations (on the problems oflife and matter) will ever be susceptible to condensation into a social orreligious system. Remarkably enough, however, they remind one of certain aspectsof the Brahmanese Upanishads.”[4]The purpose of the present book is to introduce a new slant on the teachings ofJesus Christ, a slant based on divine realization and not on dogma, nor on anynew, scholarly “revelation.” God does, sometimes, intervene in human history. Hedid so with the descent of Jesus Christ, whose teachings were founded on thehighest revelation of truth. For Jesus Christ was a great master, worthy of thedeepest reverence from all sincere seekers of Truth. It has been the tragedy ofChristian history, however—one that, if not a part of God’s plan, must certainlyhave been foreseen by Him—that his teachings have become distorted by humanignorance.Christianity was introduced into the world in an age when mankind was passingthrough a period of relative mental, material, and spiritual darkness: amaterialistic age which lasted for centuries, and brought with it the convictionthat matter itself is the only reality.Christians too, in consequence, have identified their religion with a strictlymaterialistic world view. When an increase in human knowledge began to revealonce more how vast and how very subtle the universe really is, people wereshaken, in their religious beliefs, to discover how far from reality theirunderstanding of it had been. Even at that, however, human ingenuity managed tocope with the challenge. Truth, many Christians decided, is of two types: thespiritual, and the scientific.In recent times, however, as declarations by scholars, novelists, and othershave undermined people’s belief even in the divinity of Jesus Christ, more andmore people have been asking, “How valid is this, our Christian faith?” SincereChristians naturally want to believe, and cling to their belief, even withoutreason, out of love for God and Jesus Christ. There has entered into thatbelief, however, with a certain quiet desperation the thought: What, exactly,shall we believe? In their hearts they know that God, the Bible, and the lifeand teachings of Jesus Christ are true. What their hearts know determines thecore of their religious faith. Yet they’ve been shaken in their intellects bythe double onslaught from science and the so-called “new revelations” regardingChristian history that are being proposed by an increasing number of people.What really are the facts? What is the truth?God has intervened many times in human history. If ever there was a time whenHis intervention was needed, that time is now. My purpose in writing this bookis, therefore, to offer Christians spiritual support based on revelation. Theneed for it is urgent.[4] Quoted in my book, Out of the Labyrinth, p. 221, Crystal Clarity Publishers."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 12[../Images/flower.jpg]STILL, WASN’T JESUS ALSO UNIQUE?A fascinating aspect of truth is that it is, like Paramhansa Yogananda’simprovement on Shankara’s definition of Divine Bliss, ever new. The message ofJesus Christ was, therefore, not only Sanaatan Dharma as it has been taughtelsewhere in the world, but a restatement of that Eternal Religion, and wastherefore also new: both fresh and refreshing, both timely and timeless, and,though different in some ways, in complete agreement (as it had to be) withtimeless Truth itself.I once asked my Guru, “Is the teaching you’ve brought a new religion?”“It is a new expression.” His answer held a careful correction.Much that Jesus Christ brought was new also—though at the same time whollycompatible with the eternal truth taught by great masters through the ages.God’s truth can never become stale: it is ever fresh, ever thrilling, and everboth thrillingly fresh and freshly thrilling, ceaselessly rich with inspiration.Thus it must be added that, although much of what Jesus taught was contained inthe ancient tradition—and he himself referred back constantly to that traditionin Judaism—much even of the teaching he brought was arrayed in new clothing. Heoffered ancient but ever-new truths as, indeed, they must often be taught: froma new angle.One reason for the special new aspects of his mission, and also for the forcefulcharacter he displayed, was that Jesus, unlike the rishis in ancient India (manyof whom saw it as their duty simply to perpetuate their lofty tradition), hadalso to create and establish a new tradition: not one in any way different fromSanaatan Dharma, but at the same time a particular expression that took intoconsideration the specific needs of the people of his country—a message,moreover, which they’d be capable of accepting.There is a further, and forever fascinating, aspect of Spirit’s ever-newness. Itis that when the seeker achieves Self-realization, and has dissolved his ego inthe Infinite, he doesn’t leave behind him his particular (and, as people like tothink them, unique) qualities as a human being. Quite the opposite, he discoversat last the actual, eternal uniqueness of his own soul-expression of God!It is said that no two snowflakes are exactly alike. God is not only centered inevery atom, which thereby (in Yogananda’s statement) is “dowered withindividuality”: He has also (in a way of speaking) His own special melody tosing through each individual. No spiritual master ever expresses the Divine inquite the same way as any other. All of them do, of course, express theessential characteristics of divine perfection—divine love, for example,universally and always impersonally. At the same time, however, the particularway every enlightened master expresses the divine qualities is unique.Does this mean that all saints and masters agree with one another on everyissue? Not at all! They cannot but agree on the deeper issues, which relate toSanaatan Dharma itself, but I myself have noted human differences both ofpersonality and of opinion. I remember one saint, whose nature was withdrawn tothe point of being almost taciturn, disparaging another saint’s tendency tolaugh a lot. My own Guru was once speaking of land as the best investment, whenRajarsi Janakananda (his chief disciple, “Saint Lynn” as the Guru had previouslynamed him) frankly, though without emphasis, disagreed.Ordinary human beings, on the other hand, being spiritually unawakened andcompletely centered in their egos, borrow from others almost all their values,opinions, personality traits, mannerisms, and reactions. (I’ve often thought ofa man coming out of a theater after seeing a cowboy movie, walking with aslightly rolling gait as if he’d just alighted from his horse!)A child brought up in a completely different culture from that of his parentswill reflect the values of his new environment, not those of his own flesh andblood. Heredity does play a role too, of course, in people’s outlook on theworld, in their behavior, and in their personalities. So also—even more so ofcourse—do their karmic tendencies (samskaras), which they’ve brought over frompast lives. Still, much in people’s nature is influenced also by their presentsurroundings and by the prevailing attitudes there.Shakespeare’s plays portrayed the general understanding of his times. He fairlyconsistently, therefore, described children of aristocratic parents who,although perhaps raised in peasant homes, nevertheless showed innate nobility.There is indeed some truth to this concept—and also to its opposite: thatchildren of peasants who are raised in noble homes may well retain certainpeasant-like characteristics. A child of aristocrats raised among louts willprobably acquire also some of their loutish characteristics, unless his ownnature, brought over from the past, is exceptionally refined. A “fishwife” bynature will usually behave like a fishwife, or at least tend to be shrewish,even if she is raised in a palace. It is common enough, moreover, to see veryordinary human beings born and raised to positions higher than those merited bytheir innate qualities.I remember seeing once, outside the Howrah railway station in West Bengal,India, a group of beggars standing together. They had their hands outheld, andwere pleading for alms. Among them stood a young girl with her hand held outalso, who, inwardly, was obviously remote from the rest as if thinking, “What amI doing here? This isn’t where I belong!” She looked like a queen who had foundherself, owing perhaps to selfishness in her personal karma, thrust into thatlow station in life.In America one sometimes hears the expression, “I gotta be ME!” Who is this “me”that people feel they “gotta” be? It is nothing but a bundle ofself-definitions, often borrowed from similar “bundles” which other people havethemselves lumped together! Would the fiercely independent type of “far-Westcowboy” be just the same fellow if he’d been raised in a marble palace? It ismore likely that he’d display in new ways the arrogance and the affirmation ofindependence he’d developed already in the past.One can be determinedly cheerful. (I’m reminded here of a cartoon I saw yearsago of a man in hell, pushing what might be called an “eternal wheelbarrow,”whistling cheerfully. A devil standing nearby turns to another with the lament,“He just isn’t getting the idea!”)Or, if one prefers, one can also be determinedly angry, or sad. Here I’mreminded of a story about a man who ordered a meal in a restaurant. He wasoutraged, upon tasting it, at the way it had been prepared. “I know the owner. Iknow many important people in this town: the mayor, the council members. And yetyou dare to present me with this slop!”The chef, anxious for approval, prepared a new meal especially for thiscustomer. It was served obsequiously. The man, still disgruntled, merely glancedat it, then shouted angrily, “Take it away! I’d rather be mad!”One can be happy, or one can be dour. No one, however, manifests his actual,God-given nature until he has rid himself of those ego-limitations, developed byconstantly revising his own self-definitions, until he learns to allow theDivine Light to shine through him clearly. Otherwise, every human being is likea cloudy pane in a stained glass window through which the sunlight shines onlydimly. The pane must be cleansed in order to permit clear passage to the lightshining upon it. Only then (in the case of us human beings) will the light ofGod’s consciousness shine through us clearly and beautifully.The saints may be said to be the only human beings on earth who are entirelythemselves. Otherwise, the common expression, “I’m only human,” deserves to beanswered with a rebuttal: “No, you are not yet human, for you have yet torealize, to the fullest degree, your own highest human potential.”Therefore did a great woman saint, Lala Yogishwari, centuries ago in Kashmirrefuse to wear any clothing. When the scandalized residents in her villagedemanded, “Why don’t you wear at least something?” she replied, “Why should I? Idon’t see any men around!” To her rather drastic view, no one deserved to beconsidered a man so long as he still lived in delusion. One day, it is said,another saint (a man) came to see her. Hastily, then, she donned apparel inpreparation for his visit.Have the saints personalities? Of course. They’d have to have them, to functionas human beings. My Guru once said to a small group of us, “When I incarnateagain and see the personality I’m going to have to assume, it feels a littleuncomfortable—like a heavy overcoat on a hot day. Once I actually have it,however, I get used to it.”The difference between a saint’s personality and the personalities ofunenlightened people is that a saint is not motivated by any consciousness ofego. When people are told they must learn to offer up their egos to God, theyfind it difficult to understand how to do it. It isn’t, however, that inego-free action there is no sense of acting at all. Rather, the ego-liberatedsaint enjoys the stream of divinity he feels flowing through him. He merely“pushes action along” with egoic will as its driving force. He sets action intomotion, but sees the entire flow as coming through him, rather than beingimpeded by the usual egoic sense of importance, responsibility, and “doership.”The saint may be described—in our analogy of the stained glass window—asallowing his own color to shine forth like a finally cleansed pane in thatwindow, and no longer obstructing the flow with the impurities of ego-identity.Many years ago I did office work in my bedroom. Above my desk was a large windowthrough which I would feast my gaze on a beautiful garden out of doors. One daythere was a big rainstorm. It splattered mud on my “picture” window so badlythat I could no longer enjoy the outdoor scene, and had to endure thosesplatters of mud for several weeks. Finally, one Saturday, I had the free timeto go outside and clean my window. I remember, when the job was finished, goinginside, stepping back from the window, and exclaiming, “Ah, what a beautifulwindow!”And then I smiled. For I realized that what made the window beautiful was that Icould see through it clearly once again. It wasn’t the window I was seeing now,but the garden beyond it.Similarly with mankind, and with the saints: When one becomes a clear channelfor God’s grace he becomes beautiful, but that is only because his personalityis transparent now, permitting a clear view of the divine wonders beyond!Saints might be called the true eccentrics of the world—not in the sense thattheir personalities shout, “Look at me!” but because they seem quietly to say,“Look beyond me to the truth, which lies at the heart of every man.” The saintsare by no means self-centered in the usual sense of the word. They are, however,completely centered in the divine Self within, and are often (indeed, perhapsalways) not greatly interested in the mere opinions of others, nor even in theirown opinions.In Matthew 9:14 the disciples of John compared John to Jesus, emphasizing thedifferences in their two ways:“Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Phariseesfast oft, but thy disciples fast not?”Jesus answered, “Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as thebridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall betaken from them, and then shall they fast.” (Matt. 9:14,15)This story points up two interesting truths. One is something I’ve alreadystated, namely, that each master is forever and completely himself and notnecessarily like any other master except in perfect virtue and utter dedicationto God and Truth.The other truth is the special uniqueness of Jesus Christ. Grammarians mightquibble over that qualifying adjective, “special,” but it fits the caseperfectly. Seldom has a great master come in such an outwardly commanding andheroic role. Jesus was, very specially, himself. His mission was not only todeliver new statements of Eternal Truth around which he had to create a newtradition: it was also his role virtually to wrench old traditions (bothpractices and attitudes) in a completely new direction. As he went on to sayafter that last passage:“No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is putin to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.“Neither do men put new wine into old bottles [commentators have pointed outthat the word he used must really have been, ‘wine skins’]: else the bottlesbreak [‘crack’ would, again, have been the correct translation], and the winerunneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, andboth are preserved.” (Matt. 9:16,17) (I’ll present a whole chapter, later on,called “New Wine.”)Thus, Jesus brought truth as a “new wine” to the people of his times. Most ofthose people were like “old wine skins”; they could not accept his teaching, andwould have “cracked” had they even tried to accept it. Jesus, as a human being,was loving, joy-filled, magnetic, and utterly wonderful. He’d have had to be, toattract such multitudes of simple, ordinary people. He was also, to an amazingdegree, courageous. Small wonder that those old “wine skins,” the orthodoxPharisees, rejected him as fiercely as they did. One might almost say thatJesus, by his outspokenness, virtually invited their rage, causing it to erupt,finally, in the Crucifixion!Jesus said, “Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to sendpeace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father,and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against hermother-in-law.“And a man’s foes shall be those of his own household.“He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he thatloveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.“And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.”(Matt. 10:34–38)And then Jesus spoke those immortal words, quoted already ere this: “He thatfindeth his life [who clings to it, in other words, and finds comfort in it]shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.” (Matt.10:39)Jesus was summoning his listeners to offer up their egos entirely to God.What can these statements have seemed, to non-believers, but incendiary? YetJesus told Peter in the Garden of Gethsemane, “Put up again thy sword . . . ,for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.” (Matt. 26:52)The conflagration Jesus sought to ignite was a fire of pure, all-consuming lovefor God, underscored by renunciation of every lesser attraction and attachment.He didn’t comport himself like a rabble-rousing firebrand—a suggestion that afew modern commentators have made. He did speak, however, with magnetic courage,joy, and unshakable faith. Masters are often viewed by self-satisfied worldlypeople as “social inconveniences.” It is very evident from the Gospels, however(Yogananda, too, corroborated this statement), that Jesus never spoke withpersonal anger. It is true he did sometimes reflect the divine wrath of God, as(for instance) when he drove the moneychangers out of the temple! Yes, he couldspeak, when the occasion demanded it, with fiery power and conviction, and healways expressed very firmly his refusal to compromise in matters touching onhigh, spiritual truths.To those who prefer their saints “soft and cuddly,” Jesus would have been—shallwe say?—an embarrassment. Indeed, to some people he must have seemed glaringlyoffensive! But then, so also are, to some extent, many true men and women ofGod. One wonders how the expression ever got started: “Gentle Jesus, meek andmild”! Meek he could be in the true sense, meaning harmonious. That is to say,he never demanded or wanted anything for himself, but always acted in harmonywith the divine will. Mild he could be also, for under the greatest stress heremained always inwardly kind and loving. In fact, he fitted perfectly the Vedicdescription of the man of God, as Paramhansa Yogananda quoted it inAutobiography of a Yogi: “Softer than the flower, where kindness is concerned;stronger than the thunder, where principles are at stake.”The age in which Jesus lived was a hard one. He had to survive a public missionin a rough, dogmatic, and intolerant society. Never did he hesitate to “thunder”when the occasion called for a divine rumble.It is amusing how often his later followers have tried to imitate that“thunder”! Usually their shouts and posturings are more like pop guns andfirecrackers! They ought rather to look to their own inner dedication to Christand God than to others’ lack of it. Personal sincerity is what Jesus demanded.What others think and demand of us is really “no one’s business”!Jesus, completely—one might even say, “gloriously”—himself, wanted to inspireall to seek God with the same ardor he showed, the ardor of dedication to thedivine search. Sooner or later, everyone, in his search for the eternalverities, will have to disappoint his mother, his father, his family members,his neighbors and worldly friends, and “go on alone!” This world will alwaysfight against any efforts to escape its net. One may console himself with thereflection of this one eternal truth: Once one finds liberation in God, sevengenerations of his human family in both directions (this truth my Guru averredto me personally) will be saved, or will at any rate be greatly furthered intheir own spiritual evolution.Some people take the thought of individual independence to the point ofdeclaring that, because they prize their own personal freedom, they will neveraccept anyone as a guru. They don’t realize how bound they are already by theshackles of misunderstanding! Even mental attunement with someone who hasachieved freedom in himself, and whose will is to do God’s will alone, willenable one to find in himself that essence which is, indeed, divine, but is alsoeternally unique.A mistake made constantly by unenlightened people is, like those disciples ofJohn the Baptist, to say of every new saint, “But he isn’t like that other one,whose sainthood is well established.” Saint Francis of Assisi, for example, setfor all mankind a radiant example of sanctity. My Guru used to describe him ashis “patron saint.” When one of Yogananda’s disciples, however, asked him whyhis path was in so many ways different from that of St. Francis, the Masterreplied, “This is how God wants to play through you and me.”God has a different song to sing through every soul that has achievedwakefulness in Him. That song is not different in quality, for always itmanifests God’s perfect love and bliss. It is ever itself, however, and everymelody, being divine, is in some very special way the perfection of divinebeauty."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 13[../Images/flower.jpg]SON OF MAN VS. SON OF GOD“I and my Father are one,” Jesus said.“Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.“Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; forwhich of these works do ye stone me?“The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for ablasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.“Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? If hecalled them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot bebroken [that is to say, gainsaid]; Say ye of him, whom the Father hathsanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am theSon of God?“If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. But if I do, though yebelieve not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that theFather is in me, and I in him.” (John 10:30–38)The first part of this passage was quoted in an earlier chapter. What Iemphasized there was man’s own innate and eternal divinity. I quote the passageagain here to call the reader’s attention to two other fascinating aspects ofwhat Jesus said.I’d like first to point once again to his delightful, and at the same timenotably courageous, sense of humor. Put yourself in his place on that occasion.The Jews had just accused him of blasphemy; they were about to stone him. What,then, was his answer? He replied (I paraphrase): “I’ve done all these good worksamong you. For which of these do you intend to stone me?” There could be noother explanation than courageous openness to anything, based on perfectnon-attachment, in the manner of his reply. Only supreme detachment could havemade possible his good humor. Think of it: There he was, threatened withdisaster by a hostile mob. Could what he said have been due to self-pity? (“Justlook at all the favors I’ve done you. Is this your way—sniff!—of showinggratitude?”) Absurd! He was challenging them, almost laughingly!The other thing about that saying is that his words and attitude would not have“flown” in high society. For instead of deprecating himself, as people in thatmilieu soon learn to do (mixing as they do with others who, like themselves,have “arrived” and want to demonstrate “good form” to their peers), Jesusvirtually dared the mob to swallow its words and listen to him alone!Repeatedly through the New Testament we find him, without the slightesthesitation or reticence, referring to himself. Sometimes he spoke of himself asthe son of man; sometimes, as the Son of God. “Scarcely good form,” one can hearthe members of, for example, the British aristocracy saying. “Not the straightbat.” To those at the top of any social ladder, Jesus might well have seemed“pushy” and “a bit over the top.” Let’s face it, he was “pushy.” It wasn’thimself he was pushing, of course, but divine Truth and God. His listeners,however, were obviously incapable of understanding what it was, exactly, that hepromoted. He had come as a way-shower, a road builder, a carver-out andconqueror of unknown territory. The more restrained and socially approved way ofexpressing oneself, always with tactful care, was not at all what was needed inthose times.Jesus used two expressions: “Son of man,” and, “Son of God.” ParamhansaYogananda pointed out something I myself had neither noticed nor thought ofbefore. I wonder, therefore, how many others have ever noticed it. When Jesusspoke of the “son of man” he was referring, Yogananda said, to his own humanself: to his body, his personality, his egoic “I-ness.” When he spoke of “theSon of God,” he meant the Christ, the “anointed of God,” the “Only Reflection ofthe Supreme Spirit in creation”: the Christ consciousness. I suspect that thescribes who wrote, copied, or translated the New Testament never understood thissubtle distinction either, and often got it wrong. When reading those chapters,however, readers should (according to their best understanding anddiscrimination) mentally insert this distinction, for it is important, and willhelp them to gain a much deeper insight into the true meaning of what Jesus saidand taught.When he asked his disciples, “Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?” thatword, “son,” should have been (but isn’t) written with a lower-case “s,” for hewas speaking of his separate, human expression of Divine Consciousness, and notof the Infinite Christ.We read, again: “And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Sonof God, command that these stones be made bread.” (Matt. 4:3)Again: “And, behold, they [the devils who had possessed two persons] cried out,saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God?” (Matt. 8:29)And again, after the miracle of Jesus walking on the water: “Then they that werein the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son ofGod.” (Matt. 14:33)Again: “And the high priest answered and said unto [Jesus], I adjure thee by theliving God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, and Son of God.”(Matt. 26:63) The next sentence reads: “Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said.”And Matthew states, “Now when the centurion, and they that were with him,watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they fearedgreatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.” (27:54)The Gospel of Mark begins with the words: “The beginning of the gospel of JesusChrist, the Son of God.”Later we read: “And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him,and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.” (Mark 3:11)In Luke 1:35: “And the angel answered and said unto her (the mother of Jesus,Mary), The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shallovershadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of theeshall be called the Son of God.” (And what difficulty could there be in Godimpregnating the Virgin Mary? He himself resides within the seed of every male!)“Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with diverse diseasesbrought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healedthem.“And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ theSon of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew thathe was Christ.” (Luke 4:40,41)In John we read John the Baptist saying: “. . . but he that sent me to baptizewith water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spiritdescending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the HolyGhost. And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.” (John 1:33,34)St. John wrote: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,that whosoever believeth on him [we have seen already that to believe means farmore than mere intellectual acceptance] should not perish, but have everlastinglife.“For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that theworld through him might be saved.“He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not iscondemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begottenSon of God.” (John 3:16–18)Clearly, this means that one is not condemned for not believing in Jesus, butfor not believing in the Divinity which resided in him, and therefore notbelieving in one’s own true higher Self. The condemnation comes, in other words,because one rejects one’s own high, spiritual potential: the divine presencewithin us all, with which all creatures are blessed.John also states: “And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of hisdisciples, which are not written in this book: But these are written, that yemight believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing yemight have life through his name.” (20:30,31)"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 14[../Images/flower.jpg]DOES SATAN EXIST?Satan is an example of a teaching that belongs side by side with the SanaatanDharma teachings of India, but that is touched upon in them only lightly. Satan,a Hebrew word, signifies the adversary, enemy, or accuser. Spiritually speaking,Satan indicates the conscious power of evil, which influences mankind by makingsin attractive to him, or by blocking his attempts to grow spiritually. Satanalso obstructs man’s sincere efforts to increase the influence of goodness inthis world.In India, the satanic influence is implied in teachings that concern maya, orcosmic delusion. Most people’s impression of maya, however, is that it is simplythere: a state of mind in which people entrap themselves, but not something withits own conscious power to entrap, reaching out to the unwary in a deliberateeffort to snare them in delusion. The Hebrew Satan is an entity—cosmic, as wellas individual—which tries consciously to draw men into the ways of evil.St. Matthew’s description of him as the “tempter” who appeared to Jesus afterhis forty days in the wilderness implies that there was a deliberate outsideinfluence, one beyond the conscious, personal will of Jesus. The “tempter” urgedJesus, first, to eat. Here’s how the passage reads:“And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward anhungered. And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God,command that these stones be made bread.“But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, butby every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” (Matt. 4:2–4)That expression, “mouth of God,” deserves (and will receive) treatment later on.It is important, but deeply esoteric, and requires a certain preparation on thereader’s part. For the present, therefore, let us concern ourselves with thatother word, “tempter.” Anyone with even the slightest understanding of humanpsychology might easily object, “Well, after fasting so many days, Jesus wouldcertainly not have needed an external ‘tempter’ to suggest to him the thought offood! The thought would, by that time, have been already somewhat more thanpressing!” Are we to toss off this mention of “the tempter” as evidence of aperfectly natural human desire, one that was entirely subjective? Manycommentators would be, and probably have been, glad to explain away thephenomenon as a very understandable and perfectly natural urge.I quote here, however, a fascinating statement Paramhansa Yogananda once made.“I used to think,” he said, “that Satan was only a mental concept. Now that Ihave found God, however, I join my testimony to that of all who have gone beforeme: Satan does exist, and works constantly and consciously to encompassmankind’s spiritual destruction.”I myself, when I first studied my Guru’s teachings in depth, was inclined toexplain away as allegorical some of his statements: for example, that for everybeautiful thing in the world, Satan has created something ugly and unclean tooffset it. For the lovely flowers, he has created noxious weeds; for medicinalherbs, he has created poisonous plants; for every upward inspiration, he hascreated something degrading to exert a downward-pulling influence on man’sconsciousness, such as drugs, pornography (and other inducements towardsex-intoxication), and alcohol, all of which influence man to lose himself inthe senses and in his constrictive ego-identity. I see now, however, not onlythe inherent logic of this teaching, but also how it fits into the largerpicture of Sanaatan Dharma as it has been taught in India.Satan, in other words, is not a new teaching: rather, it is a new expression ofthe ancient, timeless, ever-changeless Truth that is true Sanaatan Dharma.Those ancient teachings explain that the ocean of Supreme Spirit createdmovement at its surface. That movement might be described as the storm of maya,which raised the waves of duality, or cosmic vibration—AUM, the Holy Ghost orHoly Spirit—and made possible the appearance of everything in outward existence.God’s grace calls to man unceasingly from within the soul to return to the stateof oneness with the Infinite Ocean. (Much has been written about the silent,hidden, ever-active Divine Presence in men’s hearts.)Satan has seemed to many thinking people, however, an anomaly, presupposing (asthe concept does) a counter-force to the inward pull of Divine Love. Can thereactually be a force in cosmic creation that works against the divine will?Whence could such a force have come? Could there be two cosmic forces, each onein eternal opposition to the other: God, and Satan? Is Satan something quitedifferent from God? It seems utterly bewildering!We considered before now those words of Jesus, quoted from the Hebrewscriptures: “And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is Hear,O Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord.” (Mark 12:29) God is the Sole Reality.That reality, therefore, is but one. How, then, can the one Lord have created aforce in opposition to that reality?On the other hand, if God created everything, must He not also have createdSatan? The answer, no matter how inconvenient or unpalatable, can only be: Yes,of course He did! Satan is a part—necessarily so—of the divine scheme: a part ofthe one reality which is God Himself. Without Satan, there could have been nocreation; no outward manifestation of anything; no universe; no cosmic drama! AsYogananda said, “The villain in the play is needed, to personify evil. Withouthim, we might not feel the necessary incentive to love the hero, who representsthe good.”Philosophically speaking, Satan, or conscious evil, represents theoutward-flowing creative force, which brings Invisible Spirit intomanifestation. AUM has two aspects, the first one being the inner, cosmic Soundheard in deep meditation. This aspect of AUM is known in Sanskrit as“Paraprakriti,” the pure vibration. Inward-calling Mother Nature draws back toHerself those souls who love God and are uplifted by the inspiring, increasinglymagnetic power of divine grace.AUM in its outward, creative manifestation is called, in Sanskrit,“Aparaprakriti”: that influence which draws man outward through the senses, andinduces him to participate in worldly pleasures and to seek their delusivefulfillments.This outward manifestation is not passive. It does not merely offer to man anattractive alternative to the inner, “supremely relishable” bliss of the Divine.Every influence in creation, both good and evil, is consciously active.Satan, then, tries actively to keep everything in a state of outwardmanifestation, and man himself in a state of mental responsiveness to thatmanifestation.We may say that God, having once set a portion of the divine consciousness inmotion, needed to create, along with that cosmic manifestation, a consciousimpetus, or will, toward ever-further, outward movement.Christian tradition speaks of Satan as a “fallen angel.” People think of him asan angel who once lived in heaven with the other angels, where all were gatheredabout the throne of God. Satan, as a result of foolish pride in his own power,rebelled against God and was cast out from heaven into “outer darkness.” Thesemay be termed excellent metaphors, and perfectly in keeping with a basic Truth,as well as with traditional ways of explaining it. They are, however, onlymetaphors. In our own more literal-minded age, a more exact explanation ofallegorical truths is needed also.Yogananda compared creation to the ocean’s waves. The high waves are those whichbecome most agitated and affected by the great storm of delusion. The low wavesrepresent the consciousness of saints, who, in their humility, prefer to liveclose to God, and who recognize His power alone as the source of their veryexistence. Tall waves, however, pull as far away as possible from the oceanbosom, and are more responsive to their own inner, egoic power, which rises,with the storm, in prideful competition against others.Another allegory, closer to literal reality, is that the conscious power ofdelusion (Satan) is the storm itself, deliberately whipping up waves on theocean surface. That force is needed to keep the “show” going; otherwise,everything would sink back again into the oneness of Spirit.Did God create Satan? Yes!Did God want to create Satan? Again, insofar as He may be described as wantinganything at all, he had to “want” that aspect of His cosmic reality!Is God, then, as much evil as He is good? Most certainly not! Both good and evilexist only in the realm of maya, of duality. God is beyond them both.Again, however, God may be described as the “Supreme Good,” for, in this realmof maya, goodness at least points in the direction of the Supreme Good, which isGod. Evil, on the other hand, points in the opposite direction: away from Godand Divine Bliss, and toward ever-greater suffering and pain.God is beyond merely relative goodness. Relative good, however, might be said topoint in the direction of God. God is beyond good and evil, whereas evilenshrouds the divine reality in an increasingly thick veil. Good, on the otherhand, holds up an ever-thinning veil over the Supreme Good, which is God.Philosophically minded people, in their love for abstractions, may end uphopelessly confused on this issue—even to the point of pooh-poohing the veryexistence of evil. Christian Science, a relatively recent but well-known sect ofChristianity in America, teaches: “God does not know evil.” ParamhansaYogananda, in commenting on that statement, remarked, “In that case, God must bevery stupid!”What is evil, really? That which looks evil to us may not be at all evil in thegreater scheme of things. A tiger has to kill in order to eat; that is itsnature. The tiger cannot legitimately be called evil, therefore. To the humanbeing strolling through an Indian jungle, however, the animal is a menace, andmay therefore appear evil. Good and evil depend to a great extent on the effectthey have on man himself.We may take that thought farther and put it this way: That is evil which takesman away from his divine source within; and that is good which draws him back inthe direction of that source. Moreover, a level of goodness may lie abovewhatever level of spirituality one person has attained, who is himself steepedin evil. In another person, however, that same level of goodness may lie farbelow his own actual level of spiritual attainment, if he is already soaringtoward God. It may therefore not be good at all.To be more specific, it may be a mistake for a saint to take personal credit fora good deed, but that same deed, for a convinced materialist, may be somethingfor which he has good reason to take personal credit. For in his case, theaffirmation of personal goodness will encourage him to be better. To give even apenny to a beggar may, in him, be accounted a good deed, and one in which he maytake justifiable pride. For a saint to preen himself for having given even ahundred dollars to that beggar would be absurd.Alcohol is not, in itself, an evil. The sensory numbness it produces can even,in its proper place, be a good thing: for example, when used medically in anoperation. Drunkenness itself, however, is evil, since it dulls a person’sawareness, and decreases his ability to function with mental clarity.Thieving, again, is bad not merely because it breaks the law. Even moreimportant, it is bad because it offends against man’s own higher nature, causinghis sympathies to shrink inward upon himself.Anything that causes the ego to shrink inward produces inner suffering. I don’tsay that thieving might otherwise be good, objectively speaking—assuming, forexample, that the thief believes himself capable of rising above “that shrinkingfeeling.” The withdrawal I’ve described is, in fact, inevitable, the only reasonfor not feeling it being that the ego has already shrunk so far into itself thatthe effect of mere thievery no longer works upon him like a press. The clearestincentive not to steal is that its harmful effect is greatest on the perpetratorhimself. In one, however, who is already inured to that effect, the ego-shellsurrounding him only becomes more hardened. Spiritual sensitivity may be avanishing index in his psychology, but there is always the Law. In his case, thepolice and law courts are there for a good reason.Assuming the presence of any sensitivity at all in a person, it must be said, ofall moral errors, that what makes them wrong is that they go against man’sinnate higher nature. Some cultures may—indeed, some actually do—endorsethieving, lying, cheating, committing murder, and even cannibalism. People whoerr morally by habit are not usually over-concerned, anyway, about the effect oftheir crimes on other people. Any contractive energy in itself, however, mustinevitably inflict more suffering on the perpetrator himself than on anyoneelse. The harm inflicted on one’s self is less instantly apparent, and is oftenlaughed off as something easily borne. “I may pay in the end for robbing thatbank, but meanwhile—just look at all that lovely moolah!”What people don’t see is that heaven and hell lie, equally, within man. They arenot places, but directional flows of energy and consciousness in one’s own self.The spine itself is the highway both toward and away from the “kingdom of God”which, as Jesus said, lies within.In every tradition, heaven is described as somewhere “up there,” and hell as“down there.” Objectively, there is no justification for this belief. Notelescope has ever shown angels flitting about on clouds or in outer space. Nodevils, moreover, have ever been spewed up protestingly with oil gushers. Thedirection up, in North America is down in Australia. Up or down, in other words,have no cosmic significance: they relate entirely to directions in the humanbody. Anything that will raise our consciousness toward the brain, or expand itand help it to embrace a larger reality than the ego, is good, in that it givesone a greater sense of happiness and fulfillment. And anything that lowers ourconsciousness, or that contracts it and our finer feelings inward upon the ego,thereby intensifying our sense of separateness from others and from the worldaround us, increases in us a sense of restriction, pain, and suffering.Outer influences that raise or lower our consciousness begin by acting upon ourown thoughts and feelings. Kindness, generosity, spiritual aspiration, and,indeed, all uplifting feelings affect us by raising our consciousness.Selfishness, anger, greed, and other unkind or self-boosting sentiments, on theother hand, depress us, and cause within ourselves a downward movement ofenergy, heart’s feeling, and awareness.There is also, however, a much deeper aspect to all this. It is hinted at in asingle sentence in Autobiography of a Yogi. “Thoughts,” Paramhansa Yoganandawrote, “are universally and not individually rooted.” Thoughts and impulses donot originate in the brain: They have their roots in infinity.God and Satan, both, are active influences in this world. Their presence withinman is active, also, according to whatever invitation man himself extends firstto them. We might describe those cosmic influences as “sounding boards,” whichaugment whatever note man first strikes in himself. Whatever positive ornegative thoughts and feelings he emits (and none of us lives in a mentalvacuum) are reinforced by divine, or by demonic, currents of consciousness whichflow through the universe.Both angels and demons are realities. Good forces abound wherever upliftinginfluences and vibrations are set into motion: in churches and temples, forexample, and in the vibrations felt in clean, pure, and uplifting environments.Evil forces gather where low vibrations are prevalent: in bars, nightclubs, andsimilar places where the prevailing consciousness is base.I remember Yogananda once exclaiming during a Kriya Yoga initiation (in 1949):“Thousands of angels passed through the room today!” By contrast, the evilforces that permeate low “dives” (in itself, a suggestive word!) are actuallydemonic. Demons and devils are by no means the products of mere imagination.They are living, conscious entities that, having steeped themselves in evil,reflect in their consciousness, and even in their bodies, the evil thoughts andfeelings that absorb them.I once read a fascinating account of an American in Tibet who, during the 1930s,managed to get a native to smuggle him incognito into a séance of blackmagicians. Hooded, so that none of them were recognizable, the whole group,seated together in a circle, chanted, “Yaman taka, Yaman taka,” with the purposeof summoning up the Great Spirit of Evil from which they hoped to draw moreenergy for their dark practices. First what appeared in that circle were asuccession of demons with grotesque, human-like shapes. It was easy, theAmerican later reported, to see which demonic quality was represented in thoselurid forms, for each of them was a horrible caricature of some human failing:anger, lust, passion, greed, avarice, vengefulness, and other base qualities.At last the Supreme Spirit of Evil began to manifest itself, slowlymaterializing before their eyes as it emanated a great, magnetic power whichthreatened completely to possess their consciousness. The whole group thenurgently put out a united mental force to drive that power away before theythemselves lost control of the situation. As the Spirit of Evil slowly vanished,something of its evil remained in their consciousness. No doubt they cameindeed, to some extent, under the sway of its power.A terrible story, but illustrative also of a terrible reality: Satan does exist.If you open yourself to him, he will come, and will infect you with the diseaseof evil itself. He comes more readily than the divine forces, moreover, forSatan is eager to possess human beings, whereas angelic forces want, beforethey’ll reveal themselves, to feel that we really are, in our love for goodnessand truth, quite selfless and pure.Do not play with those dark forces! They are real. They exist. And they candetermine whether you rise toward happiness or fall into wretched misery anddespair. Man is little more than a pawn in the cosmic game. Wars are waged firstin heaven, between forces demonic and divine. Mankind on earth is capable inthat struggle of serving as an instrument for one side or the other. Most peopledon’t take sides, but wander distractedly between the two, neither particularlygood nor particularly bad. Essentially, all that such people do is mark time foryet another incarnation, after death has come to claim them and give themanother chance to “make good.” Of such people Jesus said, “Let the dead burytheir dead.” (Matt. 8:22)Above all, therefore, invite goodness into your consciousness. The battle willbe half won, once you realize that you yourself are not the source of any virtuethat you manifest, nor of any delusion, but that you can, if you choose, becomean instrument in the world for divine love and bliss.Jesus, in his parable of the sower and the seed, spoke of seeds falling by thewayside, “And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but whenthey have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that wassown in their hearts.” (Mark 4:15) One might interpret this as the simplenegligence of worldly people, who cannot inwardly absorb a truth even when theyhear it, for the power of delusion is too much of a conscious presence withinthem, and seeks ever to draw them deeper into worldly consciousness.Yogananda used to say: “Here is a line. On one side of it is God; on the otherside, Satan. Neither can influence you until you yourself turn toward the one orthe other. Once you allow yourself to turn either way, however, the divine orthe satanic influence will begin to act upon you consciously.” You yourself, inother words, first extend the invitation. God or Satan then comes to influenceyou further in the direction you’ve already indicated.“Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of thetwelve.“And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how hemight betray him unto them.” (Luke 22:3,4)A recent book, called The Gospel of Judas, pretends to be a faithful account byJudas of his closeness to Jesus. It claims that Jesus conspired with him tobring about his own betrayal. Intriguing? It is utter nonsense! I myself triedto read it, and soon gave up. The last straw for me was finding that Jesus wassupposed to have taught Judas—contrary to Hebraic tradition, which of courseJesus himself taught and fully endorsed—that there are nineteen Gods. (“AndJesus answered him, The first commandment is Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God isone Lord.”) Jesus himself said there is only one God—never that there arenineteen of them.I once had an interesting talk with my Guru on the subject of Judas. He told me,“Of course, Judas was a prophet.”“Was he!” I exclaimed in astonishment.“Oh yes,” he replied. “He would have had to be, to be one of the twelve.” Hepaused a moment, then added, “I knew him in this lifetime. After two thousandyears of suffering, Jesus appeared on his behalf to a great master in India, andasked him to give Judas, in this incarnation, final liberation.”“What was Judas like?” I inquired, naturally eager for more information.“Always very quiet and by himself,” my Guru responded. “He still had someattachment to money. The other disciples began making fun of him for it one day,but the guru said to them, ‘Don’t. Leave him alone.’”Judas’s money attachment showed up in this incarnation in a giving way, not asthe delusion of avarice, for that disciple took it upon himself to raise moneyto support the guru’s wife after his death.So, although Judas acted under the influence of Satan (in John 13:27 Jesus isquoted as saying to him, “That thou doest, do quickly”), the story of Judas mustbe strictly understood as not indicating a permanent state of alienation fromGod. As great as was Judas’s betrayal—owing, my Guru said, to “a little badkarma”—its fruits were only temporary. Judas was, inherently, a great and truedisciple. His problem was merely that there remained in him certain deep-seatedfaults that still had to be worked out.For ourselves, we must understand that no matter how many times, or how far, wefall, God will ever wait for us with outstretched arms until we return to Him.Even those, moreover, who fail spiritually are leagues ahead of the mostbrilliantly successful materialists of this world.Never fear, therefore, but give to God as much of yourself as you feel yourselfcapable of giving. He will ever do the rest."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 15[../Images/flower.jpg]A NEW REVELATIONWhen Jesus Christ appeared in the nineteenth century to Babaji, the great“Yogi-Christ” high in the Himalaya, he addressed to him these words: “What hashappened to my religion? My followers are doing good works, but most haveforgotten the essence of my message concerning direct, inner communion with God.Let us send again to the West the secrets by which they can achieve thatcommunion.”Thus, paraphrasing those words, what Jesus said was, “Let us send to the West ateaching which will enable my followers to understand and appreciate once againthe deeper message I brought them.” This is another example—several others werelisted earlier—of the truth that God does sometimes intervene in human history.Jesus Christ was asking Babaji to send to the West a true master, fullyqualified to fulfill the mission they envisioned together.India has, through the ages, given birth to many great saints and masters. Itsancient religion gives people the freedom to teach according to their ownunderstanding, rather than forcing them to adhere to some carefullypre-formulated dogma. That freedom is theirs because Hinduism has never beenorganized—enclosed, that is to say, in the straitjacket of administrativecontrol. Those teachers whose instruction is deluded soon find their words sweptaside by the power acquired over time by the strong currents flowing through awell-established tradition.Swami Sri Yukteswar, Yogananda’s guru—quoting what Babaji had told him duringtheir first meeting, at a Kumbha Mela, or religious fair, in Allahabad—said tohis young disciple Yogananda (I quote from Autobiography of a Yogi), “[Babajisaid] ‘You, Swamiji [Sri Yukteswar], have a part to play in the comingharmonious exchange between Orient and Occident. Some years hence I shall sendyou a disciple whom you can train for yoga dissemination in the West. Thevibrations there of many spiritually seeking souls come floodlike to me. Iperceive potential saints in America and Europe, waiting to be awakened.’ [Tohis young disciple, Sri Yukteswar concluded] My son, you are the disciple that,years ago, Babaji promised to send me.”As I stated earlier in this book, part of Yogananda’s mission to the West was tobring back to universal awareness “the original teachings of Jesus Christ.”After that he always added, “and the original yoga teachings of Krishna in theBhagavad Gita.”What about the findings of modern science, which seem, in the evidence theyprovide that life is without meaning, almost hostile to spiritual truth? Scienceclaims that evolution is completely accidental; that there is no observablepurpose in anything. I have addressed these issues, basing my arguments on theVedanta teachings and on those of my own Guru, in two (to me, important) books:Out of the Labyrinth, and, Hope for a Better World! In those books I examinesome of the spiritually damaging claims made by materialistic science, and theexcessive rationalism of certain recent scholars and philosophers, who basetheir findings on science. I’ve shown in those two books that, in terms of thatvery reasoning, their arguments admit of other, very different, and far morehope-inspiring interpretations.Paramhansa Yogananda’s commentaries on the words of Jesus Christ were profound,convincing, and an inestimable inspiration to Christians everywhere who wantanswers to the doubts that are being forced upon them nowadays—indeed, forcedupon every thinking person: the apparent conflict between old religious conceptsand the ever-expanding horizons of modern knowledge; the mounting influx ofdiscoveries of supposedly ancient scriptural texts in Near Eastern countries;the never-ending flood of scholarly opinions, the main purpose of which seems tobe to humanize Jesus, almost making him out to have been a fairly ordinary humanbeing. People need, now more than ever, to understand the relevance of Christ’steachings to their daily lives and to present-day understanding of the universe.Indeed, spiritual truths ought to be more far-reachingly relevant to our livesthan materialistic science can ever hope to be.Alas, Christians who believe in Christ’s teachings, and (for that matter)religiously inclined people everywhere, find themselves on the defensive insteadof “standing tall” in their claim to a rightfully prominent position in thisworld, declaring their faith openly and with confidence. The tendency iswidespread today to apologize for one’s religious beliefs, as if saying, “Well,I happen to be one of those people who”—and here they smileself-deprecatingly—“actually believes in God.” Religious tradition as they knowit has left them stranded with antiquated ideas about how the universe was made,about its inconceivable vastness, and about man’s true place in the grand schemeof things. Nor does tradition give them any clear concept of man’s chances ofredemption, and of the possibility of eventually attaining divine perfection.Christians go to church, sing hymns, offer formal prayers to God, and gather onother occasions for congregational functions. They perform their “Christian”duties, however, as if not daring to approach God intimately. They seethemselves as petitioners standing (or kneeling, or crouching) before the throneof God, arms upstretched metaphorically in supplication. How beautiful it wouldbe if they could sing, pray, and speak to Him lovingly, with deep, personalfervor! Indeed, some of them surely experience tender feelings toward Him.Nevertheless, even the hymns they sing are seldom addressed directly to God:They are paeans about Him. Some Christian hymns are thrillingly beautiful—suchas, for instance, that glorious anthem, “A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.” They arehymns only of praise, however, and lack the informal, confiding intimacy andtrusting adoration of a child. Many of those hymns are, indeed, far frombeautiful either melodically or lyrically. Most of them fall short, moreover, ofbeing devotionally inspiring.One gloomy hymn (sad in its melody, sadder in its words) that we used to sing atour Anglican church in Ploesti, Romania, began with these words:There is a green hill far, far away,Without a city wall,Where our dear Lord was crucified,Who died to save us all.We may not know, we cannot tellThe pains he had to bear,But we believe it was for usHe hung and suffered there.More stanzas follow. Some of them are rich with genuine feeling; I needn’trepeat them all. The idea behind this hymn was, of course, that Jesus, as hehung crucified on that hilltop, suffered unimaginably for our redemption. Thetheology implicit in these lines is appalling. From what was it that he savedus? I’ve addressed that question elsewhere already, but still the thought floatsto the surface: What is the destiny awaiting us as an alternative? Eternity inhell? What does that say for God’s love? True spiritual mastery meanstranscendence. It absolutely must render a person personally immune to allordinary suffering. Christ’s suffering could not possibly have been for himself.He had expressed its true nature already as being by no means personal, butsorrow for all mankind.Recall his lament as he gazed down upon the Holy City:“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them whichare sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, evenas a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!” (Matt.23:37) His suffering, though intense, was by no means personal, either in or forhimself. What he felt was compassion—indeed, anguish—for the suffering peopleinflict on themselves by ignoring God, while clinging obtusely to the miserythey bring on themselves by ego-saturated desires and attachments.Contrast the words of that hymn with this simple chant by Yogananda. Both thewords and the melody are soul-stirring:Cloud-colored Christ, come!O my cloud-colored Christ, come!O my Christ! O my Christ!Jesus Christ, come!People who want to believe, but find they cannot do so sincerely, will find inParamhansa Yogananda’s writings, and in those of my books that I have listedabove, a solid basis for the conviction that spiritual truth is as far abovematerialistic science as direct spiritual insight is above the merelyintellectual deductions of philosophy.More than fifty years have passed since Yogananda left his body. What he taughtduring his lifetime is even more relevant today, half a century later. Scienceis veering ever more in the direction of an understanding that consciousness,far from being the mere product of cerebral activity, is the underlying essenceof everything. This basic truth is the key to all right understanding ofChrist’s teachings.I have had to build gradually, through these pages, to the point where I canfinally make my statement firmly and unequivocally: Everything manifests God’sconsciousness. As Krishna stated in the Bhagavad Gita, even the atheistmanifests God. Speaking of God’s manifestation in all, he adds: “In the atheist,I am his atheism”!Important also to a right understanding of Christ’s teachings is the fact thattruth, albeit universal, must also be understood by each person individually.Outward religion must ever remain, to a great extent, a social phenomenon:necessary, but at the same time watered down to be acceptable to the majority,who prefer that a teaching give them only relative upliftment. It must let themaspire to high truths without really trying too hard to attain those truths forthemselves. For if religion is to be widely embraced—a better alternative,certainly, than having it widely rejected—it must respect the generalconsciousness of mankind by offering truths also that people can acceptcomfortably.Those truths, on the other hand, which challenge men to become saints must stillbe, for all that, at least hinted at—even if the truths are, at the same time,kept somewhat in abeyance. For didn’t Jesus himself announce repeatedly, “Thosewith ears to hear, let them hear!”? Popular religion cannot afford to offer toogenerally those uncompromising teachings which comprise the highest truths.Thus, many Hindus, too, will assure you that their scriptures sanction kama andartha: desires for pleasure (sexual, especially) and for wealth. Granted, these“fulfillments” do, if attained legitimately, have scriptural sanction. Desiresare of course an obstacle in the search for God, but since people will havedesires anyway, the important thing is to offer those desires up to God, and tofulfill them in ways that help to uplift. No one can afford to teach too widelythe universal and loftiest principles of Sanaatan Dharma. Unfortunately, butalso realistically, most people are simply, in their present condition, notready to be lifted up too high!Christianity is not essentially, however, a religion for congregational worshipalone. Churches, where congregations gather, are of course a good and necessarypart of Christianity. God-believing (let us eschew that unfortunate term,“God-fearing”!) men and women want at least to be faithful to divine principles.Dilution of the higher truth comes, however, when people insist on what theydefine as the fullness of Christ’s message as being a watered-down,“God-fearing” attitude. Christianity is also, and above all, an expression ofthe highest, universal, and most sublime truths. It is, more than anything else,for those few who desire—the more earnestly they desire, the better—to communedirectly with God.As for the rest, the churches, too, give people worthwhile truths to live up to,and are light years ahead of the plodding quest for facts that is the chosendomain of the material sciences and of intellectual scholarship.Yogananda made an important prediction: “A great change is coming in thechurches. Real souls will begin to go there.” Congregational worship is awonderful thing, especially if it encourages the individual to seek innercommunion with God rather than believing that all God wants of him is to “make aglad sound unto the Lord.” Congregational worship can serve also to put a brakeon individual delusions, like some of those which arose during the time of theGnostics. (For, as I wrote earlier, there were Gnostics and Gnostics.) There is,therefore, a need for people also to worship God together in company withothers.Yogananda was once invited to hear a famous Christian choir who sang especiallyfor him. After they’d finished, they asked him how he’d enjoyed it.“It was all right,” he said, his tone of voice a little non-committal.Naturally, they’d expected praise, and even enthusiastic applause. Their famehad, after all, been well earned.“You mean you didn’t like it?” they pressed him. He then saw that he had noalternative but to give them a completely truthful answer.“As far as technique was concerned,” he said, “you sang beautifully. But whomwere you trying to please? For whom was the music written? It was written forGod. You should have been thinking only of Him when you sang. In future, pleasedon’t sing for your audiences. Sing to God.”The direction he foresaw for the future of Christianity was a move toward deeperlove for God, and for other people in God.He wrote commentaries on all the four Gospels. A very interesting fact is thatthe month he left his body—March, 1952—was when the last issue appearedcontaining his Bible commentaries. It had been appearing regularly inSelf-Realization Magazine for more than twenty years. What a marvelous exampleof cosmic timing!His commentaries will not all appear in this book. My purpose is to offerhighlights from them. The commentaries themselves have already been published intheir entirety in a large (two-volume) tome titled The Second Coming of Christ.My hope, here, is (so to speak) to skim the cream off the top.To be honest, I must confess to a certain disappointment in that work. It wasdone by certain of my fellow disciples, and took many years to publish. Theirversion is, in my opinion, over-edited and difficult to read. ParamhansaYogananda himself told me to edit his writings, and I have felt it my duty tooffer, here, at least the essence of his commentaries. I do not think I will begiven the time, however, at my age (I am eighty) to undertake the far morevoluminous labor of editing all his commentaries. Meanwhile, however, I dorecommend that the reader at least work his way through the rather complexstructure of that book. If you succeed, in other words, in managing the potholesin that road, you will find yourself traveling through wonderful terrain. I dotherefore recommend that book—with qualifications, admittedly, but sincerely.I have also written a shorter work, The Promise of Immortality, in which—everbasing my thoughts on Yogananda’s commentaries—I compare passages from the Biblewith passages in the Bhagavad Gita. At present, that work is contained in onevolume. I hope, in time, to complete it with a second volume.The question must arise: Why was I not able to influence the editorial work ofmy fellow disciples? Those who know something of the story of my life willunderstand. Destiny has obliged us to plow in different fields.Meanwhile, what I hope to accomplish in these pages is to give you the essenceof the teachings of Jesus Christ that Yogananda brought to the West. Thoseteachings have the power, I truly believe, to change people’s lives and bringthem closer to God.What I have written so far constitutes only a kind of introduction toYogananda’s deep commentaries on the teachings of that great master of Galilee,Jesus Christ. What follows hereafter will be an overview of some of thehighlights in those great teachings."},{"pageContent":" PART TWO : GEMSTONES IN CHRIST’S TEACHINGS"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 16[../Images/flower.jpg]HOW IT ALL BEGAN“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth waswithout form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And theSpirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there belight: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and Goddivided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and thedarkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.”(Gen. 1:1–5)It is a pity that religion and science have been treated, by their own“votaries,” as separate realities. It is surely natural, especially in thematter of teaching truth, to begin discussions—especially of religioustruth—with the basic questions, How did it all begin? What is the nature ofobjective reality? What is man’s place in the universe?Thus begins the first book in the Bible: the Book of Genesis. That passagecontinues:“And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let itdivide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided thewaters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above thefirmament: and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the eveningand the morning were the second day.” (Gen. 1:6–8)What is meant by that word, “firmament”? Paramhansa Yogananda explained that itmeans space, which he said is an actual vibration, separating the material fromthe astral realms: the waters above (heaven) from those below (earth).The most mystical of the four Gospels, the “Gospel According to St. John,” alsobegins with the cosmic beginnings, setting in its proper context the deepermeaning of Jesus Christ’s mission.“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word wasGod.” (John 1:1)Both Jews and Christians identify the Word of God with the Holy Bible itself.Could any written scripture, however, have come into being before the veryuniverse was created? Absurd!Was God’s word, then, something uttered with ordinary lips? How could it havebeen? To imagine the Creator of the vast universe, with its hundred billiongalaxies, as possessing a human form and speaking human words is too fantasticto be taken seriously.Words, as we know them, are the outward vibrations of their animating thoughts.Thus far reason can take us without making us stub our toes, metaphorically, onthe incomprehensible. Before even mankind existed, however, and before therewere tongues to utter human speech, the expression, “word,” can only have had avery different meaning. In John, “the Word” refers to Cosmic Vibration itself,which is part of the Eternal Trinity and is therefore an aspect of God.God’s “Word” is the vibration of His thought. That thought, through the mediumof the Holy Vibration, produced the vast universe. The Infinite Spirit dreamedcreation into existence by setting in motion, at the surface of itsconsciousness, that Cosmic Vibration. Wherever there is vibration there ismovement. Vibration is movement in opposite directions from a state of rest atthe center. Thus, the Cosmic Vibration produced duality (dwaita). As the oceanwaves rise and fall without even slightly affecting the overall ocean level, sothe waves of the Cosmic Vibration may be described, figuratively, as rising andfalling above and below the state of absolute rest between them, in the SupremeSpirit. Their true, inner reality, however, is not that dual movement itself,but the state of rest at the center.Vibration manifests outwardly in two ways especially: as sound, and as light.The first chapter of Genesis tells us, “And God said, Let there be light.” St.John describes the holy vibration as the “Word”—as sound, in other words. Boththese phenomena, Light and Sound, are experienced in deep meditation. Indeed, itmay be said that listening to the Cosmic Sound, inwardly, is even more deeplythrilling than gazing into the inner light, even as music can affect us moreinstantly and deeply than painting.John goes on to say, “All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made.” From AUM, the Holy Ghost, were all things manifested.“In him was life; and the life was the light of men.” Human life andconsciousness, too, emanate from the Cosmic Vibration: the Word, or Holy Ghost(or Spirit). We owe our individual existence to that vibration. Our perceptionof having a separate existence is only an illusion created by the conscious,Holy Vibration.“And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.”Behind the darkness of closed eyes there ever scintillates the inner, spirituallight.Jesus said, “The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single,thy whole body shall be full of light.” (Matt. 6:22) How many translations putthose words differently: “If thine eye be whole”; “If thine eyes be healthy,”“If your eyes see goodness,”[5] and so on. No one should be blamed, for peoplecan only transmit to others what they have themselves understood. The light that“shines in darkness” is not beheld by those who are spiritually asleep, theirconsciousness darkened by spiritual ignorance.A fascinating passage in the Old Testament of the Bible follows: “Afterward hebrought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east: And, behold,the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice waslike a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.” (Ezekiel43:1,2)The Hebrew word for “east” is kedem: “that which lies before.” The same wordapplies also to the body, and refers to the forehead. (North, in mysticalterminology, signifies the top of the head; south, the base of the spine; andwest, the back of the head in the region of the medulla oblongata, the seat alsoof ego-consciousness.)The “spiritual eye” is described in the Bhagavad Gita as being located in theforehead midway between the eyebrows. It is not a physical organ, but a lightwhich is actually visible there, “behind the darkness.” Through that light (the“spiritual eye”), the deep meditator can gaze into subtler-than-material realms.As Ezekiel states, “The glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. . . and the earth shined with his glory.”Some years ago, Ananda Sangha, near Assisi, Italy, wanted to place a replica ofthe spiritual eye above the altar of its new temple. Ananda representatives wentto Murano, a city famous for its works in glass. Approaching a well-knownartisan, they described to him what they wanted. The man replied, astounded:“Why, that is something I have seen all my life!” He was deeply excited. “Tellme: What is this light?” He was a devout Christian, but knew nothing of theteachings of yoga. When that inner light had been explained to him, he wasthrilled with devotional fervor.Many yoga students, indeed, have told us over the years that they’d seen thislight long before they first heard what it was. This light, in other words, isno hallucination created by subjective expectation. The spiritual eye existsalready in everybody. All can see it, when their minds are deeply focused andcalm.What does the spiritual eye look like? When seen perfectly, it is a halo ofgolden light surrounding a field of deep blue, in the center of which is asilvery-white, five-pointed star.The spiritual eye is, in fact, a reflection of the cosmic energy entering thebody and sustaining it. Its portal of entry is the medulla oblongata at the baseof the brain. I find myself suddenly in a position, here, of having to explain anumber of deep, esoteric, but fundamental and important spiritual truths thatare well known in the yoga teachings, but that are completely foreign to mostorthodox Christians.For now comes the question: What’s all this about energy entering the body? Wequoted earlier the words that Jesus addressed to the “tempter” (Satan), afterhis forty-day fast in the wilderness. Satan had urged Jesus to ask God toappease his hunger by converting the surrounding stones into bread. It isagainst highest spiritual usage to pray for oneself, since man’s ultimate dutyis to rise out of ego-consciousness altogether. I don’t mean to suggest that itis always wrong to pray for oneself. Still, in the case of someone fullyenlightened, like Jesus, a higher dimension of spiritual truth manifests itself.A story comes to mind which was told me by my Guru. A saint in India once becameill; his disciples said to him, “Sir, you’ve prayed for many of us so often inour illnesses. Why don’t you now pray to the Divine Mother that She heal you,also?” Thinking it over, the guru decided they might be right. He prayed to God,therefore, as the Divine Mother of the Universe, and asked Her to heal him. Sheappeared to him with a stern visage and said, “Of all things! You have realizedyour oneness with Me. How is it that now you want to descend from that heightand pray for your little self? Shame on you!” The saint, of course, hastilyretracted his prayer.Therefore also Saint Bernadette refused to seek healing from the miraculouswaters of Lourdes, which she herself had brought into existence through herecstatic visions. (On her deathbed she cried, “The spring flows not for me!”)And so we can understand the reply that Jesus gave to Satan: “But he answeredand said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every wordthat proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” (Matt. 4:4)I didn’t discuss, the first time I quoted this passage, what Jesus meant by thatreference to “the mouth of God.” Paramhansa Yogananda explained it this way: Allof us have two points of entry through which we draw energy into the body: ourphysical mouths, which enable us to eat material food; and the medulla oblongataat the base of the brain, through which the life force and cosmic energy enterdirectly into the body from the surrounding universe.The Bible is, in fact, full of esoteric teachings that might be described as“pure yoga.” How could it be otherwise? For truth is simply a fact. As I havestated many times before, Truth is universal. There is no such thing as a “true,Christian vision,” from which anyone belonging to some other religion is, by his“wrong structure of beliefs,” automatically debarred. We become worthy toexperience a divine truth not by what we believe, but by the purity of ourhearts, and by our calmness of mind and feeling.“Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom ofheaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father, which is in heaven.” (Matt.7:21)As Christians can address God in their own language, whatever that may be,using, therefore, different words and different appellations for the Lord(calling Him, variously, Dieu, Gott, Dio, Jehovah, etc.), so also it must beclearly understood that God is pleased with man according to his purity ofheart, which he offers up to Him with love. God cares not at all whether we loveHim in Christ’s name or in the name of some other great savior, or even if wevisualize Him in some other way, so long as we love Him. Everyone who has lovedGod finds, in his ensuing clarity and expansion of consciousness, a windowopening onto the Infinite, Divine Consciousness.So then, you may ask, “What’s all this about energy entering the body throughthe mouth of God”? Modern man is still deluded in his belief that ourconsciousness is produced by brain activity (“I think, therefore I am”); thatthe body is what gives us life; that any energy acquired by the body has to cometo it in the form of material food, or from air. It is consciousness alone, inthe first place, which makes it possible for the brain to think. Similarly,without energy coming to us from an inner, subtler source—the true source of alllife in the body—we would not be able even to eat or digest our food!Sufficient proof of this truth has been offered mankind through certain of thegreat saints, such as Therese Neumann in Germany, who lived for many yearswithout eating any food at all.We live always by that energy, drawing from it more than we consciously realize.Yogananda explained that will power is the secret by which we draw energyconsciously into the body.Here’s an example of how we draw on it at will. Imagine yourself living alone.One day you return home from work utterly exhausted. This, you tell yourself, isone evening when you want only to flop down on your bed and sleep for long, longhours. You may even wonder whether you have the energy to get undressed and slipunder the covers.And then, suddenly, the telephone rings. An old friend you haven’t seen foryears is in town, and must leave again the following morning. Can the two ofyou, he asks, spend a little time together this evening?Imagine your response. Of course you want to see him! Of course you’re thrilledhe’s in town! Of course you have all the energy to go “out on the town” withhim! You may even return home late that evening. Even so, you rise the nextmorning full of energy in the recollection of the happy evening you spenttogether.“The greater the will,” Paramhansa Yogananda often said, “the greater the flowof energy.” He taught a set of what he called “energization exercises” by whichone can learn how to live, ever-increasingly, by cosmic energy, drawing on thatenergy with the power of will. Regular practice of those exercises enables onealso to be less dependent on outer, physical sustenance.The medulla oblongata is the one part of the body that cannot be operated upondirectly. It is the seat of life in the body. Energy enters into the bodythrough this point. The medulla is reflected, as I said, in the forehead, whereit is seen as the spiritual eye. The reason for the concentric rings in thespiritual eye, which I described earlier, with its five-pointed star in thecenter, has to do with our subtler astral and causal bodies, and with thechannels of awakening in the spine of each of those bodies.Well, then, shall I say, “In for a penny, in for a pound”? How can I suddenlyplunge you into these deep waters, when I haven’t been able even to ask youwhether you know how to swim? Well, let’s give it a try, anyway.There is another consideration. The Bible (in the Book of Genesis) says, “AndGod said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” (Gen. 1:26) Thispassage has been taken to mean that God has a man-like appearance. This is,however (as we’ve seen already), quite impossible. Study that sentence moreclosely. You’ll see that it isn’t God who has the form of a man, but man who wasmade, somehow, in the image of God. There is, indeed, something about the wayour bodies were made that clearly reflects the divine image.The five-pointed star at the center of the spiritual eye is the doorway throughwhich our minds can penetrate into the inner kingdom of God. The five pointscorrespond, interestingly, to the shape of the human body. Stand with your armsstretched out to the side, and your legs wide apart. That shape, with your headat the top: Do you see its general resemblance to a five-pointed star? Theoriginal design of our bodies was based on that star in the spiritual eye. Wewere literally made “in the image of God.” This wasn’t a merely poetic imagemeant to indicate somehow a higher potential in ourselves. And it didn’t mean,as orthodox dogma would have it, that only human beings possess souls. In fact,we are souls: we possess bodies.I mentioned the Star of Bethlehem, earlier. It was the star in the spiritualeye, which the wise men of the East followed eastward (they were, in literalfact, traveling westward) to the Christ Child. Any star in the heavens, as Ipointed out, if it’s seen over a stable would appear over something else if onewent behind that stable. The star, here, has a deeply esoteric meaning.The story of the wise men means, for “those with eyes to see (or ears to hear),”that they’d perceived a wondrous truth: The Lord Himself had incarnated on earthin human form, through Jesus Christ! The divine light had descended from theSupreme Spirit itself. The Biblical account was written to imply, to those whocould understand, that Jesus Christ was no common baby, but the Lord Himselfdescended to earth in a human body. The wise men had been appointed by God tomake this sublime fact known.And so (to return to Ezekiel) when one is deeply focused in prayer andmeditation on the spiritual eye, he beholds the light of God, and sees that allthings have their being in that light. “And the earth shined with his glory.”(Ezekiel 43:2)Ezekiel described another phenomenon. “His voice,” we read earlier in thatpassage, “was like a noise of many waters.” These words speak of the mightysound of AUM, the Holy Ghost (or Holy Spirit). The Book of Revelation, also,states: “and his voice [was] as the sound of many waters.” (Rev. 1:15)That sound has been described variously in the Bible, as well as in many otherscriptures. In the Acts of the Apostles we read that on the day of Pentecost thedisciples (to whom Jesus had promised to send the Holy Ghost) were gatheredtogether, and heard “a rushing mighty wind.” (Acts 2:2) Indeed, one sometimesfeels in meditation a sensation as though an actual breeze were blowing(usually, however, rather gently) on the body when one is sitting perfectlystill. It can happen in a closed room, and bears no relationship, in otherwords, to any outer movement in nature. This breeze, too, is a manifestation ofAUM.You may have gone occasionally to some place where deep silence reigned. Haven’tyou sometimes been aware, in such places, of a quiet, rushing sound in yourears? It occurs usually in the right ear, and may suggest the gentle sound ofthe wind through pine trees. This, too, is a manifestation of the AUM sound, theHoly Ghost, or Holy Spirit.Don’t think that it is only a soothing sound, however. The Book of Job tells us,“God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which wecannot comprehend.” (Job 37:5)And again the Bible says: “Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; Ianswered thee in the secret place of thunder.” (Psalms 81:7)AUM is a sound with which all can commune, and into which also, in time, all canmerge. It will help greatly to learn the method for deepening this communion. Itwas for this reason that Jesus told Peter, “And I will give unto thee the keysof the kingdom of heaven.” (Matt. 16:19) That marvelous passage will be treatedagain at some length later on. My intention, here, is to share with you animportant statement Yogananda made. He said the “keys” Jesus referred to are thespiritual techniques by which true seekers of God can achieve their high aim ofunion with God.Yoga is a very ancient science. It is based on simple realities of human naturethat are, indeed, universally recognized. The techniques and teachings of yogaare highly spiritual. We’ll devote more space, in the next chapter, tocorrelating the exotic-sounding yoga science with everyday, human realities.Here let me state only that what is involved is simple recognition of thoserealities, and not any strained, “far out” invention. For now, I offer twouniversally recognized facts, in the hope of convincing you that I am not,myself, being merely “far out.”1. Yogis say the seat of the will, of the intellect, and of concentration is apoint in the forehead midway between the two eyebrows. It is a commonly knownfact that, when we exert our will or try to puzzle out some complex thought, orwhen we make a special effort to concentrate deeply, we tend quite naturally toknit our eyebrows. This slight frown is a clear indication that we areattempting to focus our mind’s energy at that point.Is there—we may then ask—something special about that point in the foreheaditself? No, not there exactly, but just behind that point, in the brain.The frontal lobe of the brain is associated with intellectual effort, and withthe higher aspects of mentation. It is no great mental stretch to consider thatthere may exist, just behind that point in the forehead, the exact area (asyogis claim) on which to concentrate if one wants to develop the higher aspectsof his consciousness.In focusing at that point, the eyes are drawn upward naturally. It is, indeed,no accident that saints in a deep state of ecstasy have been seen, and have beenso depicted in works of art, with their eyes gazing upward.2. Yogis say that emotional feeling, deep love, and intuition are all centeredin the heart. It is again a simple fact that our deep feelings are centeredthere. The area of the heart is also the location of a woman’s breasts—owing,again, to woman’s enhanced capacity for sensitive feeling. A “love-sick swain”may lament, “My heart is broken!” but he’ll never say, for example, “My kneehurts!”The heart has been found—so I have read—to contain a far more elaborate complexof nerves than previously imagined. It is, in any case, much more than a merephysical pump to send blood throughout the body.Actually, yogis say that the spiritual center of feeling lies at a point in thespine just behind the physical heart. (We’ll go into this subject more deeplyduring a discussion of the spine, in the next chapter.) Yoga teaches theimportance of concentrating energy in the heart—or, more specifically, in thespinal center behind the heart. That is where the feeling quality must beawakened. From there it must be directed upward to the point between theeyebrows. The heart’s feelings should be kept reined in, and not allowed tospill outward and waste themselves in emotion, nor to flow downward in thespine. If the energy flows to the lower centers in the spine, one’sconsciousness becomes drawn downward also, to lower states of consciousness.The experiences I’ve described are universal to all humanity, and may help toexplain that, when one develops sensitivity to them, he can deepen his insightalso into the Bible and into the teachings of Jesus Christ.Jesus said, “Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they arewhite already to harvest.” (John 4:35)Again, Psalm 121:1,2 states, “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, fromwhence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord.”And, regarding the heart, Jesus said: “Blessed are the pure in heart: for theyshall see God.” (Matt. 5:8) Only when one is free from any ulterior,ego-generated motives, and is able to be wholly absorbed in God’s love, can heknow God.Again, Jesus said, “A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringethforth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evilthings.” (Matt. 12:35) Yoga emphasizes the importance of keeping the heartfilled with “good treasure”: kindly thoughts, devotion, love, calm feeling,non-attachment to everything material.“Evil treasure,” on the other hand, lies heavily on the heart, and pulls one’senergy downward. Therefore we read, of Judas Iscariot when he betrayed Jesus,“And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of JudasIscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him. . . .” (John 13:2) The impulse towardtreachery is one of the heart’s “evil treasures.” Evil is called such when it ismore than a mere suggestion in the mind, but is entertained and “treasured” bythose who harbor dark motives in their hearts. Those dark “treasures” aremanifestations of satanic influence on those people whose hearts have turned“desirefully” toward delusion. Evil motives plunge one’s consciousness downwardinto ever-deeper mental darkness.It is interesting that the Biblical account describes “the devil” putting thethought of betrayal “into the heart of Judas.” Indeed it so happens because, asYogananda said, “Thoughts are universally and not individually rooted.” We firsttap the source of negative consciousness in the universe by ourselves thinkingwrong thoughts, and by mentally toying with any desire we harbor, even lightly,in our hearts. Those thoughts and desires send rays of magnetic energy into theinfinite, attracting a compatible energy. It depends on whether our “invitation”is positive or negative. In either case it can uplift us, in turn, heavenward,or cast us down into ever-deeper darkness and suffering.If a person wants to cleanse himself of impure motives, or to strengthen hisinner purity, the best place to start is by spurning every impure imagination,which people tend too easily to “play with” in an effort (so they may tellthemselves) to “understand” and reason their way out of that thought. Instead,one should concentrate on raising his feelings from the heart to the highercenters in the throat and the head. If he can harmonize those feelings, upliftthem, and then channel them to the spiritual eye (the “Christ center”) in theforehead, he will find that his tendency to objectify impure feelings onto theworld around him will change completely. Almost automatically, they will becomepurified.Without subtle techniques such as these, which Jesus called “keys to thekingdom,” it is difficult for people to develop spiritually. They may try, forexample, to direct love toward God but, despite their best efforts, find theirfeelings being dispersed in a thousand different directions of restless emotion.They may try to concentrate on God, but, having no idea how to do so, find theirthoughts running riot.A cousin of mine gave birth to a baby with a defective heart. The mother prayeddesperately.“It was so discouraging,” she later admitted to me. “Even though I desperatelylonged to pray with all my heart, my thoughts kept straying off toward uselessdistractions. I found myself wondering whether the milkman had delivered themilk that day; asking myself what to prepare for lunch; hoping my husband wouldreturn from work in time for dinner. Intense though the pain was that I felt formy baby, I simply couldn’t concentrate. It made me weep with frustration torealize that I simply couldn’t help myself!”I told her she should take up yoga.Yoga is not some unnatural, pagan ritual. It is no more foreign-seeming than youyourself are! It puts to practical use, rather, certain realities with whicheveryone is at least partly familiar. Is yoga, then, unchristian, simply becauseit is a foreign word? Preposterous!Let me quote for you one more passage in that first chapter of St. John. “No manhath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of theFather, he hath declared him.” (John 1:18) It is heart-rending to read thispassage through the eyes of someone who believes himself essentially differentfrom God, and doomed by original sin to eternity in hell unless he accepts JesusChrist and believes that Christ died for our sins.I still remember my mother’s tears of anguish when, at the age of sixteen, Itold her I would not go to church with her anymore. She came weeping to my roomlater that day, and cried, “Oh, how it pains me to think that my own child iscondemning himself to eternal hell!” (And she had given me with heartfelt loveto God, as her first child, while still she carried me in her womb.) I nextremember her coming to me a few days later, with profound relief in her eyes.She told me with deep hope that she had just read somewhere that rejection isoften the first step toward deeper acceptance.I replied, “You’ve understood.” Sadly, I was never able to share with anyone,not even with my mother, my own deeply spiritual search.Yogananda’s most important message on the teachings of Christ was that man is,and cannot but be, a child of God. There is nothing, anywhere in all creation,but Divine Consciousness. As my Guru often told us, “To call yourself a sinneris itself the greatest sin!”Truly, human eyes cannot behold God. Only the eyes of the soul are clear enoughto perceive Him. The above passage is deeply true, but the way it ends: “theonly begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him,”is open to so many misinterpretations that I cannot but suspect those words weresomehow “refined” to fit in with dogmatic understanding.Well, they’re all that we have of that passage, and in essence they are true;they simply need to be understood deeply enough to correspond to SanaatanDharma—that eternally true religion which embraces the whole universe. Yes, itis only in Christ consciousness that God becomes fully revealed. But yes, also,we all can—indeed, we must, eventually—attain Christ consciousness ourselves.What happens during deep meditation? First, the sacred AUM vibration is heard inthe right ear; then, later, in the whole body. As meditation deepens, one findshis consciousness merging in the Cosmic Vibratory sound. One then realizes it asthe one, true Self. After hearing and feeling its vibration pervading the body,one’s consciousness expands to embrace all creation.One then feels, subtly underlying the vibrations in one’s own body, the stillreflection in it of the Christ consciousness—the “Only Begotten” because, in allcreation, no other reflection exists of the one, still, ever-unmoving,vibrationless Spirit beyond creation.With continuously deepening meditation, one’s consciousness expands, andultimately embraces the Christ consciousness everywhere. It is omnipresent inall creation. This is the Christ, the only begotten Son, who, the Bible says,“declares” God, by revealing Him in the soul.Really, it may all appear as though one had to learn a new language! So manyfalse concepts abound in “Churchianity”! The chief incentive for learning this“language” is that, if we reject it, we turn our backs on what we ourselves mostdeeply want in our own hearts and souls.Too many challenges have been hurled at Christianity: hurled by science; hurledby those who comprise so much of modern scholarship; hurled by an evolving worldview, in our modern times, that is ever-increasingly at variance with almosteverything one hears when he goes to church. The supreme justification forlearning this new language—the ancient language of spiritual awareness—is that,literally, nothing else works.If any other alternatives worked, I’d say with Shakespeare in Hamlet, “grapplethem to thy soul with hoops of steel.” But the fact is, they simply don’t! Theyare, all of them, only snares and delusions. Show me a truly happy scientist,and I’ll say to you, “And why is he happy? Simply because, in addition to beinga scientist, he is also a saint.” Outside of God, so long as one roams in thethick woods of ego-consciousness, nothing else can ever work!People for countless incarnations do their utmost to “make it” on their own “outthere” in the world. Always they fail. There is, literally, only one way “out”:It is to seek God. His is the language Yogananda came to teach us. This was thelanguage that Jesus, too, spoke. It is the language of the soul.[5] This one is, I confess, only my invention."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 17[../Images/flower.jpg]THE SPINAL HIGHWAY“The sabbath was made for man,” Jesus said, “and not man for the sabbath.” (Mark2:27)Everyone knows the story: how the disciples were picking corn on the sabbath,and the Pharisees criticized them for “working” on the biblically ordained dayof rest. The answer Jesus gave them has been applied, no doubt, to manydifferent situations, for it means also that all rules are for man’s sake,primarily, and aren’t there to satisfy a more abstract demand. Probably,however, that story has seldom, if ever, been taken to its ultimate conclusion.For in truth, the whole of Christ’s teaching refers not to external, but tointernal realities: not to some blessed eventual existence amid “heavenlysurroundings,” but to the inner man. Above all, every rule of religion, also, isthere to uplift us spiritually, and not to satisfy any demand made of us by God.I’ve quoted the following passage before: “The kingdom of God cometh not withobservation: Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, thekingdom of God is within you.” (Luke 17:20,21) As I’ve also said, everyreligious tradition on earth (as far as I know) thinks of heaven as situatedsomewhere “up above,” and of hell as being “down below.” In cosmic terms, theseconcepts obviously don’t work, for wherever we happen to be on earth, what seemsdown to us is up for people on the other side, and what seems up to us is,again, down for them—who, of course, aren’t walking about upside down, as peopleonce imagined. The realities of heaven and hell refer universally, as in thecase of the Sabbath, to realities within man himself—in fact, to the directionalflow of energy in his own body.Whatever uplifts our consciousness brings us greater inner happiness. Andwhatever lowers our consciousness diminishes that happiness and even makes usunhappy. It is a common description of happiness to say, quite literally, “Ifeel uplifted,” or, “I’m flying high today.” By contrast, when we are unhappy weuse expressions that describe a downward flow of energy and consciousness.People say, “I feel low,” or, “I’m feeling downcast,” or, “depressed.”Christian truths must be understood above all, then, in relation to universal,even if still human, realities. Every true scripture is concerned much less withabstractions than with the truth as it affects man himself.There is a book, which claims to be a scripture, that enjoyed a certainpopularity when I was young, and is still read (though perhaps less widely so).Its name is The Urantia Book. The book deals with all sorts of supposedphenomena such as the various categories of angels, and gives detaileddescriptions of the astral worlds. I haven’t read much of it, and perhaps am notbeing wholly fair. It does seem to contain fascinating stuff, perhaps especiallyfor the sort of people who are interested in science fiction. Its subject matteris not at all the domain of genuine scripture, however. The whole message oftrue scripture, and certainly of Jesus Christ, was directed, by contrast, towarduplifting man’s own consciousness, and concentrates on what will raise himtoward God. Christ’s message concerns, also, necessary warnings against whatmight alienate man from his own potential for Divine Bliss.When the “mother of Zebedee’s children” came to Jesus with her sons and said tohim, “Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and theother on the left, in thy kingdom,” (Matt. 20:20–22) the account goes on to say,“But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask.” Indeed, the question wasa foolish one.People have too long imagined Jesus and his Father seated in heaven on exaltedthrones, as if holding court. The divine consciousness, however, is omnipresent.It exists already, albeit unrecognized, within everyone, be he king, courtier,or commoner. The Divine is subtly present within every creeping snail andcrawling beetle—indeed, in every rock. Certainly it is not ensconced forever, instasis, on a throne!Jesus once compared the kingdom of heaven to a tiny mustard seed (Matthew13:31). Has anyone ever made the leap from that thought of a sprouting, and thenupward-growing mustard seed to the shining astral heavens? If so, it is a leapmy own little brain is incapable of making. What Jesus referred to in thatparable was, again, man’s own latent potential to raise and expand hisconsciousness, spiritually, into oneness with Omnipresent God. That expansion isaccomplished by removing, one by one, all the self-enclosing veils whichconstitute our egoic limitations.Jesus said he had come to fulfill the law and the prophets (Matt. 5:17). Fromthose words we may understand that what the ancient prophets taught were truthsimplicit also in Christ’s teachings.Isaiah declares: “The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye theway of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.“Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low:and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:“And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed.” (Isaiah 40:3–5)The “highway for our God,” which Isaiah said must be “made straight,” is thespine. The “rough places” are the ups and downs of duality (dwaita), which aresmoothed out when human consciousness finally comes to rest at its true centerin the Self within.Here again, common understanding soars above common belief. Everyone, that is tosay, knows that a straight spine indicates someone who is upright, honest, andwho possesses noble and lofty ideals. Someone lacking in will power, on theother hand, is commonly described as “spineless.” In English, at least, adishonest person is described also as “crooked”—an image suggestive of someonewhose spine is far from straight. Few people, unfortunately, are aware of howimportant a straight spine is to their own spiritual development.Physically speaking, one thing is obvious. A bent spine makes it more difficultto fill the lungs with air and, therefore, to breathe properly. Mentally orattitudinally, a straight spine indicates courage. Discouragement, on the otherhand, or a lack of strong will power, reveal themselves instantly in a bentspine. Spiritually speaking, therefore, it can easily be understood that astraight spine is important for lifting the body’s energy upward. A bent spineindicates a downward flow of both energy and awareness.When energy is centered particularly in the heart—that is to say, especially, inthat region of the spine which is located behind the heart—it means that thefeelings, or emotions, are deeply affected. Feeling may be evoked eitherspontaneously from within, or by inner reaction to some outer occurrence. Allemotions are indicative of at least somewhat excited feelings. Calm feelingalone brings true, intuitive perception.When the feeling quality is directed upward, particularly to the “Christ center”between the eyebrows, one develops aspiring love for God.Again, when energy becomes centered (especially by deliberate effort) in thearea of the spine behind the throat, calmness is induced, and an inner feelingof expansion.Energy centered in the medulla oblongata must be allowed to flow on toward thepositive pole of this medulla, which lies in the front of the brain at a pointbetween the eyebrows, in the “Christ center.” If, on the other hand, that upwardenergy flow is blocked in the medulla, it increases one’s focus on theimportance of his ego. (Therefore it is that egotists are said to “look downtheir noses” at others. The concentration of energy in the medulla createstension in that region, and draws the head backward.)Energy centered in the lower centers of the spine draws the mind down towardmatter-attachment.Even the gestures of dance suggest varying mental states. Sinuous movements, forexample, especially of the hips, suggest sexual desire, or an effort to temptothers sexually. Strong movements of the legs and feet suggest strong earthlyattachment. Gracious, upward movements of the arms suggest a more uplifted,spiritual consciousness. Movements of the head indicate a variety of attitudes,whether gentle, uplifted, or arrogant. Arrogance is displayed by movements inwhich people toss their heads about: backward, or energetically from side toside. Such movements are often displayed, for instance, by singers of “pop”(meaning popular) music. Movements that toss the head backward are also, ofcourse, indicative of contempt. Inclining the head forward in a positionsuggestive of the humble bow indicates a release of tension at the back and topof the neck, which can mean offering one’s consciousness forward toward theChrist center, or upward to God, or generously offering deference to others.“I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day,” says the Book of Revelation, “and heardbehind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, thefirst and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto theseven churches which are in Asia.” (Rev. 1:10,11)Paramhansa Yogananda explained, first, that that “great voice” is the mightysound of AUM. Second, he said, “the seven churches” indicate—“for them that haveears to hear”—an inner, not an outer reality: the centers in the spine. Theentire Apocalypse (as this book is often called also) is not a book ofprophecies concerning the future—unless that future be understood as a referenceto man’s own future inner enlightenment. The above passage continues:“And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw sevengolden candlesticks [candle holders].” (Rev. 1:12) What did St. John the Divinemean by, “I turned”? One explanation of this expression would be that Johnturned his head to see what was behind him. Another—indeed, the intended—meaningis that John “turned within.” Normally, man’s energy flows outward to the bodyand onward, through the five senses, to the surrounding world. To turn one’senergy backward, then, means to redirect it inward: to withdraw the energy fromthe outer body in deep meditation.A voice isn’t something one “sees,” of course. Probably the original statementwas that John perceived, rather than saw, the voice, which was the great innersound of AUM. One can both hear and see (“perceive” in both cases) the subtlespinal centers. The topmost of them is higher than the spine, at the crown ofthe head. The spiritual centers, then, are seven in number. The passagecontinues:“And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man,clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a goldengirdle.“His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyeswere as a flame of fire;“And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and hisvoice as the sound of many waters.“And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharptwoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.“And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.” (Rev. 1:13–17) The scripturegoes on to speak of the blessings that accrued from this experience.“I fell at his feet as dead.” Those words, Yogananda explained, have a subtlemeaning. They indicate the state of deep inner ecstasy, when one’s energy iscompletely withdrawn from the senses and the body, freeing the soul to soar inthe Infinite. In this context, Yogananda often quoted the words of St. Paul, “Iprotest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.”(I Cor. 15:31) Many Christian saints have been observed in a state of such deepinwardness, in meditation, that their bodies have actually appeared “as dead.”The “son of man” refers here, not to Jesus the Son of God, but to John’s ownhuman form (the son of man) in his astral body, which is in fact very much likethe physical body, though in fact the human body is only a replica of the astralbody and not the reverse.“His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyeswere as a flame of fire; and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned ina furnace.” (See above) These are descriptions, again, of the astral body. Thehighest center, at the top of the head, is called in the yoga teachings thesahasrara, or “thousand-rayed lotus.” It is so described because rays of lightradiate outward from that point in all directions. The Book of Revelationdescribes that “crown chakra” as “white like wool, as white as snow,” for thepurest light of the astral body emanates from this highest center.His eyes were “as a flame of fire.” This was because great energy flows outthrough the eyes. The quality of that energy depends on the thoughts andfeelings that animate it.The feet are described as being “like unto fine brass, as if they burned in afurnace,” because the lowest, and therefore (relatively speaking) the dimmest,energy in the astral body emanates from the feet.The “golden candlesticks” and “seven stars” indicate the spinal centers,including the spiritual eye, or reflection of the medulla which in Sanskrit iscalled the agya chakra. The real seventh center in the body is situated at thetop of the head in the sahasrara. This center, however, can be reached only byopening and passing through the spiritual eye. Until that time the spiritual eyedoes double duty, serving both as the positive pole of the medulla oblongata andas the highest of the centers. Therefore I have described the seventh center asbeing, provisionally, not the sahasrara but the spiritual eye.“And out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword.” (See above) From eachchakra, rays of energy flow out to bring sustenance to corresponding parts ofthe body. “Out of his mouth” is a reference, not to the physical mouth, but tothe medulla oblongata, or agya chakra. In the physical body, the mouth takes inphysical food. The astral body, however, lives mostly by energy, which it drawsin through the medullary center. The two rays that “go out” from the medullaoblongata move outward from that center into the body, not outward from thebody. These two rays represent the i.da and pingala na.dis, as they are known inSanskrit: nerve channels, in other words, which travel along the length of theastral spine. (In fish, these two nerves may be seen running alongside the wholespine.) These nerve channels represent central bodily realities, producing theimpulse to inhale, without which one would feel no inclination to breathe. Thesubtle cause of inhalation is an upward flow of energy through i.da in theastral spine. The subtle cause of exhalation, similarly, is a downward flowthrough pingala.Energy flowing upward and downward through the i.da and pingala nerve channelsaccompanies our emotional reactions to the world around us: upward, when thereactions are positive; downward, when they are negative. (This is, as I’veindicated before, a common human experience. When a person feels good aboutsomething, he tends to inhale, and also to sit up straighter. When he feelsbadly, on the other hand, he usually sighs, and also slumps forward as ifunwilling to take another deep breath.)When a baby is born, it utters its first cry (in disappointment, Yogananda said,at having to cope once again with matter!). Before it can emit that first cry,however, it must inhale. At death, one’s final act is a prolonged exhalation.The highest technique of yoga, known as Kriya Yoga, requires that one magnetizethe energy in the spine, first by deliberately controlling the energy-flow inthe two superficial nerve channels (i.da and pingala), and then by neutralizingthat superficial flow in breathlessness. Complete inner, bodily stillness thencauses a withdrawal of one’s energy into the central, or deep spine.The deep spine contains three concentric channels of energy, each of which mustbe entered and passed through in turn. They correspond to the ring of goldenlight, the circular blue field inside it, and the silvery white, five-pointedstar in the center, all of which together form the spiritual eye.“Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at theposts of my doors.” (Proverbs 8:34) The “posts of my doors” are the spiritualcenters of the spine through which the energy must be directed upward forenlightenment. “Heareth me” (above) signifies listening to AUM, and also to thesounds that emanate from each of the chakras. (These are all subsidiaries ofAUM.)Even in outward, physical imitations, these sounds can be thrilling. A drumsound (or, alternately, a humming, beelike, droning sound) emanates, whenstimulated, from the lowest (coccyx) center.A flute sound (or, alternately, a sound resembling crickets, or a ripplingbrook) emanates when the second (or sacral) center is stimulated.The sound of plucked harp strings, or of any plucked string instrument,indicates that the third, or lumbar center has been stimulated.A deep gong bell sound is a sign that the inner heart, or dorsal, center hasbeen stimulated.A rushing sound, like the wind through tall pine trees, indicates that theenergy is centered in the cervical center, opposite the throat.And a symphony of all the sounds (the mighty AUM) comes when the energy isdeeply centered in the agya, or medulla oblongata, or at the positive pole ofthat chakra in the spiritual eye.“Watching daily at my gates” (above) signifies meditating on the chakras. Inmeditation, try chanting AUM mentally at each chakra (three times each is a goodnumber), and endeavor to see the light emanating from each of them. Chanting AUMat the chakras stimulates the upward flow of energy through them, toward thebrain.The “garment down to the foot” (above) indicates what is known as the aura, alight which surrounds the astral body.The girdle, mentioned in the words, “and girt about the paps with a goldengirdle,” is that extra energy of love which surrounds the heart region.“When the enemy [Satan] shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shalllift up a standard against him.” (Isaiah 59:19) The standard, here, is thespine, which must be raised “against him” by straightening the spine, therebyallowing the energy to flow upward to the brain.“Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God. . . . Thou wast upon the holymountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones offire.” (Ezekiel 28:13,14) The “holy mountain of God” is what Christian mysticshave called “Mount Carmel,” symbolic, for them, of the pinnacle of spiritualattainment. The “stones of fire” are the spinal chakras, each blazing with itsown particular light.And what, finally, do those words mean, “Thou hast been in Eden the garden ofGod”? Much effort has been expended by Christian scholars of various types todetermine where on earth the Garden of Eden might have been located. Thatlocation is, in fact, within every one of us! Eden is discovered when a person’sconsciousness becomes fully centered in the spiritual eye.Adam and Eve experienced a spiritual fall because they had succumbed to thewiles of the “serpent.” They were “cast out,” therefore, from the Garden ofEden. The serpent, here, signifies especially (as we shall explain later) thetemptation to indulge in the instinctive creative desire for sexual procreationand enjoyment. (Interesting, isn’t it, that all sinuous dances, suggestive asthey are of a serpentine movement, are particularly associated with sexualtemptation?)More of this, however, in the next chapter.Let me return now (at the end of this chapter) to Christ’s admonition, which Imentioned early on in this book: “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”(Quoted by St. Paul in Acts 20:35)When we give from our hearts to others, the very gestures that often accompanythat giving, and also our energy-flow, are outward and self-expansive. Giving toothers is blessed, because it brings us more “bliss.” That is to say, it makesus happier, for it expands our self-identity to include, in our own well-being,the well-being of others.The contrary is true also: When we clutch our feelings to ourselves, as ifholding them to our chests, we become more unhappy, for thereby we narrow ourown self-identity.There is, however, another aspect to giving, also. When we give of ourselvesoutwardly to others, we expand our self-identity, but that act can’t altogetherrelease us from identity with the ego. Sattwic, self-ennobling qualities enlargethe sympathies, but are not enough in themselves to bring soul-liberation.To free ourselves completely from ego-involvement, we must “give” also (andprimarily) upward, to God, rather than only outward, to others.When the heart’s energy is offered up through the spine, and is allowed to flowfreely through the medulla oblongata (instead of being blocked there) to thespiritual eye in the forehead, the ego-sense (which is centered in the medulla)is released, and spiritualized, to become soul-consciousness.Medically speaking also, there is a connection between the heart and themedulla. The medulla controls the rate of the heartbeat. Spiritually speaking,when one’s feelings (centered in the heart region) grow light and “airy,” theirenergy rises naturally upward. The medulla oblongata also, in this case, becomes“light,” for, receiving that upward flow of energy, it passes the energy onwardto the spiritual eye.When, by contrast, the feelings in the heart grow heavy, they exert a downwardpull on the ego in the medulla also, and as a result bring one’s consciousself-identity down into the lower spinal centers. Thus, heavy feelings lower theconsciousness.Our duty, if we love God and the teachings of His son Jesus Christ, or merely ifwe want our own true happiness, is to raise our hearts’ feelings and energyupward, toward that kingdom of God which, Jesus declared, lies “within.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 18[../Images/flower.jpg]THE SERPENT POWER“And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son ofman be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but haveeternal life.” (John 3:14,15)It must be noted specifically, here, that it is Jesus who speaks these words.Their very context, especially as the passage continues, clearly suggests hisfuture crucifixion. This passage occurs quite early, however, in the Gospel ofJohn, even before the story of his encounter with the woman of Samaria. Theresimply has to have been some other interpolation here—a reshuffling of certainstatements and events. I don’t mean to suggest that those who later wroteChrist’s story might have resorted to outright invention. How else to explain,however, this clear reference to the Crucifixion, an event about which no onelistening to Christ’s discourse could have had even the slightest suspicion?What makes sense here, surely—and in many other passages as well—is thatChrist’s words, although recorded conscientiously (as I truly believe they were,for they ring with divine power),[6] were nevertheless selected from thingsJesus said at different times, and were later compiled in a way that seemedreasonable to those who were writing later on from memory, even many years afterhis death, or who tried to reconstruct his sayings in such sequences as seemedto them best. Indeed, even the most conscientious amanuensis has little choice,sometimes, other than to replace a word, or an expression, that is unfamiliar tohim with another that he can at least understand.The reference to Moses lifting up a serpent in the wilderness is deeplyesoteric. The reference to “the wilderness” makes it doubly so, as we’ll seepresently. Again, this reference to the “son of man” had to have a universalmeaning, referring to all men, for the essence of its teaching here isuniversally true. The passage following it, which I’ll quote in the nextchapter, seems clearly to be a non sequitur. Speaking of Moses raising theserpent, and relating that story to Christ’s Crucifixion, seems highlyinappropriate, besides—indeed, somewhat unfortunately so, since Jesus Christ, inthat case, is comparing himself to a serpent! Calvary, moreover, was neverdescribed as resembling, or even as being anywhere near, a wilderness.Intellectual analysis can take one very far away from the truth. I do, however,remember once asking my Guru, “Was Moses a master?”“Oh yes!” he replied emphatically. “He would have to have been: He lifted up theserpent in the wilderness.” It was obvious to me, from the vigor of his reply,that he was speaking from revealed wisdom. Yogananda knew Moses, inwardly in hissoul. He only gave that further explanation in order to underscore the truth ofhis reply. Still, what my Guru said Moses had accomplished in “raising theserpent” indicated that Moses was divinely awake in God. That “lifting up” in noway referred to any external event like the Crucifixion.“Wilderness” was an expression used often in the East as a spiritual symbol. Weshould remember, moreover—as Yogananda sometimes reminded us—that Jesus Christlived in what Europeans considered the East. “Wilderness,” in this passage,symbolized the perfect stillness of deep meditation, in which no “wild flowers”of worldly distraction bloom.Also, in the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam—a true Persian scripture of the eleventhcentury a.d., and one about which Yogananda wrote a deeply inspiringcommentary[7]—there is the quatrain (rubai), dearly familiar to Englishspeakers:Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough,A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse—and ThouBeside me singing in the Wilderness—And Wilderness is Paradise enow.Yogananda’s “Paraphrase” of this passage, taken from his book, precedes hislonger explanation of it. The paraphrase reads:“Withdraw your life-force [bread, or life-sustaining energy] into the center ofthe tree [the bough] of life, the spine, and bask there in the cool shade ofinner peace. As the sensory tumult dies away, drink the wine of bliss from theflask of your devotion. Commune inwardly with your Divine Beloved.“And in stillness, listen: For the Singing Blessedness will satisfy your everyheart’s desire, and entertain you forever with melodies of perfect wisdom.”The “Book of Verse” (not mentioned in the above paraphrase) is defined fourpages later as: “The inspirations emanating from the book of the heart, once therestless emotions have been soothed, transformed into calm feeling.”Let us study the original account of Moses lifting up the serpent in thewilderness.“And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon apole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he lookethupon it, shall live.“And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass,that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, helived.” (Num. 21:8,9)Brass is a shiny substance. Here, it symbolizes the light of inner energy as ittravels up the spine. This story is deeply esoteric. In the last chapter Ireferred briefly to the sinuous movement of the hips that one sees in certaindances. The clear intention behind that movement is a sexual invitation. Arotary movement—usually counter-clockwise when viewed from above—suggests energymoving downward from the second chakra, or sacral center. When that center isstimulated, and the energy within it flows outward, sexual desire awakens in thebody. (With the first stirring of sexual desire, the spiritually aware personwill also feel a slight stirring of energy in his second chakra. He shouldrecognize, even in that faint stirring, a preliminary warning: sufficient, letus say, for the wise.)Let us return this discussion to our own physical “beginnings.” At conception,the sperm and ovum cells unite, then subdivide to produce the physical body.Their creative activity begins at the medulla oblongata, which remains everthereafter the seat of life in the body. From that point, the energy movesoutward and downward to create the brain, the spine, the nervous system, and therest of the body.When the life-energy has completed its creation of the spine, its downward flowcomes to a stop, physically speaking, at the base of the spine. The nervesemanating from the lowest center (the coccyx) flow outward to the organs ofexcretion and to the lower limbs. The base of the spine now becomes the negativepole of a magnet somewhat similar to a bar magnet.Bar magnets are formed when their molecules, each with its own north-southpolarity, all face in a single north-south direction. So long as those moleculesface randomly, the overall magnetism of the bar is neutralized.An ancient Hermetic teaching contains the words, “As above, so below.” The truthof these words may be seen all around us. It explains the correlation betweenmaterial and spiritual realities. Magnetism in a bar of metal is in many wayscomparable, as I said, to magnetism in the human spine, and also to the manymagnetic qualities that human beings manifest. Gravity, a universal force in thematerial world, is comparable, spiritually, to the attractive power of love.Physical pleasures have their spiritual counterpart in inner, soul-joy.Again, planetary motion around the sun is reminiscent, materially speaking, ofthe individual soul in its relationship to God. A planet is held—one might evensay, drawn inward—by the sun’s gravity. At the same time, however, it is kept inoutward orbit by the centrifugal force generated by its movement around the sun.Divine Love is thus duplicated, on the material plane, by the gravitational pullof the sun, which holds its planets in orbit around it. And the balancingcentrifugal force which pulls the planets away finds its counterpart in ourmaterial desires, which keep pulling us ever outward, away from God’s centerwithin, causing us to keep our distance from Him.The molecules in a bar magnet have their subtle counterpart in the mentaltendencies, or samskars, that dwell in men’s hearts, and that settle atdifferent heights along the spine. As mental tendencies can disperse their innerstore of energy in countless different directions, seeking an ever-imaginaryouter fulfillment, so our potentially enormous magnetism is neutralized by whatYogananda called “the conflicting crosscurrents of ego.” The more those samskarscan be directed upward, in spiritual aspiration, toward the “Christ center” inthe spiritual eye, and from there to the top of the head in the sahasrara, or“thousand-petaled lotus” (the “seat,” or “throne” of God), the more greatly isthe yogi’s overall magnetism increased.Materialistic consciousness, too, can generate considerable magnetism whenpeople focus their minds on any specific material goal, and when they direct alltheir energy toward achieving it. Thus, egotists and materialists are capablealso, with their magnetism, of strongly influencing others, even if those othershave loftier goals than their own. Thus, strongly magnetic materialistssometimes succeed even in inducing spiritually inclined people to assume theirown far-less-than-noble ambitions. Even those who are devoted to doing evil candevelop a strong evil magnetism if they direct their energies one-pointedlytoward dark ends.It is important, particularly for well-meaning Christians, to understand thesetruths, for many of them insist that one ought to love everyone equally. It isindeed important to love everyone, but I’ve always remembered something my Guruonce told me: “You must be practical in your idealism.” The love we give should,for one thing, be impersonal. In many cases, moreover, it should be restrainedfrom outward expression, and cherished only in the heart. In one’s behaviortoward others, it is important studiously to avoid sending energy to peoplewhose consciousness does not resonate sympathetically with one’s own, andparticularly with one’s own most cherished goals in life. One shouldparticularly avoid anyone who displays dark, evil magnetism. For you must neverimagine that your own spiritual magnetism will protect you merely because youare well-meaning. In any magnetic encounter, it is always, Yogananda explained,the stronger magnet which prevails.Those who aspire to develop spiritual awareness should avoid people who emanateeither a strongly materialistic or an evil vibration. They should take care alsonever to reach out with sympathy to such people in the hope, perhaps, ofuplifting them. Such efforts, unless one is very strong in himself, are fraughtwith danger.Paramhansa Yogananda stated that this principle of magnetic exchange needs to beviewed as a definite rule of life, especially for spiritual aspirants. Always,when two persons of different, and particularly of incompatible, interests mixtogether, the one with the stronger magnetism will influence the other, weakerone. If the stronger magnetism is materialistic, then, no matter how idealisticthe weaker one may be, that combination will produce two materialistic magnets.One who is trying to develop success magnetism of any kind may, in fact, succumbto strong failure magnetism if he mixes with failures. He should mixconsciously, therefore, and as much as possible, with people who are successfulin life, and particularly with those who have succeeded in his own field ofendeavor.Whatever skills you want to develop—be they business, artistic, athletic,culinary, or spiritual—make it a point to court, with concentration, theassociation of those who have a strong success magnetism in that field. Aspiringartists should mix with successful artists (especially with those whose tastesare compatible with their own), and should avoid those pleasant but vaguebohemian types who are mere dabblers at their craft.Aspiring devotees, then, must consider it supremely important to abide by theprinciple which, in India, is called satsang, or wholesome and upliftingspiritual company. The aspirant shows particularly clear discrimination if heseeks the company of saints, or lives together with other devotees who spenddedicated lives in a monastery or other kind of spiritual community.Therefore also the early Christians—who must surely have received their firstencouragement in this direction from Jesus Christ himself—gathered in groups forworship, and also lived together, later on, in little Christian communities.No illustration is ever perfect, of course. Thus, a bar magnet has the drawbackthat its molecules are inert. Thoughts, on the other hand, are conscious andvibrant; they can be directed deliberately, by an act of will, toward anydesired goal. The more one-pointed that focus, the greater will be one’smagnetism. Human beings can develop an infinite variety in their magnetism. Tosucceed in any field, success magnetism in that field is mandatory.Mix attentively, therefore, with people who have succeeded in your own field. Ifyour aim is spiritual, keep the company of those who aspire to become holy. Tryespecially to mix with saints. This is a cardinal principle. If you, as aspiritual aspirant, are forced to mix with worldly people, then make it a point,if possible, to keep a “spiritual bodyguard”: one or more friends who, like you,are sincerely following the spiritual path.I quoted the next passage in an earlier context:“Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Phariseesfast oft, but thy disciples fast not?“And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as longas the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroomshall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.” (Matt. 9:14,15)Jesus, while he was still outwardly with his disciples, served as theirprotector. People, on the other hand, with nothing to depend on but their ownstrength are wise to make it a point to mix as much as possible with others whoare at least of similar mind.Let us return now to our central point: the spine, and its resemblance to a barmagnet. The strongest magnetism is generated, as I said, when all one’s energyis flowing unidirectionally. This it can never do, so long as the energy movesoutwardly, away from one’s center. It must, above all, be directed upward in thespine. For only the spine can channel one’s entire flow of energy, whetherupward or downward. On the other hand, though it is at least theoreticallypossible to channel all one’s energy downward, toward a hypothetically absoluteevil, in fact such a goal cannot ever be achieved for the simple reason that theinner, divine Self alone is real and absolute. Any pull away from that realityresults in a diminution of energy. Any outward flow, again, since it is aprojection away from the source of energy in the spine, becomes dissipated andnecessarily, in time, depleted.Again I must emphasize that what we are speaking of here is conscious energy; weare not speaking any longer of the inert molecules in a bar magnet. Consciousenergy has no physical limitations either upward or downward. Passing up thespine, that movement leads eventually to infinity. Moving downward, one must, asa logical consequence, be able to continue indefinitely toward theinfinitesimal. The “south pole,” at the base of the spine, constitutes merely aphysical full stop. The downward-flowing energy is not so physically limited.Everyone is magnetically pulled in two opposite directions in the spine: upward,and downward. The upward pull is that of spiritual aspiration—the “divine call”within: God’s love, which seeks ever to draw us back to Himself. This pull iscountered by the opposite, downward pull toward ever lower states ofconsciousness, and outward toward increasing matter-involvement. These downwardand outward pulls are the effects of maya, which is also the consciousattractive power of Satan.In spiritually unawakened man, Satan has the upper hand at least to this extent:Past memories and habits in the subconscious call to man silently, “Turn back!Seek comfort once again in what has been long familiar to you: your past, yourold indulgences, your material comforts. All these things you know, understand,and have long enjoyed.” The voice of Satan whispers to the mind: “Dwell on thosethoughts! Was your life, then, really so bad? Why cut off every association withit? Why not reflect pleasantly, at least sometimes, on that association?” TheFrench have an expression for this allure. They call it: “la nostalgie de laboue: nostalgia for the mud.”The downward energy becomes locked, so to speak, at the base of the spine, andmaintains there a firm grip. It will not release its hold, nor will it let theenergy flow back upward again, until the “mud” has been vigorously shaken offand hosed away.The energy at the “south pole” of the spine is called, in Sanskrit, thekundalini. When its thrust is downward, it is called the sleeping kundalini.When it begins at last to move upward, its movement is called kundaliniawakening. To waken the kundalini is essential for spiritual aspirants. Withoutsuch awakening there can be no true spiritual unfoldment.If I seem to be expressing myself strongly here, it is because there has beenmuch ignorant literature published in the West, sternly warning people not everto try to awaken the kundalini. This advice is sheer nonsense. It is important,on the other hand, to understand that kundalini awakening should be natural,never forced.The kundalini has been known since ancient times, in religious circles of manypersuasions, as “the serpent power.” The reference is to the fact that thekundalini is said to lie coiled, serpent-like, at the base of the spine. Medicalscience, however, has discovered no passage of any kind in the bone structure atthat base. What happens, rather, is that a spiral motion begins when the energystarts to rise up the spine.When electricity is directed through an electric wire, its movement generates amagnetic field, which moves spirally around the wire. This fact suggests whatoccurs also with kundalini awakening: It is a spiral sensation in the spineitself. Often, this movement may cause the whole body at first to rotate in acircular fashion: clockwise, as seen from above. Progressive inner relaxationbrings that outward movement under control.“Davening” is the name for a Jewish practice during which men at prayer swaydeliberately forward and backward. The reason for this practice may, once again,be explained by a movement that is sometimes caused by heightening states ofconsciousness. Inner kundalini awakening does often create a similar swaying inthe body. A forward and backward motion is an early effect of that awakening.Merely to imitate that movement outwardly, however, is ineffectual; it cannotlead to any inner awakening.The upwardly moving kundalini, or “serpent power,” is blocked from furtherascent by the outward flow of energy in each of the respective chakras, orspinal centers. These centers must, each in turn, be “opened.” That is to say,their normally outward flow of energy must be reversed and directed upward, withkundalini’s passage up the spine. Only as each chakra “opens its door” to theupward-moving energy can the kundalini continue its upward journey.When the energy that was formerly locked at the base of the spine is reunited atlast with its highest point of origin at the crown of the head, full spiritualenlightenment is attained. That energy first reaches the medulla oblongata (theagya chakra). From that point it passes forward to the spiritual eye in theforehead. From there, finally, it rises and becomes united with the sahasrara atthe top of the head.Interestingly, Saint Teresa of Avila stated in her writings (I have not seen thepassage, but was told about it by a Catholic priest) that the seat of the soulis situated at the top of the head.This gradual awakening occurs in the “wilderness” of inner, meditativestillness. Kundalini is raised up the “pole” of the spine, as was the case withMoses. From then on, one can no longer be affected by delusion. Moses was alsoable, after his awakening, to free anyone else from the poison of delusion whohad been “bitten” by the downward-moving “serpents” of worldly desires. Thus weread, in that above passage: “And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upona pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when hebeheld the serpent of brass, he lived.”For the serpent of delusion—that which tempted Eve, and (through her) Adam, inthe Garden of Eden—has a poisonous bite. It doesn’t kill physically, but it canplunge to the “spiritual death” of delusion anyone who touches it willingly, andallows himself to be drawn by its fatal allure.“Bah!” the unwary may scoff. “It’s all in the mind. It can’t hurt me. I knowwhat I want!” The “serpent,” however, is more subtle than the mind of man. Satanis adept at seeking out any chink in a person’s spiritual armor. The wisestchoice by far—and by all means the safest—is to keep a “body guard”—that is tosay, to arm oneself with the company, at least inwardly, of a true spiritualmaster, or guru.Thus also, we may see an explanation for that person, whoever it was—perhapsJohn the Apostle himself—who combined the first of Christ’s words above(concerning Moses’ lifting up the serpent in the wilderness) with the hint ofChrist’s later crucifixion. This passage occurs, as I said, very early in John’sGospel. Christ, moreover, had also raised his own kundalini, for he was a truemaster. It would be perfectly consistent with his deeper teachings for him tosay, in reference to kundalini awakening (rather than to the Crucifixion), that“whosoever believes truly in him [the Christ] will not perish, but have eternallife.”It requires, however, a considerable mental stretch to tie this statement byJesus, literally true though it is, to that completely unanticipated event: hiscrucifixion. It is, on the other hand, universally true that the “son ofman”—every son of man—must lift his consciousness, through kundalini awakening,in order to know God.A vitally important technique for this awakening is Kriya Yoga. A principleeffect of Kriya Yoga is the circulation of energy around the spine, magnetizingit. It is also important, however, that Kriya Yoga be practiced with devotion,and with high spiritual aspiration. Too much has been made in the yoga teachingsof the importance of raising the kundalini by merely mechanical methods. Manymisguided students have, in consequence, turned an important spiritual teachinginto a mere physical exercise. This, obviously, is wrong. Even without any suchmethod, but with exalted devotion, many have experienced, during meditation, anawakening of their kundalini power. On the other hand, when kundalini awakeningis accomplished by mechanical means alone, and without devotional aspiration,the energy may rise temporarily, but it will soon fall again. Until the hearthas been completely cleansed of all worldly attachments and desires, theincreased focus of energy in the spinal centers may stimulate any one of thosecenters in such a way as to flow outward, and to reawaken latent delusivetendencies.In a book of mine, Conversations with Yogananda, I included an account of onetime when our Guru said to us, “When one thinks good thoughts, the kundaliniautomatically starts moving upward. When one thinks evil thoughts, it movesdownward. When one hates others, or has wrong thoughts about them, it movesdown. And when one loves others, or thinks kindly about them, it moves up.“Kundalini is not awakened by yoga techniques alone.”One significant aspect of that statement is that wrong thoughts move thekundalini downward. Isn’t the kundalini already—one may ask—as low as it can go,since it is “locked” at the base of the spine? Unfortunately, such is not thecase. Kundalini energy can move ever further down the ladder of consciousness,into the stygian darkness of the deepest delusions.How far is it possible for the soul to fall? If it has the potential to risetoward infinity, it stands to reason that its potential for sinking downwardmust be limitless also. It is indeed possible, as I said before, for man toplunge down so far as to become identified again with the infinitesimal.The implications here are far from comforting. They have been treated in mybook, The Essence of the Bhagavad Gita Explained by Paramhansa Yogananda (asremembered by his disciple, me). Let me recommend, if you find this subjectinteresting, that you obtain that work and study it carefully. For it does notseem to me appropriate to go into it more deeply here.These truths, then, must be clearly understood. Let me enumerate them:1) All spiritual awakening depends on what we make of ourselves inwardly, and isminimally affected by outward material, social, or physical improvements.2) The highway to God is the spine, and not some fancied outward “stairway tothe stars.”3) True spiritual awakening depends on intense aspiration, and also on seriouseffort expended to keep one’s consciousness uplifted toward God. The Lord has nofavorites. “God,” as Yogananda put it, “chooses those who choose Him.”4) You will win the Lord’s favor not by superficial efforts, such as giving tocharity (which is, for all that, a self-uplifting act, and will create goodkarma for you), but by sincere love for Him in your heart. Outward acts cannotever, in themselves, bring inner spiritual freedom.5) You will find God’s guidance ever with you, the more you open yourselfinwardly to His guidance. Accept wholeheartedly, therefore, whatever He sendsyou in life. His tests can sometimes be very difficult! Try always to refereverything back to Him. Hold back nothing for yourself.[6] I reject completely the claims made by certain modern scholars who say thatsome of the teachings attributed to Jesus were scholarly inventions.[7] Available in the book, The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam Explained by ParamhansaYogananda (edited by me), from Crystal Clarity Publishers, Nevada City,California 95959."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 19[../Images/flower.jpg]THE NEED FOR A PERSONAL SAVIORWhy is it that nobody likes boastfulness in others? Is it because the boasterseems in some way to be slighting other people, by not giving them their own“proper due”? Not necessarily so at all. I think the general disapproval ofboasters is because boasting contradicts a universal, intuitive perception:namely, that self-promotion is self-betraying (because Self-demeaning), notself-exalting. There is, as we all know, a whole world “out there” to learn fromand enjoy. One should therefore, in his own interest, relate to it expansively,and not intrude himself on that vast scene by forever calling attention tohimself.People are wiser than they know. Consider this wonderful truth: Everyonerecognizes subconsciously that man is more, not less, than he appears. Sciencetries to deprecate man and make him feel that he is little more than astatistic. This is because science views everything from the outside. Man, seenas a mere body, is tiny, frail, and almost pitiably weak compared to theelephant; dull in his ability to smell and hear compared to the lowly dog; by nomeans so agile as the monkey; and poor in his ability to see compared to theeagle. Viewed as a human ego, man, to quote Shakespeare, “struts and frets hishour upon the stage, and then is heard no more.”Yet somehow everyone feels, as Emerson wrote in his essay on “The Over-Soul,”that when two human beings converse together, “Jove nods to Jove from behindeach of us.” Emerson then added that immortal sentence: “Men descend to meet.”The wisdom of the ages was expressed in such counsel as this one in the ancientGreek: “Man, know thyself (Gnothi sauton).” Again there is the dictum ofProtagoras: “Man is the measure of all things.” Are these sayings uttered simplyby people “tooting their own horns”? Everyone knows, by some deep instinct, thatman is, in some way, the complete opposite: He is a veritable universe. Hispotential is, in a true sense, infinite. His ego clings almost pathetically toits minuscule self-awareness; defends it with a fervor approaching fanaticism;strives with grim determination to keep ever fresh and alive his sense ofpersonal significance and importance. Deep inside each of us, however, we knowthat some essence in us exists that is eternal, and that possesses infinitesignificance. All of us are, indeed, much more than we seem.It is only temporarily that we have this individuality. Something underlying ourday-to-day consciousness is the true Self. In this “something,” moreover, liesour hint of immortality.God dreamed all things out of His vast consciousness into an appearance ofreality. His creative work begins at the center of each point of manifestedexistence. It expands outward from that point in every living thing to its fullmanifestation. There is nothing in existence, ultimately speaking, exceptconsciousness.Consciousness, latent in all things, becomes increasingly distinct with theupward development of evolution. So also, with increasing clarity, doesself-consciousness emerge gradually. The earthworm, though presumably notconscious enough to define itself specifically as a worm or as anything else, isyet capable of acting from its own center of consciousness. It can be trained,moreover—as I’ve said elsewhere—to seek pleasure (however dim), and to avoidpain (however vaguely perceived).In higher animals, motivation is more clearly directed from within, both inseeking pleasure and in avoiding pain.Man, at the summit of material evolution, knows very well that it is he,himself, who suffers or rejoices—not only physically, but mentally also.Consciousness, quite independently of any outward shape it assumes, is the truecriterion of evolution. Higher evolution depends on the soul’s gradual emergenceinto clear, intelligent awareness. The summit of material evolution is reachedwhen life finally expresses self-awareness.In mankind, the ego is clear about its self-definition. The Divine Self, orsoul, achieves at least some measure of infinite awareness, even though itssense of self is limited to the human ego.Paramhansa Yogananda defined ego as “the soul identified with a body.” All egos,as we saw earlier, are like little jets of flame on a gas burner, each one withthe appearance of individuality, but each one being, in fact, only amanifestation of the unifying gas underneath. What gives people their illusionof individuality is the bundles of self-definition they gradually amass, most ofwhich are quite insignificant, but which become, in their aggregate, a heavyburden on their spiritual awareness.As ego-consciousness becomes more clearly evident, so does man develop, alongwith self-awareness, more and more numerous attractions and aversions,friendships and enmities. The outwardly manifested soul—that germ ofindividuality with which, Yogananda declared, every atom is dowered—movesgradually up the ladder of evolution, becoming increasingly aware, until, inmankind, it becomes fully self-aware on an egoic level.Though evolution is an undeniable fact, Charles Darwin misunderstood it in thisone, fundamental respect. He considered it only in terms of creatures’ changesin outer form. Thus, his view of evolution was, as it were, through the wrongend of the telescope: he saw evolution as an entirely material phenomenon. Hisrejection of the spiritual reflected, of course, the norms of modern science.For science, as we know, decided centuries ago to eliminate God from itsreckoning. It decided that God is “logically imponderable,” and had better beleft out of any scientific reckoning. Subsequently, science reached, therefore,the wholly unreasoned assumption that God, because He wasn’t to be thoughtabout, doesn’t really exist. Since that view, however, was never reasoned, wemay comfortably dismiss their stand as unreasonable.The soul cannot change its intrinsic reality as a manifestation of God. It can,however, and constantly does, mutate its outward appearances. As the Indianscriptures put it, “God sleeps in the rocks, dreams in the plants, stirs towakefulness in the animals, and in mankind becomes self-aware.”A doctor friend of mine, visiting America from South Africa, told me of hisexperiences in a clinic he’d established in the town of Durban. “I’ve sometimesseen it happen on Saturday nights,” he said, “that a native will come in after aknife brawl at a local bar. I’ve actually seen people with their intestineshanging out of their abdomens, holding them in their hands.“‘Don’t bother with anaesthesia, Doc,’ they’ll say. ‘Just shove it in and sew meup.’“I’ve seen women come in with their hands supporting one breast, almost severedfrom their bodies. ‘Don’t worry, Doc,’ they’ll tell me. ‘Just sew it back on.I’ll be fine.’”One might think the explanation for this extraordinary indifference to pain mustbe that primitive people are less aware through their senses than those who aremore civilized. In fact, however, primitive people often have keener sensoryperception. They can see at greater distances than most “city folk” can; theycan hear sounds to which most of us are insensitive. What differentiates themfrom us, their “citified” brothers and sisters who’ve had a more sophisticatededucation and training in the ability to reason logically, is thatego-consciousness, in them, is less highly developed. Like animals a step lowerin evolution—from which level primitive people may have more recently come—theirawareness of pain as an experience closely related to themselves is dimmer thanour own. They may be aware that something is wrong, but they don’t refer thatfeeling of wrongness nearly so intimately back to themselves, as man does oncehe learns to depend more on reason, and develops feelings that are allied muchmore specifically to ego-attachment.Often, primitive people are also more intuitive than those with an education,whose dependence on reason is greater. A friend of mine in Australia once toldme of an aborigine employee of his who asked for two weeks off so that he mightgo visit an uncle. “He’s unwell,” he explained, “and has need of me.”“How can you possibly know?” demanded his employer. “Doesn’t your uncle live outin the bush, far from any post office? How can you claim to be getting word fromhim?”“I just know, Sir,” was the only explanation the man would vouchsafe. When hereturned two weeks later, his boss asked him, “And was your uncle really ill?”“Oh yes,” was the matter-of-fact reply. “He had need of me.” For that aborigine,this extra-sensory knowledge was so normal he didn’t consider it even worthwhileto discuss it.Animals, too, have been known to demonstrate amazing extra-sensory knowledge. Iremember reading years ago—to submit only one example out of many—of a familythat had been compelled to move to the West Coast from a city in the AmericanMidwest. They decided, with all the uncertainties they faced, to leave their catbehind them with some friends who said they would care for it. What was theirastonishment when, two or three months later, that cat turned up on their newdoorstep in Oregon. Their pet had come all that distance by foot!Civilization develops the rational faculty, which we need in order to cope withthe multitude of challenges we face in a highly complex society.Proportionately, however, we lose our subtler, yet forever-natural,sensitivities. We may also develop tastes that are far outside the range of ournatural physical instincts. Thus, we may lose the innate sense, possessed bymany animals, for which foods are good for the body, and which foods it would bebest to avoid. We may lose the instinctive knowledge of what, for an unspoiledhuman being, constitutes true beauty. (Look at the grotesque tastes in art thathave developed in our day.) We may even lose the inborn human sense of whatconstitutes moral goodness.Conscious spiritual evolution begins at the human level. Christians aremistaken, however, in their belief that only human beings have souls. Indeed,for every test that can be offered to prove that human beings havesouls—reasoning ability, the capacity for kindness and understanding, mentalclarity, latent intuitive ability—a parallel proof can be offered that animalspossess at least some of these attributes also, sometimes to an even greaterdegree. Indeed, if animals don’t have souls, then nothing, I suspect, could beoffered in proof that human beings do have them.Man prides himself on his reasoning ability. Animals, however, though perhapsnot endowed with the gift of abstract reasoning, show a definite ability to “puttwo and two together” in a reasoned, even if rather more spontaneous, way. Humanbeings, on the other hand, over-addicted as many of them are to logic and toabstract reasoning, often possess less intuitive ability than their fellows, andless of it also than some animals. They may even lack common sense! The factthat man’s overuse of his intellect produces, in some people, a mental unbalanceis a sign that the intellect is not a soul-attribute. The soul is central to ournature: Deep attunement with it produces no imbalance of any kind. People can,moreover, lose their reason altogether without being considered, thereby, tohave lost their souls.No, what defines the soul is consciousness. The more refined that consciousness,the more perfectly does the hidden soul become manifest.When I lived with my family as a boy in Bucharest, Romania, my brother Bobby,aged eight, went out one day for a walk with our Scottish terrier, Jasper. Localdog catchers happened to come onto the scene and, seeing this dog in the care ofa little boy, decided to catch it and hold it for ransom. Bobby confronted themwith courage, shouting that they had no right to take away our beloved pet. Whenhis challenge proved unavailing, he grasped the long pole, at the end of whichwas a net, held it firmly, and cried out, “Run, Jasper! Run!”Jasper, grasping the fact of his danger immediately, ran for his life. The twomen went off in determined pursuit. At a certain point down Boulevard Busteni,Jasper found himself temporarily outside their line of sight. Promptly, then, hehid behind a bush. The men rushed past him, puffing for breath. When they’d gonea safe distance beyond him, Jasper came out of hiding and trotted proudly backhome.For several weeks thereafter, we described this episode to friends, praising theintelligence Jasper had shown. He always knew we were speaking of him, andpanted, with his tongue lolling out to emphasize his pride in how very cleverhe’d been.Now, who will say that Jasper, in concealing himself behind that bush instead ofcontinuing to dash pell mell down the boulevard, showed no ability to reason?Who will say that he showed no rational understanding in his reaction when wepraised him for the intelligence he’d shown? If he showed both reason andintelligent recognition regarding even this one event, by what standards mayanyone claim that only people have souls, whereas animals have none?Man does, however, have a more developed sense of ego. He refers back morespecifically to himself every action he performs, every thing he desires topossess, every experience he has, and all the pleasure and pain he has found inthose experiences. Thus, man weaves about himself a cocoon of self-definitions,which become both his personal identity and his prison.As man evolves spiritually, he develops an increasing ability to thinkabstractly. He can conceptualize God as being infinite. He can imagine the Lordas absolute and omnipresent. No less-evolved human being—what to speak of thelower animals?—can achieve such rarefied levels of awareness. The use of reason,on the other hand, lessens the keenness of man’s intuition. The intellect helpshim to deal with reality as he perceives it through the senses. His intellect,however, as we’ve already seen, becomes a hindrance to any quest for highertruth. It can suggest innumerable reasonable answers to questions. It can never,on the other hand, give perfect certainty.Thus, we see that the road to higher wisdom lies in loosening and removing ourself-created bonds, including pride in our intellects. The process is one ofunraveling our cocoon of self-definitions.Saints have loosed and severed those bonds of ego-centricity. They understandthat both direct perception and indirect, rational understanding must reach anintuitive level, which is forever beyond the power of careful reasoning. Onlythus can anyone retrieve, as the saints have, his natural soul-level ofawareness: Superconsciousness.The ascent up “the spiral stairway of [spiritual] wakefulness” (as Yogananda putit in a poem, “God! God! God!”) brings one to the point where self-awareness isno longer limited to the little ego and becomes, rather, awareness of theInfinite Self. Man perceives himself united once more with the infinite Sourceof his existence: the Supreme Spirit.Human beings are so very close to that highest realization! All of us have thesame highly developed and sensitive nervous system, the same intelligence, andthe same latent spiritual possibilities as have the saints. The only thingpreventing people from realizing God as their own Reality is the simple factthat ego-motivated desires direct their energy outward, away from their owndivine center. The lower animals, despite having instincts (which sometimesmanifest as intuition, known also as instinct), have yet to develop the mentalclarity to seek self-expansion to Infinity. Man alone, then, is capable ofknowing God.At the same time, as is stated in St. John’s Gospel, “No man hath seen God atany time.” (John 1:18) Human beings, self-enclosed as they are in their littleego-cocoons, and unable therefore to catch even a glimpse of the high, spiritualrealities around and within them, cannot ever, in their human state, see God.Our duty, then, as children of God—a duty assigned to us from the very beginningof time—is to realize once more that we are, and have always been, projectionsof God’s consciousness, and must reclaim our oneness with Him.Opposing that effort is, unfortunately, the weight of our self-definitions,crystallized by countless actions and reactions, and by innumerable unfulfilled(though self-created) desires and attachments. When we think of thisburden—enough, surely, to sink us far under the waters of delusion—the task ofachieving freedom from our little egos must appear so great as to make thelabors of Hercules seem, by comparison, but child’s play! The task, however, isnot so bad as it seems.On a large lake, the ice sheet that covers it in winter might take a powergreater than the combined strength of thousands of men to be broken through,even if they pressed all together over its whole surface. To reach the waterunderneath the ice, however, is not so difficult if even one human being willdrill at a single spot on the icy surface.The karmic burden most people carry is like that ice sheet upon a large lake.If, by deep love for God, and by earnest prayer and meditation, one succeeds inbreaking through the ice of delusion at any spot of his “materially frozen”consciousness, he can penetrate to the water beneath that sheet and merge backinto God, thereby becoming one with Him. The karmic burdens one has brought overfrom the past, represented by that large sheet of ice, still remain to be dealtwith, but God’s love will then melt it slowly away to non-existence.Therefore does the Bhagavad Gita declare, “Even the worst of sinners, if hesteadfastly meditates [or tries sincerely in any other way to commune with theLord] speedily comes to Me.”We cannot, in our present state, rise out of or expiate all our sins of thepast, which were committed with ego-motivation. As long as the center of ourawareness remains the ego, it is very difficult to disavow ego-involvementaltogether. Attempting to do so is like trying to overcome sea-sickness whiletossing helplessly in a rowboat during a raging storm. Only from a higher levelof consciousness can our understanding really prevent us from ever committingthose errors again.Only in God can all our past sins and karmas of every kind become expiated. Pastdelusions will be seen, then, to have belonged to a lower level ofconsciousness: mere residues of the “disease,” now healed, of ego-consciousness.As long, however, as our consciousness is centered in the ego, it is from thispoint that every action, every sin (even of thought), will proceed.Our present “job,” then, is to get through the “ice sheet” of delusion and enterthe free-flowing water underneath. To do so, we must for the time being shelveany guilt we may feel for wrongs we committed in the past. We must simply loveGod, who has (let us remember) loved us eternally. As Yogananda said, “God doesnot mind your faults. He minds your indifference.” In the communion of onenesswith God, every wrong will be made right, every mistake corrected.How soon will all this be accomplished? That, Paramhansa Yogananda declared, isup to you. “In that state of oneness,” he once told me, “you don’t really carewhether or not you are perfectly free, for you see everything as simply amanifestation of God’s bliss. You may, if you like, take longer to reach finalliberation, out of a selfless desire to help those who depend on youspiritually.”The real task facing every spiritual seeker, then, is (as I’ve said repeatedly)to shake off the ages-old addiction to ego-consciousness. How to do that, whenthe very understanding we would use to free ourselves is already hypnotized bythe delusion of bondage?Analyze yourself: When someone speaks to you slightingly, do you react in anyway defensively? When you lose something expensive and beautiful, are you upsetby the loss? Do you consider that loss to be your own? If someone you depend onbetrays you, are your feelings hurt, personally? do you, in consequence, wishthat person ill? If you’ve been, occasionally, in a group where everyone ignoredyou, did you take personal offense?Each of these events should be offered up in gratitude, with an affirmation ofinner soul-freedom. By trying to extricate yourself, however, one by one fromevery blow to your ego—and consider how frequently life pummels your self-esteemin constant reminder of how vulnerable you are, as long as you cling to yoursense of separate individuality—the job of banishing ego-consciousness will beso enormous as to seem endless. There must be another, and better, way out.Fortunately, as I hinted in the last chapter, such a way exists.Instead of laboriously turning every molecule in a bar of metal in a north-southdirection, there are two things one can do. One can direct a strong flow ofelectricity through that bar; or one can place that bar alongside another onethat is already magnetized.Similarly with man, one can direct energy lengthwise around one’s own “barmagnet,” the spine, by the technique known as Kriya Yoga. He can also make it apoint to be close to, or at least mentally in tune with, the subtle influence ofa saintly being who is already enlightened.I myself faced this problem at the age of twenty-two. I had come to realize thesheer enormity of the task I faced in trying to raise my state of consciousness.It became clear to me that it might take virtually forever to spiritualize myaltogether-too-human consciousness. Fortunately, the enormity of the challengehelped me to realize what, in my case at least, seemed obvious: I needed help!Ego-centered human beings often imagine they’ll be able to overcome their wronghabits and tendencies by the sheer force of will. Yogananda assured me at ourfirst meeting, “That method just doesn’t work.” For one thing, he said, the verythought that one can free himself, and doesn’t need help from anyone, is alreadyevidence enough of bondage to the very ego one needs to overcome!Therefore is it stated in the Gospel of St. John: “But as many as received him,to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe onhis name.” (John 1:12)Without help from above, it would be impossible to extricate oneself from thefetters of ego-delusion. Is it sufficient even today, then, to “believe on”Christ’s name? We have quoted the following passage elsewhere, giving it adifferent emphasis:“Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Phariseesfast oft, but thy disciples fast not?“And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as longas the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroomshall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.” (Matt. 9:14,15)Jesus spoke of the importance, to his disciples, of his physical presence amongthem. His death and resurrection would demonstrate his divinity to the world,but he also stressed the special importance, to true disciples, of their havinghim with them in the flesh:“Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lestdarkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither hegoeth.“While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children oflight.” (John 12:35,36)Jesus was declaring the importance of having a personal guide and savior. Thisis one of the principles of Sanaatan Dharma, which was also the essence ofChrist’s teachings.St. John’s Gospel declares:“God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoeverbelieveth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.“For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that theworld through him might be saved.“He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not iscondemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begottenSon of God.“And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loveddarkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.“For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light,lest his deeds should be reproved.“But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be mademanifest, that they are wrought in God.” (John 3:16–21)The essence of that expression, “Son of God,” is, as I explained earlier,impersonality. The “Son of God,” as Yogananda declared, is not Jesus the man,but the infinite Christ consciousness, which dwelt consciously within him: thereflection not only in his own body, but in every atom of creation of theomnipresent, eternally motionless Spirit beyond all vibration.The following passages may be taken as references to the kundalini, which wedescribed in the last chapter. The more obvious meaning, however, works wellhere also:“Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall yeknow that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taughtme, I speak these things.” (John 8:28)“And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.“This he said, signifying what death he should die.” (John 12:32,33)All of us, when we have lifted ourselves above body-consciousness in deep innercommunion, will recognize the Christ consciousness that manifested in Jesus, andthat has been manifested in every great master.At the same time it would also be true to take this passage as signifying thatpeople everywhere will see, in Jesus Christ’s death and resurrection, that hedid indeed have the divine power of God. Who else, indeed, could have risentriumphant over that tyrant, Death himself? Nevertheless, Jesus, in telling hisdisciples (in effect) to “draw as much from me as you can while you still haveme with you,” was saying that a living guide is, for the true seeker, anecessity.Christian tradition is not totally lacking in the concept of what the Indianteachings call the guru. The Eastern Orthodox Church, which is as ancient as theRoman Catholic, stressed the importance of the staretz, or personal teacher andspiritual guide: a concept not essentially different from that of the guru.Yogananda stressed the importance of having a guru. He also said to me thatthere must be at least one physical contact with one’s guru. And he told meemphatically, “If you question scripture, or challenge it, it can’t answer you,but a guru can answer you, and can set you straight on any errors in yourunderstanding.”To attune one’s consciousness with that of a true guru—one, that is to say, whois himself free from ego-consciousness and fully aware of God as the soleReality—is the only way to break out of self-incarceration in the prison of theego. Most people, alas, feel little or no incentive to make such a “prisonbreak.” Desires, habits, attachments, and the energy (that is to say, thekarmas) they have directed outward repeatedly in the past—actions for which theythemselves, of their own nature, feel the inner need in some way tocomplete—keep their attention riveted on outer fulfillment. Hence is it that theBhagavad Gita says, “Out of a thousand, [only] one seeks Me.”It is said also, in the scriptural tradition of which the Bhagavad Gita is anoutstanding example, “One moment in the company of a saint can be your raft overthe ocean of delusion.” A saint’s company carries that great blessing because,as I stated in the last chapter, his (or her) magnetism can help to redirectpeople’s “molecules” of mental tendencies, and to reawaken in them the desire toreach up toward more truly spiritual goals in life.In the beginning of this awakening process, people seek spiritual fulfillment bylistening to spiritual discourses and reading spiritual literature. As theirconsciousness becomes more refined spiritually, they begin to seek out thecompany of saints, or of people blessed with spiritual wisdom: persons who canalso teach them personally.Finally—for God is ever actively present in the souls of men—those who aredeeply sincere are drawn by divine grace to someone who has been empowered toassume the duty of guiding them out of the fixations born of ego-consciousnessto perfect Self-realization. This person is their divinely destined guru—or, inthe ancient Christian tradition, their staretz, or personal link to Christ,their Supreme Savior.The link with the guru, once forged, is eternal. Even after one achievesspiritual freedom himself, and becomes in his turn a true master, that sacredbond remains as one of eternal friendship. With final liberation in God, allsouls are, of course, one in Divine Perfection; no distinction of individualityremains. Their memory of individuality, however, and therefore also of theirspecial relationship with one another in God, exists in Omniscience foreternity. Thus, if ever again master and disciple appear together in thisdream-play of God’s, their soul-link will remain—not necessarily as teacher andstudent, but always as one of eternal, divine friends.“But doesn’t aspiration to embrace something so vast as infinity”—one mayask—“create a comparably vast tension in oneself?” Most people, I imagine, atone time or another have feared, at least subconsciously, the stress that,imagination tells them, must be involved in seeking God. The answer is containedin an earlier quote from Saint Augustine: “Lord, Thou hast made us for Thyself,and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in Thee.”The popular Christian saying expresses a valid, important, and eternal truth:“If you raise one hand to God, He will lower two hands to uplift you.” GodHimself it is who inspires you to reach toward Him with ever-increasing love.God’s love it is, again, in your heart which inspires you to cast off all senseof body and ego, like a serpent shedding its skin.“The spiritual path.” Yogananda used to tell us, “is twenty-five percent yourown effort, twenty-five percent the guru’s effort on your behalf, and fiftypercent the grace of God.” Don’t let delusion-inspired thoughts whip up needlessworries, like waves upon your mental lake, about tension and hardship. No onewho has reached the Divine Shore has ever described that attainment as anythingbut a supreme fulfillment. Remember: As long as your desire for God is sincere,it will be He Himself who gives you the strength you need, which is to say, thedynamic energy to find Him.Jesus Christ sometimes spoke in terms that, from anyone who had attained a unionwith God less perfect than his, must surely have seemed almost embarrassinglyboastful and arrogant.“I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but byme.” (John 14:6)Jesus went on to say: “If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also:and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.” (the same chapter, verse 7)He also said, “Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am Iin the midst of them.” (Matt. 18:20) These words were not stated in reference tohimself, the man. Indeed, it would be absurd to think of him, in that littlebody, rushing from church to church on Sunday mornings so as to be, each inturn, “in the midst” of all his congregation of worshipers! Besides, hisstatement was, “There am I, . . .”: present, not future, tense. He was notpromising to get to each of them “by and by,” as time permitted. His use of thepresent tense suggests, rather, an eternal reality, and an infinite awareness.Saint Simeon the New Theologian, a great Hesychast master of the EasternOrthodox Church (the “New” in that title dates back to the tenth century!)interpreted this saying also in an inward, mystical way. “Where two or threethoughts,” he said, “are gathered together” inwardly in the worship of Christ,thereby focusing the mind more wholly on him, there will he be, already.To the Jewish priests and rabbis, these and similar words which Jesus expressedwere so offensive that, in the end, they crucified him. Reading his words in theBible, one is surprised at how powerfully he affirmed the importance of his ownmission on earth. That affirmation did not indicate, however, any lack ofhumility. He had no ego of which to be either proud or humble. It was simplynecessary for him to speak in that way, because there remained so little validspiritual tradition among the Jews of his time. It was necessary that heemphasize a truth which few would have recognized, had he declared itself-effacingly.In truth, a God-realized master is far above any need to protect himself frompersonal pride by affirming humility. Usually, so as to set others a goodexample of humility, he affirms his own unimportance. Ananda Moyi Ma, a greatwoman saint whom I often visited in India, went so far as never even to refer toherself in the first person. When speaking of herself she would say, “Thisbody.” In her this was no pose. She was (as my Guru told me) a jivan mukta: onewho has attained final oneness with God, and complete freedom fromego-consciousness. She did still have, my Guru told me, a little past karma towork out. Such a fully perfected being needs no longer to affirm his soul’sfreedom in God, for he has attained that freedom already. Still, it is a commonpractice among great saints, if only to set others a good example, to speak verylittle about themselves. All their energy goes, rather, toward the upliftment ofothers.It is, indeed, perfectly understandable that the self-assertiveness with whichJesus so often spoke would have seemed offensive to the unenlightened rabbis ofhis day. They were, in their own opinion, the supreme authorities in Judaism. IfJesus were to appear and teach in the same way on earth today in any country inChristendom—not as himself, but as someone unknown—I venture to say that almostevery priest, pastor, minister of religion, and every other sort of prelatewould probably consider his bold self-assertion quite as outrageous as did thePharisees. Unenlightened priests usually at least try, themselves, to make adisplay of humility—if only because boastfulness in them would alienate theircongregations! Their humility, however, is a mask. Even their self-deprecationis only to impress everyone with how good they themselves are. How could thingsbe otherwise? The ego cannot be shrugged off so lightly. It is the centralreality of most people’s existence.In the next chapter we shall discuss further the reason why Jesus Christ, evenamong great masters, was exceptional in his mission, and in his need to affirmhis own importance to that mission. For now, it is necessary first to understandthat his Self-affirmation was never personal. He never emphasized hisself-importance as a human being. All his utterances were divinely impersonal.“Verily, verily,” he said also, “I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is,when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shalllive.” (John 5:25)What, again, did Jesus mean by using the present tense here? He added the words,“and now is.” Obviously, he was not referring only to some future time. He wasdescribing a truth that is eternal. “Son of God” was, again, a reference (asYogananda explained) to the eternal, omnipresent Christ consciousness with whichJesus was himself identified. In speaking of “the voice of the Son of God,” hewas referring to the Holy Ghost (or Holy Spirit), the mighty Cosmic Vibration.Indeed, an insightful explanation of his subsequent statement, “and the deadshall hear the voice of the Son of God,” could not be that the dead, asleep intheir graves (for who knows how long—for millennia?), would hear his voice andcome once more to life.In fact, Jesus here was saying two things: First, those who are spiritually deadwill someday hear, in deep meditation, “the voice of the Son of God,” which isto say, the sound of AUM. Second, Yogananda explained also that at physicaldeath the departing soul does in fact hear that mighty sound, manifested as avibration which corresponds to its own consciousness. That special aspect of theCosmic Vibration determines the nature of one’s state after death, during theinterim period between his incarnations on earth or on some other planet.What Jesus is doing here clearly, however, is referring to people’s presentreality (“. . . and now is”). Those who love God and meditate on Him can hearwithin them even now the great Cosmic Sound, which comes to waken them fromtheir sleep of ignorance, and to raise them toward final oneness with God.This communion first with AUM, before communion with Christ, explains, too, theRoman Catholic dogma which states that one must go through the Virgin Mary toreach Christ. The Virgin Mary symbolizes the feminine aspect of God, which isthe Holy Ghost, or Holy Spirit. To unite one’s soul with God, one must firstpass through AUM. Next, one must unite himself with the Son (the Christconsciousness). Finally, passing through Christ consciousness, the soul reachesthe highest possible (because absolute) state: union with the “Father,” theSupreme Spirit.Jesus specifically described persons who are as yet spiritually asleep as beingdead. Consider in this context the following passage:“Another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury myfather.“But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.” (Matt.8:21,22)His teachings, as we have emphasized repeatedly, were concerned above all withraising people from their present state of ignorance: from their material to aspiritual identity. As Jesus Christ said, “God is not the God of the dead, butof the living.” (Matt. 22:32) He was concerned only minimally with outwardcosmic abstractions. His real issue was not the end of the world; it was notJudgment Day, nor Gabriel’s horn (which of course symbolizes the AUM Vibrationin its all-dissolving aspect). His mission was to help those refined souls whoseegos were still trapped in limitation, but who desired earnestly to get out ofthe ego and to know God.What was his meaning, in the earlier quotation above, “. . . the dead shall hearthe voice of the Son of God”?Popular fancy has depicted people moldering in their graves until “Judgmentday,” at which time “Gabriel’s trumpet” will raise them to be judged for theiractions, and sent to wherever they are to spend eternity: in heaven, or in hell.This concept—barbaric, surely—might be excusable in people with over-literalminds, such as most men had back when Christians expected the Second Coming tooccur almost any day. Indeed, Jesus himself was quoted as saying, “There be somestanding here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of mancoming in his kingdom.” (Matt. 16:28) And again he announced, “Verily I say untoyou, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.” (Matt.24:34)He was speaking of people’s present potential for communing with God. Today,more than two thousand years have passed. It must be accepted that everyone whoheard him speak those words did indeed “taste of” physical death. Thus, it mustbe obvious that Jesus, who surely spoke the truth, was referring to people’sinner state of consciousness, and of their soul-potential for God-realization.Jesus said also, “And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven:and then shall all the tribes of the earth see the son of man coming in theclouds of heaven with power and great glory.” (Matt. 24:30) Even granting thepossibility that Jesus literally meant that he would appear in the sky, let usvisualize him standing on a cloud over New York City. That cloud would beinvisible over nearby Boston. How, then, could “all the tribes of the earth”behold him? The curvature of the earth—about which people two thousand years agoknew nothing—would make it necessary for millions of Christs to appear on anequal number of clouds—simultaneously, one supposes. Is it merely facetious toask, further, What about broad deserts, which often have no clouds at all?Jesus has appeared already, however, in clouds of light to true devotees in allcountries who loved him deeply.Actually to understand what it means to be a divine Savior is to realize thatJesus was not identified with his human body, but was identified inwardly withthe Christ consciousness.Jesus’ mission was indeed special, even when compared with the missions of othermasters. This, however, is a separate subject, and will be discussed in the nextchapter. Meanwhile, let us keep in mind that Jesus Christ himself stated (as wehave seen above) that his physical presence provided his disciples with specialspiritual protection. That physical protection was taken away from them—as hehimself warned it would be—by his crucifixion. And his removal occurred,relative to our own times, nearly two thousand years ago.It is written in St. John’s Gospel: “Jesus himself [while he still lived]baptized not, but his disciples.” (John 4:2)Though only a relatively few true masters live on earth at any one time, therehas yet been no dearth of them over the centuries. Wise is that spiritual seekerwho understands how desperate is his own need for a personal guru.I was once challenged by a skeptic, “Why do you say I need a guru?”“You don’t!” I replied firmly. “You don’t need one at all! Why even think aboutit? Just be sincere in your own search for truth.”I then added, “When, however, you realize that it is God you want, and nothingelse, then you will understand also that you need help in finding Him. That isthe time, and not before, when you will understand that you do indeed need aguru!”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 20[../Images/flower.jpg]NEW WINESanaatan Dharma, the “Eternal Religion,” has to be the same everywhere in theuniverse. It concerns the path which all manifested beings must take who desireeventual reunion with their Divine Source, the Supreme Spirit. There is nothingbut the Spirit in existence. Everything in creation is a mere appearance,manifested by the Divine Consciousness.Sri Ramakrishna, a great master in nineteenth century India, used the image ofsweetness to explain how the Eternal Truth could have been presented in so manydifferent forms. Sweetness, he said, can be enjoyed as honey, as sugar, aschocolate, as Indian “sweetmeats,” and (in the West) as candies. All of themhave in common that one quality, sweetness. The truth of Sanaatan Dharma,similarly, is expressed in different ways according to the different “tastes”and levels of spiritual refinement manifested in the different cultures atvarious times in history.Christ, who taught that Eternal Religion, gave it particular emphases that weresuited to the understanding of the Judaic people of his day. He referred, forexample, to the cosmic power of maya (delusion) as Satan, and emphasized (asgreat masters in India have not, to my knowledge, done) that Satan is aconscious force dedicated to man’s spiritual downfall. The emphasis of JesusChrist on this subject differs from the teachings of India on maya, but thetruth of it isn’t different. Both maya and Satan refer to a conscious force—notto a specific being, but to a universal reality, for nothing in creation isunconscious. In Hinduism—which is, as I’ve explained heretofore, only oneexpression of Sanaatan Dharma—the emphasis, in discussions of maya, has been onsubjective delusion rather than on maya’s cosmic, all-pervasive powerconsciously to influence all men to submerge themselves in ever-deeper delusion.In fact, however—as Hinduism teaches also, even though less explicitly—thesatanic influence is not only individual, but universal.In Autobiography of a Yogi Paramhansa Yogananda wrote, “Thoughts are universallyand not individually rooted.” Jesus Christ’s allusions to Satan as a consciousforce, therefore, while they may sound strange to Hindu ears, belongnevertheless intrinsically with the truths of Sanaatan Dharma.The Bhagavad Gita states, “O Bharata [Arjuna], whenever virtue [dharma, rightthought and action] declines, and vice [adharma] is in the ascendant, Iincarnate Myself on earth [as an avatar, or divine incarnation]. Appearing fromage to age in visible form, I come to destroy evil and to re-establish virtue.”(4:7,8)God Himself, in other words, the Infinite Lord, incarnates on earth through afully liberated master whenever a special need appears among men. When He doesso, the essence of what that master declares, though it is always the sameeternal truth, often appears differently dressed. Thus, although the Jews oftenchallenged Jesus with the claim that his teachings were alien to their ownreligious tradition, the error was in fact theirs, not his.His mission was to break down a growing tendency in Judaism to dependexcessively on rules. He was sent to promote, instead, an appreciation for thesupreme importance of divine love. Thus, when he and his disciples picked cornon the sabbath, and were therefore accused of breaking the commandments, hereplied, “The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.” (Mark2:27) In the next verse he went on to say, “Therefore the Son of man is Lordalso of the sabbath.” (How those concluding words must have set the Pharisees’teeth grinding! In their eyes, Jesus, in his apparent unorthodoxy, was anyway amere upstart.) And when the Pharisees tried to “tempt” him on the subject ofdivorce by asking him, “Why did Moses then command to give a writing ofdivorcement [to one’s wife], and to put her away?” Jesus replied, “Moses becauseof the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from thebeginning [that is to say, in the pristine state] it was not so.” (Matt. 19:7,8)His subsequent words have secondary importance in the present context, where weare emphasizing the freshness, and at the same time the fidelity of Christ’steachings to true Sanaatan Dharma.God’s message to the Jews of his times, which Jesus Christ had been sent todeclare, had universal significance, but it was also specific and special, beingintended for the Jews of his times primarily. As he said to the woman ofSamaria, “Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation isof the Jews.” (John 4:22)Again he said elsewhere, “I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house ofIsrael.” (Matt. 15:24)The essence of his teaching was divine love. He wanted to show the supremeimportance of that love over even the commandments. For salvation cannot come byfollowing the law alone. Krishna too, in the Bhagavad Gita, states that by goodkarma alone (that is to say, by doing all the right things) one cannot achieveliberation from ego-consciousness. Divine love, in Sanaatan Dharma, is thesupreme secret.Following the theme we were beginning to develop in the last chapter, I am alsoconcerned particularly with another apparently novel teaching: the “saviorship”of Jesus Christ through all future ages. In the last chapter we saw the need fora personal guru. In Christianity, Jesus Christ has always held the position ofthe supreme personal Savior. Is this, in light of the points we’ve discussedbefore, a valid belief?I must reiterate that a personal guru is most certainly a necessity for everyonewho deeply desires to know God. All who live under the sway of maya, or cosmicdelusion, and who live centered, therefore, in ego-consciousness, must, in orderto know God, have at least one physical contact in their present incarnationwith a God-realized guru. This was a teaching my Guru addressed to mepersonally.Jesus himself, in passages we quoted earlier, told his disciples, in effect,“Make the best use of this time you have with me, for I won’t be here to protectyou in the same way after I am gone.” Though he was still a young man, the hintshe gave that he would die early were plentiful, even if they remained largelyunrecognized until after the Crucifixion.Jesus said to them also:“When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, andthat I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak thesethings.“And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I doalways those things that please him.” (John 8:28–29)It must be strictly understood that Jesus was not urging personal devotion tohimself.“God is a Spirit,” he said, “and they that worship him must worship him inspirit and in truth.” (John 4:24) This same passage continues:“The woman [of Samaria] saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which iscalled Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.“Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.” (John 4:25,26)Elsewhere, he said also:“My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.“If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be ofGod, or whether I speak of myself.“He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh hisglory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.” (John7:16–18)A few verses later he added:“Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but hethat sent me is true, whom ye know not.“But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.” (John 7:28,29)Impersonality is the essence of all true teaching. You yourself don’t exist,individually, except in idea; I don’t exist; no one and no thing can existexcept the One, Universal, Supreme Spirit, whose individual emanations all of usare. Our divinely assigned duty through eternity is to dissolve our separateself-awareness in the consciousness of that Eternal Self, which is infinite notin the sense of vast, but rather of having no finite boundaries at all. Jesustherefore said (again, in paraphrase), “God, who sent me, is the sole Reality,but you yourselves have yet to realize Him. That is why He sent me, that I mightguide those of you to Him who deeply desire to know Him.”Jesus, although so often constrained to use the first person pronoun, did soonly because he had to emphasize that he himself, through people’s attunementwith his consciousness, could serve them as a doorway to Infinity. His wordsaccomplished the particular purpose of discouraging people from going to thestream of lesser teachers who spring up constantly whenever people in generaldeeply desire to know Truth.It is commonly believed among Christians that the disciples of Jesus were verymuch “of the people,” and socially quite common. Yogananda stated definitelythat such was not at all the case. “Christ’s disciples,” he said, “were alreadyhighly advanced spiritually.” Fishermen and others of similarly “low caste” theymay have been, and relatively low on the social scale, but they had, in formerlives, attained high levels of spiritual refinement. Jesus saw their divinepotential. It was on that basis that he selected them. Their social status hadno value for him at all.It has become a flaw in Christian thinking to insist, “We have our faults, allof us.” I remember being slightly put off, during my mother’s funeral, by aremark the minister made during his eulogy: “Of course,” he said, “Gertrude hadher faults.” No doubt she had a few, but whatever they were, they were veryslight in my opinion, whereas this man, I suspected, didn’t know her well enoughto name even one of them. His statement struck me as simply a concession to thecommon insistence in “Churchianity” on human sinfulness, “We’re all sinners.”Yogananda, moreover, taught us rather to see everyone in terms of his or herdivine potential.As regards Judas, I have already related the interesting discussion I had withmy Guru, following his remark to me that Judas was a prophet.“Was he!” I exclaimed in astonishment.“Oh yes,” he replied. “He would have had to be, to be one of the twelve.”Even advanced disciples, however, can still fall spiritually all the way untilthey reach the final stage—Nirbikalpa Samadhi, as it is called in India—when atlast they attain full awareness that only the Infinite Self, God, exists. Thus,Yogananda explained that Judas still had some bad karma also, which he couldhave, but failed to, overcome. It was not his own absolute destiny to betrayJesus. There was, however, a definite destiny in the betrayal itself. It wouldhave come about in one way or another. For it must be understood that the karmabelonged not only to Judas, but to the Jewish people as a whole, to whom, asJesus said, he had been sent. It was, in other words, a mass karma, not anindividual one. Judas had to suffer personally the consequences of the part he’dplayed in that drama. Nevertheless, he was a great soul—far greater, indeed,than the many peripheral disciples who had come to the Master more recently intheir divine search. It is better, in other words, to seek God and fail in theattempt—and even to fail greatly—than to be a lukewarm seeker—or, worse still,not even to seek Him at all. Judas Iscariot was, spiritually speaking, far aheadof the most gloriously successful materialistic businessman.Nevertheless Jesus said, and Yogananda often reiterated, “It were better for him[Yogananda’s reference was to the betrayal by Judas] that a millstone werehanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depths of the sea.“Woe unto the world because of offenses! for it must needs be that offensescome; but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh!” (Matt. 18:6,7)Jesus was referring at the time to those true disciples of his who were humble(“as little children”). He was saying also that others who received thosedisciples in Christ’s name—not only as his disciples, but as instruments of theChrist consciousness—would in fact be receiving him, whereas those who hurt themwould be committing an offense against the Christ consciousness itself, whichever resides within us all, but which is more openly manifested in those wholove God. In the case of offense against saints who have achievedSelf-realization, the offense is greatest, and the punishment, also, is moreimmediate because, Yogananda explained, they have overcome “the thwartingcrosscurrents of ego.”The greatest sin, of course, was Judas’s betrayal of Jesus. This was a “sinagainst the Holy Ghost,” with whom Judas had already been blessed to commune. Toexperience God’s presence, and then, subsequently, to turn away from it can befinally forgiven only by the seeker himself, by turning back to the beatitude ofwhich he has deprived himself. The return is not so easy, for that one“unforgivable” sin—unforgivable, that is, by anyone but one’s self—sets up aninner vibration of restlessness, or uneasiness within one’s self that can beovercome only by great personal effort.People also sinned, however, and greatly so, in persecuting the disciples ofJesus.Yogananda said something similar regarding his own disciples. “The Divine Mothertold me,” he declared after a special ecstasy he’d been vouchsafed during thesummer of 1948, “‘In the beginning I sent you a few bad ones to test your lovefor Me. But now I am sending you angels, and whoever smites them, I [Myself]will smite.’”Yet that disciple of Yogananda’s who betrayed him most greatly was, for allthat, a great soul, and (Yogananda stated firmly) will be liberated before verymany more incarnations.Sadhu Haridas (I’ve mentioned him twice already) fell from the spiritual patheven though he was highly advanced. Yet, my Guru said, he achieved fullliberation in that same lifetime. A student of Yogananda’s, who was present whenYogananda related this story, objected, “How can that be? Isn’t the punishmentfar greater for one who, though knowing the law, breaks it?”“Mm-mm,” replied the Master, shaking his head. “God is no tyrant. When you haveeaten good cheese, then resume eating stale cheese again, you soon realize yourmistake. If, then, you once again want only the good cheese, God won’t denyyou.”Judas, he told me, “was liberated in this lifetime.” Yogananda said, “I myselfknew him.” Other disciples of Jesus must have achieved their freedom sooner, butI remember him saying that Mary Magdalene was born in the twentieth century asthe Catholic stigmatist Therese Neumann of Konnersreuth, in Germany, and had noteven yet achieved final liberation. He met this great saint in 1936.The karma accrued by Judas for his act of betrayal was not only personal. It wasa mass karma, and had to be borne by the entire Jewish people. As they—the“chief priests, and elders,” and “the multitudes,” speaking deliberately for alltheir people—cried out, prior to the Crucifixion, “His blood be on us, and onour children.” (Matt. 27:25) Yogananda didn’t often speak about this particularkarma, for his concern, like that of Jesus, was people’s spiritual upliftmentand salvation. Nevertheless, he did often refer to the suffering that followsupon wrong karmic actions.In the context of the Jewish people, although Yogananda under-emphasized thissubject, I would interpolate from what he did say about karmic law that theirsubsequent suffering was primarily a consequence of that one great act ofbetrayal.Karma is almost always mixed, however. Judas, for example, could not havebetrayed Jesus had he not had the good karma to be born as a direct, closedisciple. He suffered greatly for that betrayal, but his good karma stood him ingood stead also, and flowered at last by taking him to divine liberation.Yogananda often said, “God chooses those who choose Him.” The Jewish people hadchosen to walk in the ways of God. They could not have incurred the bad karma ofbetraying Christ had they not also had the good karma to attract him in thefirst place.When a broken bone heals, it develops a hardness greater than the bonesurrounding it. Similarly, the bad karma incurred by the Jewish people was dueto the good karma, also, which they incurred in the first place by theirintrinsic spiritual nobility. It was that good karma which had attracted thebirth of the Christ among them. It will surely flower, someday, in spiritualgreatness. For, as Yogananda said, “God is no tyrant.” Jesus himself pointed outto them the way out of their karmic dilemma:“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them whichare sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, evenas a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!“Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.“For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessedis he that cometh in the name of the Lord.” (Matt. 23:37–39)The Jewish people must understand that God, who is indeed One God as theythemselves declare daily in the prayer, “Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, theLord is One,” can come also to men “in the name of the Lord.” God, being One, isthe only reality in existence. Humility before Him, rather than arrogance (evenwhen justified), will be, for them as a people, their ultimate salvation.The following speculations may seem to be an intrusion on our theme.Nevertheless, they touch on the lives of so many people that I offer them in allhumility for whatever they may be worth.Did the formation of the modern state of Israel fully expiate the bad karma theyhad incurred as a people? This might, I believe, have been the case, had thatnation been formed in a spirit of humble and divine dedication to the One Lord.Because the basic ethos, however, behind the modern state of Israel ispolitical, and not spiritual, I think this new country will find that it hasmuch still to learn about the spiritual law and about its own role in fulfillingthat law.The Jews in Israel today describe themselves as basically atheistic, and asdevoted to a purely political dream. How can such a self-definition help them torecapture their original and very real spirituality? It doesn’t seem likely thatthe Jews will ever convert en masse to Christianity, particularly as theteachings of Christ are being taught in the churches today. There was, however,implanted deeply in their first faith—though later it became misunderstood—theconcept of the Christ, or Christ consciousness. This concept needs to beunderstood as a universal truth.These days, many Jews—the younger ones perhaps particularly—are turning to theyoga teachings of India. If, through this interest, they can recognize andaccept once more the Eternal Religion, they too will be able to embrace also theteachings of Jesus Christ as a true expression of that religion, and willdiscover in them the universal truth in his teachings.Yogananda predicted that the religion of all the world would be, in future, theconcept of Self-realization.The followers of Jesus Christ have erred greatly also, in their intenselypersonal attitude toward him as the merely human Son of God, and in theirinability to perceive his reality as the impersonal Divinity reflected in theentire created universe. Once that wrong twist in the road became fixed asdogma, many errors ensued as a natural consequence.Thus, one thing that Jesus said has become a cornerstone of erroneous teachingin the Christian religion. We touched on this episode earlier.“When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples,saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?“And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some Elias; and others,Jeremias, or one of the prophets.“He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?“And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the son of the livingGod.“And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: forflesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is inheaven.“And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter [meaning rock], and upon thisrock [petra, in Greek] I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall notprevail against it.“And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoeverthou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shaltloose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.“Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesusthe Christ.” (Matt. 16:13–20)First—as an aside, merely—Why did Jesus “charge his disciples” not to tellanyone that he was Jesus the Christ, since this fact was central to the veryvalidity of his mission? Never, in fact, did he emphasize his human personalityas possessing any intrinsic importance. “My doctrine,” he said, “is not mine,but his that sent me.” (John 7:16) So why, at the end of that last (and veryimportant) passage, did he express the wish for this truth not to be revealed?Humanity, during the time of Jesus Christ, was passing through a period, whichwas destined to last several centuries more, of spiritual darkness. I mustexplain this esoteric fact at some length in this book, but for now theexplanation will have to be deferred, since it would constitute a detour andwould be too long to fit into the present chapter.Still, it must be said here that people’s understanding in those days was somatter-bound that few could comprehend that Jesus, when he used the pronoun “I,”was not speaking of himself as a man—not even as a great spiritual teacher—butof the infinite Christ, with which his own consciousness was identified. He waslike an explorer landing on the shores of a backward country, perhaps on aPacific island, and trying to tell them about his own highly advancedcivilization.During World War II, the Allied forces created military bases on certain ofthose South Sea islands. Along with planes, ships, and advanced weaponry theybrought food and unheard-of prosperity. Several decades later, according to myreading, someone returned to one of those islands and found the natives thereworshiping before a reconstructed facsimile of an airplane, “propitiating” itand asking for a renewal of the amazing benefits they’d enjoyed for a time.Jesus Christ was, in effect, teaching people not unlike those “primitivenatives.” Descending from the Supreme Spirit, he could offer his listeners onlyas much as they were capable of absorbing, lest his message give them “spiritualindigestion.”Back, now, to the essence of the above passage. We’ve already pointed out, insupport of our argument for reincarnation, that if there had not been Jews inthose days who believed in reincarnation, the disciples would not have answered,“some say that thou art one of the [ancient] prophets.” And if reincarnation wasa false doctrine, Jesus would not have omitted to correct them after they’dalluded to it.Jesus continued, “But what about you, my direct disciples?” In effect he wasasking, “What has been your own experience of me?” Peter alone answered, sayingthat Jesus was “the Christ, the son of the living God.” From these words it isevident that Jesus had already spoken to the disciples about the Christ, asdistinct from his own human personality. This manifestation of Christ was theMessiah who was “for to come”: who manifested, through his human persona, theinfinite divine consciousness.Presumably, other disciples had understood this teaching somewhat at least. OnlyPeter, however, demonstrated rock-firm spiritual perception in his ardentexpression of faith, which was born of the irrefragable insight of deepintuition. Jesus himself, Peter declared, was a full manifestation of thatsupreme, eternal truth.Thus, when Jesus complimented him on the “rocklike” nature of his perception, hewas speaking to Peter alone, even though other disciples were present also.Roman Catholics have persuaded themselves that Jesus was speaking of allfuturity also: of a physical “church” founded on the “rock” of Peter’s faith.This dogma is loaded with so many spiritual misconceptions that one wonders howeven to shake each of them loose from the pile before casting it into thebonfire of discarded doctrines where it belongs. “Faith,” for example: It wasn’tmere belief that Peter manifested, in the ordinary sense of an intellectualhypothesis. Faith and belief are quite distinct from one another. Belief isprovisional, whereas true faith comes only after that provisional belief hasbeen tested and found true. If some of the spiritually advanced disciples ofJesus had not yet acquired such firm faith, how could hundreds of millions ofunenlightened, orthodox believers in future centuries pretend to have acquiredit? And how could this faith be preserved even for the long line of popes, manyof whom—so history declares—actually lived dissolute lives?The word, “church” (in the sentence, “upon this rock I will build my church”)must be understood deeply. A church signifies two things: a place where peoplecongregate to worship God; and also a holy place, or “house of God.” ParamhansaYogananda declared this second meaning to be the true one here. Jesus wassaying, “On your firm ‘rock’ of inner Self-realization, Peter, I will be able toestablish my ‘church’ of cosmic consciousness.”Yogananda once said to me, “You will not be safe [from delusion] until you haveattained nirbikalpa samadhi”—which is the highest state of perfect divine union.When Jesus said “the gates of hell shall not prevail against it,” he wasspeaking of this absolute union. No lower state, wherein the consciousnesspersists of having a separate, egoic reality, can guarantee complete and finalspiritual victory.All the teachings of Jesus were directed essentially toward helping theindividual to attain his own spiritual salvation. Jesus came, however, with aparticular expression of the eternal truths. It was necessary for him to focuspeople’s high spiritual aspirations in himself as an instrument of divine grace.Otherwise, the many schools of thought that were rampant in his day would havediluted his message and made it seem merely another “school of philosophy,” fromwhose teachings people could select as they chose.Indeed, one of the great heresies in the early Church was launched by Arius, afourth-century ecclesiastic and theologian who reasoned that Jesus can only havebeen a man, rather than the “only begotten Son of God.” Arius stated his reasonthus: If Jesus was God’s son, there must have been a time when he didn’t exist.The problem the church faced in those days was that, if Arius was right, and ifJesus was in fact only a man, then Jesus was at best only a wise man, but notone to promise divine salvation on his own personal reassurance.In truth, both Arius and the Church Fathers were right. Christ (as distinct fromJesus the man) is, eternally, the Son of God. That manifestation of God doescome into being, moreover, with the manifestation of Cosmic Creation. It isreabsorbed into the Spirit at the end of that manifestation, which appearscyclically.A single appearance of Cosmic Creation is known, in Sanaatan Dharma, as a “Dayof Brahma.” It lasts for billions of years. At the end of that period it isdissolved in cosmic Pralaya, or “Dissolution,” to be succeeded by what is knownas the “Night of Brahma.”These grand, overarching cycles of Cosmic Time are repeated endlessly. It canrightly be said that Christ, too, during the long Night of Brahma, is withdrawninto the “Father,” or Supreme Spirit, and therefore ceases, in a sense, toexist. Thus, the Son does, from this perspective, come into being again andagain with every re-manifestation of Cosmic Creation.Arius, however, can hardly have had anything remotely similar to such a deepunderstanding of this truth. His reasoning may have pointed in that direction,but it forced the false conclusion that Jesus Christ was, therefore, only a manand not the Son of God.This teaching needs to be pursued one step further, however. For even as Jesuswas no mere man, so also no human being is merely human. Our potential isdivine. Everything is a manifestation of God’s consciousness—humanity even moreso by virtue of having already attained, with ego-consciousness, a measure ofself-consciousness.Therefore it was that, when the Jews accused Jesus of blasphemy for hisstatement, “I and my Father are one,” his answer to them was, “Is it not writtenin your law, I said, Ye are gods? If he called them gods, unto whom the word ofGod came, and the scripture cannot be broken [gainsaid]; Say ye of him, whom theFather hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because Isaid, I am the Son of God?” (John 10:34–36)His divinity was a truth, in the last analysis, because cosmic consciousness isthe destiny, and is even now the potential, of every human being!What about the words Jesus spoke in that earlier quotation, “And whatsoever thoushalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose onearth shall be loosed in heaven”? According to Roman Catholic dogma, these wordsmean that every ordained Roman Catholic priest has the power, after hearing apenitent’s confession, to forgive him his sins. Paramhansa Yogananda, however,challenged this statement. “Test it,” he said. “See what happens, for example,if you go to a priest and ask him to absolve you of the ‘sin’ of havingovereaten the night before. Will your resulting stomach ache disappear? If so,but only if so, you might say that at least this particular priest has somepower to forgive sins.”Paramhansa Yogananda often said that the simple word of a true master is“binding on the universe.” A master’s words, because they proceed from therealization of oneness with Him who created the whole universe, have greatpower. Only such a one can say to an ill person with true conviction, “You arewell!” and that person must, indeed, become well. For his words must inevitablycome true. Whatever he states with deep concentration will have to manifestitself in time in the realm of objective reality.The ancient Indian sage Patanjali wrote, indeed, in his Yoga Sutras (Yogaaphorisms), that anyone who always speaks the strict truth develops the power tomanifest outwardly whatsoever he declares with deep concentration.We saw in an earlier chapter that Jesus, in referring to the “keys of thekingdom of heaven,” alluded to the techniques of meditation—especially,Yogananda said, to the technique of Kriya Yoga—which “open the doors, orchakras, of the spine” and allow all the body’s energy to rise toward thehighest centers in the brain, where, truly, “the kingdom of God” exists in man.A pundit (scriptural scholar) named Dinanath, whom I knew in New Delhi in theearly 1960s, told me he had made a deep study of ancient Christian texts. “Inone of the old Hesychast writings,” he said, “it is stated that when you repeatthe traditional prayer, ‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy upon me,’ you should feela coolness rising up the spine with those first words; and, with the second part(‘have mercy upon me’), you should feel a warm sensation going down the spine.”Kriyabans—practitioners, that is to say, of Kriya Yoga—will understand theinward meaning of that description.The Way of the Pilgrim, a Christian classic well known in Russia and incountries westward from there as well, states, further, that the above prayershould be coordinated with the breath, inhaling as one utters “Lord JesusChrist,” and exhaling with the words, “have mercy upon me.” Kriyabans, again,will find this counsel familiar.Finally, Jesus spoke of these techniques as “keys of the kingdom of heaven.”What did he mean by “heaven”? We discussed this concept earlier. As for“kingdom,” the term was familiar to the people of those days; it was somethingthey could relate to and understand. In fact, much of what we might call“Christian mythology” springs from concepts that, in our own day, are out ofdate: a royal kingdom with a Royal Person ruling over it; a royal court completewith courtiers, crown, and a throne; hierarchies of power ascending pyramid-liketo culminate in one, Supreme Ruler, God, enthroned high above all others withJesus Christ at his right side and a host of angels below them in variouspostures of adoration. These static images possess a certain quaint charm, butfor all that their existence in the scheme of things as we now know them must beclassed with fairy tales. (Yes, Hinduism too is replete with comparably mythicalimages.)All images like these were conceived during a relatively dark era, spirituallyspeaking. Modern Science has served mankind, in this case, as a divine broom; ithas swept away the accumulated dust and cobwebs of uncounted centuries, and thelitter of countless archaic concepts. Religiously inclined people shouldtherefore be grateful to science, even if most scientists themselves, afteropening our mental windows onto vast and glorious vistas of reality, haveallowed new dust to settle over the panorama. (The worst of this “newdust”—which I contrast here with “new wine”—is its materialistic belief thatconsciousness is something that must be produced, rather than being that whichproduces not only thoughts, but all material reality.)Because science observes, it thinks that consciousness, too, must be observed,for scientists try conscientiously to remove the observer from everythingobserved. God, however, simply is Consciousness itself. The Indian scripture putit beautifully in describing God as Knowing, Knower, Known, as one.“God’s Kingdom” is infinite, of course, and embraces much more even than thisphysical universe. Indeed, scientists tell us that the material universe is notactually infinite, for, vast as it is, it is complete and self-contained. If oneasks the obvious question, “What’s outside of it?” science replies, “Nothing.You are applying finite ways of thinking to a level of reality where they nolonger obtain.”Only one thing can possibly be only as large as it is. That “thing” is thoughtitself! The thoughts formed by consciousness are what set their own limits.Beyond those limits, it may truly be said that nothing exists. The only way toexpand that thought would be to push the thoughts outward by asking, “What liesoutside?” That question would force the thought itself to expand and embrace awider perspective.We come now at last to the central theme of the present chapter: “New Wine.”Jesus gave a new emphasis to Sanaatan Dharma, as it had been expressed throughJudaism. The “old wine” of orthodox Judaism was a valid perception of Truthitself, but people’s understanding of it had grown archaic and encrusted withlayers of excessive reasoning. The Pharisees had banished God to a dry realm ofcarefully reasoned, man-made laws, and had burdened God Himself (their ownconcept of Him, that is to say) with characteristics that were altogether toohuman. Their concept of Him was of a jealous, angry, and vindictive Yahweh(Jehovah). Indeed, the old scriptures themselves described God as having thesecharacteristics, though the descriptions were also taken out of context, andtheir truths, distorted.Yes, God is indeed a “jealous God” in this important sense at least: Hiscondition for revealing Himself to His children is that we be pure in heart, andthat we have no other God, or idols of material, or outwardly directed desires,before Him. God is not vindictive, moreover, but karmic law is very exacting—farmore so than most people realize. And though emotions of any kind, includinganger, have simply no place in the “kingdom” of divine consciousness, man doesneed sometimes to be “shaken up” by fear-inspiring images of the wrath of God.The search for God often, indeed, owes its initial energy to the “fear of God.”(I remember Yogananda once scolding a disciple, and adding these surprisingwords: “God is angry with you for what you have done.”)God is, however, for everyone the supreme goal of life. He is infinitely loving,infinitely blissful, and radiates to infinity the “peace which passeth allunderstanding.” In this sense, Jesus came on earth to humanize God, by showingHim to be infinitely lovable.At the same time, this was “new wine” for the “old wineskins,” whose mind-setwas to adhere strictly to the ancient dogmas. The new concepts Jesus proclaimedwould spill out through many cracks in their brittle understanding. As Yoganandaoften put it, “Most people are psychological antiques. Their thinking, like oldfurniture, splits when it is exposed to the fresh air of new ideas.”I mentioned in the last chapter that Jesus did not die to save the whole humanrace from sin. He himself declared that he had come “for the lost sheep of thehouse of Israel.” Even these “sheep,” moreover, had to pay greatly for rejectingand betraying the great blessing God had sent them, which was His divineresponse to their good karma and to their prayers to be brought out of bondage.(They failed to understand that real bondage is to only one thing:ego-consciousness!)Even the disciples of Jesus did not become suddenly and completely free fromsin. And Judas, who, in the end, deeply and bitterly regretted his sin ofbetrayal, and who (according to Christian dogma) ought by Christ’s sacrifice tohave been saved as much as anyone else from the consequences of his sin, had topay the price of suffering for nearly two thousand years.God is infinitely compassionate. At the same time, as human parents well know, achild needs sometimes to accept the painful consequences of its mistakes, lestit grow up spoiled, fretful, and emotionally immature. It would not even havebeen in mankind’s highest interest for Jesus to have taken away all of itssins—or, say rather, the consequences for having committed them.Finally, history itself shows that mankind became, on the whole, if anythingeven worse during the centuries immediately following the Crucifixion.What Jesus accomplished through his divine self-sacrifice on the cross was theupliftment—but not, be it noted, the spiritual perfection—of his faithfuldisciples, that they might continue, on his behalf, his redemptive work afterthe death of his body.Saint Simeon the New Theologian (who lived, as we stated earlier, all of athousand years ago), asked the following question of his readers in one of hiswritings: Is a person really baptized if he is unaware, either at the time orlater on, of any change in his consciousness? St. Simeon’s answer to thatquestion was resoundingly in the negative.St. Paul, St. Simeon reminded his readers, in the epistle to the Galatianswrote, “For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put onChrist.” (Gal. 3:27) “When you put on clothes,” continued St. Simeon, “aren’tyou perfectly aware that you have put on something? If anyone is not so aware,what can it mean except that he himself is either a corpse, or still naked?“Verily,” the saint concluded, “those who claim to have been baptized, but whoadmit to having experienced no inner spiritual awakening from their baptism, canonly be considered spiritual corpses!” (Some of those old writers could bebracingly caustic!)Christians today, especially in the Western churches, take everything, includingbaptism and so-called new birth into the Christian life, completely (as theycall it) “on faith.” That “faith,” however, is really nothing but blind belief.Jesus spoke also of the need for a personal Savior. This need, too, must befulfilled by some actual experience—by some kind of inner upliftment. Thesupposed fulfillment of that need must not be left to any affirmation of meredogma. I have said that the true Savior is the guru, who himself, or herself,knows God. I submit here my own testimony: Living with a true guru (ParamhansaYogananda) under his personal guidance, and tuning my consciousness to hisconsciousness, have changed and uplifted me in ways that I know I could neverhave accomplished on my own.Jesus said that his physical presence among his disciples was a great help tothem, spiritually. What happened, then, after the Crucifixion? His death didhelp them enormously, in relieving them of some of the burden of their own pastkarma. The impact on the whole world, however, was definitely to a lesserdegree. Water always flows downhill, and if it issues out of the mountains ontoa desert, it soon expends itself on those dry sands. Similarly, the karmicpenance of Christ’s crucifixion, being a single act and not renewed again andagain in compensation for man’s further and uninterrupted sinning, cannot havefully relieved the sins of all mankind. A finite cause, as I stated earlier,cannot have an infinite effect, for even though Jesus Christ’s consciousness wasinfinite, the crucifixion of his body was a finite event. Wishful thinking, weshould ever remind ourselves, is not “binding on the universe.” Indeed, when weread the statement, “He died to save the whole world,” we should bear in mindthe peculiarities of human speech itself. In French, the expression, “tout lemonde” (literally, “the whole world”), simply means, much more generally,“everybody.”What has kept Christ’s true teachings alive has been the living presence of truesaints among his followers. When their sainthood is ignored, discouraged, orpersecuted, the effectiveness of his religion becomes proportionatelydiminished.Sad to say, the situation in Christendom today has reached crisis proportions.Christianity, opposed on all sides by scientific arrogance; diluted byintellectual (but spiritually unenlightened) scholarship; filtered down throughan ever-increasing admixture of egotism and worldliness, and distorted by claimslike, “We’re all saints!”: The marvel is that the teachings of Jesus Christ havesurvived at all! That they have done so is an indication of their truegreatness. As Mahatma Gandhi said, emphasizing the reality of God: “In the midstof death, life persists.”Christianity today, however, has become a wilting plant. It is denied the“living water” of direct, inner, personal experience of God. Religion needs tobe continuously renewed by the living presence of true saints, who deeplypractice the high teachings and have realized their truth in themselves. MostChristians today are like “old wineskins,” incapable of accepting and containingthe ever-fresh, dynamic “new wine” of Truth.My fervent prayer is that this book, and its proclamation of ParamhansaYogananda’s renewed revelation of Christ’s revelation, will initiate a renewalof dynamic, original faith in Jesus Christ.Yogananda himself called his mission to the West, “The Second Coming of Christ.”"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 21[../Images/flower.jpg]GOD ALONE SAVESI told this story earlier, at greater length. On the occasion when ParamhansaYogananda, traveling by train, was challenged by a fundamentalist Christianpreacher, that man demanded, “Do you accept Jesus Christ as your only savior?”Yogananda answered, “I accept God as my Savior, and I believe that He haseffected His salvation through many of His awakened sons, not only through JesusChrist.”Christians as a whole have failed fully to understand how very impersonal Jesuswas in all his references to himself. When, by contrast, he seemed quiteself-assertive, it was always while speaking of the divine Self—as, forinstance, when he said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comethunto the Father, but by me.” (John 14:6) His meaning, in such statements, wascosmic. His reference was to the omnipresent Christ consciousness, which alonewas truly manifested through him. On the other hand, he never accepted personalpraise. Rigidly, rather, he turned it away from himself toward God as the soleReality.I saw this in my own Guru. Whenever people, Indian fashion, touched his feet ina gesture of respect and devotion, he always raised his right hand, with thefingers pointing straight upward, to indicate that he offered that gesture up toGod where, he was reminding us, it really belonged.“And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall Ido, that I may have eternal life?“And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one,that is, God.” (Matt. 19:16,17)What we have here is a theme so grand that it makes me almost tremble whileplacing these words on paper in my poor efforts to explain the truths itpropounds. The glory of Jesus Christ’s divine essence was cosmic. By no meanswas it particular only to the time when he himself lived on the stage of humanhistory in that human form. In a sense it is true that Jesus Christ died for allmankind—even as do all great, liberated masters. For although each of themincarnates on earth with a specific mission, yet also, in the divine effulgenceand bliss-consciousness all of them radiate to the world, they bring blessingsto the whole of humanity.Sir Edwin Arnold, in his beautiful poem The Light of Asia, recounts the life ofthe Buddha. That epic-length poem describes thrillingly the moment when LordGautama achieved enlightenment and became the Buddha. The whole world, so thataccount states, experienced fleetingly, in that instant, a wave of upliftment.The wave passed wondrously through the hearts of all creatures, touching theirconsciousness with a breath of divine bliss. So does it happen in truth, whenany soul on earth attains oneness with the Supreme Spirit. It occurs even moreso later on, when any soul, having finally worked out all the karma of its manypast lives, attains final liberation. The blessing, in Buddha’s case, was indeedof the latter and still greater kind, for he had been born already free. He,too, was an avatar, or incarnation of God.When a soul attains final liberation (so my Guru averred), his earthly familyfor seven generations, forward and backward, are blessed with spiritual freedom.What degree of freedom they attain is, of course, relative and not absolute, forall beings must work hard to achieve final liberation. Nevertheless, what theyreceive—depending, each one, on his or her own receptivity—is a very greatblessing. Perhaps they attain freedom from the need, at least, to be reborn onthis material plane, sodden as it is with the heavy mud of delusion.Dr. Lewis, Yogananda’s first Kriya Yoga disciple in America, once asked him, “Ifa master’s direct family are granted their spiritual freedom, what about thedisciples?”“Oh, they come first!” was the reply.Suppose one asks, “What about the whole world?” I feel safe in answering forhim: “The world, too, is blessed with a degree of upliftment, though certainlyit is not wholly saved.”The power of one ascended master—a soul, that is to say, that has finallyattained complete liberation—is less than the power of a divine incarnation whohas descended from that state of final union, and brings a divine dispensationto all men who receive it lovingly.How then, given this eternal truth, could the incarnation of Jesus Christ, afull incarnation of God, be less than a blessing on the whole of humanity? Weremankind never to be visited by such incarnations, the clouds of maya mighteasily close in forever upon the human race engulfing it. No one, perhaps, wouldever be inspired to strive for enlightenment.People are born on earth as men and women. They grow up with the thought, “I amincomplete. I need a mate.” And so, searching anxiously, they encounter someonewho seems a likely candidate for helping them to achieve that fulfillment.Rarely, alas, do they find the one, right person. They marry, produce progeny,and become increasingly engrossed in their little families. Sexual union,instead of bringing them fulfillment, only depletes their energy—that of men,especially; women’s depletion comes more through emotional attachment, andthrough the process of giving birth. Thus, human beings become more and morefirmly bound to ego-consciousness.And then, with time, they begin to “live again” through their children. Thisthey do not selflessly, however. Their ruling thought is, “My sons; mydaughters.” They dream of achieving, through those children, a more completeself-fulfillment. And then, as those children grow up and have children of theirown, the first couple—grandparents, now—dream still of progeny, on and onthrough future generations, their dream of earthly perfection projected everfarther away from themselves.After death, worldly attachments and desires linger in their consciousness, and,even as Cosmic Creation was produced in the first place out of consciousness, sothose people’s consciousness of worldly desires brings them back again andagain—perhaps even into the same families. Thus they hope, by means of theseconstant “return engagements,” to keep their private dream continuously aliveand exciting.People dream of eventually finding the perfect mate. Perhaps for a time theythink they’ve fulfilled their dream. Again and again they meet disappointment,however, and die with their longing for a perfect marriage still intact. Thus,they come back to the material plane again and again. Like children engaged inan Easter egg hunt, they run from “bush to bush” seeking their one, true“other.” If indeed every human being has a soul mate—and even electrons, it hasbeen found, have their “twins” which work together in tandem with them, nomatter how far apart they are located—how vast is the universe of consciousbeings through which one’s soul mate may have to be sought!Yogananda stated in his Bible commentaries that one’s soul mate may even beliving on another planet. Final union with that other half may occur in vision.It must not, however—indeed, it cannot—be a sexual union, for in sexual unionpeople’s consciousness is drawn downward in the spine, away from their ownhigher, spiritual centers.This teaching is touched on only lightly, if at all, by great masters, for theycertainly don’t want anyone seeking his soul mate on every street corner! TheGospel of St. Matthew states,“The Pharisees also [along with ‘the multitudes’] came unto him, tempting him,and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for everycause?“And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made themat the beginning made them male and female,“And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleaveto his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?“Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joinedtogether, let not man put asunder.“They [the Pharisees] say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writingof divorcement, and to put her away?“He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered youto put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.“And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be forfornication [except, that is, if she be unfaithful sexually], and shall marryanother, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away dothcommit adultery.” (Matt. 19:3–9)Fornication for its own sake, moreover, is (Yogananda said) adulterous even inmarriage, if it is without the consciousness of mutual love. For what adulterymeans is to adulterate: to admix with something pure an element of impurity.The desire for a soul-mate is deeply embedded in human nature. Its roots liedeeper than the ego itself. God ultimately, however, is our true Soul Mate. Inthis case too, therefore, these words of Jesus remain eternally true:“Seek ye the first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all thesethings shall be added unto you.” (Matt. 6:33)If indeed every human being must eventually find his soul mate, thisfulfillment, too, is one that “shall be added unto you” if you seek God first.The thing is, whether married or single, to make Him above all, eternally, yourpriority.The passage on divorce continues:“His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife[uncertain and insecure], [perhaps] it is not good to marry.“But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom itis given.“For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother’s womb: andthere are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs[people who abstain from sex], which have made themselves eunuchs [chaste] forthe kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receiveit.” (Matt. 19:10–12)The words I quoted earlier, “What therefore God hath joined together, let notman put asunder,” must, Yogananda said, be understood as true soul-union in God,and not merely as the dedication to one another of a man and a woman, even iftheir union is consecrated in a church. Therefore Jesus said, “He which madethem at the beginning, made them male and female.” There is a divine, not merelya biological, truth in these words. Many marriages are based on a superficial,fleeting attraction—as Yogananda wryly put it, “on a union between a slick bowtie and an attractive shade of lipstick!” He himself, perhaps in concession tothe times in which we live, went further than Jesus did in stating when divorcemight be permissible. If a person’s spouse is foolish, worldly, and above all ifhe or she exerts a downward pull on the consciousness of one who is trying torise spiritually, divorce is spiritually justified. A teaching in the Indianscriptures is, “If a duty conflicts with a higher duty, it ceases to be a duty.”Yogananda sometimes told the story of a famous opera singer, AmelitaGalli-Curci, who had later become his disciple. She first married a man who, intime, became a drunkard. One evening, in a drunken fit, he raised a chair tostrike her. This time she looked him straight in the eye, and with firm, deepconcentration said, “Don’t you dare touch me!” She walked forthwith out of thehouse. Years later she met someone else, whom in time she married. This manbecame to her, Yogananda stated, a true spiritual partner.Divorce, in this case, was justified, both morally and spiritually. Her firstmarriage had not been a “marriage in God,” even though (considering that she wasboth Roman Catholic and Italian) it had probably been solemnized in a church andby an ordained priest.Again, there was a couple who lived for some years in Yogananda’s seasidecommunity in Encinitas, California. The man decided to leave his guru. Enteringtheir house, he announced to his wife, “Let’s pack up. We’re getting out ofhere.”“Oh no,” she replied. “You leave if you want to. I remain with my Guru.”Yogananda, when speaking later with me (and perhaps a few others) of thisepisode, quoted the woman’s words with approval.He also told me of how his own family, during his youth, had tried three timesto get him married. Each time, he’d simply refused. On their third attempt, heoffered the girl to a cousin of his. The young man was delighted to get her, forshe was exceptionally beautiful.Yogananda returned to India in 1935, and briefly stayed in their home. Duringthat visit he observed the wife nagging her husband unremittingly. “I saw thepoor man tiptoeing about like a mouse,” our Guru told us, “forever in dread ofanother tongue-lashing.”The Master took her aside and said to her, “You know, I have some right to speakto you on these matters, since you were first promised to me. What I want to sayto you is that, had we been married, and had you treated me as I see youtreating him, I’d have given our marriage no more than one week. After that I’dhave left for the Himalayas, to devote my life to seeking God in meditation!”She heard him, and—as much as was possible for her rather aggressivenature—reformed.It is permissible for one to leave his spouse for God, in cases where the spouseis trying to pull him (or her) away from the spiritual life. Otherwise, asYogananda frequently commented, “Loyalty is the first law of God.”Back, then, to our original theme: Mate, money, fame, power, worldly position,children, a growing family tree of grandchildren and great grandchildren, and anaccompanying sense of one’s own central importance in this scene—all these areamong maya’s ways of keeping people bound unendingly to the wheel of samsara(worldly involvement). Were it not for those few who become saints, and aboveall for the incarnations of God who appear on earth (though alas! from the humanpoint of view too rarely), people might never even think of seeking a way toemerge at last from the swirling mists of delusion into the clear light of trueunderstanding.An avatar, or incarnation of God, has the power to lift innumerable souls out ofdelusion. As Lahiri Mahasaya predicted to Yogananda’s mother on the day shebrought her baby to him for a blessing, “Little mother, thy son will be a yogi.As a spiritual engine, he will carry many souls to God’s kingdom.” One imaginesthose powerful locomotives, God’s direct incarnations, pulling lengthy trainsbehind them. Those masters who, by contrast, have ascended only in the presentlife, though they reach the same level of divine realization, have not flowingthrough them the same spiritual power to uplift an innumerable throng ofspiritual seekers.Everyone, if he would find God, must first free at least a few others. I onceasked my Guru, “How many must an ascending master save?”“At least six,” he replied.That Jesus was a divine incarnation is hinted at from the very beginning of hislife. It was the three wise men who announced they had “seen his star in theeast.” That statement had a deeply esoteric meaning: Jesus, they were saying,had descended through the star which appears at the center of the spiritual eye,and which is the doorway to the inner kingdom of God.Jesus brought a special dispensation to mankind. I remarked earlier thatreligiously minded people owe a great debt to science for having opened thewindows of men’s minds onto vaster realities in the material universe. Sciencedeserves our gratitude. Scientists themselves, unfortunately, rarely have thehumility to understand what a treasure they have brought: the gift of increasedknowledge regarding the workings of God’s creation. Most scientists lacksuperconscious intuition. They are like the artist who, on beholding a beautifulsunset, boasts, “I could paint a better sunset myself!” (And what could hiscolored daubs accomplish? At best they would be only smears of pigment on alittle canvas, never to be enjoyed except when the canvas was so placed as toreflect light! He wouldn’t have even sunlight to illuminate his scene fromwithin.) Scientists pride themselves on having discovered what was simply therealready, long before their very science was even a dream in anyone’s mind!Several months ago, I was the main speaker at a conference in Milan, Italy. Thetopic was, “Science and Religion.” Ervin Laszlo, a great and wise scientist, hadbeen invited to speak. At the last minute, however, he had been forced to cancelowing to illness. Another scientist was accordingly invited to speak in hisplace. This person, proudly assured that science alone has all the answers,showed little interest in the subject of the conference, and began his talk bylurching (so it seemed to me) into the words, “Religion tries to instill blindbelief in people, whereas science deals only with the facts. Once a scientificfact has been proved, scientists everywhere in the world accept it withouthesitation.” (I’ve been exposed to that tired mantra all my life!)I was reminded of a statement made by Max Planck, the famous German physicist,in his Scientific Autobiography: “A new scientific truth does not triumph byconvincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because itsopponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar withit.” Scientists are, after all, only human. Not many of them are wise. Many ofthem, as human beings, might almost be called small-minded, for they’ve blindedthemselves, by exclusive focus on the power of reasoning, to the point wherethey seem, often enough, to lack even common sense!It was purely delicious, for me, when this man, barely five minutes into hisspeech, began to squabble with other scientists on the platform, right beforethe whole audience, concerning some supposed incontrovertible scientific “fact”he was championing!Arrogance has been the undoing of many scientists, perhaps, who speak as thoughthey considered the very universe their personal responsibility! I remember myGuru once saying, “Pride is the death of wisdom.”Nevertheless, a humble view of the realities science has opened up for us shouldmake us deeply grateful to science itself. It has provided us with what could bean ego-freeing awareness of universal realities. For the cosmic scheme is,fundamentally, completely impersonal. The thought springs naturally to the mind,when we gaze up at night into the heavens and contemplate the infinity of spaceand time: “How insignificant, in the great, divine order, am I!” To those whosethoughts probe even more deeply, the further thought may occur: “The cosmos,though an incontrovertible fact, can be understood only to the extent that ourquesting begins with us, ourselves.” Expanding beyond the petty little self—andeven rejoicing in the comparison of our little selves to that vastness—we comeat last to realize that, although the cosmic empyrean appears to have no actualcenter, it does, in fact, have a center: in ourselves! The universe, Yoganandastated, is “center everywhere, circumference nowhere.” Every human being, as faras he himself is concerned, is the center of everything in existence!God dwells, moreover, in the heart. Because of Him, our souls have divineimportance in the great scheme of things. Our egos are insignificant, but in oursouls, and in the fact that God alone must be found first within each of us, ourimportance is infinite!Science is self-condemned, of course, to viewing everything from the outside. Itwill never succeed, therefore, in prying from even the tiny electron its deepestsecrets. Sanaatan Dharma, however, the Eternal Religion, offers truths by whicheveryone can come to know the one indwelling, divine Self. Beside this supernaldiscovery, all the knowledge science has ever given us amounts to little morethan rummaging around in the cosmic pantry, looking for something worthwhile tonibble on.To get out of the ego, and to realize ourselves as that conscious essence fromwhich all things were manifested, is simply not possible so long as man seeksrelease by his egoic efforts alone. Reason by itself cannot supply him with thekey he needs to unlock that door, for his rational faculty is already infectedwith the very disease of delusion it would cure. Wise is that scientist—alas, heis also rare—who doesn’t preen himself on the findings of science. For, as Istated earlier, all science can do is find what was there already. Rarely doscientists have the humility of George Washington Carver, the great Negroscientist, whose absence of pride drew the inspiration from God to find hundredsof uses for the humble peanut.To get out of ego-consciousness, it is necessary first to tune in to someone whohas already, himself, overcome the ego: in other words, a true guru. Few peopleare born so highly advanced that they no longer need a guru’s help, being inthemselves already sufficiently free from ego to be able to draw the neededupliftment directly from God.A few Christian saints have been born with this high state, and have thereforenot needed a guru. Such persons have served in their turn as gurus to their owndisciples. An example springs to mind: St. Francis of Assisi, to whom JesusChrist often appeared physically. Jesus, on the other hand, so as to emphasizethis eternal truth, went himself to John the Baptist for baptism. John had beenfrom ancient times, so Yogananda explained, the guru of Jesus Christ. Jesus hadoutstripped his guru in spiritual advancement (something that does happen,sometimes). Therefore John demurred, saying:“I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?“And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becomethus to fulfill all righteousness.” (Matt. 3:14,15)Paramhansa Yogananda explained that John had been one of the great prophets ofolden times: Elijah. Jesus in that lifetime (so Yogananda said) had been hisdisciple Elisha (on whom Elijah cast his mantle). Therefore, when Jesus wastransfigured before three of his disciples on Mount Tabor, they beheld him withMoses and Elias (the Greek version of the Hebrew name, Elijah). The Bible goeson to relate:“And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias mustfirst come?“And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall come, and restore allthings.“But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but havedone unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man sufferof them.“Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.”(Matt. 17:10–13)Jesus had no need of baptism from John; in fact, John said as much. Jesus,however, requested this grace of him in order to show to all “the world” thefact that this, usually, is the need of every true seeker.Therefore said Jesus to Nicodemus, “Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except aman be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” This account continues:“Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enterthe second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?“Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of waterand of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” (John 3:3–5)To be born of water is to be born into the human body. To be born of the spiritis to receive new birth into the Divine Spirit of God, from one’s guru.The concept of our need for a guru was preserved in the Eastern Church, with itstradition of the staretz or personal spiritual teacher. In the West, thisconcept was lost sight of, unfortunately, long ago, owing to the supremeimportance the church claimed for itself as the Christian’s only channel to God(apart from Jesus Christ himself). This belief, though institutionallyconvenient, is in fact not valid. It has given rise, moreover, (as I saidearlier) to numerous other fallacies. In consequence, few Christians nowadays,if they deeply yearn to know God, have any recourse outside the numerouschurches, each of which claims some degree of infallibility. The notion ofhaving a guru, therefore, has among orthodox Christians been virtuallyforgotten.The fallacy has been taken by the Protestant churches to the extreme ofinsisting that one can get everything he needs by simply reading the Bible. ManyProtestants, as I stated earlier, even protest self-righteously, “Why, we’re allsaints!” (What a perfect way to keep religion utterly mediocre!) Yogananda saidto me, “If you argue with a scripture, it can’t answer you. A true guru,however, can correct your misunderstandings, and set you straight.”The message Jesus brought from God was, as it would have had to be, SanaatanDharma, the Eternal Religion. His message was also, however, special andparticular, as truth often is when it is taught by a divine incarnation. Itwould not have been appropriate for Jesus Christ to tell his followers to lookfor guidance to any other representative of the ancient truths. Even so, a timedid occur when he qualified this fact also. The disciples came to him with newsof someone who was of another following, but was casting out devils in his name.“Master,” the disciples said to him, “we saw one casting out devils in thy name,and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.“But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle inmy name, that can lightly speak evil of me.“For he that is not against us is on our part.” (Mark 9:38–40)Jesus nevertheless, both in what he taught and in his divine presence, opened upnew vistas onto Infinity. It behooved all those who followed him, as it behoovesall those even today who would follow in his footsteps, to honor him and to seeksalvation in his name. Those, indeed, who teach in his name are right to makeclear the truth that they represent him, above all. For although Sanaatan Dharmais eternal and the only true religion in the universe, many are the windows thatopen out onto it. The Eternal Religion cannot be understood except through oneof the actual “openings” onto the cosmic verities.Thus, Paramhansa Yogananda, whose coming had been at the request of JesusChrist, declared also that he himself was the last in his particular line ofgurus. He placed Jesus Christ first in that sequence because it was Jesus who,by his request to Babaji, had started this mission. When Yogananda said that hehimself was the last in that line, he did so because these were the five masters(including himself) who had initiated this divine dispensation, so charged byGod. He never stated that there would be no other gurus in his work. Had he doneso, it would have meant that his teaching was not valid.I once asked him, “Is this mission a new religion?”“It is a new expression,” he replied, giving special emphasis to that last word.A new expression was what Jesus, too, brought to mankind.To me, particularly as I’ve labored to fulfill my Guru’s commission to me that Iedit his writings, it has often seemed that Yogananda is himself the “avatar” ofthis new age of energy. The concept that there are different historical ages issomething I shall do my best to clarify in the next chapter.The message Yogananda was sent to deliver to the Christian world was one that hehimself called the Second Coming of Christ. His teachings, though entirelyChristian in content, opened up new “windows” onto the eternal truth of Christ’steachings. Yogananda showed people in this scientific age how, withoutdiminishing their religious faith, to embrace the vast panorama that science hasrevealed to mankind. He showed, as science has done also, that reality is bothinfinite and infinitesimal. He declared—again, as science has also done—thatmatter has no existence except as countless different vibrations of energy.What Yogananda taught was, however, far in advance of modern science, for hedeclared man’s need to recognize consciousness itself as the supreme cause, andnot as merely the effect of brain activity. He helped Westerners, schooled asthey are in the “either . . . or” methods of Aristotelian logic, to discoverthat truth can be stated in many ways: that the relativity of values is a fact,for the only thing absolute in existence is the Supreme Spirit. (Thus, heresolved a great modern dilemma: absolute, versus relative, truth.)[8]Jesus did the same. He said, for example, in his “Sermon on the Mount”:“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, andglorify your Father which is in heaven.” (Matt. 5:16)Only a little later, however, he said, “And when thou prayest, thou shalt not beas the hypocrites . . . standing . . . in the corners of the streets, that theymay be seen of men. . . . But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet,and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thyFather which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.” (Matt. 6:5,6)A literal mind, addicted to the “either . . . or” approach of Western logic,might object, “Couldn’t he make up his mind? If I declare my devotion in public,how can I at the same time keep it a secret?” There are many subtle nuances inlife’s truths, however. A great master’s teaching must be viewed with intuitive,rather than with literal, understanding.This fact is something I myself—raised as I’d been on Western methods ofreasoning—had to learn from my Guru. A divine truth must be taken inside andunderstood in its own, specific context. In the example I just gave, the seekerneeds to share with others the graces he receives, in meditation, of peace,light, and joy, for by selfishness his capacity for empathy would only shrink.He must receive these graces from God, however, in the secrecy of inner,meditative silence.Yogananda appealed, as did Jesus also, to the deepest reality in all beings,whose universal desire is always the same: the soul’s longing for perfect bliss.Based on this realization, Paramhansa Yogananda, like Jesus Christ, saweveryone, regardless of outward forms, as his brother or sister in God.These truths need a new expression, however, in our new age. That we actually dolive in a new age, into which science has heralded us, is something most peopleunderstand and accept, even though many of them also resist the concept. Theramifications of the conflict that is raging, in consequence, throughout thethinking world will be explored in the next chapter.[8] See my book, Out of the Labyrinth, Crystal Clarity Publishers, 2001."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 22[../Images/flower.jpg]THE AGES OF HISTORYHuman nature hasn’t changed much since the days of Jesus Christ. Ourunderstanding of it, however, has certainly become more sophisticated. Mostintelligent people today know that a person’s conscious beliefs don’t define himwholly as he is. Human nature is much more complex than anything suggested bysuperficial beliefs. A person can believe one thing consciously, yet behave inways that contradict his belief, and that show his real beliefs to be quitedifferent. Our knowledge of human nature includes, now, an awareness of thesubconscious. We know, consequently, that our motivations can spring from depthswe don’t even consciously recognize.There is some recognition nowadays, moreover, that there may be spiritualdimensions in life, and in every human being, that are not generally known, butof which it is now possible to speak without being dismissed as a complete fool.When people present that old fundamentalist challenge, “Are you saved?” it iseasier, nowadays, to ask in return, “Saved from what?” And the usual answer,“Saved from eternal hell,” can at least be contested by cool reasoning—as indeedI have tried to do in this book. For it is unthinkable to any fair-minded personthat a loving God would so condemn his own children for actions they’vecommitted—and committed, moreover, in ignorance—as to spurn them for alleternity! A finite cause, as I pointed out earlier, cannot have an infiniteeffect.People have, in other words, become more open to common sense, and are lesseasily swayed by unreasonable or merely dogmatic pronouncements.Jesus had to adjust his teaching to the general level of consciousness in histimes. Again and again we find him saying, “He that hath ears to hear, let himhear.”“Take heed,” he said once to his disciples, “and beware of the leaven of thePharisees and the Sadducees.“And [reading on] they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we havetaken no bread.“Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reasonye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?“Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the fivethousand, and how many baskets ye took up?“Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?[He is referring here to the miracles of divine providence he’d performed.]“How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerningbread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees?“Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread,but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.” (Matt. 16:6–12)Many times his disciples took him literally when he was speaking onlymetaphorically. As another example, during his visit to Samaria, when they urgedhim to eat something and he answered saying, “I have meat to eat that ye knownot of” (John 4:32), they thought he must have eaten already. All the answer hegave them on that occasion, however (vouchsafing no further explanation), was,“My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.” (John4:34) His answer was not really quite adequate in itself, for although the soulmay be satisfied if one does God’s will, actions alone will not ordinarily fillthe stomach.Jesus explained himself more fully on this point when he said to “the tempter”(Satan), “It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every wordthat proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” (Matt. 4:4) The people of his times,however, and to some extent even his own disciples, were not ready for teachingsthat were too far ahead of the general knowledge of their day.A good example of present-day advancement is something everyone knows about now:energy. How could Jesus speak of energy, when the people of his day were noteven aware that energy exists? Indeed, the whole world was dim on this point. Inthe yoga teachings of India, for example, energy (prana) had come to be thoughtof only in connection with the breath. Refinement of understanding has beenincreasing all over the world in the centuries since then, and not only inWestern civilization.Paramhansa Yogananda explained (as I stated in Chapter Sixteen) that manpossesses another “mouth” besides the one through which he ingests food. This“mouth of God,” as Jesus called it, is not physically visible, but it receivesenergy directly from the surrounding atmosphere rather than by the indirectmethod of introducing sustenance into the body by the physical mouth: food,which the body must then convert into energy. The portal of entrance for thisdirect flow of energy is the medulla oblongata at the base of the brain. Throughthis “chakra,” or subtle center, energy enters the body. This “mouth of God,” sodesignated, is also the seat of the ego. (The divine sense of Self, by contrast,is located in the heart.)We all live to some extent by this energy. Without it, indeed, we would die. Wecan draw on it consciously, moreover, by a combination of awareness of it, andwill power. Saints have been known even not to eat anything at all for years,living entirely by the inner, direct source of energy. One such saint wasTherese Neumann, to whom I’ve alluded before in these pages.For practical application of this knowledge, Yogananda taught a system of“energization exercises,” as he called them, which enable the practitioneractually to energize his body at will. Thus, he helped us to make these truthsmore dynamic to our consciousness.Jesus evidently did not feel he could stretch people’s minds—not even those ofhis own disciples—so far as to speak of the cosmic energy. It is only in thelast hundred years or so that humanity has come to some understanding of energy.During this time, science has proved that matter is, in fact, without substanceat all: It consists simply of vibrations of energy.In other ways, too, Jesus went along with the understanding of his times. Forexample, he ate meat, though many spiritual teachers nowadays recommend againstit, and medical science is coming more and more widely to recognize that meateating can actually cause many diseases. Yogananda also explained—somethingpeople nowadays are at least ready to consider—that meat eating exerts adownward pull on the mind, because mammals, whose consciousness is relativelyhigh in development compared to vegetables and even to fish, experience intenseemotions when they are slaughtered: especially emotions of fear and anger. Thesefeelings leave gross vibrations in the meat, which are absorbed by the personeating it. (No one, two thousand years ago, would have even understood thatword, “vibrations.”)Many were the truths Jesus taught that could not be explained in those days, butthat today seem at least not so outrageous. One teaching of his to whichParamhansa Yogananda often referred was the following:“And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for itis profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thywhole body should be cast into hell.“And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee. . . .” Heconcluded by repeating the same words as those in the verse before. (Matt.5:29,30)Jesus, later in the same chapter, made it a point to state specifically that hewas changing some of the ancient rules: those which, to him, were not essentialto the teachings of Sanaatan Dharma since they were simply ways of helpingpeople to absorb the Eternal Truth. The alterations he made showed how greatincarnations of God do sometimes make changes in the way the eternal truthsshould be applied to the shifting, temporal scenes of life. (Ordinary humanbeings, it should be added, must not presume to make such changes. Only greatmasters have the right, and indeed the duty, to do so, for their inspirationcomes to them directly from God.)In the above verses, however, one must ask: Did Jesus literally mean that oneshould pluck out his right eye and cut off his right hand if these “offend” him?What, for that matter, did he mean by that word, “offend”?How can the eye offend us? Well, obviously—since Jesus was speakingspiritually—it offends against our higher nature if we gaze pleasurably onanything that is spiritually unclean or unholy. Such sights are best avoided,especially if, to us, they are attractive. The sight, then, becomes anoffense—in the sense of being sinful—to the soul of anyone who revels in it.Why—we then ask—did he specify the right eye? What both our eyes see is, afterall, the same, so why blame only the right one? The answer is that the right isthe positive side of the body. In ancient tradition, the right side of the bodyindicated energy that is given with full consent of the will. What Jesus meant,Yogananda explained, was that seeing becomes an offense when we give the consentof our will power to what we see. We should withdraw our attention from anythingthat feeds thoughts of illicit, because impure, pleasure.Yogananda went farther, however. He said that what Jesus really meant, but wasnot in a position in those times to say, was that we should withdraw not onlyour attention, but above all our energy. For our energy can flow out towardsense objects even after our conscious attention has been withdrawn. This is thebane that subconscious influences can exert on the mind. (Those influences canalso be a blessing, of course, when they reinforce a wholesome direction of thewill.) What we must do, then, is wholesomely redirect our energy. Only in thisway can we change influences that, otherwise, will keep rising into the mindfrom the subconscious like bubbles in a glass of champagne.Imagine a woman “baring all” seductively, so to speak, on a television screen. Asincere seeker of God and of higher truth might notice that scene fleetingly,but his normal and proper reaction would be simply to look away, or to close hiseyes, or (if he controlled the situation) to change the channel. If he findshimself drawn to gaze at the scene by the consent of his will, however, thisexemplifies what Jesus meant by “thy right eye.” In such a case, he must throwthe thought out of his mind with a strong effort of the will (“pluck it out”).It is better (“more profitable” was the way Jesus expressed it) to live withfleeting regret for having refused to enjoy that scene than to let lasciviousthoughts draw one’s entire consciousness down into a pit from which there is noexit, finally, but to climb laboriously out again.Merely to tell one’s self, however, “I just won’t think about it,” is almostnever adequate. Often, the more one tries not to think about something, the morehe finds himself irresistibly drawn to thinking about it. The solution, then, isto direct energy with will power toward some other, more wholesome thought oractivity. Don’t merely try not to dwell on thoughts that you want to avoid:Vigorously divert the mind, with energy, in a new direction.“Habits,” my Guru once told me, “can be overcome in a day. They are onlyconcentration of the mind. Concentrate differently, and a wrong habit can bebanished in an instant.” He also said that this new direction of concentratedthought must be accompanied by a vigorous, new, and creative flow of energy.“The greater the will,” was his maxim, “the greater the flow of energy.”I have several times, over the years, tested the validity of this counsel, andhave found it to work infallibly. It is like a story I once read of an alcoholicwho wanted to overcome his addiction to liquor. One day he found himself drawnforcibly, owing to long habit, to open a new bottle of whiskey. All at once,furious with himself, he grabbed every bottle of alcoholic drink from his liquorcabinet, carried the lot out of doors, and hurled them fiercely onto thesidewalk, shattering all of them completely. So vigorous at that moment was hisdetermined renunciation that he found, later, his habit patterns had been newlyredirected—completely so. Never again did he feel the desire for liquor.The Bhagavad Gita states, “To meditate on sense objects, while outwardlyabstaining from them, is hypocrisy.” Throughout the world, religious followers,not knowing the subtle key to self-mastery, have lacked this secret: energy.They haven’t realized that transcendence requires a withdrawal and aredirection, not only of thoughts, but of energy from every false attraction.This is what Jesus Christ meant (but, in his cultural context, couldn’t say).Yogananda could say it, however, for today we live in an age when everybodyknows of the existence of energy.Yogananda told us of having once read an account in a newspaper of a woman who,deeply remorseful for having stolen and wanting to obey the commandment ofJesus, had cut off her right hand. Alas, her penitential act brought her nocure. The impulse to steal remained with her, and she stole again—this time,with her left hand!I have noticed in life that people with strong personalities often expressthemselves colorfully. Jesus Christ, though he had long since overcome all senseof having a separate ego of his own, still possessed a strong personality. Farfrom being self-effacing (the “gentle Jesus, meek and mild” of sentimentaltradition), he had, and indeed needed to have, enormous strength of will to facethe wilful opposition of a strong people, whom he’d been sent to help. Thereforeit was that he used such expressions as, “And there be eunuchs, which have madethemselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake.” (Matt. 19:12) He didn’tsay, “Some people prefer to be chaste and celibate, for they find that thispractice helps them to direct all their thoughts upward in the recollection ofGod.” He wanted to shock people, to seize their attention and make his messageindelible in their minds.In the foregoing commandment, too, he didn’t say gently, “If your right eyetakes pleasure in viewing wrongful images (whether sexual, or in other waysworldly), I suggest that it would better for you if you looked away, or if youat least lowered your gaze.” That would have been a sensible caution, and wouldhave raised no eyebrows. Instead, however, what he stated, as strongly andcolorfully as possible, was (in essence), “Pluck that image out of your eye andthrow it onto a dungheap!” Be vigorous, in other words, in your resolution notto entertain for even a moment the slightest thought of delusion.The mind likes, instead, to play with wrong images. Perhaps it justifies itselfwith the rationalization that all it wants is to understand what makes theforbidden scene attractive, and why. Never go down that path: it has led many aseeker into a mire of delusive involvement. Instead, then, declare forcefully:“NO!” You don’t need to understand the delusion. Understanding will come later,when your mind is calm, clear, and uplifted. It will never come if you trygently to puff away the clouds of delusion in the hope that they’ll accommodateyou by vanishing.“The first thought of delusion,” my Guru said to me: “that is the moment tocatch it.”The important thing is to bring energy, also, into play. Reject delusion withenergy. Had Jesus said those things, people would not have understood him.Therefore I say that Yogananda, though he called his mission “The Second Comingof Christ,” added new dimensions to Christ’s teachings that accord well withman’s expanded understanding in this new age. And therefore, also, I speak ofYogananda as the avatar, or divine incarnation, for this age of energy. Hismission was to show people how completely compatible Christ’s teachings werewith the expanded, and self-expanding, knowledge of our times.Jesus was not only, at the beginning of our Christian era, the messiah to theJews. He said also, “Other sheep I have that are not of this fold: them also Imust bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and oneshepherd.” (John 10:16) “One fold,” indeed, and one recognized, eternalreligion, which Yogananda explained as Self-realization. Jesus Christ, too, willbe a living messiah for all time.The age Jesus lived in was, religiously speaking, rigidly dogmatic. His fellowJews criticized him again and again for not “measuring up” to their ideas ofwhat a teacher to the Jews ought to be and to teach. His own followerscontinued, through the centuries that followed, to be as dogmatic about theirown traditions as the Jews had been about theirs. Moreover, as Christianityentered into, and became absorbed by, the Greco-Roman world, it adopted therigid disciplines of Greek reasoning to bolster the dogmas it was formulating.Thus it shunned the more fluid perceptions that come with soul-intuition.Times have changed. Mankind is now more advanced—clearly so—not only inobjective and subjective knowledge, but also in empathetic awareness, humanbeing for human being.What explanation can be advanced for such a great change? Only two thousandyears have passed: not so very much time, surely, despite the Christian dream ofa millennium as being a very long time.Many ancient cultures believed,[9] interestingly, that there had been asuccessive series of ages—of, some of them said, recurring cycles. The Egyptiansspoke of a gradual descent from a much higher age. It is interesting to notethat many scholars have commented that Egyptian history seems to have begun atits height, and thereafter only declined. The Greeks spoke of a downwardsuccession of ages also: gold, silver, copper, and iron. The Hopi of theAmerican Southwest speak even today of four “worlds,” or epochs of time. So alsodid the Aztecs of Mexico. The Scandinavian countries (Norsemen) also believed infour declining ages. The four descending ages were, again, a part of Celtictradition. In Asia, the Sumerians believed there had been higher ages in thepast. The Persians, like the Greeks, spoke of four descending ages: gold,silver, steel, and iron. There is also some suggestion of this knowledge amongthe ancient Hebrews, in the Book of Daniel.In ancient India, the tradition existed of a cycle of four ages, or yugas: Satya(spiritual) yuga; Treta (a predominantly mental age); Dwapara, an age of energy;and Kali yuga, a dark age of widespread ignorance.In India, and perhaps elsewhere as well, the tradition was that the great cyclesof time recur regularly, in unceasing repetition.In all of these cultures, the belief was held that mankind, at the time whenthose traditions (according to present-day knowledge) were recorded, had reachedthe lowest age. Modern historians have of course treated those traditions withthe condescension of “wise old age” for the “fairy tales” of childhood, or,equally, as the nostalgia people generally feel for “the good old days.” It isinteresting, however, that those traditions were so widespread. They seem,indeed, to have been almost universal.Science today has opened our eyes to the vastness of the universe, and also toits subtlety. At the same time, however, science has had an eye only formaterial realities. It is developing ever-greater sophistication in itsunderstanding, but it still seems far from perceiving the universe in terms ofcosmic influences.One such influence was described in ancient times (especially in India) as thegreat cycles of cosmic time.What was taught more specifically by other ancient civilizations, beyond that ofIndia, has been obscured by the fact that, over time, all those civilizationshave crumbled and disappeared. The only culture still functioning—and some ofits old traditions, it must be admitted, have reached a somewhat tottering oldage—is the culture of India. India’s basic spirituality has preserved itstraditions, wobbling but still upright, from the natural disintegrations oftime.In that tradition, most—and perhaps all—of the discoveries of modern sciencewere anticipated. The vastness of the universe was known. Also known was thefact that energy is the basis of matter. Indeed, their knowledge went muchfurther, for it claimed that will-directed thought is what generated energy inthe first place. It also claimed that unmoving consciousness (inconceivable tothe modern mind) predated thought, and was the very foundation of universalCreation.It is an astonishing legacy, one that science has only succeeded inconfirming—albeit its confirmation is rather like stating that the base of thattall mountain over there does, in fact, exist.Paramhansa Yogananda’s guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar, said that there is definitelytruth to the declaration of the ancients that the vast cycles of time exist;that the universe, having been conceived first by consciousness, and projectedout of consciousness by thought (idea forms), and then energy, is far moreconscious than the mind of man has imagined. Cosmic influences do exist. Theyflow, indeed, like streams and rivers through the entire universe, influencingeven the consciousness of mankind.It sounds “far out.” Most people, indeed, will probably dismiss the wholeconcept as “poppycock.” Very well, let us take it as such. Still, it does answercertain questions very well that have never before come under consideration.Those who have made these assertions, moreover—not only Swami Sri Yukteswar, whowas a great modern sage, but also great rishis (sages) of olden times—have notbeen the sort of persons whom any sensible human being would dismiss blithely asstupid.Sri Yukteswar corrected modern Hindu traditions, and presented a timetableregarding our own earth and solar system that is easier to grasp. Hinduism is avery old tree, and is in present need of pruning to rid it of growths like thosewhich have appeared also on the much younger tree of original Christianity. InHinduism, indeed, the case is worse owing to the extreme antiquity of thatancient religion. According to modern Hindu tradition, we now live in adescending Kali Yuga, or dark age, which is destined to last another fourhundred and thirty thousand years.According to that same tradition, the days of Rama (during Treta Yuga) in theRamayana, and of Krishna (toward the end of descending Dwapara Yuga) in theMahabharata—both of them stated, therefore, to have lived in higher ages—wouldhave to have been impossibly distant in the past, too long a span of time formankind to have remembered, especially considering how prominent a place thosetwo figures hold in modern memory.Another tradition in modern (as well as in less recent) India is that, at theend of Kali Yuga, Satya Yuga (the Golden, or Spiritual, Age) will immediatelybegin again. Nothing in Nature endorses such a sudden shift. Day fades totwilight before it becomes night; night always fades to predawn light beforebecoming day again. Summer fades to autumn before it becomes Winter; Winterchanges to Spring before Summer returns. Nothing in the universe moves by suddenjerks. Even supernovas, sudden as they seem, take time to develop, and then,again, to fade away. All this is perfectly obvious; I state it only to point outthat ancient traditions must be pruned regularly of fallacies, which grow upowing to human misunderstanding.Swami Sri Yukteswar declared that certain errors of reckoning had crept into theancient traditions. When a great master, moreover, takes the trouble to makesuch a strong declaration (as opposed merely to going along affably withtradition), it is idle to speculate that he may only be stating an opinion. Ifthere is a place in human thinking for dogmatism, I think it must begin withaccepting statements made by those who, alone among mankind, have demonstratedtrue wisdom. A human being without any firm convictions deserves to beclassified among invertebrates! A strong corroboration for this particular dogma(if that is what it is) may be seen in the fact that the truly wise are alwaysin deep agreement with one another. All the arguments in religion have beenfomented by lesser men. As my Guru said, “Fools argue; wise men discuss.” Thewise, in their discussions, always agree on fundamental points of truth.According to Swami Sri Yukteswar, our planet and solar system are affected by aCosmic Year, or complete cycle of ages, lasting 24,000 years: 12,000 ascending,12,000 descending.The nadir of that descent, he said, was reached in the year 500 a.d. From thenon there has been, as he pointed out, a gradual ascent toward ever-greaterunderstanding and enlightenment.History does, in fact, show a gradual decline in ancient times (ancient, thatis, relative to our present time sense). Egyptian history seems to have sprungout of nothing, so to speak, at a peak from which it descended to finaldisintegration. Egyptologists, eager for acceptance by other scientists asscientists themselves, have denied this claim. The claim has nevertheless beenmade again and again, and by serious scholars.I wish I could take the time to explore this subject of ancient civilizations indepth, for it has always fascinated me. The theme of this book, however,prevents me from making such a foray. I must content myself, therefore, withsaying that the years prior to 500 a.d. do indeed seem to have been accompaniedby a gradual descent into what has been called, in the West, a dark age.Interestingly, knowledge that was lost in the descending arc seems to havereappeared at comparable points on the re-ascending arc. The ancient Greeks knewthat the world is round. They knew that it is not the center of the universe.They even knew about the atom—a very recent discovery in modern times. Thatknowledge was, however, subsequently lost. In the Christian era, the cosmologyof Ptolemy became accepted so dogmatically by the Church that Copernicus, agreat, trail-blazing scientist, dared not, for much of his life, announce hisfindings, which proved that the earth is not at the center of everything.Galileo faced persecution by the Church for stating that the earth moves. (AndGalileo was only “forgiven” by the Catholic Church in the second half of thetwentieth century—after four hundred years!)According to Sri Yukteswar, we came out of Kali Yuga (the Dark Age) only in 1700a.d. Since that time, there has been a great surge of awakening. A 200-yearbridge (or sandhya) to the succeeding age of energy, which ancient Indiantradition called Dwapara Yuga, brings us to 1900 a.d., the beginning of Dwaparaproper. Since then we have seen a virtual explosion in human progress.I need hardly recount more than a handful of the inventions that have come tolight in our own times through men like Edison, Tesla, Marconi, and countlessothers: alternate-current electricity; electronic engineering; widespreadtelephonic communication; radio; television; airplane travel; travel to outerspace and the exploration of the moon and Mars; mobile telephones; computers. Ineed hardly speak, moreover, of the contributions made by Albert Einstein,especially with his Law of Relativity.We are, in fact (and not in some hippie, hallucinogenic fancy) living in a newage: an age of energy.We are also seeing the less fortunate consequences of transition from one age toanother: a global struggle between old, restrictive ways of thinking and doingthings, and newer, ever-more expansive ways. Personally, I do not see how thisstruggle can resolve itself peacefully, though we all hope, of course, that itwill do so.There is, alas! violence in the air. Terrorists pretend to have the solution:Blow up everything! create a world-wide “brotherhood” of everyone who is inagreement with them, and blow all the rest to smithereens. People who favorviolence, however, will never be at peace with anyone until they’ve found peacein themselves. The sort of “peace” they envision, if they could indeed bring itabout, would turn out to be a boiling cauldron of hatred, discord, andself-righteous back-and-forth denunciations, all of them ending finally in—well,a play I wrote when I was fifteen said it perfectly: a huge explosion, greaterthan all the rest. And then—Silence.We must seek a peaceful way of resolving our differences. We must becomesolution-conscious, and give up our traditional problem-consciousness.How—I have asked myself—will this book be received: With open minded gratitudefor the common sense it expresses? or with dogmatic blame, outrage, andpersecution? Or will it, perhaps, encounter a mixture of both? The firstreception is what I would greatly prefer. The second would be a great pity formankind itself, never mind what happens to me. The third, I am sorry to say, isthe most likely outcome. I don’t think what I have written will be ignored,though there is always that possibility. If it leads to personal hardship forme, however—well, I am prepared for it. My God is Truth. I have no other.In time, the contest cannot but resolve itself. I myself believe in ParamhansaYogananda’s prediction of “a new world of peace, harmony, and prosperity forall,” when people give up fighting the inevitable and learn to accept, and evento love, one another, and then to work together for the common weal.Then will the Second Coming of Christ become a reality: not necessarily thereturn of Jesus the man, but of the principles for which he stood bravely and,eventually, died on the cross.[9] As evidenced by more than two hundred myths and folk stories from overthirty cultures, according to Giorgio de Santillana, former professor of historyat M.I.T. (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and co-author of the book,Hamlet's Mill."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 23[../Images/flower.jpg]THE MISSING YEARS“Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.“And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom ofthe feast.“And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarriedbehind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.“But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s journey; andthey sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.“And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.“And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple,sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking themquestions.“And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.“And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, whyhast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought theesorrowing.“And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must beabout my Father’s business?“And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.“And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them:but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.“And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.”(Luke 2:41–52)So ends the last Biblical account of the childhood of Jesus. From then onnothing more appears until his apparently sudden arrival on the scene at the ageof thirty. Often and often people have asked the question: What transpiredduring those missing eighteen years? The life of someone so very important asJesus Christ must surely have been combed over again and again, its everyepisode discussed and analyzed. Instead of which . . . nothing? It seems morethan strange: It seems quite impossible.Many have suggested that those “lost years” must have been excised from theBible. The scribes who recorded his story—assuming they did remove thataccount—didn’t dare to substitute for it something of their own creation.Assuming that what we do find is true—that “he went down with them, and came toNazareth, and was subject unto them”—his “subjection” to them can hardly havelasted for eighteen years, considering the “declaration of independence” he madeto them at the age of twelve.It would have been easy for the account to continue, “And he grew to manhood,and worked with his father as a carpenter.” Whoever the scribes were, theydidn’t dare add even that much.Christian tradition does have him working as a carpenter. Jesus, however, seemsflatly to contradict the tradition, for his own words were, “Wist ye not that Imust be about my Father’s business?” After this strong statement, it isunthinkable that he would have simply gone home, remained in the family foreighteen years, and become a common apprentice and journeyman carpenter underJoseph until the age of thirty, and only then commenced his life’s mission. Attwelve he had already told his parents he had God’s work to do. And, as hestrongly implied, he had begun that mission already.Westerners are likely to object, “But twelve is too young for any boy to begin alife mission!” His parents evidently held the same view. It is obvious, however,that Jesus did not hold it, for we find him telling them in no uncertainwords—words very different, moreover, from what one would expect of any child oftwelve—what he must do. Under comparable circumstances, wouldn’t almost anyother child have been overwhelmed with joy seeing his parents again—after threelong days? Jesus reacted as no one could have expected. He didn’t cry, “Mommy!Mommy! You’re here! I’m coming! I’m coming!” and rush to her, flinging his armsemotionally around her knees. In fact, his response seems very suggestive of theanswer he gave on another occasion, many years later:“While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stoodwithout, desiring to speak with him.“Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without,desiring to speak with thee.“But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who aremy brethren?“And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold mymother and my brethren!“For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is mybrother, and sister, and mother.” (Matt. 12:46–50)I am not familiar with Judaic traditions, but from everything I’ve heard about“Jewish mothers” I imagine it would be unthinkable in that tradition for atwelve-year-old child—especially one with a heart so full of love—coolly todeclare his independence from his parents. In that first account he seems almostto have scolded them for finding him! Visualize the scene, and reflect that itoccurred after three whole days. Surely the event was extraordinary.I remember a time when I myself was separated from my parents for only one hour.It was on a ship which was steaming into New York Harbor. I wasn’t twelve, butnevertheless, how differently I reacted: I was panic-stricken! Crowds ofgrown-ups towered all around me, hemming me in. I had no idea where my parentswere. Images formed in my mind of landing all alone in a strange city,inexperienced, and utterly helpless. I freely confess I sobbed desperately. Andwhat a relief it was to find them at last!The only episodes I know that were comparable to this story about Jesus, who wasvirtually renouncing every blood tie to his family, have occurred in the livesof great reincarnated masters.Swami Shankara, in south India, told his mother at the age of six that he wasgoing to renounce the world for God. When she tried, quite naturally, to holdhim, he jumped into a river and allowed himself—so the story goes—to be caughtby a crocodile.“Look, Mother!” he cried. “Either you give me your consent, or I will let thiscrocodile take me. Whatever happens, you won’t have me anymore!”Hastily she gave her permission. And the child, who had been born with divinepower, made the crocodile release him, whereupon his life mission began. Thatmission, interestingly enough, ended also at the age of thirty-three.My Guru recounted this story to me as a historic fact. For those who don’tbelieve it, here is another one which occurred more recently:Swami Pranabananda, a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya—Pranabananda, my Guru told me,attained full liberation in that life—left his body.[10] “In his nextincarnation,” my Guru said, “he left home at the age of six. His purpose, hedeclared, was to join Babaji in the Himalayas.” After a brief pause, my Gurucontinued with a smile, “It caused a lot of commotion in that village at thetime!”Paramhansa Yogananda himself ran away from home at a young age. His olderbrother succeeded in bringing him back, but the seeds of world-renunciation,which had been sprouting from the very beginning of this life, lay deeply buriedin his nature.In the light of spiritual tradition—especially in India, where the lamp ofspirituality has burned brightly for centuries—that declaration by Jesus at theage of twelve, that he must “be about his Father’s business,” was not unique.That he had, moreover, a karmic tie with India had already been indicated by thevisit, soon after his birth, of the three wise men of the East.Clearly then, to start with, those eighteen years must have been deliberatelyomitted from the official account of Christ’s life. For some reason, which wemust explore, people felt it prudent to do so. Evidently, however, as I said, noone dared to insert even one sentence to replace what had been removed.Two vital questions forcibly intrude themselves on this picture: What wasomitted? And, What was the reason for that omission?In 1958, I had an interesting conversation with a prominent spiritual leader inIndia: Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha, the Shankaracharya of Gowardhan Math. Hewas at that time the senior representative of the ancient Shankara Order ofSwamis. Throughout the land people respected him highly as a man of truth andhonor. My own experience with him, which covered many months, supports thatreputation. (I mention these credits to say that what he told me, though Icannot prove it, had the ring of authenticity. I myself accepted it as true.)That much said, let me quote something he told me, as exactly in his own wordsas I can remember them.“Some years ago [he said] I came into possession of one of only three copies ofan ancient document which purported to be an account of the proceedings of oneof the early Councils of Constantinople. [The swami told me the date of thatcouncil, but I forget which one it was.] In that council, the question wasraised as to how the Church should deal with the record, which still existed, ofthe missing eighteen years of Jesus Christ’s life.“The problem raised was that the account might unsettle the faith of devoutChristians, for it stated that Jesus had spent at least a number of those ‘lost’years with great masters in India, to which land he had gone to study with them.The question raised in the council was whether Christians might not be shaken intheir faith if they thought that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, had felt itnecessary to study under anyone. The general feeling of the prelates was thatthe account should be removed, to protect the devotion of the faithful.“At that point,” Bharati Krishna Tirtha continued, “someone in the audience gotup and stated, ‘I am a layman, not a priest, and am aware that it is notcustomary for such as I to speak at these councils. However, I feel I must speakout. What I have to say is, If the apostles themselves were not shaken in theirfaith by this revelation, why should we who truly believe, all of us, that Jesuswas the Son of God, have less trust then they? Surely the simple truth will notin any way diminish his stature in people’s eyes!’ The man’s objection was notconsidered, however, and the account of those eighteen years was forthwithremoved from the Bible.”I cannot vouch for the truth of the above statement. I know that there arerecords in India which support the claim that Jesus lived in that country forseveral years. Accounts have been published describing documents that stillexist in the ancient Tibetan monastery of Himis, in Leh, a province of Ladakh innorthern Kashmir. I will return to these records later in this chapter.Eyewitness accounts by people who have seen them have increased in number eversince 1887, when they were first discovered.Let me first, however, submit what to me is the strongest testimony of all: thefact that Paramhansa Yogananda himself declared many times, as a definite fact,that Jesus Christ did visit India, and that he lived there for some years.I had been with my Guru for just a month when he invited me to his desertretreat at Twenty-Nine Palms, California, where he was dictating his revisedcorrespondence-course lessons. During one evening’s session he stated duringdictation: “The three wise men who came to honor the Christ Child after hisbirth in Bethlehem were the line of gurus who later sent me to the West: Babaji,Lahiri Mahasaya, and Swami Sri Yukteswar.” This was heady stuff, especially fora young neophyte! I’d learned for the first time about yoga, gurus, karma, etc.,only a week before traveling across America to meet him. That meeting had takenplace, as I said, hardly a month earlier. At our meeting I’d begged him toaccept me as a disciple, and—unprecedentedly, as I later learned—was accepted onthe spot. Suddenly, now, I found myself plunged into a completely new way oflife. And here, only one month later, I was listening to this stunningrevelation!I think that perhaps acceptance of this book may depend somewhat on my owncredibility. Let me add, therefore, that this seemingly abrupt change in my lifewas by no means so sudden as it appeared to others—especially to my parents, whoat that time were far away in Egypt, where my father had been transferred to anew post. I had been seeking truth in secret, however, almost desperately foryears. Reading Autobiography of a Yogi had changed my life completely foreverthereafter. So utter was my faith in this new—but anciently familiar—teacher inmy life that, whenever someone represented some teaching to me as being his,even if it seemed strange to me, the only question I asked was, “Did our Gurureally say that?” If the answer was yes, I posed no further questions.So, yes, it was startling to hear that the three wise men had identities whichcould actually be named in our own age. Yet there was something about ParamhansaYogananda that convinced me, as no one else had ever come close to doing, thathe knew the Truth. He fitted exactly something that was said about Jesus: “Neverman spake like this man.” (John 7:46) Yogananda’s words held more thanconviction: they rang with divine truth and wisdom. Unaccountably, when I waswith him, I often felt that I was verily in the presence of God Himself. Thereglowed about him a divine aura. And though some of my readers may dismiss mywords as proof of my simplicity and gullibility, I was in fact, when young,something of a rebel against intellectual authority. I refused to believe anyoneunless I felt convinced, first, that he knew what he was talking about.Yogananda announced to us also, “Jesus, in his youth, paid a return visit toIndia to study under the ‘wise men’ who had come to honor him as a baby.”People may wonder, as those prelates did at the Council of Constantinople ofwhich the Jagadguru Shankaracharya spoke, why an Incarnation of God needed tolearn from anybody. The truth is, as Jesus put it to John the Baptist, “Sufferit to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.” (Matt.3:15)Even though Jesus was indeed one with the true Son of God (the Christconsciousness)—though not, be it noted, the only such Son—he went by that waywhich would “fulfill all righteousness.” God is not miserly about sending hisfully awakened Sons, who have become one with Him, to help His fallen children.Even great incarnations of God, however, have to pass through the usual stagesof infancy, childhood, adolescence, and maturity. If Jesus spoke in the templein such a way that others were “astonished at his understanding and answers,” wemust add that his parents, too, were amazed. In other words, he had been untilthen, in their eyes, a growing child—precocious no doubt, but hardly omniscient!A liberated master, whose mission it is to mix with the public, must comporthimself in such a way as not to impose his wisdom on those who hear him. Hemust, for their sake, seem down to earth and, in that sense, perfectly normal.It would be no help to them were he to overwhelm them with his omniscience ineverything. My own Guru often expressed himself, when I knew him, in such a wayas to make us feel that he didn’t mind disagreement. I often questioned him—moreso, perhaps, than most others, for I’ve always had a questioning mind—and hereplied graciously, though often he telescoped his answer as if to oblige me tomeet him on his own level of intuitive insight. He also said to me, concerninghis own guru, “My master would often end a statement with the words, ‘Don’t youthink so?’ as if to invite us to make an effort to understand him, rather thanreceiving his words passively.”Thus, it was perfectly normal for a great master—indeed, for an avatar likeJesus, which is to say, an Incarnation of God—to assume for a time the slightveil of delusion, as well as the behavior of a normal human being, in order tohelp others, later.I once asked my Guru, “Does an avatar always live in the consciousness ofoneness with God?”He replied, “One never loses, inwardly, the consciousness of being free.”Nothing, in other words, binds his consciousness. We see this freedom inYogananda’s autobiography, despite the lengths to which he went, in humility, tohelp the reader to identify with everything he himself went through.Our Guru told a group of us toward the end of his life, “I went to all thosesaints as a child, hoping to learn from them, but I found they kept askingquestions of me.” They called him, “Chhoto Mahasaya,” which translates not onlyas, “little sir” (as he himself translated the term in his book), but also as,“Little Saint.”In 1887, the Russian writer Nicolas Notovitch discovered in the monastery ofHimis an ancient manuscript which detailed the life of Jesus (called Issa inthat work). It recounts that Issa had traveled there as a young man, and hadlater “preached the holy doctrine in India and among the children of Israel.” Ittells how Jesus (Issa) left home to avoid pressure from his parents, Joseph andMary, to take a wife. Legend has it that he traveled by camel caravan over the“Silk Road,” which was the main passage between the East and the West.Notovitch published a book which became famous in his time, called The UnknownLife of Jesus Christ. In it he described Issa (Jesus) spending time in Puri,Orissa, among the priests at the famous Jagannath Temple. According to thataccount, Jesus got into trouble with the Brahmin pundits, or priests, fordefying the customary proscriptions against members of the lower castes, whom hehimself taught freely. I myself am somewhat inclined to doubt whether Jesus madeso much of an issue of the caste system, or that he tried to reform it. He mayindeed have criticized it, and may thereby have offended those orthodox Brahminswho served as priests in the great temple. As for himself, however, he latersaid, when he began his mission, that that mission was to “the lost sheep of thehouse of Israel.” Still, it must be added that it would not have been out ofkeeping with his nature as we know it had he stood up boldly for the EternalTruth, and therefore spoken out fearlessly against any man-made aberration ofthat truth.A prominent disciple of the great Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Abhedananda, later (in1922) went to Ladakh in order to verify the account by Notovitch, and actuallysucceeded in doing so. Later still, the well-known Russian artist—who wasalready well known as a veritable “Renaissance Man”—Nicholas Roerich (I believeParamhansa Yogananda got to meet him), wrote in 1929 of the many legends he hadheard in Kashmir about the visit of Jesus Christ to that land, and about themanuscripts at Himis monastery.Madam Elisabeth G. Caspari, a Swiss musician, and her husband visited the Himismonastery during the summer of 1939. There the couple also learned from thelibrarian, along with two other monks of that monastery, about the manuscripts,which were shown to them (but were not translated for them).An interesting feature of Jesus’ way of teaching was his doing so in the form ofparables. This method has always been common in India, but it was not common, sofar as I know, among the Jews.It was the destiny of Jesus, as he himself declared, to fulfill his mission inIsrael. Therefore he returned, and came for baptism to John the Baptist, hisdestined guru. Christ’s teaching reflected, however, a much more cosmopolitanoutlook than that of John, who (the Bible tells us) lived “in thewilderness. . . . [and] had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdleabout his loins; and his meat [diet] was locusts and wild honey,” and who, inaddressing some of the more learned of his listeners, would cry out, “Ogeneration of vipers.” (Matt. 3:3,4,7)Do we see in Jesus Christ’s words to Nicodemus, which we quoted earlier—“Verily,verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdomof God”—a hint of teachings to which he’d been exposed in India? I know of notradition in Judaism of being born again in the same body. India, however, doeshave that tradition. Brahmins, if they are indeed true to their divine calling,are described as twice-born in just the sense that Jesus goes on to describe inhis second answer to Nicodemus:“Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enterthe second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?“Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of waterand of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” (John 3:3–5) I’veexplained this inner meaning already: namely, that to be born of water means tobe born into a body, whereas to be born of the Spirit means to be born intospiritual consciousness: to emerge from the chrysalis of ego-consciousness intodivine consciousness—an emergence in which the guru acts as the “midwife.”Do we see, again, in Jesus Christ’s parable of the Prodigal Son a hint of hisown experience of traveling from Israel to India? He himself was no prodigalson, of course, but that beautiful story may have been suggested to him by hisjourneys. In one sense, the possibility that he may have paid a return visit tothe three wise men, to study under them, could have been seen as a “cominghome.” Then again, his return to Israel to carry out his life mission, and hisreceiving formal baptism from his guru John the Baptist, would certainly havebeen a final homecoming. Of course, the story of the Prodigal Son is an allegoryfor the soul’s departure from God into the land of delusion, and of its returnto God after wandering long in the “land of” ignorance. Still, the story itselfcould have been suggested to the mind of Jesus by his own wanderings.(Obviously, I offer this suggestion with no hint of trying to prove anything. Ifind it merely interesting.)The account of Jesus leaving home as a boy to avoid marriage is very much inkeeping with ancient tradition in India. Marriage in Israel, too, was arrangedin those days after a boy reached the age of thirteen.The story is told in south India of the great mauni, or “silent saint,”Sadasiva, who as a young man lived in his parents’ house and spent his time instudying the scriptures and meditating. One day he emerged from his room to findan unusual commotion in the home. Inquiring as to the reason for all thathubbub, he was told, “We are preparing for the arrival of your bride.”(Marriages in olden times, especially in India, were arranged by the parents.)Sadasiva returned to his room and reflected, “If the mere prospect of her comingcan so unsettle my routine, how much worse would her actual ‘in house’ residencehere be!” He slipped out that very night, and never returned.To the average person, such complete non-attachment to home and family seemsextraordinary. Sooner or later, however, everyone, if he would find God, mustdisappoint his family’s expectations of him. All of us came alone into theworld, and will depart it alone. In the end, every soul, in its true essence,must “go on alone.”What, incidentally, of the family of Jesus? It says, “While he yet talked to thepeople, behold, his mother, and his brethren stood without, desiring to speakwith him.” The New Testament also describes James as being a brother of Jesus.Much has been made, especially in the Catholic Church, of his mother Mary havingbeen always a virgin: conceived immaculately, and immaculate forever thereafter.The Catholic Church also encourages devotion to the Virgin Mary, whom it offersas a substitute for the Divine Mother aspect of God. I said earlier that theCosmic Mother represents the AUM vibration, through which one must in fact passin order to reach the unmoving Christ consciousness, which is present in everyparticle of creation.It is true that, by Eastern tradition, one’s so-called “brothers” may also beone’s first cousins—“cousin brother” is an expression one often hears in India.Yet I, personally, see no real problem with praying to the Virgin Mary. I toobelieve she was a virgin when she conceived Jesus, even if she did subsequentlyhave other children. Paramhansa Yogananda said once in a prayer to God, “Thouhast suckled me through many mothers. And this last one was Thyself.” His motherhad eight children, and gave birth to them all by normal means. It is not themere act of procreation that introduces the element of delusion. It isattachment to that act. Yogananda’s most highly advanced disciple, SisterGyanamata, had been married and had had a son. Yet he stated at her funeral, “Ihave searched her life, and have found therein not a single sin, even ofthought.”So to me it seems unnecessary to worry whether Jesus did or did not have actualbrothers. That his mother was holy and, indeed, truly immaculate I thinkeveryone who believes in Jesus Christ agrees. I certainly do.There has always been a tie between Judaism and Hinduism. Strange as it mayseem, that tie is strongest in the insistence of both religions on the existenceof one God. In Judaism, the statement, “Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is One,”is unequivocal. And in Hinduism, the concept of a Supreme Spirit, Brahman,admits of no other. Indeed, by a strange-seeming paradox, the concept of Brahmanis even more absolute in India than in the Judaic concept of Yahweh, or Jehovah.For the Jews have always seen God as separate—even aloof—from themselves.Brahman, however, in Hinduism (and, indeed, in Sanaatan Dharma everywhere) isthe only reality in existence.From this concept arose the justification for the innumerable so-called “gods”of Hinduism, which Judaeo-Christian tradition unjustly condemns. Those “gods”are conceived of in India as aspects, only, of the Undefinable. They areintended as means of awakening devotion to the Supreme, and are far from beingthe “golden calf” so excoriated (and justly so) in Judaism.Idol worship, Yogananda explained, means worshiping anything other than God:money, sex, power, fame, sensory pleasures. That was what the golden calfrepresented, which those Jews worshiped who had fallen into delusion while Moseswas up on the mountain, communing with God. The golden calf symbolized theJewish fetish (which some say continues to this day) with money, wealth, andmaterial security. Jesus himself said:“He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he thatloveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.” (Matt. 10:37) He saidalso:“All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did nothear them.” (John 10:8) Jesus obviously was not referring to the old prophetswho came before him in time, for he also said elsewhere, “Think not that I amcome to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but tofulfill.” (Matt. 5:17) Yogananda explained that Jesus was speaking of himself,as he often did, in the impersonal sense as the Son of God, or Christconsciousness. Those spiritual teachers and teachers of religion, in otherwords, who try to draw people’s devotion to themselves, instead of directing itto God where alone it belongs, are indeed “thieves and robbers.”It is the ego, more even than “gold” and other worldly and false fulfillments,that constitutes the idol most people worship. Christians should understand idolworship in this fundamental sense, and should be especially forgiving ofdevotional images, since they themselves keep images of Jesus on the cross ontheir altars, and also keep many other devotional pictures. Through thecenturies, moreover, Christianity has inspired many glorious works of devotionalart, depicting sacred scenes.Hinduism is a much older religion than Christianity, and, because it was notstarted by any individual but sprang into existence during a higher age whenmany people actually communed with God, it contains many devotional images. Ofsome comfort to Christians may be the fact that Hindus, too, often squabbleamong themselves as to the “one, true” image of God. As Yogananda used to say,“Ignorance, East and West, is fifty-fifty.” In India, too, only true saintsdeserve consideration as the custodians of religion. The competitive spirit onesees everywhere in religion is a manifestation of Kali Yuga. It may still remainsomewhat during ascending Dwapara Yuga, but it will certainly die out throughhigher ages, as man becomes progressively enlightened.The masters are not affected by the great cycles of time. They abide ever inperfect wisdom. Jesus Christ had one mission above all: to teach everyone, andespecially his own Jewish people, that God is One, and that all men, being apart of that Oneness, must seek their highest fulfillment in His love.[10] The account appears in Autobiography of a Yogi."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 24[../Images/flower.jpg]CONCLUSIONThis is the final chapter of our book—which I feel I’ve written with you, andnot only for you. I was praying, “What should I say, Lord, to finish off anylast doubts that might be lingering in the reader’s mind?” And then one of myfavorite “spirituals” came to mind:Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen.Nobody knows but Jesus.And I realized that I’ve said so much about the impersonal aspect of Christ’slife that you might feel robbed of that dear, personal side of him, with whom wecan all share our moments of sorrow, our troubles, and our difficulties. If so,I should be very sorry, for that conclusion would be wrong in terms not only ofhuman needs, but also of my own feelings, and of cosmic truth itself.Here’s an illustration Yogananda used: Think of a funnel, narrowing down to itssmall end in you; the other end widening out to infinity. Yes, that’s not, initself, a personal image: I realize that funnels have no feelings. (Well, I’vesaid that everything is conscious, so I suppose one could make a case forfunnels being conscious! Even so, I admit it’s a stretch.) So let’s just placeit in the background of our mental picture, and think of Jesus, the man, talkingto us, consoling us, smiling at us with sweet, loving sympathy, interest, andconcern. Behind him, his consciousness, and also the love he expresses, widenoutward to infinity. Nevertheless, they have also a narrow focus: in him as aman, and in you and me, as human beings.God, I said, is both infinite and infinitesimal. What makes divine love andJesus Christ’s love impersonal is only this: God wants nothing from you or me.Our human feelings, however, our human needs, our joys and our griefs: you and Ias human beings mean as much to Him as they do to us! For, in Truth, He is inus!God created everything from within. He became you! “He wants nothing from you,”Yogananda used to say to us, “except your love.” You are already as close to Himas the greatest saint and master that ever lived. In that sense, indeed, theProtestant boast, “We’re all saints!” is valid. The only difference between youand Jesus Christ himself is that you are still—one supposes—a Prodigal Son,wandering in the land of delusion. Your thoughts and energies roam still, faraway from your true Self. Within yourself, however, dwells the living Christ.That is why Jesus said, “Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for,behold, the kingdom of God is within you.” (Luke 17:21)Jesus didn’t come on earth to show people how great he was. He came to show ushow great we ourselves are, in our divine potential.Many years ago, during a visit I made to Australia, a man came up to me after alecture and said, “I heard you speaking quite a lot about God. Well, I’m anatheist. What have you got to say to me that would interest me?”I paused hardly a second in silent prayer, then answered, “Why don’t you thinkof God as the highest potential you can imagine for yourself?”For a moment, he was surprised into silence. Then, with a rather pleased, thoughself-deprecating, grin he replied, “Yeah, well, I guess I can live with that!”God cares, you see, for you—for your smallest thoughts and feelings. In thatcaring, however, He invites you to look at yourself also impersonally: to seethose thoughts and feelings as windows onto infinity; to see the self that youare now as also the tip of a funnel, which reaches upward and outward, andbecomes lost in infinite skies. Those “skies” are impersonal in the sense onlythat they ask nothing of you. Their influence, however, would draw you out ofyour petty ego to the realization that love itself, divine love, cannot remainconfined forever in your little cup of human consciousness.St. Paul wrote to the Corinthians: “When I was a child, I spake as a child, Iunderstood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put awaychildish things.” (I Cor. 13:11)He went on to speak of a future time when he would see God face to face: “Thenshall I know even as also I am known.” God knows us, and loves us, not only aswe know ourselves, and as we are in ourselves, but also as we are in truth, inour very own, divine potential.I once read a story of a Catholic nun in Europe who escaped Communistpersecution. It was a dramatic and beautiful account. My only clear memory ofit, however, is that she kept a small devotional picture in her pocket, and keptpatting that pocket lovingly for reassurance during every harrowing experience.Sweet, touching, and, yes, inspiring! To one who loves God, God becomes in asense a lovingly prized possession, something we can hold in our hands;something, above all, we can hold in our hearts.The impersonal side should be kept ever in mind, lest we trivialize God. To loveHim personally, however, is nevertheless a good beginning.I used, in the beginning of my spiritual journey, to pray silently to my Guru,“Teach me to love you as you love me.”One day he looked at me deeply and said, “How can the little cup hold the wholeocean?” I understood him. We must seek ever to enter and expand ourconsciousness into the great ocean of divine love. As Jesus said,“He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sakeshall find it.” (Matt. 10:39)Most people, however, are not ready to think of dissolving their egos in God,and that weakness was what Jesus meant to address here. The wonderful thingabout true spirituality, as opposed to formal religion, is that its teachingsmake no absolute demands of anyone. Wherever you are right now, whethergeographically or on your own level of consciousness, that is where God willmeet you if you call to Him with a sincere heart.I read a novel years ago about a man who gave his life to God, and “of course”(such was the author’s shallow understanding) became wholly disillusioned in theend. We live in an age of experimentation, so why not try this experiment onyourself? See whether God will not listen, and also answer you. He is with youevery moment of your life—“Nearest of the near, Dearest of the dear,” my Guruused to say. Just try the following experiment:Think of God in the second person: “You,” not He. Don’t look up and repeatformal prayers in a hymnal or prayer book. Talk to Him in the language of yourown heart. Share with Him your every thought, your every feeling. Talk to Jesusin that way, and to Mary, and to the saints. Say, “This person has hurt medeeply, Lord. What shall I do about it?” Or say, “I’m off to work now, Jesus. Bewith me today. Guide my thoughts, that they be pleasing to you.” Say “You”—not“Thou,” which isn’t any longer the way we speak in daily life. Talk to him as aFriend, a Father, a Mother, even as your own utterly Beloved.One of the great mistakes people make is to think, when God answers them in someparticular aspect, that that aspect defines Him entirely as He is. He is allthings. He could come to you as a Sacred Crocodile if that happened to be howyou loved Him (though I can’t really imagine anyone really loving Him in thatform!). To be serious, I think you might find some one person who inspires you,and imagine God in that form.My own godfather’s wife had a sweet, motherly expression. I used, first, tovisualize her as my Divine Mother, since no other image came to mind thatinspired me. (My own mother’s face might have done it for me, except that I hadknown her in too many ordinary, familial circumstances, whereas I rarely saw mygodfather’s wife.) It served me well, for starters. Gradually my visualizationstook me beyond human forms altogether, and I felt my Divine Mother everywhere,behind all forms, real and imaginary.Whatever form you choose, see to it only that you don’t become narrow orfanatical. In India, many people have almost come to blows over whether Godshould be worshiped as Vishnu, Shiva, Kali, Durga, Krishna, or Rama, or as thenon-dual Absolute. To climb a mountain—as their own sages have many timespointed out—you can ascend it from the south, the north, the east, or the west.The important thing is to get to the top.Try simply talking with God, therefore—not to Him, and not at Him, but with Him.Think, when you go for a walk, “Your energy is powering my legs.” If you hear adog barking in the distance, ask God, “Is there something You want to tell methrough that bark?” A materialist would of course answer, “That dog is barkingwith its own interests in mind. Why take it personally?” But God is everywhere.He can speak to you consciously through all things, if you will listen not onlywith your mind, but with your heart.God is in every person you meet. It would be a good practice, while walking downany city street, to look at every passerby and think of him or her as God inthat form. Then tell yourself, “He (or she), too, wants what I want: happiness.”He/she may visualize that fulfillment as a new job, or a raise in salary, or awife or a husband, or children, or as any of the innumerable things people yearnfor everywhere on earth, in the expectation that they’ll find happiness throughthem. Look at them more deeply, however, and remind yourself, “What their soulsreally want is divine bliss, which is only masquerading as human happiness. Inthat yearning, they are all my brothers and sisters, even if in their presentintentions they are misguided.” Talk to God about them in your heart. Ask Him tobless them. In time, with this practice, you will come to think of all life as agreat, glorious symphony, blending all creatures together in wonderful, flowingchords, rhythms, and melodies of divine aspiration.Don’t tell anyone about this practice. If you do so, that outward flow of energywill drain your inner treasure, and may dilute it with other people’s cynicism,lack of comprehension, or prosaic matter-of-factness.One challenge that people will fling at you is, “So what, exactly, do you meanwhen you say that God answers you? Are you suggesting He performs miracles? Andare you really going to say that you believe in the miracles of Jesus Christ?Come off it! Things like that just don’t happen!”Don’t they? I lived with a true man of God, and saw things many people would saywere impossible. But I learned that these are not things to speak about openly.I learned my lesson one day, after a gathering in Beverly Hills. I had beeninvited there to perform yoga postures at a Jewish Bar Mitzvah. Afterward, amaterialistic Jewish psychiatrist cornered me and challenged my beliefs. Idefended them as reasonably as I could, and then, to clinch my argument, spokeof certain miracles to which I’d been a witness. It did no good at all. In fact,I could see the thought forming in his mind, “Perhaps I could find time for this‘patient’ next Wednesday morning.”A few days later, I served lunch for my Guru and several guests, and followedthe meal with a short demonstration of yoga postures. After the guests haddeparted, I sat alone at the table for a few minutes with my Guru. During ourconversation he paused briefly, then commented, “By the way, when you are withatheists and materialists, don’t speak to them of miracles.”“You knew!” I exclaimed.Looking at me deeply, he replied, “I know every single thought you think.”Often, during our time together, he demonstrated the truth of that extraordinarystatement.Let me address rather, then, the question: How are so-called miracles evenpossible? (I speak of them as “so-called,” because nothing is miraculous,really, in the sense of naturally impossible. Were someone today able to travelbackward in time, and appear to people four hundred years ago, and were he totell them of the wonders of radio and television, he would probably be locked upas a lunatic.)I have spoken of the scientifically proved fact that matter exists only asvibrations of energy. Yogananda’s dictum, “The greater the will, the greater theflow of energy,” provides a clue as to how that energy itself was brought intomanifestation: It was by an act of divine will, outwardly projected.God, the Supreme Spirit, willed creation into existence. First, what Hemanifested were thought forms—ideas for the further manifestation of Hiscreation. Those ideas might be compared to an architect’s blueprint. When Godsaw “that it was good,” He projected those ideas further outward (workingthrough already-manifested beings) by His divine will, manifesting energy.The astral world, which most people think of as heaven, is actually a universeof energy. It is much larger, Swami Sri Yukteswar said, than the materialuniverse. Finally, God (again, through higher beings) vibrated that astralenergy still more grossly, to produce the material universe.Incidentally, Yogananda explained that the reason God said, “Let us make man inour image, after our likeness.” (Gen. 1:26) was that God created man throughactual, highly exalted beings.Is there, or will there ever be, the prospect of some even-denser manifestationof the divine will than the material? In my understanding, there can never be,for that which conceals divine freedom in an appearance of complete inertia(that is to say, in dull matter) permits no further descent. Never mind abouthell: In a sense we live in hell already. This is not to say that no actual,astral hell exists, for indeed there is such a hell also.When the thick walls of flesh are removed at death, human feelings and emotionsare released from their narrow confinement in a body into a far lesscircumscribed essence, which, if one’s feelings are dark, can lead to sufferingfar more intense than people ever know on earth (though it brings a release intofar greater joy, for those who ascend to the astral heavens). Fortunately, theexperience of hell is not permanent, for the germ of divinity is centered everin each soul, however much that soul may be covered over with the impurities oflust, avarice, passion, anger, jealousy, hatred, or other dark emotions. Godcondemns no one to hell, even temporarily. People condemn themselves by theviolence of their own self-created thoughts and emotions.Back, then, to the subject of miracles: Anyone who becomes even somewhat awareof the subtle energies within him can direct those energies in ways that, tomost people, will seem miraculous. These are really only workings of NaturalLaw; nothing about them is really miraculous. Nevertheless, when one has becomefully conscious of the upward flow of that inner energy, he can effortlesslyperform feats which, to the ordinary person, would seem impossible.When the energy flows upward with kundalini from the sacral center in the spine,the swadisthan, which controls the water “element” or elemental stage ofmanifestation (described as “water” because the energy in that center manifestsfluidity), the yogi who has “opened” this center can walk on water. That waswhat Sadhu Haridas did in that boat with the Christian missionary.When the energy flows upward from the heart or dorsal center (the anahat chakra,which is also the “air” center), he can levitate—as St. Theresa of Avila did,much against her own will, anxious as she was not to make a spectacle ofherself.All the yoga teachings caution people never to display these powers unless theyfeel a divine sanction from within. The caution is given to protect the aspiringyogi from falling into spiritual pride. The great master Sri Ramakrishnacautioned his disciples on the subject of spiritual pride, saying, “Ordinarypride is relatively easy to dispose of, for in the realm of relativity no stateof mind ever lasts for long. Pride is soon followed, therefore, by a fall, or byopposing forces which produce inner conflict and unhappiness. The foundation ofworldly pride is no more substantial than a bubble. Spiritual pride, however, isfounded on something real, and it can take the spiritual aspirant incarnationsto come out of it.”Give back to God, therefore, everything He gives to you. Don’t hug it toyourself—an act which would mean only affirming it as something possessed byyour ego. Jesus said, indeed, in two combined verses that my Guru often quoted:“Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, orsisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’ssake, and the gospel’s, But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time,houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, withpersecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.” (Matt. 19:29 and Mark10:29,30) Only Mark added that part about persecution, but Yogananda alwaysstressed this word also, for, he said, “No one who gives his life wholly to Godcan escape Satan’s displeasure.” The real riches one receives from God are also,in part, the necessary riches of this world, for one does find himselfsustained, and never abandoned, who clings to God.I must add, however, to that word “persecution,” that abandonment by God cansometimes seem total. God’s tests can be very hard. Nevertheless, I say thiswith the conviction born of experience: God does not abandon His own. His own,moreover, are all those who place their lives without reservation in His hands.As the Bhagavad Gita says, “O Arjuna, know this for a certainty: My devotee isnever lost.” Christ’s promise of abundance is not limited to heavenly rewards.It is fulfilled also in this life. All one’s earthly needs are fulfilled, evento overflowing.He added to the above verses in both gospels, “But many that are first shall belast; and the last shall be first.” How many long-term devotees on the spiritualpath claim precedence over newcomers with the smug statement, “Don’t you think Iought to know better? I have been following these teachings much longer than youhave!” Yogananda often quoted those words also to remind his disciples that whatmatters is not seniority, rank, or years on the spiritual path, but theintensity of one’s own dedication. He added, “Hold nothing back from God. Giveto Him everything you have, and everything you are.”Materialists, inevitably, will respond to the promise of God’s abundance, “Oh,yeah?” and, “How?” and, “What about all the starving poor in the world? Whatabout their sufferings? What about the massive cataclysms, which impersonallyclaim both the virtuous and the sinful?”Paramhansa Yogananda asks the following question in his book, The Rubaiyat ofOmar Khayyam Explained: “Is life so difficult to understand? Well, of course itis! If it were easy to grasp the drift and purpose of this spectacle, how wellwould that speak for the skill of the Dramatist? The Divine Playwright hasconcealed the nature of His plot—which is, in itself, straightforward—behindendless subplots and complexities. He has cloaked the wonderful ending of theplay behind a network of confusing hints and plausible-seeming, but false,explanations for the events taking place. It is a story wrought withincalculable skill, its true purpose concealed with sublimest artistry behindmyriads of tragic and comic secondary plots.“The whole meaning of the story comes clear in the end. When the soul attainsSelf-realization and eternal freedom, it understands, and then, ‘with clappingwings,’ it applauds enthusiastically.“Someday God will lift for all of us—each one in turn—the heavy curtain ofillusion, and play out for each of us the final scene of His Divine Drama. Whenthis happens, the glorious ending that He had in mind from the beginning will berevealed to us at last.”Ah, what a sublime work Yogananda created with his explanation of that truescripture. Omar Khayyam’s poem seems, on the surface, to be a mere love song. Intruth, it is a timeless and great scripture.Yes, God tests those who love Him. Look at Job—not for comfort, to be sure, butto stiffen your spine with divine courage! And yet, there is another truth tokeep in mind always: Jesus promised to send “the Comforter.” I’ll discussYogananda’s explanation of that meaning in a moment. First, let me point out animportant truth: No one who has found God has ever cried out, “What adisappointment!” All who know Him have been overwhelmed with oceanic joy.Sister Gyanamata, whom I mentioned toward the end of the last chapter, was onher deathbed, about to leave her body. The last words she uttered, ecstatically,were, “What joy! Oh, too much joy!”Such, in the end, is the experience of every soul. Moses was not allowed toenter the Promised Land. That prohibition applied, however, only to Moses theman. Though a fully enlightened soul, his human ego had to leave even itselfbehind before his soul could enter into the true Promised Land: the innerKingdom of God. And only those who had been born out of bondage—soul qualitiessuch as pure love, self-surrender to God, and universal compassion—were allowedto enter in. Every ego-born characteristic, on the other hand, no matter hownoble, had first to die before the “chosen people”—those qualities of our naturewhich we raise wholly toward God—could fulfill their divine destiny.People don’t see beyond the veil. Someone dies, and his friends and loved onescry, “Poor soul!” They’ve no idea what his present state is. Death is nothing,in itself. It is a matter of merely stepping out of one’s costume when the playis over, and returning to one’s other, more normal life.Life is not the horror show they imagine it to be who “keep all their eggs inthe one basket” of life on earth. The materialists want materialistic answers totheir intellectual doubts and challenges. It doesn’t always work that way. Ispeak with some experience on this point. God doesn’t always give you what youwant, but if you live for Him sincerely, you will find that God gives yousomething much better than you ever imagined. In other words, the system works.Why not try it?Modern man believes in the value of experimentation. Very well, why not submitthis truth to the test of your own experience? I challenge you! Yoganandachallenges you! It is high time those materialists were driven, mumbling, intothe cobwebbed corner where they belong!The spiritual path, which is true Christianity, is endlessly satisfying. Peopleimagine shriveled-up nuns and monks, “meek” priests and pastors, all of themforever deprecating themselves (to the ultimate exasperation of all), andemotionally starved “faithful”—like a certain classmate of mine in college withthe appropriate name, Coffin, who would gaze at us lugubriously as he asked us,“Have you been saved?” People like that find “inspiration” in judging anyonedourly who doesn’t see things just the way they do.Let us consider that word, “meek.” Jesus said in the Beatitudes, “Blessed arethe meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” (Matt. 5:5) Looking at the blessingthat follows upon meekness, one sees that by “meek” Jesus couldn’t have meantthe somewhat hangdog expression so many Christians assume in their efforts to behumble. Those people alone “inherit the earth” who work with it harmoniously,instead of trying arrogantly to wrest from it the treasures they want. Blessed,then, are those who live in harmony. That has to be what Jesus meant.True religion means to live a spiritual life. Living such a life, however, neednot necessarily mean being religious. The outer trappings and ceremonies offormal religion serve a valid purpose, if they help one in his search for aninner life. Spirituality, however, is the true and only goal offered in thehighest teachings of every true scripture.Jesus promised to send the Comforter. What did he mean? When the Comforter came,it was on the day of Pentecost. Let us read the account:“And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord inone place.“And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and itfilled all the house where they were sitting.“And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat uponeach of them.“And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with othertongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.” (Acts 2:1–4)The “rushing mighty wind” is a manifestation of the cosmic AUM, the Holy Ghost,or Holy Spirit. The sound of that Cosmic Vibration is supremely comforting. Itplays on the harp strings, so to speak, of one’s very being. Earthly sounds,even the most beautiful of them, become tiresome in time, and, indeed,irritating if we hear them for too long. When one hears the sound of AUM,however, he knows with utter certainty that he could never tire of it throughall eternity, for it is the vibration of his very being. Many times, whilewriting this book, I have been entranced to hear that sound within and aroundme, as if in divine corroboration and approval of what I had written.The tongues of fire have an esoteric meaning which I will suggest to the readerthat he look up in the edition of Paramhansa Yogananda’s book, The Second Comingof Christ. That volume, heavily edited as it is, and somewhat difficult to read,will bestow on the serious student great blessings, and he will find his effortsrichly repaid.The speaking in tongues comes indeed as a power bestowed in communion with theHoly Ghost. All languages are expressions of AUM. If, sometime, in a foreigncountry, you find yourself up against an alien tongue, try to tune in to it fromwithin, instead of worrying too anxiously, outwardly, about the complexities ofa strange grammar. You will quickly find those complexities resolving themselvesin a surprising simplicity.My own efforts in this direction have not been accompanied consciously by innercommunion with AUM, but I have tried to tune in to those languages from within,and have found that they come with surprising ease. Natives of the countriesI’ve been in have often thought I was their countryman. One day in Calcutta Iwas speaking on the street with my driver before going into a shop. A passerby,hearing me talk and seeing my white skin, later asked the driver inastonishment, “Is he Bengali?” No, I don’t speak good Bengali, but at least Ihave the vibration of it down pretty well.I have heard self-styled “Pentecostals” speaking in what they called “tongues.”To anyone who knows languages it sounds like gibberish. No language on earthcould be so starved of variety in its syllables! Yogananda spoke of “the unholyghost of emotions.” Really to commune with the Comforter is to listen calmly, inmeditation, to AUM. That sound, as one listens, gives supreme comfort to thesoul. Doctor Lewis, Yogananda’s first Kriya Yoga disciple in America, quoted theGuru to us in telling the following story:“Master had said to me, ‘When you are in AUM, nothing can touch you.’“One day I was out sailing in a boat off Martha’s Vineyard when suddenly a greatstorm arose. It threatened to capsize our boat, and I thought we were ‘goners.’And then I remembered Master’s words. I gazed up into the light, and suddenly Iknew we were safe. [The inner light is a primary manifestation of the CosmicVibration.]“When I got home, and just as I walked in the door, the phone rang. Master wason the other end of the line. He said to me, ‘You came near getting wet, Doctor,didn’t you?’”There is a technique for listening to the AUM sound. Although I am not free toinclude it in the pages of this book, I urge every reader to consider veryseriously the thought of learning and practicing this technique.Jesus said, “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I inhim, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.“If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; andmen gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.“If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and itshall be done unto you.” (John 15:5–7)I have used elsewhere the illustration of the sounding board. This image,coupled with the Comforter, and with the image Jesus gives here of the vine andits branches, may help to clarify for everyone an eternal truth. AUM, the HolyGhost, is the sounding board. The Christ consciousness is the vine of which allof us are branches. If one will act in the thought of being united to CosmicTruth (the vine, the sounding board, the Eternal Comforter) he will know thatGod and Jesus Christ are always with him, and that he has no further need ofanything else, anywhere.Communion with the Holy Ghost is, above all, a means of entering into, andflowing with, the stream of divine love. Love God, therefore. As a trueChristian, love Jesus as your divine friend, who came down to earth for yourupliftment. The more you tune in to his deep message, the more also you willknow that only one thing matters in life: selfless, divine love, like that of aneternal child for his Heavenly Father, and for his Divine Friend."},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHORmaster.tif [../Images/master_opt.jpeg]“As a bright light shining in the midst of darkness, so was Yogananda’s presencein this world.

In 1920 he movedto the United States to begin what was to develop into a worldwide work touchingmillions of lives. Americans were hungry for India’s spiritual teachings, andfor the liberating techniques of yoga.In 1946 he published what has become a spiritual classic and one of thebest-loved books of the twentieth century, Autobiography of a Yogi. In addition,Yogananda established headquarters for a worldwide work, wrote a number of booksand study courses, gave lectures to thousands in most major cities across theUnited States, wrote music and poetry, and trained disciples. He was invited tothe White House by Calvin Coolidge, and he initiated Mahatma Gandhi into KriyaYoga, his most advanced technique of meditation.Yogananda’s message to the West highlighted the unity of all religions, and theimportance of love for God combined with scientific techniques of meditation."},{"pageContent":"swami in India bw.tif [../Images/swami%20in%20India%20bw_opt.jpeg]“Swami Kriyananda is a man of wisdom and compassion in action, truly one of theleading lights in the spiritual world today.”—Lama Surya Das, Dzogchen Center, author of Awakening The Buddha WithinSwami KriyanandaA prolific author, accomplished composer, playwright, and artist, and aworld-renowned spiritual teacher, Swami Kriyananda refers to himself simply as“a humble disciple” of the great God-realized master, Paramhansa Yogananda.
