Many of the religious and philosophical concepts and methods he introduced decades ago are now finding expression in education, psychology, business, medicine, and other spheres of endeavor — contributing in far-reaching ways to a more integrated, humane, and spiritual vision of human life. The fact that Paramahansa Yoganandaji's teachings are being inter- preted and creatively applied in many different fields, as well as by exponents of diverse philosophical and metaphysical movements, points not only to the great practical utility of what he taught, but also to the need for some means of ensuring that the spiritual legacy he left not be diluted, fragmented, or distorted with the passing of time. With the increasing variety of sources of information about Paramahansa Yogananda, readers sometimes inquire how they can be certain that a publication accurately presents his life and teachings. In response to these inquiries, we would like to explain that Paramahansaji founded Yogoda Satsanga Society of India/Self- Realization Fellowship to disseminate his teachings and to preserve their purity and integrity for future generations. He personally chose and trained those close disciples who head the Yogoda Satsanga Society/Self-Realization Fellowship Publications Council, and gave them specific guidelines for the preparation and publishing of his lec- tures, writings, and Yogoda Satsanga Lessons. The members of the YSS/SRF Publications Council honor these guidelines as a sacred trust, in order that the universal message of this beloved world teacher may live on in its original power and authenticity. The Yogoda Satsanga Society of India/Self-Realization Fellowship name and the YSS/SRF emblem (shown above) were originated by Paramahansaji to identify the organization he founded to carry on his worldwide spiritual and humanitarian work. These appear on all YSS/SRF books, audio and video recordings, films, and other publica- tions, assuring the reader that the work originates with the organiza- tion founded by Sri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda and faithfully conveys his teachings as he himself intended they be given.

The year was 1931. As I stood at the back of the crowded auditorium, I became transfixed, unaware of anything around me except the speaker and his words. My whole being was ab- sorbed in the wisdom and divine love that were pouring into my soul and flooding my heart and mind. I could only think, \"This man loves God as I have always longed to love Him. He knows God. Him I shall follow.\" And from that moment, I did. As I felt the transfiguring power of his words on my own life during those early days with Paramahansaji, there arose within me a feeling of the urgent need to preserve his words for all the world, for all time. It became my sacred and joyous privilege, during the many years I was with Paramahansa Yogananda, to record his lectures and classes, and also many informal talks and words of personal counsel—truly a vast treasure-house of won- drous wisdom and God-love. As Gurudeva spoke, the rush of his inspiration was often reflected in the swiftness of his speech; he might speak without pause for minutes at a time, and continue for an hour. While his hearers sat enthralled, my pen was flying! As I took down his words in shorthand, it was as though a special grace had descended, instantly translating the Guru's voice into the shorthand characters on the page. Their transcription has been a blessed task that continues to this day. Even after such a long time—some of my notes are more than forty years old—when I start to transcribe them, they are miraculously fresh in my mind, as though they had been XV"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xvi JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION recorded yesterday. I can even hear inwardly the inflections of Gurudeva's voice in each particular phrase. The Master seldom made even the slightest preparation for his lectures; if he prepared anything at all, it might consist of a factual note or two, hastily jotted down. Very often, while rid- ing in the car on the way to the temple, he would casually ask one of us: \"What is my subject today?\" He would put his mind on it, and then give the lecture extemporaneously from an in- ner reservoir of divine inspiration. The subjects for Gurudeva's sermons at the temples were set and announced in advance. But sometimes his mind was working in an entirely different vein when he began to speak. Regardless of the \"subject for today,\" the Master would voice the truths engrossing his consciousness at that moment, pouring forth priceless wisdom in a steady stream from the abundance of his own spiritual experience and intuitive perception. Nearly always, at the close of such a service, a number of people would come forward to thank him for having enlightened them on a problem that had been troubling them, or perhaps for having explained some philosophical concept in which they were par- ticularly interested. Sometimes, while he was lecturing, the Guru's conscious- ness would be so uplifted that he would momentarily forget the audience and converse directly with God; his whole being would be overflowing with divine joy and intoxicating love. In these high states of consciousness, his mind completely at one with the Divine Consciousness, he inwardly perceived Truth, and described what he saw. On occasion, God appeared to him as the Divine Mother, or in some other aspect; or one of our great Gurus, or other saints, would manifest in vision before him. At such times, even the audience would feel deeply the special blessing bestowed on all present. During such a visita- tion of Saint Francis of Assisi, whom Gurudeva deeply loved, the Master was inspired to compose the beautiful poem, \"God! God! God!\" The Bhagavad Gita describes an enlightened master in these words: \"The Self shines forth like a sun in those who have ban- ished ignorance by wisdom\" (V: 16). One might have been over- awed by Paramahansa Yogananda's spiritual radiance, were it not"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"PREFACE xvii for his warmth and naturalness, and a quiet humility, which put everyone instantly at ease. Each person in the audience felt that Gurudeva's talk was addressed to him personally. Not the least of the Master's endearing qualities was his understanding sense of humor. By some choice phrase, gesture, or facial ex- pression he would bring forth an appreciative response of hearty laughter at just the right moment to drive home a point, or to re- lax his listeners after long and intense concentration on a par- ticularly deep subject. One cannot convey in the pages of a book the uniqueness and universality of Paramahansa Yogananda's vivid, loving per- sonality. But it is my humble hope, in giving this brief back- ground, to afford a personal glimpse that will enrich the reader's enjoyment and appreciation of the talks presented in this book. To have seen my Gurudeva in divine communion; to have heard the profound truths and devotional outpourings of his soul; to have recorded them for the ages; and now to share them with all—what joy is mine! May the Master's sublime words open wider the doors to unshakable faith in God, to deeper love for that One who is our beloved Father, Mother, and Eternal Friend. DAYA MATA Los Angeles, California July 1975 • • • Decades have now passed since Paramahansa Yogananda gave the talks presented in this series of anthologies, in which Journey to Self-realization is the third volume. The years have brought recognition of the timelessness in the outreach of his far-sighted, practical wisdom, which penetrates into the deep- est realms of spirituality—transcending every boundary of country and creed, speaking universally to the spiritual needs of a newly emerging global civilization. In one of the discourses in Man's Eternal Quest, the first"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xviii JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION volume in this series, Paramahansaji says: \"The one purpose of Self-Realization Fellowship [Yogoda Satsanga Society] is to teach the individual the way to personal contact with God.\" That personal divine communion, the heartbeat of his spiritual legacy, is the paramount theme in this third anthology as well. As we approach the dawn of a new millennium, it is clear that humankind's truest hope lies in those who take the time to find the tremendous love and understanding awaiting dis- covery in the presence of God in our souls, directing its flow therefrom as a healing balm toward all the members of our world family. How tangibly those blessings radiated from the person of my revered Guru. In public, even strangers on the street would be irresistibly drawn to respectfully inquire: \"Who is he? Who is that man?\" In his presence during periods of deep meditation, we saw him completely enraptured in communion with the Di- vine. The whole room would be filled with an aura of God's love. Paramahansaji had attained the highest goal of life's jour- ney; his example and words now illumine the path for millions worldwide. All of us are on the same sacred journey, to a destination as yet perhaps only dimly glimpsed—a journey of discovery that will gradually unfold before us, revealing all along the way new gifts and graces of the soul. In time, it will lead us to the full realization of who we truly are: not the outward form that cloaks us, but an immutable spark of the Infinite Spirit. My prayer is that each reader find in these pages a profoundly em- powering vision of that divine destiny, and a new awareness of the joy that is inherent in the journey itself.

To the myriad complexities of human existence, he brings clarity and compas- sionate wisdom, opening before us a larger, more far-seeing vision of who we are and where we are going. \"Self-realization,\" Paramahansa Yogananda tells us, \"is the knowing—in body, mind, and soul—that we are one with the omnipresence of God; that we do not have to pray that it come to us, that we are not merely near it at all times, but that God's omnipresence is our omnipresence,- that we are just as much a part of Him now as we ever will be. All we have to do is improve our knowing.\" This book explores how to \"improve our knowing\"—how we can experience the Divine Presence, within us and in all life, not just as a passing inspiration but as a constant inner realization. Through this expanded awareness, we receive the gifts of the soul: peace, love, intuitive guidance, ever new joy— an unfolding understanding that we are indeed \"made in the image of God.\" This is the third anthology of talks and essays by Parama- hansa Yogananda—a sequel to Man's Eternal Quest (1975) and The Divine Romance (1986). The wisdom in these volumes is not the studied learning of a scholar; it is the empirical testi- mony of a dynamic spiritual personage whose life was filled with inner joy and outer accomplishment, a world teacher who lived what he taught, a Premavatar whose sole desire was to share God's wisdom and love with all. As a man of God, and as an authority on the ancient divine science of Yoga, Paramahansa Yogananda has received the high- est credentials from his spiritual contemporaries, and from readers of his works in all parts of the world—the literary and xix"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"xx JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION general public as well as his followers. That he has also re- ceived the ultimate commendation from the Supreme Author- ity is amply attested to by the manifest blessings of God on his exemplary life, and by the infinitely beautiful, uniquely edifying responses given to him by God in vision and divine communion. This comment in Review of Religions, published by Co- lumbia University Press, is typical of the acclaim accorded Paramahansa Yogananda's earlier work, Autobiography of a Yogi: \"There has been nothing before, written in English or in any other European language, like this presentation of Yoga.\" The San Francisco Chronicle wrote: \"Yogananda presents a convincing case for Yoga, and those who 'came to scoff' may remain 'to pray.'\" From Schleswig-Holsteinische Tagespost, Germany: \"We must credit this book with the power to bring about a spiritual revolution.\" Of Paramahansa Yogananda himself, Swami Sivananda, founder of the Divine Life Society, Rishikesh, India, said: \"A rare gem of inestimable value, the like of whom the world is yet to witness, Paramahansa Yogananda has been an ideal rep- resentative of the ancient sages and seers, the glory of India.\" His Holiness the Shankaracharya of Kanchipuram, revered spiritual leader of millions in South India, wrote of Parama- hansaji: \"As a bright light shining in the midst of darkness, so was Yogananda's presence in this world. Such a great soul comes on earth only rarely, when there is a real need among men. We are grateful to Yogananda for spreading Hindu phi- losophy in such a wonderful way in America and the West.\" Paramahansa Yogananda was born in Gorakhpur, India, on January 5, 1893. He had a remarkable childhood that clearly indicated his life was marked for a divine destiny. His mother recognized this and encouraged his noble ideals and spiritual aspirations. When he was only eleven, the loss of his mother, whom he loved above all else in this world, made firm his in- herent resolve to find God and to receive from the Creator Himself the answers yearned for in every human heart. He became a disciple of the great fnanavatar (incarnation of wisdom) Sri Sri Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri. Sri Yukteswar was one of a line of exalted gurus, with whom Yoganandaji"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xxi had been linked from birth: Sri Yogananda's parents were disciples of Sri Sri Lahiri Mahasaya, guru of Sri Yukteswar. When Paramahansaji was an infant in his mother's arms, Lahiri Mahasaya had blessed him and foretold: \"Little mother, thy son will be a yogi. As a spiritual engine, he will carry many souls to God's kingdom.\" Lahiri Mahasaya was a disciple of Sri Sri Mahavatar Babaji, the deathless master who revived in this age the ancient science of Kriya Yoga . Praised by Bhagavan Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, and by Patanjali in the Yoga Su- tras, Kriya Yoga is both a transcendent technique of meditation and an art of living that leads to union of the soul with God. Mahavatar Babaji revealed the sacred Kriya to Lahiri Ma- hasaya, who handed it down to Sri Yukteswar, who taught it to Paramahansa Yogananda. After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Sri Yoga- nanda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable Swami Order. Two years later, he began his life's work with the found- ing of a \"how-to-live\" school—since grown to twenty-one edu- cational institutions throughout India—where traditional aca- demic subjects were offered together with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. When in 1920 Paramahansa Yogananda was deemed ready to begin his world mission of disseminating the soul-liberating science of Yoga, Mahavatar Babaji told him of the divine re- sponsibility that was to be his: \"You are the one I have chosen to spread the message of Kriya Yoga in the West. Long ago I met your guru Yukteswar at a Kumbha Mela-, I told him then I would send you to him for training. Kriya Yoga, the scientific technique of God-realization, will ultimately spread in all lands, and aid in harmonizing the nations through man's personal, transcendental perception of the Infinite Father.\" Paramahansa Yogananda began his mission in the West as a delegate to the International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston in 1920. For more than a decade he traveled the length and breadth of the continent, speaking almost daily to capacity audiences in many of the largest auditoriums in the country— from New York's Carnegie Hall to the Los Angeles Philhar- monic. On January 28, 1925, the Los Angeles Times reported: \"The Philharmonic Auditorium presents the extraordinary"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"xxii JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION spectacle of thousands...being turned away an hour before the advertised opening of a lecture with the 3000-seat hall filled to its utmost capacity.

A Hindu invading the United States to bring God....\" It came as no small revelation to the West that Yoga—so eloquently ex- pounded and clearly interpreted by Sri Yogananda—is a univer- sal science, and that as such it is indeed the essence of all true religions. In 1925, atop Mount Washington in Los Angeles, Parama- hansa Yogananda founded the international headquarters for Self-Realization Fellowship, the society he had started in In- dia in 1917 as Yogoda Satsanga Society of India. To this day Sri Yogananda's worldwide work is directed from this location ( see photo facing page 360), guided and served by monks and nuns of Self-Realization Fellowship, to whom Paramahansaji en- trusted the responsibility of carrying on his work and preserv- ing the purity of his teachings. In the late 1930s Paramahansaji began to withdraw gradu- ally from nationwide public lecturing. \"I am not interested in crowds,\" he said, \"but in souls who are in earnest to know God.\" Thereafter, he concentrated his efforts on classes for se- rious students, and spoke mostly at his own Self-Realization Fellowship temples and the international headquarters. Paramahansa Yogananda had often voiced this prediction: \"I will not die in bed, but with my boots on, speaking of God and India.\" On March 7, 1952, the prophecy was fulfilled. At a banquet in honor of the Ambassador of India, Binay R. Sen, Paramahansaji was a guest speaker. He delivered a soul-stirring address, concluding with these words from a poem he had writ- ten, \"My India\": \"Where Ganges, woods, Himalayan caves and men dream God—I am hallowed; my body touched that sod!\" He then lifted his eyes upward and entered maha- samadhi, an advanced yogi's conscious earth-exit. He died as he had lived, exhorting all to know God. The Guru's talks in the earliest years of his ministry were recorded only spasmodically. But when Daya Mataji became a disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda in 1931, she undertook the sacred task, faithfully recording, for the generations to come, all of her Guru's talks and classes. This volume is but a"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xxiii sampling: under the direction of Paramahansa Yogananda, many transcriptions—particularly those containing private in- struction and meditation techniques and principles given to Self-Realization class students—were compiled along with some of his writings into a series of Yogoda Satsanga Society Lessons; other talks appear as a regular feature in Yogoda Satsanga annual-series booklets. Most of the selections in this volume are lectures or classes given at Self-Realization Fellowship temple services or at the international headquarters in Los Angeles. A few of the talks were given at informal gatherings or satsangas with small groups of disciples; or at meditation services in which the Guru experienced ecstatic communion with God, affording all pres- ent a glimpse of that blissful consciousness. Some inspirational writings are also included in this volume. Paramahansaji was a prolific writer who often used his spare moments to compose a new canticle of love for God or a short article that might help others to better understand a certain facet of truth. As most of the talks set forth in this book were presented before audiences familiar with Self-Realization [Yogoda Sat- sanga] teachings, some clarification of terminology and philo- sophical concepts may be helpful to the general reader. To this end, many footnotes have been included; also a glossary ex- plaining certain Sanskrit words, and other philosophical terms, and giving information about events, persons, and places asso- ciated with the life and work of Paramahansa Yogananda. If the reader encounters an unfamiliar term, he or she might wish to consult the glossary. It may also be noted here that quotations from the Bhagavad Gita in this volume are from Paramahansa Yogananda's own translations, which he rendered from the Sanskrit sometimes literally and sometimes in paraphrase, de- pending on the context of his talk. (Paramahansaji's compre- hensive translation of and commentary on the Gita, published by Yogoda Satsanga Society of India/Self-Realization Fellowship, is entitled God Talks With Arjuna—The Bhagavad Gita: Royal Science of God-Realization.)

He showed that the practice of yoga establishes an inner attunement with God that constitutes the universal basis of all religions. Abstractions of theoretical religion pale before actual experience of God. Truth cannot be wholly proved to any seeker by another; but by the practice of yoga meditation all of us can prove truth for ourselves through the irrefutable assurance of our own direct experience. \"We are all part of the One Spirit/' Paramahansaji said. \"When you ex- perience the true meaning of religion, which is to know God, you will realize that He is your Self, and that He exists equally and impartially in all beings....Do not settle for intel- lectual satisfaction about truth.

Know the Reason for Your Existence It is an insult to your Self to be born, live, and die without knowing the answer to the mystery of why you were sent here as a human being in the first place. To forget God is to miss the whole point of existence. Learn to feel God, and to enjoy Him. Make it a habit and you will see in time how much you have gained. Acquiring material possessions and prosperity is no safeguard against sorrow. There will come a day when you will feel totally helpless, a mere pawn of destiny; and then you will begin to realize that God alone is your haven of security. He doesn't want to impose Himself on anyone. You must take the initiative to seek Him through your own fervent desire, pre- ferring Him to all other desires. As the swan can swim through muddy waters with its feathers remaining unsoiled, so should you live in this world. If you coat your mind with the oil of nonattachment, then material desires cannot cling to you. The dewdrop that separates itself from the lake and floats in isolation on the lotus leaf will be dried up unless it returns to the lake. So, before life evaporates in material desires, bet- ter slip into the consciousness of God. The dewdrop of life will then not have to suffer death but will be eternal. Birth is separation from the Infinite,- death is not an end of life but a transition to a higher state. Freedom from birth and death is a return to God. The dewdrop belongs to the sea. Separated, it is vulnerable to the sun and wind and other elements of nature,- but when the droplet returns to its source, it becomes magni- fied in oneness with the sea. So it is with your life.

On the lotus leaf of material happiness the dew- drop of life must remain untouched and unpolluted until it slips into the vastness of God's presence. How to express our innate immortality in spite of contrary limitations is the pur- pose of our subject on making youthfulness more lasting. Youth Is a State of Mind and Soul, As Well As of the Body Everyone is interested in youthfulness. In one way or an- other everyone is seeking the fabled \"Fountain of Youth.\" But what is youth? All young people are not necessarily youthful- some are already old and jaded far beyond their years. In con- trast, some elderly people remain youthful in spite of their ad- vancing age. They keep their minds young. Their smiles trickle down from their souls into their bodies and faces,- their very life blood throbs with the joy of being. And then there are those dull, lifeless persons who are as good as dead before they die— and they don't even know it. They are the \"walking dead.\" You see many people like that—negative, critical, moody, dispir- ited. There is no excuse for a wrong state of mind. You must be always positive-minded, cheerful, smiling, vibrant. By all means, practice this mental youthfulness that comes from the core of your being. Thus, the age of the body has no real connection with youthfulness. It is the state of the mind and the expression of the soul that make a person youthful. The definition of youth is that state of body, mind, and soul in which one feels the acme, the zenith, of joy and power. If you want to, you can re- tain that state indefinitely. Conversely, by carelessness you can lose it very easily. Let us first approach this subject from the mental stand- point. The mind is the controller; that is, it is at the controls of this body. The body itself is designed by the mind. We are the sum total of the consciousness we ourselves have created over a period of incarnations. * This mind, or consciousness, is the supreme force that governs all voluntary and involuntary activities of this bodily factory with its multifarious outputs. * See kaima and reincarnation in glossary. *"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"6 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION The Five Mental States of the Consciousness We judge our condition as desirable or undesirable by the degree of happiness therein, or by the lack of it. Accordingly, there are five mental states: happiness, sorrow, indifference, peace, and true joy. Waves whipped up in the middle of the ocean by a storm rise high, recede into a hollow, and then rise again, one after the other, until the storm ceases and the waves dissolve in the sea. Likewise with the mind. The mental peaks are life's alter- nating joys and sorrows,- the hollows in between are indiffer- ence or boredom. These are the first three mental states. You can usually recognize a person's mental state by his face. If you ask a person whose face registers happiness what has made him happy, you will find that some desire had been sat- isfied—he got a raise, he accomplished something he wanted to do, or was otherwise gratified. A desire fulfilled gives joy. When you see a person with a glum or sour face, his ex- pression tells you that he has met with some disappointment. A desire contradicted produces unhappiness. The desire for health is contradicted by pain; the desire for money is contra- dicted by poverty, and so on. Then there are the people in between. Ask them, \"Are you happy?\" \"No.\" \"Are you sad?\" \"No.\" They are in the middle, neither on the crest of the wave of happiness, nor on the clashing wave of sadness,- they are in the intermediate hol- low. That is the neutral state of indifference. One cannot remain indefinitely on the crests of either buoyant happiness or turbulent sorrow, or in the dumps of boredom. In this world of competing dualities, the ordinary being is tossed up and down—rising on a wave of joy, sinking into the trough of indifference, and then getting tumbled by a wave of sorrow. They little know anything beyond these states of consciousness. To be thus jostled about is to surren- der free will to a seemingly capricious destiny.

His usage, however, was rooted not in the narrowly exclusive sense of the word man, denoting only half of"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"HOW TO EXPRESS EVERLASTING YOUTHFULNESS 7 ing life is evenness of mind. That can be attained only by con- centration, mastery of the mental faculties. Even the most terrible sorrow is healed by time; nothing is gained by reliving it every day. Sorrowing for someone who is gone does not help him or yourself, nor does it change that sad fact. Making your- self miserable by nurturing an inferiority complex or punish- ing yourself for past mistakes or failures will not get you any- where; it paralyzes your mental faculties. Never allow yourself to get into negative mental ruts. And do not be bored with life either. That is a very uncomfortable state. It slowly stews you. Don't bake yourself and your potentialities in the oven of indifference. Beyond the first three conditions of the mind—happiness, sorrow, and indifference—is the state of peace. Very few peo- ple reach that plane. Those who have money and health and satisfying relationships—everything they really need or want— may say: \"I am not happy or unhappy or indifferent. I am con- tented; I am peaceful.\" After a period of turbulence, such a con- dition is welcome. But if for a long time one has peace that is merely the absence of joy and sorrow, he will say, \"Please knock me on the head so I can feel if I am still alive!\" Such peace, being a negative state in which excitation has been neutralized, is not lastingly satisfying. So now comes the positive aspect, the last or fifth state of consciousness: the attainment of ever new joy. That state is found only by contacting God in deep meditation, through the practice of such techniques as those given by the masters of India. That all-fulfilling joy will never grow stale. How to de- scribe it? If for ten days you were not permitted to sleep, but were forced to stay awake, and then allowed to fall asleep, the joy you feel at that moment, compounded a million times over, would not begin to express the joy that I am speaking about. the human race, but in its broader original meaning; the word is derived from the same root as Sanskrit manas, mind—the uniquely human capacity for ra- tional thought. The science of yoga deals with human consciousness from the point of view of the essentially androgynous Self ( atman ). As there is no other terminology in English that would convey these psychological and spiritual truths without excessive literary awkwardness, the use of man and related terms has been retained herein."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"8 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION Jesus and other divine ones spoke of that joy. Saint Francis and Sri Chaitanya* knew that joy. Why else would saints de- prive themselves of material gain, except that they found something greater? This path of Self-Realization doesn't tell you to cast aside everything of this world, but it does urge you to give up lesser, obstructing things for the superior, lastingly fulfilling true joy in life. The time has come for you to know and understand the purpose of religion: how to contact that supernal Joy, which is God, the great and eternal Comforter. If you can find that Joy, and if you can retain that Joy all the time, no matter what happens in your life, you will stand unshaken amidst the crash of breaking worlds. So that is the first law of retaining youth: You must have a happy state of mind, a state that is untouched by the events of life. In that joy, not even death can shake you. How could Jesus say, in the face of crucifixion, \"Father, forgive them for they know not what they do,\"+ unless he had that inner joy which even the tortures of the flesh could not take from him? In that steadfast mental foundation, he could, with his dying breath, express love for those who were the instruments of the death of his body. That is the invulnerable state you must strive to cultivate. Learn to Smile Sincerely in All Circumstances Seeking God in meditation is the direct way to attain a joy- ous and youthful state of mind. There are additional practices that will also help to nurture mental youthfulness. First of all, learn to smile—sincere smiles. Wherever you are, no matter how trying the circumstances, smile from your heart. Harbor no form of anger or malice. Try to give genuine smiles to all— friends, family, strangers alike. Half the secret of youthfulness lies in that. If you have a contagious smile that wells up from * A brilliant scholar, Sri Chaitanya in 1508 had a spiritual awakening and became inflamed with love for God, whom he worshiped as the avatar Lord Krishna (see glossary).

I often say that if you can't smile, then stand before a mirror and train yourself to smile by pulling the corners of the mouth up! The day you make up your mind to smile, you will see that everything seems to conspire to try to make you cry! That is life. The day you make up your mind to be patient and for- giving, it will seem that others suddenly become harder to get along with. That is life. We are often crucified by others, but their meanness should not affect our resolutions to be kind. Let others pursue their way,- you be bigger and adhere to your way. It is not the approval of human beings that you want, but the certification of God. Once you find His pleasure, you will be happy. Try to please others insofar as you can, and try not to offend anybody,- but don't let that work against your primary duty to please God, first and foremost. It is not worth it. Practice your smile of mental youthfulness all the time. See how many hours at a time you can keep your balance in spite of your trials. When you can remain cheerfully evenminded al- ways, you will find every cell of your body alive with great joy. God has blessed me these many years. Whether my smile is seen outwardly or not, divine joy is always with me now. The great River of Joy is flowing beneath the sands of my con- sciousness. Neither the changefulness of life nor the specter of death can take that away from me. It was hard work to make that state permanent and unchanging, but it was worth it. So many people have thrown away years upon years and have not found joy. Why imitate them and go after those things that promise happiness and give unhappiness? Contact the Spirit in meditation, and you will know that what I have told you is true. You will possess a joy you will not part with, even if the whole world is offered to you in exchange. Money, sex, wine—nothing can match that supreme joy. It is an ever-burning radiance in your soul.

This same prin- ciple is applicable in every situation: If you are unwilling, then you have no energy or interest. If you are willing, you have the vitality and enthusiasm of youthfulness. Another key to mental youthfulness is to learn to be less selfish and self-centered, and more giving and caring toward others. To hold on to the joy found in contact with God in meditation, you must practice His quality of loving all, of be- ing just and kind to all. Forgive your enemies. What a wonder- ful release you will have from the bondage of anger and jealousy. Reach out to help others every day, in whatever way you can— and especially by bringing souls to the spiritual path to seek God. Give to all that same love with which you love your fam- ily and dear ones. God gives you loved ones that you might learn to expand self-love to include love for others. And He al- lows death and other circumstances to take away dear ones that you do not confine your love to only a few, but learn to give it to all. The more universal your love becomes, the more your ex- panded consciousness will be filled with the joy of His om- nipresent Being.

The higher laws have not been much demonstrated in the West because its culture has concentrated on external material development, whereas the East has devoted itself to an inner research into the realms of Spirit. Why be astonished that some masters, to fulfill a divine purpose at God's behest, choose to live unusually long lives? We see in nature that there are animals that can live much longer than ordinary human beings. Yet man is supposed to be the superior creature. Why is he less long-lived? Because as hu- man beings we are uniquely gifted with free will, privileged to do anything we like; and by misuse of this endowment, man chooses to do all the things he should not do. His wrong hab- its of living, thinking, persistence in disunion from God, are passed from generation to generation in the process of evolu- tion, severely limiting the expression of his divine potential- ity—physically as well as mentally and spiritually. When in the mother's womb the human body starts to grow from the division of the first cell—consisting of the union of sperm and ovum—an embryo is formed within four days. The whole potential of the body is there on the fourth day. In the beginning, the formative cells are called germ cells, each one capable of becoming any kind of bodily tissue. According to a specific design, they mysteriously start to specialize to form nerves, bones, skin, blood, organs—all the components of the body. As the body parts are formed, the specializing germ cells become somatic cells, locked into their specific func- tions and the limitations of those functions. That means they do not always obey the conscious mind, because the evolu- tionary and individual karmic habits and thoughts of cen- turies are embedded deep within their composition. For example, man is able to grow two sets of teeth; so why can't he grow a third set, and a fourth? Because the very cells of our bodies are hypnotized by the evolutionary patterns of generations lodged in our brains and in the cellular makeup. The more we get away from the subconscious hypnosis of the evolutionary state of civilization, the more free we shall be.

Obey the Laws of God Embodied in Cosmic Nature Nature, cosmic creation, is the embodiment of the laws of God. So you must learn to obey these laws. Disease, mental inharmonies, and all kinds of misery are the consequences of disobedience. By misuse of free will, human beings choose to misbehave; and their actions, being contrary to divine law, later react upon the nervous system and the consciousness, cre- ating inharmonies in body and mind. When it comes to diet, the laws of health are constantly broken. Most people dig their own graves with their knives and forks. The animals in the zoo are fed more scientifically than the average human being. You should govern your eating habits by what you should eat, and not merely by what pleases your sense of taste. Your diet should include a predominance of fresh fruits and vegetables, and natural whole grains and legumes. Avoid too many refined starches and too many sweets, and greatly limit the intake of fats—these can be very injuri- ous to health. The best candies are nature's sun-dried fruits, unsulphured. Those who eat a lot of meat should break off that habit by strictly avoiding all forms of beef and pork, and eating fish, poultry, or lamb only occasionally. Every piece of meat eaten should be accompanied by a large serving of let- tuce. Far more preferable is a totally meatless diet that in- cludes instead some dairy products, eggs, and vegetable protein foods. Unsalted peanuts or almonds or raw garbanzo beans, ground finely and mixed with orange juice, makes a good source of protein as a substitute for meat. Take milk in between meals, not with meals. Avoid overeating. Ingesting more than the body needs can be as harmful as wrong eating. Don't think you have to eat just because the dinner bell rings. And when you do eat, eat less. Also, learn to fast one day a week and three consecutive days once a month on fresh fruits or unsweetened fruit juices. Proper elimination is very important. Fresh fruits and veg- etables help to clean out your body. When fasting, it is good to take a mild natural laxative in orange juice. Posture, also, is important to good health. Poor posture"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"14 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION constricts the healthy flow of the life energy in the various body parts and vital organs. The best posture is chest out, shoulders back, stomach and abdomen in, and buttocks tucked under. Don't stand with a swayback or with hunched shoulders. Don't sit in a slumped position with the spine out of alignment, hampering breathing and the free flow of life energy in the spine. Psychologically, a hunched posture suggests a defeatist attitude. Always sit and stand erect. Be master of yourself, with your mind on the infinite power within and around you. Take regular exercise, such as walking every day. Learn to breathe properly—calmly and deeply, filling the lungs all the way to the lower lobes. When the system is well oxygenated by proper breathing and exercise, the life force therein vital- izes the whole body, including the brain. Lastly, in connection with the physical aspects of youth- fulness, it is extremely important to conserve your power of sex. Overindulgence in sex and misuse of Nature's creative force will bring on disease and old age quicker than anything else. It devitalizes the body and weakens the immune system. Married couples should practice moderation, and single per- sons should observe abstinence. By adhering to good-health practices, and by not diminish- ing the inner life energy through wrong physical and mental ac- tions, you will enhance your ability to retain health and youth- fulness. Even bad health karma from past lives can be thus greatly mitigated. No matter what your past is, it is never too late to try to change,- it is never too late to correct your bad habits. The \"Fountain of Youth\" Is Within the Soul In the final analysis, the sought-after \"Fountain of Youth\" is to be found in your soul. Your true Self, being made in the im- age of God, is immortal. It never undergoes the ravages that af- fect the body. \"No weapon can pierce the soul; no fire can burn it; no water can moisten it; nor can any wind wither it....The soul is immutable, all-permeating, ever calm, and im- movable—eternally the same.\"* Right within your body is this immortality. You are dreaming delusion's dreams of weakness * Bhagavad Gita 11:23-24."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"HOW TO EXPRESS EVERLASTING YOUTHFULNESS 15 and frailty, and thus you do not see that behind you, and within your soul, is the everlasting immutable power of God. You must realize this. If you can once attain that consciousness, then even death cannot disturb you. Those who know God have that consciousness. They know the science of the atomic structure of creation, and its source and essence in the creative thought of God. To know Him is to see the body as a part of Spirit. The miracles of this realization are not to be demon- strated before the staring curiosity of people,- but all God-realized saints have in some way quietly manifested that power. In your dreams, you can make yourself whatever you want to be ; you can do whatever you want to do. Sometimes you are sick, and sometimes rich, and so on. Mind can do anything in that dream state. When you learn how to control your mind dur- ing the waking state, realizing that its power is a part of the consciousness of God, you can similarly have complete mas- tery over the body. Meditation upon the soul is the method by which the mind can be made to work its wonders under your control. When you find your true Self, the soul, you shall see that the body is nothing but an emanation of God. Those who are sincere seekers and follow this path stead- fastly shall know the mystery of the everlastingness of the soul. If you can be cheerful and evenminded in all circum- stances, and do all things willingly, you can be mentally ever youthful. If, in addition, you obey health laws, and use your will to draw on the infinite cosmic energy, you can promote vi- tal youthfulness in the body. And, above all, if you know that you are immortal, made in the image of God, your whole be- ing will glow with that eternal youthfulness; and if it is the will of God, you will not have to experience so-called death when you cast off this mortal body. * And even if you do un- dergo the natural transition of death, it will be seen only as a peaceful dream. Make a solemn resolution to meditate every morning and *In his Autobiography of a Yogi, Paramahansaji writes: \"Many yogis are known to have retained their self-consciousness without interruption by the dramatic transition to and from 'life' and 'death.'\" He himself left the body consciously at the time of his passing in 1952."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"16 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION before going to bed at night: \"First, last, and always, O Spirit, I will keep my engagement with Thee in meditation.

Everything you hear this morning you should strive to remember and put into practice. It is so easy to be inspired momentarily, and then forget much of what you heard. That is why I often employ rep- etition; for to penetrate the hard core of human conscious- ness, a truth must be repeated again and again. By such re- view, it gradually becomes a habitual part of one's thoughts. There is a vast difference between just listening to a lec- ture and applying the truths it contains. Everything my guru [Swami Sri Yukteswar*] told me I put into practice. As a re- sult of his training I have always kept my spiritual priorities straight. I never miss three things: my meditations, morning and night; my exercises;t and service to others. These I reli- giously perform; all else of less importance I somehow manage. Living in the consciousness of God, I find many things that once seemed necessary have become unnecessary. Last night I felt no need for sleep because my awareness of God was so strong. Once in a while I would see my body asleep, but that sub- conscious sleep -samadhi (nidra samadhi sthiti ) soon slipped away and my mind and body were filled solely with the con- sciousness of God.* These things that I tell you come from my own direct ex- * See glossary. t The Energization Exercises. + The unconscious process of withdrawing the mind from the senses and body- identification in sleep is referred to as nidra samadhi sthiti.

Through Him whom I perceive within, it is possible to trans- mit to those who are in tune the light of God that is in me. It is not I, but He who is in me whom I extol. Just as the wealthy man can bestow his fortune on his worthy children, so it is possible for the man of spiritual wealth to bequeath his divine riches to those disciples who follow his example. This is true of all great masters. There are many instances of this trans- mission of spiritual consciousness, such as the \"mantle\" of Elijah that fell on Elisha, and the Holy Ghost imparted by Christ to the faithful eleven of his twelve close disciples. Many come to the spiritual path; but it is those who re- main steadfast to the end who will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. True devotees—those who see that the murky paths of this world all lead to disillusionment—steadily pursue God, never doubting Him. It doesn't matter whether He an- swers or not. The devotee inwardly prays: \"Lord, Thou know- est I am coming, so I care not when Thou wilt reply to me. Though I am undeserving of Thy response, yet Thou canst not refuse me when the time is right.\" As soon as God is convinced that you are in earnest and nothing can turn you away from Him, then through the guru He gives you the final realization—the guru transmits to you the light of God that flows through him. * Perhaps you thought you would never know such a blessing. That supreme experi- ence I received from my Guru. He gave me by his touch what I could not attain by the power and effort of my meditations alone. Beginning with this new year, make firm spiritual resolu- tions. I have made a few myself, and pray with all my heart that with the blessing of the Father and Gurudeva I will carry these through. Life Is a Matrix of Consciousness We are made of the matrix of consciousness. All life was spumed out of the one Source of the river of consciousness. * See guru in glossary."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"REMOLDING YOUR LIFE 19 Your individualized consciousness is thus the very foundation of your existence. All of your thoughts and actions are bub- bles and droplets of the river of consciousness. The seemingly solid body is actually a mass of electro- magnetic currents. Its electrons and protons are condensa- tions of the relative positive and negative creative thoughts projected by God, which I call thoughtrons. All creation de- rives from these thoughtrons, the consciousness of God. What is the difference between black and white? They are two contrasting thoughts, each frozen into its particular con- cept, that is all. For example, black horses and white horses in a dream are nothing but different crystallizations, relativities of the dreamer's one stream of thought. In the ultimate sense, then, all things are made of pure consciousness,- their finite appearance is the result of the rela- tivity of consciousness. Therefore, if you want to change any- thing in yourself, you must change the process of thought that occasions the materialization of consciousness into different forms of matter and action. That is the way, the only way, to remold your life. The Tenacity of Habits I can give a directive to my mind and it will at once react or behave accordingly. Most people who make up their minds to stop smoking or to stop eating so many sweets will continue with those actions in spite of themselves. They do not change because their minds, like blotting paper, have soaked up hab- its of thought. Habit means that the mind believes it cannot get rid of a particular thought. Habit, indeed, is tenacious. Once you perform an action, it leaves an effect or impression on the consciousness. As a re- sult of this influence, you are likely to repeat that action. Af- ter several repetitions, that inclination is so strengthened that the action becomes a habit. In some people, just one act is enough to form a habit, because of a latent predisposition from past lives. The mind may tell you that you cannot free yourself from a particular habit; but habits are nothing but rep- etitions of your own thoughts, and these you have the capac- ity to change."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"20 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION The nature of habit can be understood by this analogy: Clay can be molded into a vase ; and while the clay is still soft it is easy to change the form of that vase again and again. But once it is fired in an oven, its shape becomes firmly set. So it is with your consciousness. Your thoughts are molding your actions, and your mental convictions from the repetition of those actions is the fire that hardens the thoughts into un- yielding habit patterns. Why are the faces of all of you different? Because your minds are different. Your habit patterns of thoughts have molded not only your mind but also your body. You have probably no- ticed that some thin people might eat five meals a day and yet never gain weight. And some heavy people may eat very little and yet become heavier. Why? The former, sometime in a past life, established the thought in their consciousness that they were thin, and in this life they brought that thought and tendency with them. No matter what they do, they never grow fat. It is the same with obese persons. In past lives, they left this world with the consciousness of being fat, and they brought the seed of that thought into their present existence. The whole physiology of the body responds to these karmic seed tendencies. If you want to change your constitution, then you have to say, \"It is I who thought myself into being thin (or heavy or sickly). Now I will myself to be robust (or what- ever you so desire).\" If you get rid of the thought that has made you other than you want to be, you will see the body change. I can maintain my weight, or as easily be thin at will. My trouble as a youth was that I was too thin. Master [Swami Sri Yukteswar] cured me of that consciousness, so ever since I have preferred to be heavier. \"Old Age\" Is a State of Mind Most people are psychological antiques; they never change, year after year always the same. Everyone has self-limiting idio- syncrasies. These were not put into your nature by God, but were created by you. These are what you must change—by re- membering that these habits, peculiar to your nature, are noth- ing but manifestations of your own thoughts. If you feel that your character is not what you think it"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"REMOLDING YOUR LIFE 21 should he, remember that it was molded by none other than yourself. Certainly there are outside influences, but inner ac- ceptance is the determining factor. If everyone says that Johnny is a bad boy, and Johnny accepts that condemnation, he may not make the effort to be good; he adopts that negative thought. But if he had refused to accept it, he could have been different. One must never give up hope of becoming better. A person is old only when he refuses to make the effort to change. That stagnant state is the only \"old age\" I recognize. When a per- son says again and again, \"I can't change,- this is the way I am,\" then I have to say, \"All right, stay that way, since you have made up your mind to be like that.\" Try to be more pliable, like children. However, even some children are old before their time because they have lacked the training and have not been given the incentive to change past- life tendencies; their mental clay is already fired in the oven and they grow up with the same inclinations they had in child- hood. On the other hand, there are aged people with whom I have talked, just once, and they have changed for the better. God is not a respecter of age, for the soul is ageless. Those who are always ready to improve and expand themselves are like re- ceptive children. Those who grow in understanding become more childlike. The great masters are like that. To be childlike doesn't mean one is wishy-washy. I am not afraid of anything in the world,- no one can intimidate me. I live for God and truth, and I love everyone. If someone mis- understands me, I try to establish understanding. But if I can- not change that person, neither can I be moved by his bad be- havior. If a nonunderstanding person has made up his mind against you, why should you change in order to please or pla- cate him? Stand by your principles when you are right, and be willing instantly to change yourself when you are wrong. Will Power Is the Instrument of Change If you have molded clay into a vase and fired it, and now you want to make that object into a tray, you cannot do so. But you can pulverize the vase and add that powder to fresh clay, and then form it into a tray. Likewise, when a bad habit is fixed in your mind and you want to change it, you will have"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"22 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION to use your strong will to pulverize that habit and absorb it into fresh, pliable good actions that can be remolded to the desired image. Strong will means strong conviction. The minute you say to yourself, \"I am not bound by this habit,\" and mean it, the habit will be gone. Look within and determine your main characteristics. Some love to write, or compose music, or dance,- others enjoy finance and economics, and so on. Unfortunately, some love to gossip, and others to fight. Don't try to change in yourself what is good. But those things you do against your will, and that make you unhappy after you have done them, are what you want to get rid of. How? Affirm with conviction, before going to bed and on arising in the morning, \"I can change. I have the will to change. I will change!\" Hold to that thought through- out the day, and carry it with you into the subconscious land of sleep and the superconscious realm of meditation. Suppose your problem is that you frequently get angry, and afterwards feel very sorry for having lost your temper. Every night and morning make up your mind to avoid anger, and then watch yourself carefully. The first day may be difficult, but the second may be a little easier. The third will be easier still. After a few days you will see that victory is possible. In a year, if you keep up your effort, you will be another person. In my childhood, I used to get angry at injustices. One day I saw how foolish it was: I could not change the world in a minute by a display of wrath. I raised my hands and vowed: \"I will never be angry again.\" Since then, I have never been angry within, though I can be outwardly fiery when necessary. When I came to America, twenty-some years ago, I saw everyone was drinking coffee,- so I tasted it for the first time, and gradually came to like it. Lest it become a habit, I made a rule never to drink coffee by myself. Still, there were so many invi- tations that I found I was drinking coffee all the time. One day, as I ate alone in a restaurant, I realized I missed the coffee. I thought, \"So! You got me! All right: good-bye, coffee habit!\" That was the end of it; in the past twenty years I have never touched it. Just last night, some friends served coffee to me. It tasted all right, but it will never again be tempting to me."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"REMOLDING YOUR LIFE 23 Freedom Is to Act for Your Highest Welfare You must be free—unenslaved by habits, or the wish to please society, or anything else. To be able to do, not what you want to do but what you should do for your own highest welfare, that is freedom. For example, temperamental people, addicted to their emo- tions, love to intimidate and \"scare the daylights\" out of oth- ers. I say, \"Go ahead, if you must, but remember that you will have to pay for that bad behavior—no one else.\" Every wrong action goes against one's own well-being. It fails to give the peace and happiness expected. Sometimes it seems difficult to be good, while it is easy to be bad; and that to give up the bad things is to miss something. But I say you will not miss any- thing but sorrow. Do not be like the naughty child who wants to do the very thing he is told not to do. Everything that the great ones have warned against is like poisoned honey. I say don't taste it. You may argue, \"But it is sweet.\" Well, my reasoning is that after you have tasted the sweetness it will destroy you. Evil was made sweet to delude you. You have to use your discrimina- tion to distinguish between poisoned honey and that which is in your best interest. Avoid those things that will ultimately hurt you, and choose those that will give you freedom and happiness. In this new year, change your consciousness. Cultivate the right conduct and good habits that lead to freedom. When you can say, \"I don't indulge in bad habits because they are against my interest; I choose goodness of my own free will,\" that is freedom,- and that is what I want for you. Both Discrimination and Will Power Are Necessary Remolding your consciousness means exercising free will guided by discrimination and energized by will power. Dis- crimination is your keen eyesight and will is your power of lo- comotion. Without will, you may know what is right through discrimination and yet not act on it. It is acting on knowledge that gets you to your goal. So both discrimination and will are necessary."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"24 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION Will power is easy to develop. Try first for small accom- plishments. Gradually you will get rid of tendencies you thought you could not overcome. Watch your consciousness. Develop the habit of self-examination, of watching and analyzing your thoughts and behavior. When there are telltale signs of bad habits or inclinations, that is the time to discriminate and re- sist with will power. The first time you succumbed to a temptation, you didn't expect that you would be compelled to repeat it. But after giv- ing in a few times, habit took over. Eventually you felt you could not get rid of that habit. But you can, if you use your God-given discrimination and will power. Habits are simply thoughts grooved deeply into the brain. The needle of the mind plays those records of habits again and again. Even the chem- istry of the body responds, as with addiction. Applying mind and will can change those patterns. Don't immediately attempt dramatic changes. Experiment in little things first, to train your inherent power of command. I see that a great many of you here today will be rid of your bad habits as a result of fol- lowing these suggestions. Think Away Undesirable Thoughts Start the new year with the resolve to face your bad hab- its and conquer them. Take the bull by the horns, so to speak, and tame it. Your bad habits are the satanic influence that has kept God out of your life. Good habits can be compared to good people. When they look through the window of your mind, they see they cannot get into your life because the chairs of your consciousness are occupied by bad habits. Evict the undesirable occupants and let the noble ones in. You don't need the help of anything or any- one else to change yourself; just change your consciousness. Very simply, all you have to do is to think away the thoughts you want to destroy, by replacing them with constructive thoughts. This is the key to heaven,- it is in your hands. Those people who behave in the same way day in and day out are the ones who refuse to change their thoughts. That is all. There is a saying: \"A woman convinced against her will is of the same opinion still.\" Why say this of woman? Man is"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"REMOLDING YOUR LIFE 25 the same. Everyone must learn to cut out wrong thoughts with the incisive scalpel of wisdom. Thought is a projection of God's omnipotent light and will. If you make up your mind to change, you can use its power to transform yourself. We Are What We Think We Are We are what we think we are. The habitual inclination of our thoughts determines our talents and abilities, and our per- sonality. Thus, some think they are writers or artists, indus- trious or lazy, and so on. What if you want to be other than what you presently think you are? You may argue that others have been born with the special talent you lack but desire to have. This is true. But they had to cultivate the habit of that ability some time—if not in this life, then in a previous one. So whatever you want to be, start to develop that pattern now. You can instill any trend in your consciousness right now, provided you inject a strong thought in your mind; then your actions and whole being will obey that thought. Do not settle for a one-track mentality. You should be able to succeed in any profession or do anything you put your mind to. When- ever others told me I would not be able to do a thing, I made up my mind that I could do it, and I did! Few demonstrations of mind power are more dramatic than the power of thought for good or ill on the health of the body. My Guru told me the following story: He had lost much weight as a result of a serious illness. During convalescence, he visited his guru, Lahiri Mahasaya. The Yogavatar* inquired about his health. Sri Yukteswarji explained the cause of his del- icate condition. \"So,\" Lahiri Mahasaya said, \"you made yourself sick and now you think you are thin. But I am sure you will feel better tomorrow.\" The next day, Gurudeva went exultantly to Lahiri Maha- saya and proclaimed, \"Sir, with your blessings, I feel much bet- ter today.\" * A title given to Lahiri Mahasaya, who is revered as an avatar (divine incar- nation) whose life ideally expressed the goals of yoga (science of union with God). (See Lahiri Mahasaya and avatar in glossary.)"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"26 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION Lahiri Mahasaya responded, \"Your condition was indeed quite serious, and you are still frail. Who knows how you might feel tomorrow?\" The next day Sri Yukteswarji was again completely de- bilitated. He lamented to his Guru, \"Sir, I am again ailing. I could hardly drag myself here to you.\" Lahiri Mahasaya replied, \"So, once more you indispose yourself.\" After some days of this alternating health and ill health, which followed exactly the expectation of Sri Yukteswarji's thoughts influenced by Lahiri Mahasaya's suggestions, my Guru realized the powerful lesson Lahiri Mahasaya had been trying to teach him. The Yogavatar said, \"What is this? One day you say to me, 'I am well,' and the next day you say, 'I am sick.' It isn't that I have been healing or indisposing you. It is your own thoughts that have made you alternately weak and strong.\" Then Master said, \"If I think I am well and that I have re- gained my former weight, will it be so?\" Lahiri Mahasaya answered, \"It is so.\" Guruji said, \"At that very moment I felt both my strength and weight return. When I reached my mother's home that night, she was startled to see my changed condition and thought that I was swelling from dropsy. Many of my friends were so amazed at my sudden recovery that they became disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya.\"* Such phenomenal demonstrations are possible to those who possess the power of realization that everything is thought. When you have yet to attain that realization, you have to keep applying will and positive affirmation until you make thought work for you. Thought is the matrix of all creation; thought cre- ated everything. If you hold on to that truth with indomitable will, you can materialize any thought. There is nothing that can gainsay it. It was by that kind of powerful thought that Christ rebuilt his crucified body; and it is what he referred to when he said, \"Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, * See also the account of this story in Autobiography of a Yogi, chapter 12."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"REMOLDING YOUR LIFE 27 when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\"* Let Nothing Weaken the Will Behind Positive Thoughts Once you have said, \"I will,\" never give in. If you say, \"I will never catch cold,\" and the next morning you have a terrible cold and are discouraged, you are allowing your will to remain weak. You must not get discouraged when you see something happening that is contrary to what you have affirmed. Keep on believing, knowing it will be so. If outwardly you say, \"I will,\" but inwardly think, \"I can't,\" then you neutralize the power of thought and emasculate your will. If your will has become weak- ened by fighting disease or other reverses, you have to take the help of someone else's will to strengthen you through their prayers and positive affirmations on your behalf. But you must also do your part to change your consciousness. That is my ad- vice to you. Develop your will power and positive thinking, and you will find your body, mind, and soul working to mold every- thing in your life according to your will. As thought is the most powerful agent in your life, pro- vided you know how to develop and use it, never let the power of your thought be diluted by mixing with weak-minded or neg- ative people—unless you are very strong-minded and can instead strengthen those persons. Failures should align themselves with successful people. The weak should seek the company of those who are stronger. People who have no self-control should associate with those who are self-disciplined—the greedy man, for example, should eat with the man of self-control; with such an example before him, he will begin to reason, \"I also can con- trol my appetite.\" Change Your Consciousness From Mortality to Divinity Just as by the power of thought you can change yourself to be whatever you want to be, so most importantly, you will be able to change your consciousness from that of a mortal to a divine being. The mortal man is he who thinks, \"This is the * Mark 11:24 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"28 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION way I live and this is the way I'll be until I die.\" But the divine man says, \"I dreamed I was a mortal, but now I am awake and know that I am a child of God, made in the image of the Father.\" Though it takes time to realize this fully, it can be done. If when time comes for meditation at night you yield to the thought, \"It is so late now to meditate; let me sleep and I will meditate tomorrow,\" you will be sleeping on into the grave. When the world has surrendered to the drug of slumber, you be awake in God. And throughout the day's activities, think that it is God who is working through you. Give the re- sponsibility to Him. He who thinks of God all the time, can he do wrong? Even if he happens to err, God knows it was his wish to do right. Give everything to God, and you will change because then the human ego can no longer dictate to you. No matter what comes to you, just say, \"God knows best. It is He who is giving me this suffering; it is He who is mak- ing me happy.\" With this attitude, all your nightmares of life will change into a beautiful dream of God. Darkness is the absence of light. Delusion is darkness; Reality is light. Your eyes of wisdom are closed, so you see only the darkness,- and you are suffering in that delusion. Change your consciousness; open your eyes and you will see in the stars the sparkle of that Divine Light. In every atom of space you will see the twinkle of God's light of laughter. Behind every thought you shall feel the ocean of His wisdom. The dance of life and death, prosperity and failure, have no reality except as dreams of God. Realize this, and you shall see that it is materialized thoughts that are dancing around you, and that you are the ocean of thought. Nothing can stay nor hurt you. Now I ask you to close your eyes and think of one bad habit you want to get rid of. If you concentrate with me as I say the words in Spirit, and you believe, you shall be free of that habit. Throw away the thought that you cannot give up whatever it is. I am sending a strong thought into your consciousness that right now you are rid of that habit. Affirm with me: \"I am free of that habit now! I am free!\" Hold on to that thought of free- dom; forget the bad habit.

It is arrogant to think that our little earth is the only place inhabited by intelligent life. There are many such worlds as this—some more highly evolved, and others in earlier stages of evolution. The orderly manner in which the universe is run shows that it is guided by some form of intelli- gence that permeates all created things. When we examine the mechanism of a watch, we know that there was an intelligent being who created that instru- ment so that it would work according to a mathematical plan. The maker coordinated all the little cogwheels and other parts to produce a certain motion that measures time. Keeping time is a necessity in a universe whose very existence depends on the relativities of time and space. The entire cosmos is one gigantic watch with myriad cog- wheels of galaxies, stars, and planets, sitting in space, measur- ing the passage of time with the motion of past, present, and future. Just as the man-made watch is the product of human intelligence, so the vast universal watch is the handiwork of a higher Intelligence. We cannot doubt it. In spite of some things that are not to our liking here on earth, we cannot deny that there is a mathematical harmony in the universe. Why God created this earth is always a very thought- provoking question. From a relative standpoint, we can counter, \"Why do we carry a watch?\" The answer is to measure time, to measure events and our movements throughout the day. Breakfast, work, dinner, caring for the body, entertainment, 30"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"A WORLD OF COSMIC ENTERTAINMENT 31 sleep—all consist of certain motions in time. So we can say that the watch is required for measuring the passage of our time. Such measuring is necessary because this world in which we have been placed is conditioned by time. Our existence and ac- tions are subject to the divisions of past, present, and future. As human beings, we have to act or we become human vegeta- bles; and our behavior must be in an orderly way that is har- monious with the universal motion of time and its man-made constraints. A watch helps us to do this. Now, is this cosmic watch a necessity to God? Must He too be circumscribed by past, present, and future? The answer is both yes and no. Time, the orderly ticking of the cosmic clock, is an integral part of may a, delusion, \"the Magical Measurer,\" the only way that God could create a variety of forms and events from His one consciousness and display their progression in space for our participation and wonder- ment. * But no, God Himself is not limited by the relativity of past, present, and future and the changes inherent in the pas- sage of time. In Him there is naught but the eternal now. And though delusion comes from Him, it is not in Him. The World Is God's Lila It is a paradox that if God is not compelled by the relativ- ities of this world as is man, then why did He bring forth cre- ation? If God needed this world, it would imply that He is im- perfect, not complete or satisfied within Himself. And on the other hand, if God is perfect, then why did He create such an imperfect world? The rishis of ancient India, having penetrated to the Orig- inal Cause of Being, declare that God is perfect; that He needs nothing, for all is contained within Himself; and that this world is God's lila, or divine play. The Lord, it seems, like a lit- tle child, loves to play, and His lila is the endless variety of ever-changing creation. I used to reason in this way: God was infinite omniscient Bliss; but, being alone, there was no one but Him to enjoy that Bliss. So He said, \"Let Me create a universe and divide * See maya in glossary."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"32 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION Myself into many souls that they may play with Me in My unfolding drama.\" By His magical measuring power of may a He became dual: Spirit and Nature, man and woman, positive and negative. But even though He has created the universe out of delusion, He Himself is not deluded by it. He knows that everything is but a diversification of His one Cosmic Con- sciousness. Experiences of the senses and emotions, the dramas of war and peace, sickness and health, life and death—all are happening in God as the Dreamer-Creator of all things, but He is unaffected by them. One part of His Infinite Being ever remains transcendent, beyond vibratory dualities: there God is inactive. When He vibrates His consciousness with thoughts of diversity, He becomes immanent and omnipresent as the Creator in the finite vibratory realm of infinity: there He is active. Vibration brings forth objects and beings interacting in space in the motions of time—just as vibrations of man's con- sciousness bring forth dreams in sleep. God created this dream universe for entertaining Himself and us. The only objection I have to God's lila is this: \"Lord, why did You permit suffering to be a part of the play?\" Pain is so ugly and torturing. Existence then is no longer entertainment, but a tragedy. That is where the intercession of the saints comes in. They remind us that God is all-powerful, and if we unite ourselves with Him, we will no longer be hurt in this play- house of His. It is we who inflict pain on ourselves if we trans- gress the divine laws on which He rests the whole universe. Our salvation is to unite with Him. Unless we attune ourselves to God and know thereby that this world is but a cosmic enter- tainment, we are bound to suffer. It seems that suffering is a nec- essary discipline to remind us to seek union with God. Then, like Him, we will be entertained by this fantastic play. It is wondrous to think deeply of these things. I delve in these realms all the time. Even as I speak to you I am seeing these truths. It would indeed be terrible if an Almighty Being had thrown us into this delusive earthly existence without an escape or the ability to realize what He realizes. But this is not the case. There is an outlet. Every night in deep sleep you unconsciously forget this world; it is no more for you. And every time you meditate deeply, you are consciously transcen-"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"A WORLD OF COSMIC ENTERTAINMENT 33 dent; the world doesn't exist for you. Thus do the saints say that to unite ourselves with God is the only way we can un- derstand that this world is not something to which we should give much importance. Look Upon Life As a Movie In this world there is a constant repetition of history, of warfare and trouble. If we are objective, we begin to behold events as a sort of continuous cosmic motion picture wherein the same basic story is played over and over again, only in dif- ferent times and places with different characters. You wouldn't sit through the same movie repeatedly; it would soon lose its interest. So we can grant to the Heavenly Father that He has provided for changes in history and contrasts in good and evil to give variety to the entertainment in this cosmic movie house. We can say that God should never have created this world in which there is so much trouble. But on the other hand, the saints say that if you knew you were gods, * you wouldn't mind it. If you watch a movie, you like a lot of action rather than something dull, don't you? That is the way you should enjoy this world. Look upon life as a movie, and then you will know why God created it. Our problem is that we forget to see it as God's entertainment. Through scripture, God has said that we are made in His image. As such, we could behold this world drama as a movie, even as He does, if we but look to that soul perfection within and realize our unity with the Divine. Then this cosmic movie, with its horrors of disease and poverty and atomic bombs, will appear to us only as real as the anomalies we experience in a movie house. When we have finished seeing the motion pic- ture, we know that nobody was killed; nobody was suffering. In fact, that truth is the only answer I see when I look at the drama of life. It is nothing but an electrical shadow-show, a play of light and shadows. Everything is the vibration of God's consciousness condensed into electromagnetic images. The essence of those images cannot be severed by a sword, nor * \"Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?\" [John 10:34, Bible)."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"34 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION burned, nor drowned, nor suffer pain of any sort. It is not born nor does it die. It only passes through a few changes. If we could watch this world as God watches it, and as the saints do, we would be free from the seeming reality of this dream- ing. In that consciousness I can understand that this world was created for entertainment; and that it is not necessary ei- ther to God or to us. Awaken From the Cosmic Dream You can understand life as God's cosmic dream movie if you analyze the dream movies you create every night in sleep. Sometimes you have nightmares and sometimes you have lovely dreams. How real they seem, not only to you but also to those beings in your dream. But when you wake up you know that they were not real, and you can laugh at that unre- ality. Of course, everyone prefers beautiful dreams to night- mares. I remind God of this: \"If we must participate in Your dreams, Lord, we like beautiful dreams of health and smiles in- stead of nightmares of disease or mental suffering.\" But the trouble is, as long as you will love beautiful dreams and fear nightmares, giving reality to any dream happenings, when nightmares come you will suffer. Therefore, the masters say, \"Awake from both the beautiful dreams and the nightmares.\" If you are attached to human happiness, you are in for a lot of trouble, because nightmares are inevitable along with the beautiful dreams. But if you will think of a dream as a dream, whether it is enjoyable or dreadful, you will have peace. When you realize that life is a dream, then you are free. That is the philosophy the great masters of India teach— that this world, this creation, is the dream of God. Just as when you are half awake and can see a dream and know you are dreaming, yet apart from it, that is how God feels this universe. On one side He is awake in ever new Bliss, and on another side He is dreaming this universe. That is how you should look upon this world. Then you will know why He created it, and you will not ascribe these dream conditions to your soul. If you pass through a nightmare, you know that it is no more than a bad dream. If you can live in the world in that consciousness, you will not suffer. That is what Kriya Yoga will give to you."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"A WORLD OF COSMIC ENTERTAINMENT 35 That is what Self-Realization Fellowship [Yogoda Satsanga Society] Lessons will do for you if you practice them faith- fully.

Occidentals have accused the masters of propounding a negative philosophy of life—that is, never mind whether you suffer, never mind whether you are happy or not; deny the world. On the contrary, the masters of India ask, \"What are you going to do when you are confronted with pain and sorrow? Are you going to cry helplessly, or are you going to practice those techniques that give evenmindedness and tran- scendence while you are treating the malady?\" They urge com- monsense remedial action and simultaneous control of the emotions so that if health does go away and pain comes you do not give in to despair.

Those who habitually cling to material consciousness do not want to make the effort required to reach that state of in- vulnerability. When suffering comes, they do not learn from it and so repeat the same mistakes. One man who came to see me boasted how much money he had. I cautioned him, \"Don't tell everyone what you have,- someone will get hold of you and your money.\" Soon thereafter, a lady did get hold of him, and after a short while she wanted a divorce and half of his money. By God's grace I helped him get out of the mess. While the divorce was going through, I wrote to him urging him not to get involved again. I knew his tempera- ment. But he came back with another wife. I was astounded by his foolishness. His new wife was a good woman, and had a lit- tle money of her own. But now he wanted to get away from her, and she wouldn't let him go. Being a restless man, he had de- cided he didn't want married life,- he wanted his freedom. But I had to advise him, \"You lost your freedom willingly, now you must make the best of it.\" Isn't human nature strange? In India if the wife dies, you can be pretty sure the husband will not marry again. Usually he lives in her memory. That kind of romance is considered the ideal in India—and yet once in a while we see something there to the contrary. A man came to me crying his head off for his deceased wife. His feeling had given way completely to uncontrolled emotion. He said he wanted to kill himself. I sympathized with his sense of loss, but tried to get him to think rationally. \"You can't get her back by carrying on this way,\" I told him. He sobbed, \"I will never marry again.\" But I saw otherwise, and said, \"You will marry in a month from now.\" He insisted, \"Never!\" Well, in one month he remarried; but he didn't come to see me because he was em- barrassed to remember his strong disavowal of my words. Sometimes when I am traveling by car I see how many people lived before in the houses that I pass, and how many people will come to reside in them in the future.

That is the higher philosophy of the mas- ters of India. Emotional Sensitivity Is the Cause of Suffering Do not be so sensitive. Emotional sensitivity is the silent cause of all suffering. To give strength to creation as a reality by emotional involvement in it is foolishness. To not meditate, to not sit still and realize your true soul nature, but to drift along as a part of the eternal motion of creation, is a constant danger to your happiness. Perhaps some day your body will be terribly sick, and though you want to walk or do other things that you used to do in your younger or healthier days, you find you cannot do them; it is a terrible disillusionment for the soul. Before that day comes, make yourself so free that you can look on your body with detachment, caring for it as though it were somebody else's. One of my students had a very painful condition in her knee in which the bones were decaying. I don't know how many times that leg was operated upon and put back together again. But she talked of it as though it were nothing: \"It is a minor operation,\" she would say casually. Now that is the way to take life. Cultivate that state of mind by which you can live with greater mental strength. Even when you do not have the opportunity to meditate long or deeply, always think that you are working for God. When your mind can remain anchored in Him, you will not suffer anymore,- no amount of disease or illness will be able to touch you inwardly. Sometimes when this body gives trouble, I look within and everything vanishes in the light of God. Just as you see the moving pictures on the. screen and enjoy the contrasting conflict between good and evil actions and between the joyful and sorrowful scenarios, so you shall be entertained by this world. You shall say, \"Lord, whatever You do is all right.\" But until you consciously realize that this is all a dream, you will not see why God created this world. Be Like the Active-Inactive Lord I think that in bringing forth the universe God wanted to keep busy. Let this be an incentive to spiritual aspirants. Many"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"38 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION think that to find God and get away from this dream they have to forsake their responsibilities and seek seclusion in the Hi- malayas or other such totally solitary places; but that is not so simple. The mind will still be absorbed in its moods and rest- lessness, and the body will have to be very active just to keep warm and satisfy its hunger and other needs. It is easier to find God in the jungle of civilization if you follow a balance between meditation and constructive, dutiful work. Be like the active- inactive Lord. In creation He is joyously busy,- beyond creation He is joyously quiescent in divine bliss. Because I made the ef- fort to find God in meditation, I am enjoying His bliss even in the midst of activity. And thus activity doesn't adversely affect me at all. Even though I may say I don't like this or that in the dualities around me, still within I am calm and like steel: \"Calmly active and actively calm; a prince of peace sitting on the throne of poise directing the kingdom of activity.\" To all appearances, it seems that out of perfection God cre- ated imperfect beings. But in truth, imperfect beings are per- fect—souls made in God's image. All God wants you to do is separate your dream imperfections from your perfect Self. When you think about your mortal life and all your troubles and identify with them, you do an injustice to the image of God within you. Affirm and realize, \"I am not a mortal being; I am Spirit.\" God is ever trying to draw His children back to their in- herent perfection. That is why you will see even in evil people there is a search for God, though it may not be pronounced as such. Can you find an evil person who wants to derive misery from his actions? No. He thinks his pursuits are going to give him a good time. The man who drinks or takes dope thinks he will get pleasure from it. Everywhere you will see people, good and evil, searching in their own way for happiness. No one wants to hurt himself. Then why do people behave in an evil way that is bound to cause pain and sorrow? Such actions arise from the greatest of all sins—ignorance. \"Wrongdoer\" is the right word rather than \"sinner.\" You may condemn wrongdoing but should not condemn the doer. Sins are errors committed un- der the influence of ignorance, or delusion. But for a different degree of understanding, you might be in the same boat. Jesus"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"A WORLD OF COSMIC ENTERTAINMENT 39 said, \"He that is without sin among you, let him cast a stone.\"* The point is, in everything we do we are seeking happi- ness. No one can truthfully say he is a materialist, because anyone who is seeking happiness is seeking God. Therefore, in evil as well as in good God is coaxing us back to Him by our search for happiness. The sorrow inflicted by evil will eventually turn the wayward to the joys of virtue. Since life is inherently a medley of good and evil, of beautiful dreams and nightmares, we should seek out and help to create the beauti- ful dreams and not get caught up in the frightful nightmares. In the Diversity of Creation There Is an Inherent Unity From His one consciousness, God created the many. And now He is trying to bring the many back into Oneness again. When the storm is upon the ocean, it creates innumerable waves. When the storm dies down, the waves sink back into the ocean. In the diversity of creation there is an inherent unity— as the ocean is the essence of the waves. Family consciousness bonds groups of souls together. Countries have a leader to unite and direct them. Social groups cohere in a common cause. When you find God, you will see all forces united in Him. \"Then life is sweet and death a dream,- health is sweet and sickness a dream; praise is sweet and blame a dream—when Thy song flows through me.\"t You will have a whole different picture of life. In reacting to life, most people either say, \"Praise the Lord,\" or urge us to be afraid of Him,- and some blame or curse Him. I think this is very foolish. What can you say to God that will be praise? He is not moved by praise or flattery, because He has everything. Most prayers are offered by people who are in trouble,- some cry out, \"Praise the Lord,\" hoping for some favor thereby. You may curse or praise the Lord; it will not make any difference to Him. But it will make a difference in you. Praise Him—or better still, love Him—and you will feel better. Curse Him and it reacts to hurt you.

When you go against that na- ture, you automatically punish yourself. From my childhood I was rebellious at life, because I saw so much injustice. But now the only rebellion I feel within me is that people do not know God. The greatest sin is ignorance— not to know what life is all about. And the greatest virtue is wisdom—to know the meaning and purpose of life and its Creator. To know that we are not little human beings, but that we are one with Him, is wisdom. Every night in sleep God takes away all of your troubles to show you that you are not a mortal being; you are Spirit. God wants you to remember that truth during the conscious state, so that you are not bothered any more by the anomalies of life. If we can very well exist at night in deep sleep without thinking about this world and its troubles, we can very well ex- ist in God's world of activity without being caught up in this dream. Even though dream universes are floating in God's consciousness, He is ever awake and knows He is dreaming. He tells us, \"Do not get panicky during this daydream; look to Me as the Reality behind the dream.\" When there is health and joy, smile in the dream. When there is a nightmare of sickness or sorrow, say, \"I am awake in God, merely watching the play of my life.\" Then you will know that God has cre- ated this universe as an entertainment for Himself. And you, being made in His image, have not only the perfect right but also the ability to enjoy this play with its varying dreams even as He does. Desire is what holds you in mortal bondage. If you want a big home on a hill with a view, a nice income, a good mar- riage and family, you may wear yourself out striving to get these things,- then perhaps your spouse leaves you for some- body else, or you get sick, or your business fails—that is the na- ture of human happiness. Therefore, I say to God, \"Lord, You can keep all of Your earthly baubles. Let only Thy will be done through me. I am willing to follow whatever be Your will.

Dismiss this phantasma of disease and health, sorrow and joy. Rise above it. Become the Self. Watch the show of the universe, but do not become absorbed in it. Many times I have seen my body gone from this world. I laugh at death. I am ready anytime. There is nothing to it. Eternal life is mine. I am the ocean of consciousness. Sometimes I become the little wave of the body, but I am never just the wave without the Ocean of God. Death and darkness cannot cast fear upon us, for we are the very Consciousness out of which this universe has been created by God. In the Bhagavad Gita the Lord says: Whoever realizes Me to be the Unborn and Beginningless as well as the Sovereign Lord of Creation—that man has conquered delusion and attained the sinless state even while wearing a mortal body. I am the Source of everything; from Me all creation emerges. With this realization the wise, awestricken, adore Me.

Somehow, God has all the power of the universe at His command; but why does He have this power? Why is God God? Why aren't you God? You will rack your brain when you try to think in this way. That there is a God, an absolute In- telligence and Power, we cannot rationally deny. The testi- mony of Jesus, Krishna, Buddha, and the saints cannot be questioned. From the ideals they exemplified and the miracles they performed, we know they were speaking truth. They gave irrefutable testimony that God is ; and that He is perfect and almighty. They have told us that God is Joy, and God is Love. But if this be so, why did He create such an imperfect world, and an imperfect body for man? We think that if we had the power God has, we could create a much better body than this, and a much better world—at least in our imagination we think we could! Jesus said, \"He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do.\"* How did he know, twenty centuries ago, the \"miracles\" of modern science that are commonplace today—we see how by radar man can determine the presence and location of things thousands of miles away. A soldier told me that the first time he believed in God was when he saw radar at work.

So there is a reason why God threw the cloak of maya, the limiting power of delusion, upon man. Man's Power Is Nothing Compared to God's It seems that as soon as man gains power, he misuses it. Al- ready they are speaking of push-button war, in which one has only to press a button and atomic bombs will destroy nations. Just imagine, New York City, with all its millions of people, can be finished with one bomb! God has given great power to man that he might use it rightly. Even so, man's power is nothing, compared to God's, because this whole world is an atomic bomb that God holds in His hands. If any individual, or the leader of any nation, thinks he can get away with using bombs, he is very much mistaken, for the words of Christ are still true: \"...all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.\"* If aggressive countries fight one another, they shall be wiped away, and the meek nations shall inherit the earth, t We must use spiritual force, not atomic bombs, or we are go- ing to perish. It is evident that in the storehouse of nature are hidden many secrets. Though the atomic bomb is a terrible thing, still it shows that there are inconceivable powers locked in the heart of nature—powers that man has yet to discover. And behind all these is a God. There is an Infinite Intelligence that governs all creation. That Intelligence works through divine law that cooperates with good and punishes evil. Why else is it that Hitler, who first had the secret of building the atomic bomb, lost it, and it came instead into the hands of America?

Why, then, did God in His almightiness create such an imperfect world, and give man the power to destroy? If you were God, you would know exactly what is going on, and why this universe was created as it is. When you are reading a very interesting novel, you see good and evil contradicting each other, and you think it is terrible when evil is winning. For instance, in one chapter the hero is about to be killed; but in the next, everything is straightened out and he is saved. You must understand that each life is a master novel written by God. It is not up to you to try to fathom it; you will be defeated by the limitations of your may a- deluded intelligence. First conquer delusion and become one with God; then you will realize why He created this world. But we do have a right to ask Him why. And there are many, many reasons. First of all, it could not be that this earth is a ne- cessity to Him, because in that case God would be imperfect; He would have something to attain from it. But we have the testi- mony of the saints that He is perfect; and I give testimony from my own experience, for I have communed with Him. Even though I had had visions and other spiritual experiences before I met my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, I told him I wouldn't talk about God to others unless I knew Him. When I saw those vi- sions I had experienced coming true, I knew that a Being was guiding me, and I began to see Him in all things. This World Is God's Hobby Since God is perfect and this earth is not a necessity for His evolution, it is therefore a sort of hobby to God. For exam- ple, there are two kinds of artists: one type is the commercial artist who makes art pay,- and the other type is one who creates gossamer wings of art with no market value, simply for the per- sonal enjoyment of it. Now we cannot think of God as com- mercial, for He has nothing to gain from His art of creation.

When I visited there as his guest, I said, \"Your farm is not paying for itself, is it?\" He replied, \"That's right. This egg I am eating cost me ninety cents. I could get one in the market for a few pennies.\" So this world is God's hobby. But it is not any fun for those who are suffering in it. I often say to the Lord, \"If You wanted a hobby, why did You create pain and cancer and terrible emo- tions as part of it?\" Of course, I am not in the world to dictate to the Lord. I know that. But I humbly fight with Him. He laughs at me, and says, \"In the last chapter, all will know the answer to these questions.\" Well, I know the answer, but I argue on behalf of those who don't: \"It may be a play to You, Lord, but it is misery and death to those who don't know it is just a play.

Or someone who has made lots of money thinks he is happy and then sees the stock market crash, and in despair jumps out the window—how terrible! And in the sense traps of sex, wine, and money there is temptation not only from outside, but from within. How is man going to justify all this? And why are there gangsters, and persons who are insane, and all kinds of dreadful goings-on, Lord? Why are there germs that kill so many people every year? If the bones of those who die of disease were heaped together, the pile would be as high as the Himalayas,- and yet it is a hobby to You, God. What about those who are victims of Your hobby?\" And the Lord says, \"I have made all men in My image. If you know you are a part of Me, you can live in this world and enjoy it as I do.\" That is the ultimate answer. We do not see this world as God sees it. Seeing With the Open Eyes of Wisdom and Calmness I will give you an example of how things went wrong in creation. If right now in this room I suddenly close my eyes and start dancing wildly, forgetting everything around me and the limitations of my blindness, you will call out to me, \"Be careful! You will fall or bump something!\" But I insist, \"No, I am all right.\" Then I do stumble and fall and break my leg; and"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"46 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION I cry and ask, \"Why did this happen to me?\" You will answer, \"Well, why did you close your eyes and try to dance in the dark- ness?\" Then I reply, \"Oh, my goodness. Why did I dance with my eyes closed?\" Because your eyes are closed, you cannot help thinking this world is terrible. But if you keep open your eyes of wisdom and calmness, you will see there is a lot of enjoyment in this world—just as though you are watching a motion picture. When you go to a movie, you like to see a happy picture, or one that makes you feel good, because life itself is so trou- blesome. But according to the cosmic motion-picture theory of this earth drama, the historic revolutions and wars and man's troubles are justified, because if you go to a picture show every day and see only love scenes, you would get tired of them. You would want to see some action, some contrast and excitement. Therefore, God is justified in creating the dualities of this earth. He didn't want this drama to be stale. If there were only an- gels, it would be a very tiresome play,* where there is a villain and a hero, it is more entertaining. The contrasts were made to help us realize that this drama is only a cosmic movie, and that by translating our consciousness into God's consciousness, we could look upon this earth as He does. But I wouldn't want to be the villain, for crime doesn't pay—especially before the inexorable cosmic law. I would rather be somewhere sitting under a tree, absorbed in meditation on God, or be busy serving others to make them comfortable with true peace and happiness. For although life is governed by a cos- mic plan, we have freedom to change our part in the drama. The point is, if you learn to see this world as a picture show, you will find nothing wrong with it. The only thing I complain about is that pain makes this picture seem so real. You wouldn't mind your hand being taken off if you didn't feel any pain and if you could put it back in place again. Some saints have shown that this is possible. For example, Jesus carried out his prophecy when he said, \"Destroy this temple [the body], and in three days I will raise it up.\"* And when Pe- ter cut off the ear of the centurion, Christ restored it. By know- * John 2:19 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"WHY GOD CREATED THE WORLD 47 ing the Lord, Jesus had the power to remake the body. Science concentrates on making more material comforts for man,* but when disease comes, and the doctor says, \"It is all over,\" you can't do anything about it. And then how do you feel? Helpless. But the masters say you don't have to feel that way. This world will seem an unjust creation if you keep your eyes of wisdom closed. You must realize that you are God's child, and if you are in tune with Him you will see this earth as a picture—as God's hobby. Then you can live in this world without being affected by it all. It is those who take it too seriously who suffer. And because of that suffering, they don't understand why God created this earth. When a mother hears of the loss of somebody else's baby she feels sympathetic. But when it is her own baby, she suffers great anguish. When you transform your consciousness into divine consciousness so that you feel for everyone else's well-being as you feel for yourself, when all the world becomes your greater self, you will become completely dissociated from the sufferings of your lit- tle body. You will behold creation as a sort of dramatic experi- ence in which nothing can hurt you. Free Choice—God's Greatest Gift We can say that God made this earth not only as a hobby, but also because He wanted to make perfect souls that would evolve back to Him. He sent them out under the cloak of delusion, or maya, but endowed with freedom. That is the greatest gift of God. He has not denied mankind the free choice that He Himself has. He has given man freedom to be good or evil, to do exactly as he pleases—even to deny God. Both good and evil exist, but nobody compels you to be evil unless you choose to practice evil; and nobody can compel you to be good unless you want to be good. God created us with the ability to exercise His gifts of intelligence and free choice, by which we can choose to go back to Him. God certainly means to take us back when we are ready to go. We are like the biblical prodi- gal son, and God is continuously calling to us to come Home. The ideal of every human life should be to be good, to be happy, and to find God. You will never be happy unless you do find God. That is why Jesus said, \"Seek ye first the kingdom of"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"48 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION God.\"* That is the purpose of our existence: that we strive to become good, to become perfect, and to use our free will to choose good instead of evil. God has given to us all the power we need to do so. The mind is like an elastic band. The more you pull, the more it stretches. The mind-elastic will never break. Every time you feel limitations, close your eyes and say to your- self, \"I am the Infinite,\" and you will see what power you have. No joy of the senses, no joy of possession, can match the joy of God. Though He had everything from eternity to eternity, He began to think, \"I am all-powerful, and Joy itself, but there is no one else to enjoy Me.\" And He thought, as He began to create: \"I will make souls in My image, and clothe them as hu- man beings with free choice, to see whether they will seek My material gifts and the temptations of money, wine, and sex; or whether they will seek the million million times more intoxi- cating joy of My consciousness.\" The point that gives me the most satisfaction is that God is very just and fair. He gave man freedom to accept His love and live in His joy, or to cast it aside and live in delusion, in ignorance of Him. Though all created things belong to God, there is one thing God hasn't—our love. When He created us, He did have some- thing to attain, and that is our love. We can withhold that love, or give it to Him. And He will wait endlessly until we are ready to offer our love to Him. When we do, when the prodigal son comes Home, the fatted calf of wisdom is killed and there is much rejoicing. When a soul returns to God, there actually is rejoicing among all the saints in heaven. This is the meaning of the parable of the prodigal son as told by Jesus. Watch Yourself From the Balcony of Introspection There is so much more to life than what you think. Since everything earthly seems so real, how much more so must be the Reality that creates this unreal reality! But the unreal real- ity makes you forget the Real. God wants you to remember that you wouldn't mind this earth if it were like a motion pic- ture. Even if the brittle bones of the body break, you would say, * Matthew 6:33 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"WHY GOD CREATED THE WORLD 49 \"Well, look at those broken bones,\" and not feel any disturbance or suffering. You can say that when you are anchored in the Di- vine Consciousness. You will make fun of your habits, and you will be intensely amused at your distinguishing characteristics, as from the balcony of introspection you watch yourself perform in the motion picture of life. I do that all the time. When you know this world to be God's lila —His play—then you aren't upset by the contrasts in this drama of good and evil. In a dream you can behold rich people, poor people, some- one strong, someone else groaning with disease, someone dy- ing, and someone being born. But when you wake up, you real- ize that it was only a dream. This universe is God's dream. And when I ask Him, \"Why do You not dream only beautiful dreams? Why must Your play be fraught with nightmares?\" He replies, \"You must be able to enjoy both the nightmares and the beau- tiful experiences for what they are—dreams, only dreams. But if you dream only beautiful dreams, you will be drowned in that beauty, and never wish to wake up.\" That is the answer. So you must not be frightened when nightmares come, but say, \"Lord, it is a passing dream. It has no reality.\" And when you are smil- ing with health and happiness, say, \"Lord, it is a beautiful dream, but do what You like with my dreams of life.\" When you are nei- ther touched by the nightmares of disease and suffering and wor- ries, nor bound by the beautiful dreams, then God says, \"Wake up, now! Come back Home.\" So watch this universe like a picture-play, as do the mas- ters who are awake in God. They are very much interested in those souls who try to escape this dream. God wants everyone to get out of this nightmare, and watch this cosmic motion picture as an entertainment. He wants you to know that you are one with Him. That is why from time to time He sends God- realized souls to earth to help mankind. When people get too Sroggy with nightmares, these souls^eome to wake us up, to shake us and say, \"What is the matter with you? You are dream- ing.\" And you cry, \"No, no, my leg is broken,\" or, \"I am suf- fering with disease,\" or, \"I am drowned in poverty.\" But when, through the blessings of the great ones, you open your eyes, you see it is a dream."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"50 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION Separate the Unreal From the Real As a little boy, I used to dream that a tiger was after me ; I would cry out that the tiger had caught my leg.

Your leg is all right.\" As a result of that childhood dream I had the first wonderful expe- rience that God gave to me: The last time I had that dream, I said, \"That is an old trick. There is no tiger after my leg.\" And I quickly jumped out of the dream. It went away and never re- turned. From that time on I was watchful, even in dreams, to separate the unreal from the Real. Saints are those who are half awake and half dreaming: on one side awake in God, and on the other side dreaming the dream of incarnation. But they can quickly get out of this dream. When my body feels some hurt or pain, I focus my eyes and my mind here at the Kutastha, or Christ-consciousness center, between the eyebrows, and then I feel no pain; and in a little while I don't even see or feel the body. So remember, God is dreaming this world. And if we are in tune with Him, we will live a divinely intoxicated life and nothing will disturb us.

Everything has come out of God and must go back to Him. Even in evil, man is seeking happi- ness. Worldly happiness inevitably leads to disillusionment; but those who go on seeking, throwing away one after the other the shining glass-bits of pleasures of the world, will at long last find the diamond of true happiness in God. Satisfac- tion will never come from anything less than God. Since the various paths of life take you to God eventually in the set course of evolution, if you have self-control and lead a nor- mal, rational life and try to seek true happiness it is all right to keep on in this average way. But it may take you many, many incarnations. It is better to make a conscientious effort to hasten your attainment of God.

If you pray until the ether churns with the light of your prayer, then you will find God. But if while you are praying for God to come, you are thinking of something else— that is, wanting God because you want something from Him— you won't find Him. Your purpose of seeking God must be straight, and your efforts intensified by the sense of necessity for God that you awaken in yourself. Religious Superstition Has Taught People to Be Afraid of God You trust yourself more than you trust God, and yet you know that in the ultimate sense you cannot breathe or walk or move without the direct impelling force of His presence in the brain, in the heart, in the cells of the body. Just because you have become accustomed to dependence on food, air, and sunshine, you think these externals support your life. It is a delusion to think so. You are directly dependent on One Power, which is God. Because He is the All-Supreme, religious superstition has taught people to be afraid of God. That is not the relationship you want with your Heavenly Father. I don't give you the hellfire-and-brimstone gospel. I want to teach you that God is your own: dearer than the dearest, nearer than the nearest, more loving than all things that we love. If you would but treat Him that way! If you would but lift one hand, He would drop two hands to lift you up. If you are unceasing in grasping for the hand of Spirit, He will come without fail.

If you have that trust and if you love Him more, you shall feel that He has loved you always and that it was you who didn't seek Him. That is why you thought He was away. He is never indifferent to us ; we are in- different to Him. God is compassionately aware that He has sent us here into this troublesome world; and if He cares for the sparrows that are sold for a farthing,* how much more does He care for us. Only He wants to be sure of our love, so He plays hide-and-seek with us. God has an inferiority complex; He is not sure whether the devotee truly wants Him or something else. I tell Him of- ten, \"Lord, if they only knew how wonderful You are, they would seek You. But You keep yourself hidden in the flowers, in the clouds, in the ether.\" Yet when you look at the beauty and wonders of nature, how can you doubt God? He works in everything, and His tools are life and intelligence. Just as ships at sea can be controlled by radio, so are we controlled by the \"radioed\" power and intelligence of God. Without His beam of life, we are dead. Why not seek that Power which is the source of our being? Why not seek the Giver instead of the gifts? That is where the real freedom lies. He is working right within your brain cells and your thoughts. If you would but contact Him within, you would find a Friend who is unfailing, a Lover who never lies. It is God alone who is pursuing you with His love, and who is seeking you right within you. If you would seek Him willingly, if you would pursue Him within, you would find Him. It is only the misuse of your free will and the resistance of your karma, the effects of past wrong actions, that prevent the quickening of your footsteps toward the Divine Goal. The Law of Attraction Inherent in Creation Setting aside the old superstitious beliefs, we should find out why we should seek God. When we look at the processes * Matthew 11:29 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"54 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION of nature, we will see why. So I shall discuss today's subject from an entirely different standpoint—from the standpoint of science and of metaphysics. You will see what a wonderful analogy there is between the descension of the universe from God and the ascension of the universe back to God. Inherent in creation is the law of attraction. Celestial bod- ies exert their gravitational attraction on one another; human beings are subject to the pull of good or evil. Many persons take to drink or to various other evil diversions; the saints are intoxicated with God. The man who turns from the church to the bar in the village inn is drinking unhappiness, destruction of health, and loss of keenness of mind; but he who goes into the church within himself and quaffs the inspiration of bliss that flows from the vintage keg of silence is ever happy. So goes the search for the Infinite. When you understand the law of gravitation, you can understand the best way to tune in with the pull of God, and therefore the best way to find Him. Gravity's effect is seen when two bodies are free to move and they are drawn toward each other. Gravitation, according to phys- ical science, is that attraction which exists between masses of matter—by virtue of which every such mass tends toward every other mass with a force varying directly as the product of the masses, and inversely as the square of their distances apart. That is, if the distance between two masses is one foot, the attraction will be relatively strong; and if the distance is increased to two feet, the attraction will be only one-fourth as powerful. The law of gravity is universal, the same in the earth as in the sun—and in all objects in space. The sun gravitates the earth and the other solar planets and keeps them whirling around it. The earth gravitates the moon. The attraction of the earth for the bodies on its surface is the same as the earth's attraction toward the moon. The only difference is that the gravitational effect of the earth on the moon is reduced by the square of the distance from the moon to the earth's core. The mass of both objects, and the distance between them, determines the force of gravity. Gravity is not a one-sided pull, but the pull between two objects. Just follow this analogy. It will come to a beautiful spiritual understanding. Imagine, for example, that here are two bodies. You pull at"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"HOW GOD IS PULLING US BACK TO HIM 55 one and it comes toward you, but if that body is pulling away from you with a force equal to your pulling, then there is a bal- ance. The moon, by centrifugal force, is pulling away from the earth; but the gravitational attraction of the earth toward the moon keeps a balance. It is evident that the same force of grav- ity has given balance to the entire universe, so that the pull ex- erted by each object on every other maintains an orderly balance; otherwise all things would have flown apart in infinite space. On the other hand, if gravity were the sole force at work in the cos- mos, everything would have melted into one mass of matter. God's Forces of Attraction and Repulsion at Work in Cosmic Creation With a giant telescope, 6,000 stars were visible in one small part of space,- and though they seemed like little dots in the sky, most of them are 100 times bigger than the sun! Just think how immense God is, that the whole universe is con- tained in only a fragment of His being! The Lord seems to be having a lot of fun playing with these marbles in the sky. Creation came into being by the power of repulsion by which God sent forth from Himself His creative forces. By this outgo- ing creative power, God is repulsing us and the world of matter away from Himself, and yet at the same time He has instilled in His creation the force of His pull to draw us back into Him- self—which is much greater. If God didn't pull us we would be completely thrown into matter for unending incarnations. From the study of theogony we learn that many ancient cul- tures ascribed the beginning of creation to the descent of gods, or celestial creative forces. The ancient Parsis, for example, be- lieved in the gods Ormuzd (or Ahura Mazda) and Ahriman, who evolved themselves out of primordial matter and were the two deities who created, respectively, good and evil. The origin of the material world is illustrated in the Egyptian notion of a cosmic egg, made by the god Ptah, out of which creation issues. According to the Hindu belief, Brahma* is the eternal self- * The Sanskrit rendering of Brahma with a short a at the end, as in this con- text, denotes God's all-inclusive Creative Consciousness, not the circum- scribed concept of the personal \"Brahma-the-Creator\" of the Brahma-Vishnu-"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"56 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION existent Being—Spirit, the Immutable Absolute—which un- folds Itself into creation by condensing a finite portion of Its con- sciousness into causal, astral, and material objects through the gradations of subtle creative vibratory elements of ether, air, fire, water, and earth. Spirit's consciousness as immanent in cre- ation as the Creator is the world Soul out of whom all souls have come. This Brahma, the transcendental ever-existing Intelli- gence, emanates a hierarchy of individual creative intelligences. In the Sankhya doctrine of evolution of matter, we follow the chain of causes back to the principal creative intelligence, the unlimited eternal Primordial Nature, or Maha-Prakriti. Out of this principle, or Original Nature, all existences have issued, and into it they will return.* This primordial creative Nature is en- dowed with its own volition to carry out the development of cre- ation. Its first emanation as plastic Nature contained the origi- nal Soul or deity, Prajapati, out of which all individual souls have issued—the first physical beings were called Swayambhuva Manu (\"man born of the Creator\") and Shatarupa (\"having a hundred images or forms\"), just as Adam and Eve are the sym- bolic first man and woman of the Judeo-Christian tradition. Though the Hindu concept refers to the creative intelli- gences as deities, they are understood to be none other than individualized aspects of the one Spirit. God transforms Him- self into these intelligences and then into matter and human beings, just as our consciousness can transform itself into a dreamland wherein we can see and experience everything as though it were real—human beings, earth scenes, plants, ani- mals, and so on. But when we wake up we see they were all made of one dreaming consciousness. Shiva triad (which is rendered with a long a at the end, Brahma). See Brahma- Vishnu-Shiva and Brahman in glossary. * \"I am the Source of everything; from Me all creation emerges. With this real- ization the wise, awestricken, adore Me\" (Bhagavad Gita X:8). \"At the end of a cycle ( kalpa ), O Arjuna! all beings return to the unmanifested state of My Cos- mic Nature (Prakriti). At the beginning of the next cycle, again I cast them forth. By revivifying Prakriti, Mine own emanation, again and again I produce this host of creatures, all subject to the finite laws of Nature\" (Bhagavad Gita EX:7-8). The \"Big Bang\" theory of modern science provides an interesting parallel to Hindu cosmology."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"HOW GOD IS PULLING US BACK TO HIM 57 The magical power by which God differentiates His infinite consciousness into finite dream images and gives them a dream reality is called maya, cosmic delusion. A tug of gravitation ex- ists between God and maya and man. God is pulling man and maya is pulling man, and man is free to move toward either. God and man, God and cosmic delusion, are all pulling on each other. God is pulling creation, including man, toward Himself; and material man and nature are pulling away from God. What- ever exerts a gravitational pull toward God is \"good.\" Whatever pulls beings away from God is \"evil.\" There is a sort of balance when neither good nor evil predominate. But sometimes that bal- ance is lost, as when man turns toward evil and pulls far away from God so that he feels less and less attraction to the Divine. But no one can pull away from God completely. The stronger gravity of God will gradually draw the soul back to Him again, though it may take innumerable incarnations to do so. When you shoot an arrow, it travels with its force until that force dissipates and gravity causes it to fall back to earth. In the same way, we were propelled from God, and our desires are the force that keeps us moving away from Him, coursing through the sky of reincarnations. God's gravity may seem to have failed us, but He is constantly pulling us toward an in- evitable return to Him. When our desires will be exhausted, then we will be drawn toward God again by the power of His gravity. How the Thoughts of God Evolve Into Matter Now, thought is the most elastic of forces because it is the finest vibration of consciousness. You can divide thoughts into smaller and smaller units and you will never be able to reach the end. Conversely, you can increase in size, for example, a mental concept of the earth, expanding it throughout eternity, and still you will never be able to exhaust infinity. So God's first expres- sion of creation is of vibratory consciousness—thoughtrons, or small units of thought. These first thoughts became positive and negative, because no creation is possible at all without duality. Without good and evil, light and shadows, only God's undiffer- entiated consciousness would remain. So God projected out of Himself units of positive and nega- tive thoughts from which everything is created, just as a dream"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"58 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION is created by units of thought. First, a world of ideas came into being: the causal universe. Then those units of thought became lifetrons, the substance of an astral world of finer-than-atomic forces. * Then lifetrons became condensed into the material cre- ation consisting of positive and negative protons and electrons, atoms, molecules, cells, and so on. Atomic physics demonstrates that all things in the material cosmos are made of atoms that vary in weight, density, power, size, and configuration and have within them the qualities necessary to inform the infinite vari- eties of matter and life. But science has yet to recognize the lifetronic power and thoughtronic intelligence behind the atomic building blocks that—in accord with God's cosmic laws wielded by Maha-Prakriti, Primordial Nature—combine them to produce mineral, vegetable, animal, and human forms. Evolution Versus Involution When God saw that He had driven these elements of cre- ation out of Himself—from the finest to the grossest forms— the process of involution began to work. From the standpoint of our subject today, think of evolution as going away from God and involution as going back to God. For every process of evolution there is a process of involution. As God's creative thoughts assumed their grossest form in matter, then involu- tion began. The process of involution is going on all the time. God's dreaming consciousness manifests first in the stones, or inert minerals. It then begins to stir in the sensitivity of plants, but has no self-consciousness. Then come all forms of sentient life in the animal kingdom. The innate vitality and conscious- ness then finds expression in man, with his superior intelligent power to reason and discriminate. And finally, in the superman the superconsciousness of God is fully reflected. Thus does creation go away from God, and then come back to Him again. God will give salvation not only to man, but to the planets, the earth, the stars—everything that has worked so hard for billions of years to provide a stage for a cosmic dream drama. Going back to God by the involutionary procedure of Nature is a very slow process. But the discriminating man eventually * See astral world and causal world in glossary."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"HOW GOD IS PULLING US BACK TO HIM 59 asks, \"Why wait millions of years before I can return to God?\" He reasons that he didn't ask to be created in the first place—that God created him without his permission and therefore He should release him. He refuses to wait longer. When that desire comes, man has made the first definitive turn back to God. When you truly want to be released from this earth dream, there is no power that can stop you from attaining liberation. Never doubt it! Your salvation is not to be achieved—it is al- ready yours, because you are made in the image of God; but you have to know this. You have forgotten it. The musk deer madly seeks the fragrant musk everywhere, and in its frantic search carelessly slips to its death from the high mountain crags. Had the foolish deer only turned its nose to the musk pouch within itself, it would have found that which it sought. Similarly, we have only to turn within ourselves to find our salvation in the realization that our true Self, the soul, is made in God's image. Manifesting the Divine Qualities Inherent in the Five Stages of the Soul's Return to God Man has evolved through aeons. In order to quicken his evolution—his involution back to God—he has to make an ef- fort to stimulate the process of natural evolution. He does this outwardly to better his physical existence. For example, man was created by nature to use his feet for locomotion. The process was too slow and too limited in distance, so he used animals to ride on. Then he invented the car, and the airplane, and so on. Now, why shouldn't we likewise accelerate our soul's evolution? The soul of man has to ascend through the five states, or stages of evolution, previously described, before he gets back to God: mineral, plant, animal, man, and super- man. He is to accumulate unto himself the divine qualities inherent in each stage. 1. He must be transparent like the gems, without spots of de- fective perception. He has to develop their crystalline character, by removing the mental blemishes in his other- wise sparkling mentality. His thinking and perception should have gemlike clarity that will undistortedly re-"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"60 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION fleet the Divine Mind. This means his sensations must be pure. Misuse or overindulgence of any sense creates flaws in the sensibilities. But if the gem of one's sentient men- tality is unclouded, one then develops spiritual sensitivity. 2. The spiritually progressive man is consciously sensitive to life and his surroundings, like the sensitive response of plants to their environment. But as the sensitivity of plants abhors harshness, the spiritually sensitive being shuns the coarseness of material things and finds himself gravitating toward God, as plants turn toward the sun. 3. Then comes the vitality of animals. Though they may have great strength and will power, they do not know how to use these energies intelligently. The progressive man must be full of vitality like the animal, but employ the animal's strong will, not for avaricious purposes, but to govern activity with self-control and to have mastery over the life force. When the vital force is always engaged in something good and worthwhile, and is not dissipated in bad habits or the abuse of sex, then man is going to- ward God. But as soon as he gives in to plainly indiscrim- inate animalistic instincts, he is going toward matter. That is the common happening we see everywhere. The yogi, on the other hand, learns how to use vitality and will with wisdom. He is not weak. He is a master of self-control. He knows how to relax and throw the searchlight of vi- tality within to reveal the presence of Spirit. The reversal of the life force from matter to Spirit is called pianayama. By withdrawing the life current from externals through Kriya Yoga, the consciousness begins inwardly to awaken to its higher nature in God. 4. The rational man thereby becomes a thoughtful, discrimi- native being, ever progressive in his power to think and rea- son clearly.

So many people try to win their points by argument, but I let them have a sense of victory right away. There is no use talking to them. \"Fools argue, wise men discuss.\" When we conversed with Master [Swami Sri Yukteswar] it was a communion bound by pure reason and blessed by his wisdom. The masters cling to truth, not theories. But most people are enslaved by emotion and circumscribed by their own opinions. If two people really want to find truth, they can agree very quickly. It is only by developing both pure reason and pure feel- ing that you can reach God and truth. In the ordinary man, reason is uppermost and feeling is hidden; in the average woman, feeling is uppermost with reason hidden. If you have too much feeling, it becomes emotion and will take you into the meshes of matter; and too much reason be- comes rationalization which also takes you into delusive matter. When you balance reason and feeling by medita- tion, you will come to God and truth-perceptions. By an interchange of these qualities, man and woman can help to balance in each other pure reason and pure feeling, thus helping each other toward union with God. But mar- riage is not the only way. By successful meditation one attains this balance within himself, or herself, for it is al- ready there, hidden in the soul. 5. After developing the balanced reason and feeling of the dis- criminative stage, the last state of involution is to be at- tained: the pure intuition and omniscience of the super- man. He is intuitively progressive in feeling his soul and Spirit. He must then fully lift his consciousness from the body and materiality to his original omnipresent state. The freed soul is back once more with God. You can develop in yourself all these finer qualities by which God is processing matter once again into Spirit. You can hasten this process in your own body by spiritualizing it through meditation and Kriya Yoga. You will see your body changing into a mass of light, atoms of condensed electromagnetic energy."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"62 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION When you gravitate toward God, those luminous atoms are re- alized to be naught else than the vibratory thoughts of God— the compressed consciousness of Spirit. The Paths of Knowledge, Devotion, and Action Of different prescribed paths that lead to God, I will show you how the law of spiritual gravity is applied to the ways of knowledge, devotion, and action. According to how you apply the principles of these paths, you are pulled either by Spirit or by matter. The path of knowledge, or reason. If you program your- self with theoretical knowledge, you will become a walking victrola, able to repeat lofty phrases and to be considered a learned being, but your knowledge will be unsupported by your own realization or spiritual attainment. Such intellectualiza- tion keeps the ego tied to the physical faculties of mind and its relation to matter. Theoretical knowledge cannot give you realization about God. So don't waste your time on too much theory. Those who do so become lost in the jungle of reason and never get beyond mere theories. In the process of reason- ing and reasoning they never perceive truth, for truth is beyond reason. Most intellectualists thus become bound by their own conclusions. If you use your power of reason only to make money and seek material gain, again you will gravitate toward matter. So the masters say: Do not use your God-given reason to become more and more mixed up in the labyrinth of matter and in the egoistic limitations of the intellect; with the power of discrimination, study and apply truth until it becomes your own intuitive realization. When you develop your intuition, you will feel the presence of God and His omniscience within you. That is called esoteric reason, or Jnana Yoga. The path of devotion. If you have pure devotion, you will feel the pull of God and will find Him. But again, there are two poles in this path also, two forces pulling you—devotion to God and devotion to matter. Even death tries to remind us that it is foolish to be lured by material attractions. The miser is de- voted to objects of matter and remains attached to them to the end, even though he at last has to leave everything behind. Yet,"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"HOW GOD IS PULLING US BACK TO HIM 63 to his final breath, he is just as devoted to material things as the yogi is to God. But the yogi reasons, \"Matter is external and possession of its objects is short-lived. Why should I concen- trate on the little temporal things and exclude eternity? Devo- tion to God alone is the only way to everlasting fulfillment.\" The consciousness of the worldly man is circumscribed; he is devoted to his body, his surroundings, and his family. His attachment says, \"Us four and no more.\" He should rather use that family affection as a lesson in learning to expand his love. As soon as you love not only your family, but give that love to all, you are going toward God. That is why Jesus said: \"Love thy neighbor as thyself.\" To use family affection for all, to give to the world the same love you have for self and family, is gravi- tation toward God. Lessen the consciousness of family, prop- erty, and all material attachments and begin to reexpress the omnipresence you have lost. In loving God, do not lose your devotion in emotion. This sometimes happens on the path of devotion. I was surprised to find \"holy rollers\" in this country. It began with certain sects in India. But when devotion is expressed in physical emotion, the pure quality of love is lost in the external expenditure of the life energy in the muscles. When the body and mind gravitate to- ward God, they become calm and quiet. The consciousness and life force become interiorized when one is inwardly with God. True devotion is like a plummet that sinks into the sea- bottom of the perception of God. That is Bhakti Yoga. The path of action. Some persons have a natural inclina- tion to be active; they love the motion of working and serv- ing. If you work for your own self you are pulled toward mat- ter. But if you work with the thought of doing everything for God, you are pulled toward God. When your activity centers only on making money for material advantages for yourself and your loved ones, or on any activity with a selfish end, you are going away from God. Thus do most people engage their ener- gies in their attachments and their desires for more and more material acquisitions. But as soon as your active energy is used to seek God, you move toward Him. You see, again, this constant pull from God and from matter. One side says make money for material satisfaction, and the other side says find"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"64 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION satisfaction in seeking God, in serving God, and in acquiring monetary success to help God's work of uplifting others spiri- tually, mentally, and physically. When you act for material gain you are yielding to the gravitational pull of matter. When you are acting for God, you are linked to the gravitational pull of God. If your desire for material things and for God are even, you will be more or less at a standstill. If your desire for God becomes greater, then your desire for material things will be lessened. Engaging in spiritual activity consisting of both medita- tion and working with the thought that everything you do is for God—that is Karma Yoga. When in meditation you feel God's bliss eternal, you will no longer feel tied to the body, and you will be filled with enthusiasm to work for Him. You can't be a lover of God and be lazy. One who meditates and loves God is always active for Him and for others. Work for God, Love God, Be Wise With God, and Realize Him Through Kriya Yoga Seeking union with God by wisdom alone, by devotion alone, or through action alone is one-sided. The far superior way is to take your mind and vital forces and all your desires, and your devotion and wisdom and service, and dissolve them all in God. When by Kriya Yoga you can withdraw your life energy and consciousness from the five sense telephones, when you can withdraw your vitality from your body and mind and throw the searchlight of your attention on God, that is the highest way to God. By Kriya Yoga, you shut off the senses at will and take your mind and life and vitality and sensibility and plunge into the Infinite. The person within whom the aurora borealis of Spirit is dancing—whether materially he possesses much or no outward glamour at all—he is the real soul. So, the easiest and best way to God is not to be limited only to fnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, or Karma Yoga, but to com- bine them. Work for God, love God alone, and be wise with God. Use your reason, not to become an overstuffed intellect, but to find God—gravitating toward intuitive wisdom gained in meditation and avoiding theoretical knowledge and materi- alistic rationalizing. Use your devotion not for worldly attach-"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"HOW GOD IS PULLING US BACK TO HIM 65 ment to things or people, but for finding God—absorbing yourself in devotion and ecstasy with God. And work not for yourself under any circumstances, but for God and to help others. The culmination of these lies in following the direct highway to God through practicing Kriya Yoga —listening to the cosmic sound of God's voice of Aum, * quieting the heart and breath which draw you toward body consciousness, and seeing His great light of omnipresence. Worshiping in the church or temple is a good habit, pro- vided you learn from that inspiration to go into your own tem- ple of meditation and ecstasy within. In the deepest hours of the night and in the quiet of the dawn, enter your inner cathe- dral and talk to your thought audiences, rousing all of them to be devoted to the Infinite. And on the grand organ in your temple of peace the great Aum will be played. Start tonight to meditate earnestly. Do not wander aim- lessly. Go straight to God. You have closed the gates to Heaven by gravitating toward matter and the body. Gravitate toward Him who is constantly pulling you. Go back to God. Remem- ber, the kingdom of God is within you. If you meditate and seek Him with wisdom, devotion, and good actions, you will surely find Him. * Aum, Amen, is the all-pervading sound emanating from the Holy Ghost (In- visible Cosmic Vibration,- God in His aspect of Creator); the voice of creation, testifying to the Divine Presence in every atom. Practice of pianayama tech- niques such as Kiiya Yoga induces a state of deep calmness in heart, breath, and other physiological functions. Freed from distractions of body conscious- ness, the mind is able inwardly to perceive and commune with the presence of God as Aum. (See Aum in glossary.)"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Acquiring Attunement With the Source of Success Self-Realization Fellowship Temple, * Los Angeles, California, January, 13, 1935 Very few people realize that divine law governs all actions and determines the effects thereof. Thus, the destiny of each individual is directed not by chance, but according to the causes he himself sets into motion. By spiritual realization, every cir- cumstance of one's life can be scientifically traced to a specific cause or pattern of causes. But because the ordinary person does not perceive how the law of action and reaction is governing his life, he believes that what comes to him is in large part a mat- ter of happenstance and fate. He often says: \"This was my good luck,\" or \"That's my unfortunate lot.\" There is no luck that one has not created before, in this or other incarnations; and there is no hapless fate except what has been \"predes- tined\" by one's own actions, here in the present or way in the past—sometimes many lives before entering the portals of this life. These self-created causes are why some people are born poor and others rich; some healthy and others sickly; and so on. Otherwise, where is the justice of God if He made all of His children equal, and then consigned some to live in favorable circumstances and others in unfavorable conditions? The law of cause and effect that governs our lives is what we call karma. Karma means action,- and it also means the fruits or effects of our actions. These effects, for good or ill, are what make it so hard for people to change themselves or their circumstances. There is no other explanation for the inequali- ties among humans that does not deny the justice of God. And * Self-Realization Fellowship services were held at this temple, at 711 Seven- teenth Street in Los Angeles, from December 1934 to September 1939.

If, then, your successes or failures have more or less been de- termined by yourself in the past, is there no remedy by which you can alter your present conditions? Yes, there is. Reason and will have been given to you. There is no difficulty that cannot be solved, provided you believe you have more power than your troubles, and you use that power to shatter your impediments. You have to make the scientific effort necessary to succeed. Success Means to Create at Will What You Need The typical concept of success focuses on having a lot of money. But real success means to have the power to create at will what you need—the power to acquire those things that are truly necessary for your absolute existence and happiness. It is important, therefore, to understand in what lies real neces- sity—to know the difference between needs and wants. If the perception of \"needs\" is boiled down, then the necessities for a happy life can be easily met. The ideal of balanced living is a middle path between the ideas of the East and the West. The East says: \"Meditate on God; never mind what you don't have.\" I think that is too ex- treme. At the other extreme, the West says: \"You must have a nice car and house, and new clothes, and everything that will make you comfortable and keep you entertained; it doesn't matter whether you can afford it or not.\" Luxury is the goal in the West; it is a habit, and the law of habit makes one bound to his accustomed ways. Simple living does not mean poverty or poverty conscious- ness. There are destitute people whose lives are miserable; that is not the ideal of simple living. Simplicity means to be free of de- sires and attachments, and supremely happy within. It requires a masterful mind and a very strong will to live simply. It entails neither hardship nor deprivation, but the wisdom to work for and be content with what you truly need. To spend money on fool- ish things, even if you have the means to do so, is weakness. Prac- tice self-control, and reduce your wants to purposeful necessities. And do not live beyond your means,- that is the first lesson to learn if you want to be prosperous. Spend less than your income; otherwise, you will never be satisfied and happy. Above all, hold"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"68 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION to the thought: \"My happiness is unconditional; I can do with- out anything. But since God has given me a body to look after, I shall do my best to supply it with the proper necessities of life.\" How grandly and simply the saints of India live. Possess- ing little, they are wealthy beyond the riches of kings. All na- ture begins to synchronize with them. Their complete inner sat- isfaction is what you should create within yourself—to learn to be happy with whatever you have. Of course, modern living requires more necessities than does residing in a hermit's hut. But instead of carrying with you through life an attachment to a lot of possessions, you should cultivate the power to acquire what you need when you need it. If you haven't that power, you are poor, no matter how much you possess. Even a Henry Ford or a Rockefeller may be said to be poor by that standard, be- cause needs do not consist only of physical necessities. No amount of money can assure health or happiness. Prosperity means uniform fulfillment for body, mind, and soul. Imagine, George Eastman, who invented the Kodak, had every material thing that anyone could desire. Think of it! He had luxury,- but there was something wrong with his prosperity, for which reason his existence was intolerable to himself. Conse- quently, he ended his life by sending a bullet through his head. Happiness can never come merely from wealth and possessions. Jesus Christ did not have any money. But he had the unlimited prosperity of God at his command. He demonstrated this many times, as on the occasion when he fed five thousand with five loaves of bread. And even when death came, its cruelty could not take away what he had inside. To the end he thought first of others: \"Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.\" To be all-round prosperous, you must follow the example of Jesus and not that of unscrupulous businessmen. If you learn to apply the divine law of prosperity, it will wait on you. That is the secure way,- it is the only condition in which you can be secure in this world. That wealth no robber can steal; it is the security that everyone needs. Cultivate Prosperity in Order to Help Others The law of prosperity cannot be manipulated by man for his own selfish advantage. The working of that law is con-"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"ACQUIRING ATTUNEMENT WITH THE SOURCE OF SUCCESS 69 trolled by God, and He doesn't permit His laws to be bent or broken arbitrarily. If man works in harmony with the divine law of success, he receives abundance; if by wrong actions he disrupts its generous flow into his life, he punishes himself. How are you to work in harmony with the principles of that divine law? First of all, as I said, leave behind desire for and attachment to luxuries; develop your mind power so that it is satisfied with simple things. After that, say: \"Well, my needs are only a part of my responsibility. I have dependents and must fulfill my obligations to them also.\" Provide for your family, but never spoil your children with too much money. Unless you include the welfare of others in your prosper- ity you will never be ideally prosperous. I do not mean just a disinterested giving of money to needy persons, but a sincere reaching out to help others help themselves. Then you will see a tremendous law of supply at work in your own life. No matter what your situation might be, that law of reaping the good that you sow will be always with you to help you. Most people think first and foremost about themselves, and about making money to satisfy their own desires. If you do that, sooner or later you are going to be deceived. Rather, you should start with this thought: \"My life's duty is to make others happy.\" Be motivated by how your actions and plans can be of benefit to others. Then devise the means to accomplish your goals. In order to serve, you must have the necessary re- sources. If you milk the cow you must feed the cow. The am- bition to live well and be prosperous becomes spiritualized if the purpose is to better serve others by being able to include them in your prosperity. In rendering good service, you are bound to get good returns; and when you get good returns, you can improve your own living standard and do even more for others. That is how the divine law works. Have Faith in the Power of God You are living directly by the power of God and not by human prosperity. You may argue that unless you have jobs you cannot eat. All right; but even if I put an abundance of food and money before you, and suddenly your heart fails, what good will those material things do you? None. It is God alone"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"70 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION who has given you life and the power to work and grow and accomplish. Your very existence is a manifestation of His will, so why shouldn't you depend directly on Him? You must absolutely remember that. If a need arises, I say, \"Well, I must get busy.\" But I nevei wish for anything or undertake any action without first seek- ing God's guidance: \"Father, I will reason, I will will, I wil] act, but guide Thou my reason, will, and activity to the right thing that I should do.\" Then all the forces of fulfillment work with me. In little things and in big things I have seen that Divine Power work. I am working for God alone; I have left everything for His cause. I am His child. If you live with the consciousness that you are His child and that He is your Father, and make up your mind to do your best with dogged determination, then in spite of obstacles, and even if you make mistakes, His power will be there to help you out. I live by that law. In that way I was able to acquire our Self-Realization Fellowship headquarters, even though I hadn't the material means in hand to do so. And see, even in this time of depression, still I have bought this temple. I worked the divine law, and this temple is the result. Unless you also live by that law, you cannot know the Power of which I speak. If you can go through your tests smiling with faith in God, and without harboring any doubts, you will see how God's law works. In San Francisco, I had only $200 in the bank and was about to begin a lecture campaign. I had not enough money even to make a start; and many large bills had to be paid. I said: \"God is with me. He has given me this trouble and He will look after me. I am doing His work; I know He will help me.\" If the whole world forsakes you, but you know that He is with you, His law will work its wonders for you. When my secretary came to me and I told him how much we had in the bank, he literally collapsed on the floor. I said, \"Get up.\" He was shaking: \"We are going to jail for not paying our bills!\" I said, \"We are not going to jail. In seven days we will have all the money we need for the campaign.\" He was a doubt- ing Thomas, but I had faith. I was not in need of money for any gain of my own, but to spread God's work. I had no fear, even"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"ACQUIRING ATTUNEMENT WITH THE SOURCE OF SUCCESS 71 for the enormity of my troubles. Fear is afraid of me. What is there to fear? Nothing should give you fear. Face all troubles with faith in God and you will conquer. Bhagavad Gita says: \"With heart absorbed in Me, and by My grace, thou shalt over- come all impediments.\"* And think of it! I was walking in front of the Palace Hotel when an elderly woman came up to me and said, \"Can I talk with you?\" We exchanged a few words and then out of the blue she said, \"I have money to burn. Can I help you?\" I replied, \"I don't need your money. Why should you offer money to me when you don't even know me?\" She an- swered, \"But I do know you; I have heard so much about you.\" And right there she wrote out a check for $27,000. I saw in that the hand of God. In Having God, We Have Everything But the greatest victory I had was in Phoenix. If only every- one could feel the grace of God as I have felt, they would know, as I do, that in Him they already have everything. That was my experience in Phoenix. I was deeply, deeply praying and medi- tating, because I had to meet a great need in the morning and someone had failed me. My prayer was not for money, but for freedom. I said to Divine Mother: \"Why am I put to such trou- bles; why do I have to face such a crisis?\" But I didn't stop there. I went on meditating; and then I prayed to the Mother: \"Talk to me. If You tell me to do so, I will leave everything be- hind and walk out of the organization, singing Thy name. I do not need anything but You. I ask nothing for myself. Test me. If You will it, I shall at this moment leave everything. In Thy Light I shall walk away.\" When Divine Mother saw that I meant what I said, this is what She replied: \"I freed thee long ago; but because thou think- est thou art not free, that is why thou art not free. Dance of life or dance of death, know that these come from Me and as such rejoice. What more dost thou want than that thou hast Me?\" From that day I found freedom. If you have in your consciousness the desire to please God above all else, He will look after you. \"...What more dost * xvin:58."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"72 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION thou want than that thou hast Me?\" Will you remember that? Every one of you? It isn't much to remember. If you will med- itate and sincerely pray to God, you will find Him; and He will bring to you all the prosperity you need. Use the law of meditation. It is the law of all laws, for it brings response from the Power behind all power. I knew, when Divine Mother spoke those words to me, that all would be well. The necessity was met, and I was saved from a catastrophe. That Power will work for you as it has always worked for me. I speak these truths from my own experiences. It would not be possible for me to talk about them if I hadn't demon- strated them in my own life. I live by faith in God. My power is God. I do not believe in any other power. As I concentrate on that Power, it works through me. I have been referred to as one of the most successful lec- turers in this country. Thousands have been taught by me. Not that I am proud of myself on that account. My success is only because I have believed solely in the power of God. Eventually I gave up all public lecture work—I am giving up everything now for God. I find that I have accomplished that part of what my life's purpose was to be. That purpose is to pick souls from the crowds and help them to know God. I have found such souls all over the country; and I am training them. * I move by Spirit; there has been no thought of money, but of service to mankind; and because of that, the Lord has opened * By the time Paramahansaji gave this talk in 1935, he had drawn many of the direct disciples who were destined to play important roles in his world mis- sion, including two whom he appointed to be his spiritual successors in lead- ing his work as president of Yogoda Satsanga Socitey of India/Self-Realization Fellowship: Rajarsi Janakananda (see glossary), who met the Guru in Kansas City in 1932; and Sri Daya Mata, who had attended his classes in Salt Lake City the previous year. Among others who were drawn from the lecture-cam- paign crowds, those who stepped forward to dedicate their lives to Parama- hansaji's work and who received his personal spiritual training, were Dr. and Mrs. M. W. Lewis, who met him in Boston in 1920; Gyanamata (Seattle, 1924); Tara Mata (San Francisco, 1924); Durga Mata (Detroit, 1929); Ananda Mata (Salt Lake City, 1931); Sraddha Mata (Tacoma, 1933); and Sailasuta Mata (Santa Barbara, 1933). After withdrawing from nationwide lecturing in the mid- 19308, Paramahansaji concentrated his efforts on classes for serious students, and spoke mostly at his own Self-Realization Fellowship temples and at the international headquarters."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"ACQUIRING ATTUNEMENT WITH THE SOURCE OF SUCCESS 73 up all channels to support my existence and the existence of this work of Self-Realization Fellowship [Yogoda Satsanga Society of India]. I wish to serve you; that is all. That is why I am here. The minute I need help, it is there—from the Divine. Some money was needed for Christmas. What happens? A student wrote and said, \"You have a cash balance in the bank in De- troit. What do you want done with it?\" I said, \"Send it imme- diately.\" My need was fulfilled at the right time. That power of God is working with you also. You will see it is so if you have faith and know that prosperity comes not from material sources but from God. Seek God-contact and He Will Guide You The Lord doesn't tell you that you do not have to think for yourself, nor that you need not use your initiative. You have to do your part. The point is, if you cut yourself off from the Source by wrong actions and desires, and by lack of faith and divine communion, then you cannot receive His all-powerful help. But if you are guided by attunement with God, He will help you to do the right thing, and to avoid mistakes. The way to start is by deep and regular morning and evening meditation. The more you meditate, the more you will realize there is Something behind the kingdom of ordinary conscious- ness where a great peace and happiness reign. Practice the pres- ence of this peace and happiness, for it is the first proof of God- contact. It is the conscious realization of Truth within yourself. That is what you need. That is how to worship Truth; for we can worship only what we know. * Most people worship God as Something intangible; but when you begin to worship Him as real, through your own inner perception, you will feel increas- ingly the presence of .His power in your life. No matter what else you might do, nothing will produce that God-contact which comes from deep meditation. Fervent effort to increase the inner peace and happiness born of meditation is the only way to real- ize God. The time to pray to God for guidance is after you have med- * \"God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth\" {John 4:24, Bible)."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"74 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION itated and felt that inner peace and joy ; that is when you have made divine contact. If you think you have a need, you can then place it before God and ask whether it is a legitimate prayer. If you feel inwardly that your need is just, then pray: \"Lord, you know that this is my need. I will reason, I will be creative, I will do whatever is necessary. All I ask of You is that You guide my will and creative abilities to the right things that I should do.\" Be fair with God. Perhaps He has something better for you than what you are praying for. It is a fact that sometimes your most fervent prayers and desires are your greatest ene- mies. Talk sincerely and justly with God, and let Him decide what is right for you. If you are receptive, He will lead you, He will work with you. Even if you make mistakes, don't be afraid. Have faith. Know that God is with you. Be guided in everything by that Power. It is unfailing. This truth is appli- cable to every one of you. By practice of ever deeper meditation, you can eventually go into the superconscious state of inner realization and re- main therein while performing on the conscious plane all of your activities. When you learn to work from the state of su- perconsciousness, and to work with divine inner happiness no matter what you are doing, you will feel with you always the presence and power of God. \"As I Perceive, May You Perceive\" I have delivered His message to you, and I see His great light in you all. In that Light I bless you. The ethereal power of God flows through me: through my speech, my brain, my cells, every wisp of my consciousness—every thought is a chan- nel through which His divine light is passing. Open your hearts and realize that the Divine Light is also passing through you.

The proposal, heartily endorsed by Paramahansaji, brought forth the response in this article. The word holiday sprang from two words, \"holy day.\" A holy day should be a time for introspective thinking and for man to nurture his sacred soul qualities. One of the Ten Com- mandments is \"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy\"— a day of rest and spiritual renewal. Christians observe the sab- bath on Sunday—a day for basking in the sunlight of wisdom. The Hindus reserve a number of days in the year for spiritual purposes. Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas correspond to some of the sacred days of the Hindus. The Durga Puja festi- val is as widely observed in India as is Christmas in the West. Man is a spiritual and a material being. He should develop himself spiritually by inner discipline, and become materially ef- ficient by developing his business faculties. Primitive man kept all his mental faculties busy satisfying the needs of the material life. His time was spent in hunting, eating, and sleeping. Mod- ern man tries scientifically to meet the present material condi- tions of life. What primitive man did unmethodically, modern man does methodically. This method in modern man's efforts for material success has indirectly improved his inner faculties. The masters of India counsel direct development of the in- ner faculties, such as will power to fight temptation, feeling for serving fellow beings, and intuition for directly realizing truth.

People crave different things—money, or fame, or spiritu- ality—as a result of early habits and specific environmental in- fluences. That is why the people of both the East and the West lead one-sided lives. The East is generally more spiritually in- clined and the West more materially inclined. But we cannot live happily by spiritual doctrines only or by riches only. To bring a balance into the lives of men of East and West, both should adopt a method of developing an equilibrated life. People in general spend six days of the week in making money, and even the seventh in thinking about it; but they spend hardly any time on self-development. One reason the West has so much crime, so many murders and robberies in spite of its developed civilization, is that people are too busy securing the commodities of material comfort and have no time to reflect on the practical value of following moral and spiritual principles. If material poverty is to be avoided, spiritual poverty is to be abhorred; for the latter is the underlying cause of all human suffering. A practical spiritual man is a happy man, and only a happy man is a successful man. One hundred percent material prosperity among the inhabitants of a city will not prevent mur- ders and crime. Following the universal principles of mutual ser- vice, spontaneous cooperation, love for the spiritual life, and dis- ciplining the human sense cravings is wholly necessary for the harmonious, happy, healthy, prosperous life of any community. Official records annually show that almost one billion dol- lars are stolen by young men and women ranging in age from fifteen to thirty. We have the New York newspapers' report that 400,000 more meals were served in the jails this year than last year. Why is all this? Because the ordinary man's at- tention is not yet fixed on the vital problems of the art of liv- ing. Why not use some of the money spent for erecting and maintaining jails to create How-to-Live schools, which will pre- vent children from becoming criminals? Criminal offenders grown worse in jails are let loose in healthy society for furthei spread of the bacteria of crime. Most persons will say, \"Oh, I am too busy with my busi-"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"BUSINESS. BALANCE, AND INNER PEACE 77 ness to think about the art of living. We all know about that. Someday we will come to it, but what we are interested in right now is money.\" But what purpose would money serve if one succeeds in making millions at the cost of a complete ner- vous breakdown and loss of poise and happiness? Spiritualizing Ambition With the Ideal of Service Since God has given us hunger, and since we have a phys- ical body to look after, we must have money and we should earn it honestly and scientifically, by serving the right needs of our fellow beings. Business life need not be a material life. Busi- ness ambition can be spiritualized. Business is nothing but serv- ing others materially in the best possible way. Those stores that start out with the idea of only making money are readily rec- ognized as commercial money-making dens. But stores that concentrate on serving customers with the best articles at the minimum cost will succeed and will also advance the moral de- velopment of the world. I have never forgotten the remark of a fine salesman in a large shop where I was selecting an overcoat for myself. \"Sir,\" he said, \"I am not trying just to sell you something; I am try- ing to find out exactly what you need.\" He did not try to sell me the most expensive overcoat; he showed me a less expen- sive one that exactly suited me in every way. I was pleased to get what I needed at a reasonable price. Thus he secured in me a permanent customer for his company. People should spiritualize their business ambitions by start- ing out with the idea of serving the proper needs of their fellow beings. Not only should man make money by serving, and thereby get something for himself in return, but should also work for the sake of acquiring money to use in creating insti- tutions that will serve public needs. When one has made a great deal of money, and simultaneously helped his workers and as- sociates to become more prosperous, and then uses his wealth for helping others to help themselves, that is spiritualizing am- bition. Wealthy parents who leave too much money for their children choke the evolutional development of self-created, self-earned success and happiness in their offspring. Even the \"brainy\" man must exercise ambition or he does injustice to"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"78 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION himself by crippling his faculties. By injuring himself he sets a bad example and thus hinders the progress of humanity. That is why I agree with Mr. Henry Ford in helping peo- ple to help themselves, and not in humiliating, slave-breeding charity. It is only by having ambition and crowning it with the ideal of service that materially ambitious people will find a spiritual reason for making money. A Balance of Oriental and Occidental Traits Is Needed Oriental peoples have, as a rule, been spiritually inclined, taking life philosophically and cultivating a natural tendency toward contemplation. Of course, many Orientals have used their leisure for indulging in laziness instead of working for spir- itual realization; but on the whole, they have an awakened spir- itual perception. Our Western brothers have devoted their time predomi- nantly to developing the material and intellectual sides of life. But they are often too busy even to enjoy the fruits of their la- bor, or to know the taste of peace, relaxation, and the bliss of meditation. They become enslaved by less important engage- ments and forget their highest engagement with the blissful ideal life of God-contact. Because of the extensive use of machinery, Westerners have this advantage over their Eastern brethren: they can use the time thus saved to advance more in the deeper studies of life. Business activities and money are meant for the comfort and betterment of man,- he should not allow blind greed for them to rob him of his happiness and the achievement of higher goals. Six full days and nights of machine-like existence, and part of one day (Sunday) for the cultivation of one's inner self, is not a balanced way of life. The week should be allotted to work, amusement, and spiritual culture: five days for money-making, one day for rest and amusement, and at least one day for in- trospection and inner realization. * In the Western world, life * For the spiritually sincere and eager, Paramahansaji encouraged a routine of morning and evening meditation every day (before and after one's active du- ties), and one day a week devoted to silence, introspection, spiritual study, and a period of meditation of at least four hours or longer."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"BUSINESS. BALANCE, AND INNER PEACE 79 is altogether too fast; the Orient tends to go to the other ex- treme. A balance needs to be struck. Every man must have some free time to find himself. One day a week—Sunday—is not enough, because it is his only holiday and he wants it for rest and is too tired to meditate. With a five-day working week, as proposed by Henry Ford, people could use Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday for getting away from the noisy city environment, and thus increase their longevity. The Chicago Chief of Police reported a study that says man's longevity could be increased by eleven years if the city noises were cut out and man's nervous system calmed down thereby. Almost every family in America can afford an au- tomobile of some kind, and with it they can get out of the cities on weekends and refresh themselves in the peaceful re- treats of nature, living the double life of a hermit in the woods and a warrior in the field of worldly activity. Learn the Art of Living Rightly Since ultimate wisdom—knowing everything that can be known by the maximum use of human reason—is the human goal, then why not learn the art of living rightly? People lose their balance and suffer from money madness and business mania only because they never had the opportu- nity of culturing habits of a balanced life. It is not our passing thoughts or brilliant ideas but our everyday habits that control our lives. There are some very conscientious businessmen who make millions without being irregular or nervous, but there are others who become so engrossed in making money that they cannot think of anything else and do not wake up from their obsession until something terrible happens to them, as sickness or loss of all happiness. We must begin with the children as well as with the adults. The plastic mind of the child can be molded into any shape with the cooperation of self-disciplined, reformed adults. Desired habits can easily be created in children because the will to per- form is mostly free except for a few innate tendencies. Adults have to battle and expel old habits in order to lodge new good ones. But all habits, whether in children or adults, must be cultivated through the medium of spontaneous willingness. In"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"80 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION training children in a balanced life or in habits of paying equal attention to the earning of money and to the acquisition of spiritual happiness, the time and method of training has to be considered. Many psychologists say that the later periods of life are but the repetitions of the training one received between the ages of two to ten or fifteen. Spiritual sermons inspire the minds of children to better action, but that is all. Actual practical discipline is necessary for roasting the seeds of past-life prenatal habits lodged in the subconscious and superconscious minds. This can only be done by directing inwardly the cauterizing power of the electricity of concentration. Children ought to be brought up with a spiritual ambi- tion to make money only for the sake of service. Modern chil- dren are mostly reared in a wrong atmosphere where money- making is the goal, so they try to \"get rich quick,\" even by the hold-up method. Their reason argues that if making money by any means is the goal, then why shouldn't hold-up meth- ods prevail? It lies in the hands of today's adults to uplift the citizens of tomorrow by educating the children into a balanced life. As long as the adults will remain intoxicated with a one-sided ma- terial life, so long will the children follow that example and their hopes will remain unfulfilled. To save the future of the world by saving the children, the modern adult must wake up and cultivate a balanced life of spiritual as well as material habits. Leading a Balanced Life Many heads of concerns manage to work only five days a week from nine in the morning to three in the afternoon and generally take Saturdays and Sundays off. They have some poise, more home life, but they spend most of their free time in playing golf and going dancing and to the movies, instead of giving some time to spiritual culture. In order to lead a balanced life, adults must educate them- selves to realize that business ambitions should be only for making ourselves and others happy. Without this ideal, over- strenuous business activity produces nervousness, lack of har-"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"BUSINESS. BALANCE, AND INNER PEACE 81 monious social qualities, miserliness, greed, and disrespect for all good principles. By realizing the true purpose of business activity—service for the benefit of others as well as oneself— life can be really happy. I think Mr. Henry Ford has inaugurated a new era in spiri- tualizing business life by proposing a five-day work week. \"The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: there- fore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.\"* Jesus wanted people to have Sundays as the Son's day, or wisdom's day, to culture soul knowledge; but when people are so busy all week, they want Sundays for relaxation and amusement, instead of giv- ing it to God and introspection. The clergymen and priests who are opposed to having movies and diversions on Sundays ought to sympathize and cooperate with Henry Ford's plan. The hard- working man could utilize Saturday for relaxation, gardening, wholesome amusement; then he would feel free and glad to use Sunday wholly and solely for attending religious services and for spiritual self-discipline through practicing the techniques of concentration and meditation for attaining inner peace and God- communion. + I know many prominent, intelligent businessmen who in their heart of hearts are discontented and are craving for God and wisdom, but they are helplessly carried away by their work habits and by too many social engagements. Their highest en- gagement with God, Truth, higher studies, and more home life is sacrificed for money-making or useless socializing. So it is extremely necessary that truth-loving real world patriots should cooperate for making Saturday a day for amuse- ment and relaxation, and Sunday a day exclusively for cultur- ing habits of meditation, association with good persons, good principles, and the highest good—God-Bliss within. As certain training is needed for engaging in the art of war, so does our engagement in battling with active life. Untrained warriors are soon killed on the battlefield; so also persons un- trained in the art of preserving their inner peace are quickly * Mark 2:27-28 (Bible). t Those whose spiritual tradition it is to observe Saturday as their holy day would instead use Sunday as their day of rest and relaxation."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"82 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION riddled by the bullets of worry and restlessness in active life.* Man's great need is to find more time to enjoy nature, to simplify his life and his imaginary necessities, to enjoy the true needs of his existence, to leam to know his children and friends better, and most of all, to know himself and the God who made him. * Sixty-five years after Paramahansa Yogananda's publication of this article, a 1991 study by Harvard economist Juliet B. Schor showed that the principles advocated by Paramahansaji are as timely now as they were in the 1920s. Pro- fessor Schor discovered that the average American now works the equivalent of a whole month more per year than did his or her counterpart in 1970. Mod- em Americans, she found, are working longer hours than people at any time in history other than the Industrial Revolution—spending even more time on the job than did medieval serfs! Increased efficiency of production can result in either more earnings or more leisure time, states Schor. Ever since Henry Ford and other industrialists revo- lutionized workforce habits in the first two decades of this century, America as a whole has typically opted for the money. Greater income and an excep- tionally high standard of living have resulted. Yet, despite most Americans' abil- ity to purchase fancy cars and homes that overflow with sought-after creature comforts, Professor Schor found that they are no happier as a result. As she writes in The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure (New York: Basic Books, 1991): \"If our desires keep pace with our incomes...getting richer doesn't make us more satisfied....According to a recent review of exist- ing findings, Americans are literally working themselves to death—as jobs contribute to heart disease, hypertension, gastric problems, depression, ex- haustion....Studies point to a 'sleep deficit' among Americans, a majority of whom are getting between 60 and 90 minutes less a night than they should for optimum health and performance....Parents are devoting less attention to their children. Stress is on the rise, partly owing to the 'balancing act' of reconciling the demands of work and family life.\" \"If we are to have a chance at leisure,\" Schor concludes, \"we'll need to resurrect the public debate that ended in the 1920s.\""},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Probing the Core of Nervousness Self-Realization Fellowship Temple, San Diego, California, fune 15, 1947 Everyone has at times been nervous, more or less, with- out knowing why. I may shake this piece of cloth and say it is nervous, but what is making the cloth move? When I cease moving my hand, the cloth lies limp. You always blame other things for making you nervous, but never accuse yourself. Yet it is you who make yourself nervous,- ninety-nine percent is your own fault. Restlessness, emotional excitement, concen- trates too much energy in the nerves so that they begin to wear out. After years and years, the adverse effects of that nervous- ness begin to show. The nerves are very tough—God made them so, because they have to last a lifetime—but it is neces- sary to give them proper care. When you stop overloading the nervous system, as when you are in deep sleep or a state of calmness in meditation, you are not nervous at all. In medita- tive ecstasy the nerves become highly rested and rejuvenated. Healthy Nerves Essential for a Healthy Body Nerves are like wires connecting all parts of a factory. If the wires become worn or burned out, then the whole factory or certain affected areas of it cannot function. Similarly, the nervous system enlivens all parts of the body, including the perceptive, cognitive, and responsive functions of the five senses. If the nerves are destroyed, then transaction with the world is also destroyed. There are two systems of nerves: the central nervous sys- tem in the brain, medulla, and spinal cord; and out of that the peripheral system, which connects the nerve centers to the dif- ferent organs of the body and carries energy to them. The ner- vous system sends sensations to the brain, enables the brain to process them, and then reacts upon the brain's interpretation of those stimuli. 83"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"84 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION During the primitive growth of the embryonic brain, the first formative stage of the nerves is like liquid, which then gradually becomes fibers that eventually grow into nerves— tough super-highways for conducting energy from the brain to all parts of the body. The brain is the house of government; the twenty-seven thousand billion cells are the subjects. The nervous system that connects them all must be kept in proper working order. You may recall the paralyzing effect of the re- cent telephone strike. That is what can happen in your body. When the nerve \"telephones\" are paralyzed, they cannot con- vey their vital messages. For example, if the optical center in the brain is impaired, owing to wrong eating, disease, or strain, the nerves of the eyes are affected, and the eyes begin to grow weak. Examine Yourself to See What Makes You Nervous Most nervous diseases are due to overexcitation of the mind. These arise from many causes. Examine yourself to see if you are nervous, and then determine what it is that makes you nervous. When you get mad, for instance, you send tremen- dous volts of energy into the brain and the heart. Emotions such as anger and fear can so overload the nerves that they cause the body to malfunction, sometimes even stopping the heart and causing death. If you pass a million volts of current through a small wire that can stand only a few volts, the wire will be burned out. Excitement means you are directing too much en- ergy to a certain area and depriving other nerves of that life force. The man of calmness, on the contrary, keeps his nerves well fed with a balanced flow of energy so that no part of the body is detrimentally overloaded or depleted. Nervousness is the disease of civilization. I remember when some of us were driving up Pikes Peak in Colorado. Other cars were speeding past us on the steep, winding grade. I thought they were hurrying to get to the mountaintop in time to see the sunrise. To my great amazement, when we arrived we were the only ones outside to enjoy the view. All the oth- ers were in the restaurant drinking coffee and eating dough- nuts. Imagine! They rushed to the top and then rushed back, just for the thrill of being able to say when they got home that"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"PROBING THE CORE OF NERVOUSNESS 85 they had been there, and had coffee and doughnuts on Pikes Peak. That is what nervousness does. We should take time to enjoy things—the beauties of God's creation, the many bless- ings of life—but avoid undue excitement, restlessness, and sud- den emotions, which burn up the nervous system. Talking too much, including the habit of engaging in long conversations on the telephone, creates nervousness. Habitual twitching—such as drumming the fingers or moving the toes —burns energy in the nerves. Another cause of nervousness, though you may not be aware of it, is the noise of the radio or television going on for hours at a time. All sounds cause the nerves to react. * A study conducted in the police department in Chicago showed that if human beings were not subjected to the bombardment of the sounds of modern living, which are especially harsh in cities, they could live years longer. Learn to enjoy silence,- don't listen to the radio or television for hours on end, or have them blaring mindlessly in the background all the time. There is enough \"television\" of saints and music of the spheres going on throughout the cosmos that you don't need to listen to canned music or watch canned pictures. Through the calmness of inner silence, learn to tune in to God's won- drous cosmic programs. Learn to Control Your Emotions Another major cause of nervousness is unkind speech. Never gossip or talk against others. Be busy reforming yourself. Practice kind speech. Don't be quarrelsome. If your husband or wife gets angry and rouses your ire, take a little walk and cool off before responding. If he or she speaks sharply, don't retort in the same way. It is better to remain quiet until the temper has cooled down. Avoid being stubborn or patronizing; * Many researchers have described the adverse effects of noise on human health, including Dr. Samuel Rosen, clinical professor of otolaryngology at Co- lumbia University, who wrote: \"It is known that loud noises cause effects which the recipient cannot control. The blood vessels constrict, the skin pales, the voluntary and involuntary muscles tense, and adrenaline is suddenly in- jected into the blood stream, which increases neuromuscular tension, ner- vousness, irritability, and anxiety.\""},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"86 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION but at the same time, refrain from involving yourself in a quarrel. Wait until you both have regained calm reason. Never let anyone rob you of your peace; and do not steal away the peace of others by your verbal misbehavior. The misuse of speech is one of the most injurious of all weapons. You may say something in anger or high emotion that you do not really mean, and then feel sorry afterward; but for twenty years or longer the other person remembers it. (In this respect, mem- ory is a bad thing. The power to remember is a blessing if used in the right way, but harmful if used as a repository of the bad things that have been done to us.) If your wife screeches at you and you shout back, you will suffer twice as much— once from her harsh words and again from your own. You pri- marily harm yourself. By the time you get through, you will feel that there is nothing left of you. This is why there are so many divorces. Frankly, people should not marry until they have learned to have some control of their emotions. The schools should ed- ucate young students in this art, and in how to develop calm- ness and concentration. The American home is breaking up be- cause these things are not taught—neither at home nor in the schools. How can two people who are habituated to nervous activity live together without almost destroying each other with their nervousness? In the beginning of a marriage, the bride and groom are carried along on the emotions of excite- ment and passion. But after a while, when these inevitably start to wane, the true natures of the couple begin to come out and the quarreling and disillusionments set in. The heart requires true love, friendship, and, above all, peace. When through emotion peace is destroyed, it is a dese- cration of the bodily temple. A healthy nervous system is what will maintain in proper order all the bodily organs and feel- ings. And to keep the nervous system healthy, it is important to remain free from devastating emotions such as fear, anger, greed, jealousy. Cast off fear. What is there to be afraid of? Even a little bit of fear, such as senseless apprehension of the dark or wor- rying about things that \"might\" happen, affects the nerves more than you can imagine. Why dread even death? God al-"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"PROBING THE CORE OF NERVOUSNESS 87 lows it to happen to everybody, so it cannot be bad. That is a very consoling thought to hold on to. Death is just like a re- freshing sleep; and you are not afraid of sleep, are you? Death is complete rest. God gives you death to release you from all of your troubles here, and then to provide you with a fresh start in a new incarnation. To Be Caught Up in Emotion Is to Forget God To be caught up in fear, anger, greed, or any violent or im- pulsive emotion is to forget God. If your senses, which govern your emotions, are under your control, you are a saint. No one knows better than yourself whether you are a master of your senses or a slave to them. Remember, anything that overrules your self-control leads your nervous system to destruction. The greedy man eats, and the man of self-control eats. One eats for the well-being of his body, and the other overeats for sensual gratification. If one's love is concentrated more on God and less on the senses, then all sensory abuse will be over- come. When tempted, pray to the Lord, \"Make Thyself more tempting than temptation. No matter how You test me, Lord, I shall cling to You.\" When your nervous system is filled with peaceful, loving thoughts of God, your nerves become recharged with His power. Krishna said: \"When the feeling ( chitta ) is ab- solutely subjugated and is calmly established in the Self (the soul), the yogi, thus devoid of attachment to all desires, is spo- ken of as the God-united.\"* Movie stars and other professional entertainers are consid- ered the beautiful people of America. But why are their personal lives so often in a shambles of unhappiness and multiple di- vorces? Most of them live too much on nervous energy con- centrated in the senses. Overeating, promiscuous sex, the in- toxication of wine and drugs—all produce a pseudo happiness. In God alone one finds fulfillment of all desires. In God alone one finds ever new joy, which can never be attained through the instrumentality of any of the senses. If you are in the grip of any abuse of the senses—and this means any one of them—contin- * Bhagavad Gita VI: 18."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"88 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION uously affirm your freedom: \"I am not enslaved by this habit; my love for God is supreme, greater than for anything else.\" Desire and Attachment Feed Nervousness Desire and attachment feed the disease of nervousness. By the time you have acquired the things you crave, you are worn out. Desireless nonattachment is freedom from the tyranny of enslavement to possessions. Everyone says how beautiful Encinitas is. * I like it because on the altar of the horizon of the ocean and blue sky I see God. When the Hermitage was given to me, for seven days I delighted in it. Then I gave it to God, inwardly freeing myself from all sense of possession. Now I en- joy it through the joy of others. All the things that India sadly lacked, and that I had wished for her, I see you have here in America; but still you are not happy. Now I pray that India does not become too westernized. Both India and America express extremes. There needs to be balance—American civilization modified with the spirituality of India. Every nation wants the material advantages that Amer- ica has. And the spiritual consciousness that every nation needs is found in India. I think that life in America is becoming more simplified, which is good. It takes too much time and energy to keep too many possessions in good order. The truth of the matter is that the more unnecessary \"necessities\" you have, the less peace you have; and the less you are possessed by posses- sions, the more happiness you have. The way to develop spiri- tually is to live simply, live quietly, study good books (never read cheap novels), practice calmness through control of the senses and emotions, and meditate much of the time. Califor- nia with its equable climate and natural endowments is an ideal place to lead a simple life,- and here will be a great spiritual resurgence. Right Attitude Toward Wealth People shy away from the idea of renunciation, yet they renounce so many things of true value—not the least of which * The SRF Ashram Center in Encinitas, California. (See Encinitas in glossary.!"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"PROBING THE CORE OF NERVOUSNESS 89 are peace of mind and even sometimes their very lives—for the sake of money, which is perishable. Wealth may be taken away from you, or you may be taken away from it by death; you can- not take it with you. The only value of money is to do good for the well-being and true happiness of self and others. Those who think only of their own security and comforts, forgetful of others in need, are courting poverty,- it will be forced upon them sometime. Those who cling selfishly to their wealth instead of doing good with it do not attract prosperity in their next life. They are born poor, but with all the desires of the wealthy. But those who share their good fortune attract wealth and abun- dance wherever they go. Jesus spoke of this principle when he said, \"Sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven.\"* If you learn to share with others, you will see that God is ever with you,- He will never leave you, and you will never go without. Depend upon Him, and He will look after you. Do not forget that your very life is directly sustained by the power of God. When you remember that your reason, will, and activity are dependent upon Him, you will be guided by God, and you will realize that your life is one with His Infinite Life. He who is motivated by selfish desires neglects his as- signed role in helping the drama of God's creation. He who lives only for himself, creating webs of desires, becomes entangled in those webs. But he who acts and works for God is free. You do not know why you are here on earth, or why you are a man or a woman, or why you are the way you are. You are not here merely to have your own way. You are here to do God's will. To work for yourself is to be bound by life. To work for God is to be free. Learn to be very active in this world, doing constructive work; but when you are through with your duties, turn off your nervous motor. Retire to the center of your being, which is calmness. Mentally affirm to yourself: \"I am calm. I am not a mere nervous mechanism; I am Spirit. Though I dwell in this body, I am untouched by it.\" If you have a calm nervous sys- * Luke 18:22 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"90 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION tem, you will have success in everything you undertake; and, above all, you will succeed with God. The Nervous System Connects You to the World and to God The nervous system has two duties. The nerves allow you to interact with the world; and, as the yogis of ancient times discovered, the nerves also serve to connect you with God. The life force in man's body ordinarily flows outward from the brain and spine through the nerves to the senses and their external experiences. When in yoga meditation that en- ergy is reversed to flow inward, it draws the consciousness to the subtle spiritual cerebrospinal centers of divine perception and God-realization.* Nervousness, the overstimulation of the nerves, ties the con- sciousness to the body,- calmness conduces to God-communion. When you turn off external nervous energy and calm yourself in meditation, and the life force retires from the senses to the cerebrospinal centers of spiritual perception, your nervous sys- tem is then connected with superconsciousness, and you have God. You are in the land of light, which is beyond the subcon- scious realm of sleep. Sleep is an unconscious way of turning off life energy from the nerves. You therefore get some rest dur- ing slumber, but you do not have the conscious experience of bliss that the superconscious state produces. When you awaken from sleep, you are just the same as you were before sleep. But if you can cross the subconscious realm into the supercon- scious land of light, you will have the most wonderful experi- ences, and these produce lasting spiritual changes in the con- * Yoga teaches that within man's brain and spine are seven subtle centers of life and consciousness. Yoga treatises refer to these centers as muladhaia (coccygeal); svadhisthana (sacral), manipura (lumbar), anahata (dorsal), vishuddha (cervical), ajna (medulla and Christ ( Kutastha ) center between the eyebrows), and sahasrara (thousand-petaled lotus in the cerebrum). Without the specialized powers lodged therein and flowing outward into the physical organs and senses, the body would be an inert mass of clay. Conversely, when the energy and consciousness are focused inward, the wondrous source and sus- taining power of life is revealed, evolving from the supreme consciousness of the soul and Spirit.

The more you can remain in that interiorized state of bliss in meditation, the more you will feel that joy with you all the time, even in the midst of activities. The Spiritual Physiology That Makes Man Unique There is a spiritual physiology underlying the nervous sys- tem that makes man a unique vehicle for the highest stages of the evolution of consciousness. Man's brain, being larger than that of most animals, with the exception of the elephant and the whale, and being more complex, contains the greatest capacity for thought. This makes the human brain a proper instrument for man, whose consciousness is the most highly evolved of all creatures. Man alone is capable of advanced levels of discrimi- nation; and ultimately, of God-realization. The greater the amount of thought (for example, in man as contrasted with ani- mals), the greater the complexity of the cerebral convolutions. The fissures of these convolutions are about one inch deep in the adult brain. The gray matter of the convoluted surface of the brain is where our sensory-motor thought processes are lodged. In early stages of the developing fetus, the brain is more like a marble dome. The awareness and responses of the fetus increase with the developing complexity of the convolutions. The mind, the source of thought and discrimination, is a process of con- sciousness, not physiology; it triggers the physiology. * Now, you will find very interesting how God has made this physical body. It is a deep and vast subject; so just a few points I will touch on. The gray matter on the surface of the brain is the receptacle of nerve impulses. This is where all the nerve cells * In yoga science, the mind is conceived of as a conglomerate of interacting components: chitta (consciousness; intuitive feeling), manas (the sensory mind), buddhi (discriminative intelligence), and ahamkara (egoity).Yoga teaches that the physical body, including the brain, is a product of conscious- ness—not the other way around, as is held by some Western theorists. Yoga points out, however, that in man's usual state of consciousness the mind is so identified with the physical body that biochemical changes have a tremen- dous influence on the mind, which in turn reacts on the body through the mediums of the endocrine and nervous systems. This complex reciprocal in- teraction between body and mind is the major factor in man's physical and mental health."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"92 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION and electrical vibrations are located. When you decide to move any part of your body—your hands, fingers, eyes, for example— this creates electrical impulses in the cells of the gray matter, which are transmitted through the motor nerves to the body part that you want to move. As that part moves, another electrical current is sent back to the brain via the sensory nerves. These electrical impulses stimulate the nerve cells in the gray matter, and more energy-giving oxygen is drawn from the blood vessels in the membrane surrounding the brain. An exercise that is very good to stimulate the energy in the brain is to rap the head gently but firmly with the knuckles. This is especially helpful if done in the morning as you begin your day—or anytime you feel brain lag. The Spiritual Eye: Epitome of Creation Underlying the gray matter in the brain is white matter, which is spoken of as passive. The construction of the brain has a correspondence with the single or spiritual eye* in man. In fact, this eye of astral light, which can be seen in meditation, is an epitome of the creative energy and consciousness of which man's body is formed and by which it is enlivened. Jesus said, \"The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be sin- gle, thy whole body shall be full of light.\"+ The spiritual eye is perceived as a golden aura surrounding a sphere of blue, in the middle of which is a five-pointed star of white light. When you look in a mirror at your two eyes, you see they are patterned after the spiritual eye: the outer \"aura\" or white of the eye; the inner circle or iris; and the central \"star\" or pupil. The point of origin of the single eye is in a subtle spiri- tual center in the medulla oblongata (at the base of the brain, where it joins the spine).t The energy from this single eye di- vides at the medulla and pours through the brain into the two physical eyes, through which the world of duality is per- ceived. The spiritual eye with its three lights, or three differ- ent rays—one within the other like an extending telescopic lens—has all-seeing spherical vision.

Penetrating the blue light, the yogi will realize the Christ or Krishna Consciousness—the Kutastha or infinite in- telligence of God, the \"only-begotten son\" or reflection of God—which is present in all creation. Piercing the tiny five- pointed white star, the yogi experiences Cosmic Conscious- ness—the transcendent consciousness of God that underlies all creation and that is also beyond the realms of manifestation in Infinitude. The yogi in Cosmic Consciousness perceives that all creation, including the microcosm of his body, is a projec- tion of the fivefold rays of God's Cosmic Consciousness. * The Divine Creator's Cosmic Consciousness, His pure re- flected intelligence in creation as Christ or Krishna Conscious- ness, and His active creative power as Cosmic Vibration are thus the very Essence of all manifestations.t Gold, blue, and white—the colors of the radiations of this Holy Trinity of God in creation—are therefore the most spiritual of all colors: white reflecting the transcendent God-Consciousness, blue re- flecting the Christ or Krishna Consciousness, and gold (or red, a transformation of gold) reflecting the radiation or energy pres- ent in the cosmos. Throughout history, man has instinctively associated white with purity and spirituality,- blue with tranquil omnipresence, as in the blue sky or heavens,- and gold or red with energy. How the Intricate Human Body Evolves From Spirit The tricolored rays of the spiritual eye, through a complex transformation known to yogis, form the physical body of man the microcosm. The golden rays of cosmic energy, for example, are strongly inherent in the vital red blood, and are manifested * Yoga defines the five elemental vibrations of matter as earth, water, fire, air, and ether—thoughts of God that manifest as the universe and its beings through God's intricate laws of nature.

The blue rays are a predominant factor in the gray matter of the brain, which provides a medium for the expression of thoughts through sensory-motor activity—just as on the universal scale Christ Consciousness [Kutastha Chaitanya] provides the medium that upholds all of nature's activities. And the white rays are the predominant factor in the white matter of the brain, in which God's transcendent Cosmic Consciousness is insulated. The nerve tissues are cylindrical in form. If you see a dia- gram of the nervous system, it is like a web of projecting rays, pathways of electrical energy without which there is no life in the body. The underlying spiritual physiology relates to the pro- jected thoughts of God. The first manifestation of God the Creator is thought, Intelligence itself. When God began to \"think\" the body of man, it produced tentacles of thought—a thought is a linear projection. These became rays,- the rays be- came fibers; and the fibers became nerves through which energy is conducted throughout the nervous system to the twenty- seven thousand billion bodily cells. I became aware of these various corollaries as I read a lit- tle bit of physiology; God was showing me at the same time His deeper science. It is so interesting to see the marvelous evolution of complex matter from the singular consciousness of Spirit. How intricate it is, and yet so simple, when you see that everything is God. It is all upheld by the power of His thought. \"On a little piece of thought rests the cosmic lot.\" Color Is Important in Your Life In the creation of the body of man, the rays of the spiri- tual eye first formed the astral body, the rainbow-hued body of life energy that is the blueprint and enlivening power of the material body. Because the material body is a condensation of the multicolored rays of light of the life-giving astral body, color is important in your life. The point is, you are affected by color because colors are manifestations of specific vibra- tions. You should always try to wear, and to surround yourself with, colors that are harmonious to your nature. And for the reasons I have mentioned, gold, blue, and white are good for the nervous system. Of course, for a change you should use"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"PROBING THE CORE OF NERVOUSNESS 95 other colors as well. But generally, it is good to have some of these particularly beneficial colors around you. You will find your nervous system will be much calmer. Though it is quite all right now and then, for variety, to vary the colors you use, and that you feel harmonious with, radical changes can affect you. You wouldn't want to paint the rooms in your home black, for example.* The Best Diet for the Nerves Even foods, which also are material condensations of as- tral rays of life, have effects that are correlated to their color. Various kinds of natural white foods are good for the nervous system,- they benefit the white matter of the brain. Berries are good for the gray matter of the brain—that is, blueberries or blackberries (which are really purple). Most fruits are gold in color (or variants of gold, such as red and orange). As gold is the color of the creative vibratory energy in matter, such fruits help the muscles, the blood, and the tissues. Goat's milk, un- bleached almonds, and raisins are very good for the nervous system. But all forms of meat of higher animals, especially beef and pork, are harmful to the nervous system; they are hyper- stimulating and cause aggressiveness. Avoid too much starch, especially foods made from refined flour. Eat whole grains, cottage cheese, and plenty of fruits, fruit juices, and fresh vegetables—these are important. Need- less to say, alcoholic beverages and drugs destroy the nervous system; stay away from them. A yogic drink that is very good for the nervous system is made by adding crushed rock candy and fresh lime juice to a glass of water. It should be thoroughly mixed and evenly blended so that the taste is equally sweet and sour. I have recommended this to many people with excellent results. * Modern science has found interesting confirmation of this ancient yogic dis- covery. Research at the University of Delaware by Roger Ulrich, Ph.D., showed that the predominant colors in one's environment have a measurable influence on the frequency and strength of one's brain waves. \"Studies show that blues and greens have a calming influence,\" said Dr. Ulrich. \"Oranges and reds ac- tivate or increase arousal.\""},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"96 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION Another beneficial practice when you are very nervous is to take a cold bath. I once told this to a newspaperman. He said, \"Well, if I did that every time I was nervous, I would have to carry a bathtub with me all the time!\" I said, \"Not necessary. Take a large piece of ice and rub it all over, the body, especially over all the openings of the body. With this yoga technique, you will find that your nerves will become much calmer.\" Attunement With God: Greatest Cure for Nervousness Remember that the greatest healing of nervousness takes place when we attune our lives to God. The highest com- mandments given to man are to love God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength; and secondly, to love your neighbor as yourself.* If you follow these, everything will come in its own way, and in the right way. It is not enough just to be a strict moralist—stones and goats do not break moral laws; still, they do not know God. But when you love God deeply enough, even if you are the greatest of sinners, you will be transformed and redeemed. The great saint Mirabait said, \"To find the Divine One, the only indispensable is love.\" That truth touched me deeply. All the prophets observe these two foremost command- ments. Loving God with all your heart means to love Him with the love that you feel for the person who is dearest to you— with the love of the mother or father for the child, or the lover for the beloved. Give that kind of unconditional love to God. Loving God with all your soul means you can truly love Him when through deep meditation you know yourself as a soul, a child of God, made in His image. Loving God with all your mind means that when you are praying, your whole attention is on Him, not distracted by restless thoughts. In meditation, think only of God; don't let the mind wander to everything else but God. That is why yoga is important; it enables you to con- centrate. When by yoga you withdraw the restless life force * Mark 12:28-31 (Bible). t A medieval Rajputani princess who renounced her royalty and became a renowned devotee of God.

Live Like a God, and You Will Attract Godly Friends Lastly, learn to love your neighbor as yourself. Remem- ber, you are here on earth in this lifetime for just a little while. You have come here before in numerous incarnations, interacting with many different souls. Who are your real rela- tives? To the wise man, everyone is his relative,- everyone is his \"neighbor.\" Of course, the wise man discriminates, knowing that though the sun shines equally on the diamond and the charcoal, it is the diamond that beautifully reflects the sun- light. One should seek and associate with the highest dia- mondlike mentalities. Take time to find true friends. Good souls attract good souls. Live like gods, and you will attract godly friends. Live like animals on the sensual plane, and you will attract animalistic companions. Do not mix closely with those who lower your ideals and create materialistic nervous- ness in you,- but at the same time do not exclude anyone from your love. In addition, be not only a giver of love, but also a peace- maker, that wherever you go you bring harmony, calmness, and upliftment. No one wants to be around a skunk; everyone avoids it. The nervous man—he who is always restless, irrita- ble, emotional—similarly repulses others. We do not want to be human skunks. We want to be like the rose, which even if crushed exudes its sweet fragrance. Be a human rose, spread- ing the essence of peace wherever you go. Kriya Yoga Gives the True Experience of Religion Your life will reflect spiritual consciousness if you medi- tate. Since the publication of my book [ Autobiography of a Yogi], everyone is asking about Kriya Yoga. That is my purpose. I didn't come to give theological abstractions, but a technique whereby those who are sincere can truly know God, not just theorize about Him.

Jesus said: \"Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?\"* When by Kriya Yoga I open my spiritual eye, the whole world drops away from my consciousness, and God is with me. And why not? I am His child. St. Ignatius said, \"God seeks willing hearts that He may give His bounties to them....\"t That is most beautiful, and that is what I believe. God seeks willing hearts for the bestowal of His gifts. He is willing to give us everything, but we are not willing to make the effort to be receptive. He looks in our hearts, and if they are filled with something else, He does not come. But when you can truthfully say to Him, \"Lord, there is nothing in my heart but Thee,\" He will come. For a while He will play hide-and-seek with you,- but if you are persistent, you will begin to see wonderful things hap- pening, mysteriously, that you know come from God. In time, you will receive His clear response in the form of direct answers to your prayers, or in visions of the saints. Then at last He will come to you openly. You will be able to talk to Him; you will be able to commune with Him. Nervousness will never again be able to touch you once you are permanently anchored in the realization of God's Presence. * Luke 6:46 (Bible). t Paraphrased from Colossians 3:23-24 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Divine Harmony Written in the 1920s or early 1930s Each morning as the glad sun steals into my room and by a soft touch of his rays gently wakes me, I rub my sleep-filled eyes, look up at the sky bathed in radiance, and say: \"O God of light, let Thy fingers of illumination play over every key of my life, that all the notes may unite in one song of harmony and love. Let no inimical note harm the concord of this melody; let no discordant measure mar the musical composition that I write with my life.\" My prayers to God are not for things temporal, but for those that abide. Fame, which vanishes like a dewdrop in the sun, or wealth, which passes like a breath of wind, hold no in- terest for me. I want a life that is humbly serviceful, and abun- dance that is more than material riches. What could be more de- sirable than to live a full, harmonious life that is all-reaching and all-giving? Disharmony is misery and death; harmony is the joy of life. We Live in Two Worlds This world is not the same to all people. Each one lives in his own little domain. One may reside in an aesthetic realm of poetry and music,- another in a gross region of cries of flesh and of sighs after matter. Peace and harmony may reign in one person's world; strife and war in another's. But whatever be the circumstances of one's environment, it consists of both an in- ner world and an outer world. The outside world is the one in which your life engages in action and interaction. The world inside of you determines your happiness or unhappiness, and also your fitness or unfitness, expressed in the world outside.

In one of his works, Mark Twain tells of two tourists who got out of bed, wrapped themselves in blankets, and rushed out to see the sun rise over the Alps. But their mental timing was topsy-turvy. While they reveled in the glorious display of light and colored clouds, to their dismay the sun went down in- stead of up into the sky! Travel weary, they had slept through the whole day. People are convinced that their own personal perceptions are \"fact,\" until contrary evidence eventually proves otherwise. Who can persuade biased individuals that the whole universe moves in an eternal cosmic rhythm, and that all irregularities are misconceptions due to limited or distorted vision? Those who can hear, hear; those who can see, see; those who have a perceptive heart perceive the divine harmony that runs through all creation. To many Western philosophers and thinkers, who view the world only through the reports of the senses, nature appears full of strife and discord. In the storm, they read a story of fury ; in the earthquake, a tale of the misery the earth has to bear. To their sensitive understanding, the struggle waged by the whole of nature in quest of food is an offensively discordant note in the Creator's song. \"Is it harmony,\" these thinkers in- quire, \"when life to animals means death to plants, and the blood and bone of animals means food for man?\" In all of na- ture there is vying for dominance and survival: One species wars against another; one race against another; one nation against another. Where is the harmony? To the untrained ear, some music may sound like a bab- ble of noise. To an uneducated eye, a masterpiece of art may look like whimsical strokes of the painter's brush. The mind not attuned to the love of God does not see the meaning of the anomalies of His creation. Even a man such as Nietzsche, in spite of his brilliant flashes of insight and intuition, could not discern the inner harmony that is the very heart of all man- ifestations. Is it any wonder, then, that lesser minds do not comprehend this truth? To penetrate into the soul of creation, yoga insight is required."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"DIVINE HARMONY 101 There Is Harmony at the Core of Disharmony Things are not what they seem. When you look at a mere cross section of something, it makes little sense. But view the whole of it, and lo! a meaningful image emerges. Similarly, the magnificent painting of creation stretches across the infi- nite canvas of time and space. Every object and event in na- ture is a masterful stroke of the Great Painter. But the ordinary person sees only confusing bits and pieces of these depictions. Consider everything that happens as a note in the sym- phony of the Cosmic Conductor. Individual notes seem mean- ingless until heard in relation to the whole composition. In the Creator's cosmic magnum opus, which has been playing throughout all time, everything—storm, death, love, life—has its part in the medley. All unite in a universal rhythm of har- mony, which is heard only when the soul is attuned to God in meditation. In the \"Vision of Visions\" in the Bhagavad Gita,* Sri Krishna bestowed on Arjuna this realization of universal unity amidst all seeming diversity, the Immutable Harmony in the core of creation's fluctuating disharmony. \"The Lord said: 'Behold Me as the Cosmic Idol in the Temple of Omnipres- ence—the whole cosmos of gods, men, and Nature!'\" How limited is the scope of man's perception. You have ears, but do they really hear? You have eyes, but do they truly see? You have a heart, but are its feelings accurate? You have a soul, but is your consciousness a pure expression of that di- vinity? Those who are of night live in darkness,- those who are of the day live in the light. Only those who partake of the har- mony within their souls know the harmony that runs through nature. Whosoever lacks this inner harmony feels also a lack of it in the world. The mind in chaos finds chaos all around. How can one know what peace is like if he has never tasted it? But he who has inner peace can abide in this state even in the midst of outer discord.

But she had no patience with him and was grimly determined to end what she considered to be his impractical spirituality. Failing in all of her other devilish devices, she set about to burn all his books, and consequently set fire to their house as well. At this the yogi drew near to his wife and said, \"Dear lady, I love you more than ever. You have been God-sent to me. All this while you have taught me to be patient. Now you have healed my last infirmity, love for and attachment to books and a home.\" Who or what can disturb the trained and tran- quil mind of a real yogi? We Run After Rainbows We do not always see the things that are nearest to us. We pass by riches that lie close at hand and chase after rainbows. We seek security in darkness, when in reality we are longing for light. We drink unslaking golden dreams when our souls are athirst for the Ultimate Reality. We run after the nonexistent sheltering shade of mirages while actually craving the oasis of peace and harmony that lies within our souls. The inharmo- nious diversity that beckons to us outside is a mere shadow- play of the real treasures that are inside. Quiet the outgoing mental restlessness and turn the mind within. Harmonize your thoughts and desires with the all-fulfilling realities you already possess in your soul. Then you will see the underlying har- mony in your life and in all nature. If you harmonize your hopes and expectations with this inherent harmony, you will float through life on buoyant wings of peace. The beauty and depth of yoga lies in its bestowal of this invariable tranquility. Harmony Is Born of Love and Wisdom Harmony is born of love and wisdom. These, in turn, are offspring of a heart that is pure and outreaching. A pure heart is the result of pure thoughts.

When the mental con- flict of divergent thoughts ceases, owing to the elimination of wrong thinking, there arises in one's life an outward as well as an inward harmony. Therefore, whenever your thoughts en- gage in a family quarrel among themselves, mediate their dif- ferences with wisdom and behold! distressing conflicts will disturb you no more. Such is the experience and testimony of those who practice yoga. The mind is nature's incinerator wherein you can burn to ashes all mental dross that is not worthy to be saved: your waste thoughts and desires, your misconceptions and grievances, and your discords in human relationships. There is not a single relationship, however estranged, you cannot reconcile, pro- vided you do so first in your own mind. There is not a single problem in life you cannot resolve, provided you first solve it in your inner world, its place of origin. Be not intimidated by con- sequences, even though they be drastic. Before you act, if you first harmonize the situation with the discriminative wisdom in your mind, the outcome will take care of itself. A harmonized mind produces harmony in this world of seeming discord. Inner Harmony Breeds Strength Inner harmony is a prolific source of power; it breeds strength. Things that you think you are unable to bear, you can not only bear but change and improve. To you is given the power that can move the world and alter the face of fate de- spite inharmonious outer circumstances. Cervantes wrote his famous Don Quixote in a prison cell, as did Sir Walter Raleigh his history. Harmony conserves mental energy; disharmony dis- sipates it. If the mind is a battleground of thoughts fighting against thoughts, without decision, without concord, enough energy is consumed that could instead have rebuilt life ideally.

He must first feel at home with himself, then he will find harmony in his interaction with all with whom he comes in contact. One who finds fault with others usually doesn't have a high regard for himself either. Such persons do not know the harmonious center of their being. They become tired of every- thing, sometimes even of life itself. No wonder such people see only disharmony wherever they go. This is why even some millionaires commit suicide, in spite of all their material power and possessions. There is no happiness in wealth or in any- thing else unless there is peace-producing harmony in the mind. Those who cannot find peace in their own hearts will not find it elsewhere either. Harmony Is the Secret Principle of Life Good judgment is a natural expression of wisdom; but it is directly dependent on harmony within, which is poise of mind. When the mind lacks harmony, it has no peace,- and without peace it lacks both judgment and wisdom. Life is full of bumps and knocks.

Harmony is the soul of organization; disharmony is death. Harmony is the fruit of common understanding. \"With all thy getting, get understanding.\"* Efforts to establish harmony among human beings or nations solely on the basis of economic equality or equivalence of military preparedness are sure to fail. There can never be understanding if the attention is fixed on things as temporal as gold pieces, navies, and guns. It is not parity in wealth nor an equal number of bombs or cruisers that will bring peace to man and to this world, but the inner har- mony of the individual human souls who comprise the various nations and the social structures in them. What is necessary is an understanding of the common higher necessities for the preservation and true happiness of the bodies, minds, and souls of all beings. Cosmic Harmony Is the Pulsating Heart of God Love and forbearance are essential to the growth of har- mony. Love nurtures all things that grow; it harmonizes and unites. Hatred agitates and separates; and indifference destroys what could have been made good and beneficial. Love is har- mony and harmony is love. Hearts that do not love are never visited by angels of harmony. Love is the highest, the grandest, the most inspiring, the most sublime principle in creation. All human souls, the world, the whole universe, are attuned to the cosmic eternal harmony of love. Disharmony arises from igno- rance of this divine unity, which is the heart of God pulsating in everything He has created.

First Self-Realization Fellowship Temple at Encinitas, California, February 13, 1938 Truth is a very ambiguous word; it is a difficult concept to explain. Everyone has convictions they swear to as truth. But among countless differing ideas, what is really true? Truth is relative, and truth is absolute. It passes through many evolutions in the relative stages before it reaches the ab- solute state. For example, two people are discussing a business venture. One makes a proposal that is sure to bring success, and the other person makes a counterproposal that accomplishes the same goal but has additional advantages. But then a third person comes along and has an even better idea. Each method was \"true\" in its own right, but in a relative sense. Truth Is That Which Gives Permanent Happiness In the absolute sense, anything that contradicts true hap- piness is untruth; and that which gives permanent happiness is truth. Permanent happiness refers not to the temporary thrill that comes with material success and pleasure, but to the joy found in the soul's attunement with God. By this standard, you can judge any action you perform as to its projected end result— whether or not that action will promote lasting happiness.

These laws are basic truths that are eternal and not subject to man's manipulation.

If you want to find truth, your thoughts and actions must be true— physically, morally, and spiritually in accord with the eternal divine principles. Truth is the ultimate Substance. Let me first explain where the presence of that Substance is to be found. Everything is linked with Cosmic Intelligence—the tree, the sky, a bird, man. That link is called Substance, the essential nature of all phe- nomena. It is the connecting link that makes of all manifesta- tions one Essence. This Substance or Truth is hidden; what you see are only phenomenal appearances arising out of Substance by the power of cosmic delusion, or maya. The Three Ways of Arriving at Truth Now, there are three ways of arriving at truth: through sense perception, through inference, and through intuition. If your sense perception is wrong, your inference is wrong. Looking at the horizon you may think there is a fire, because you see smoke; but as you approach the site, you find it was just a cloud of dust. In order to apprehend the truth of anything, you depend on your sight, hearing, smell, taste, or touch, plus the power of the mind. These, however, could not be ultimate proof of the truth; because if the senses lie, the mind will lie. Your mind draws its conclusions from what the senses perceive, and the senses are extremely limited. Jesus therefore conveyed truth to the masses in parables \"because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.\"* The ears are tuned only to certain rates of vibration. The highest and lowest sounds your ears cannot catch. If the power of your hearing were sufficiently increased, you would hear the magnificent sound that the universe is making as it rolls along through space. Everything is in motion and that motion is ac- companied by sound. Nothing is at rest, except in that tran- scendental sphere of Spirit where there is no vibration. Right within your body you can hear those vibratory sounds of cre- ation, manifestations of the omnipresent Aum or Amen.

Intuition: All-Knowing Power of the Soul So how are you going to find the truth, the reality that lies behind what the senses perceive? You cannot do it by your rationalizing mind, because your mind falls victim to the senses,- it only infers about what the senses tell it. The mind therefore does not comprehend the infinite forces that are dancing all around. Only by the development of intuition can you know what is truth. Intuition is direct perception. It is the all-knowing pure comprehension of the soul. You have an inkling of the nature of intuition through those unexplained feelings called hunches. A hunch is undeveloped intuition, something you know without the medium of the senses or inference, some truth that comes of itself. You may be sitting quietly, and for no reason you think of someone you * Dr. George Washington Crile (1864-1943) was an army surgeon who de- voted his career to discovering a better understanding of the phenomena of life.

Now, how did you know? It was through a momentary flash of intuition. That kind of spontaneous intuition all of you have had at some time. Errors in judgment are a result of not having developed intuition. Most of you have had the feeling that you could be great, and do great things; but because you have lacked intu- itive power, that potential has, for the most part, remained dor- mant. To progress and to avoid the misery of mistakes, you have to find what is the truth in everything. This is possible only if you develop your intuition. That is the practical truth of the matter. That is why I am asking you to cultivate and use intuitive power in everything. In your relationships with others, in your business, in your married life, in every part of your life, intuition is essential. By not developing the faculty of intuition, you make wrong decisions, pick up the wrong business associates, and get caught up in wrong personal relationships. Since the judgment of your mind is conditioned by the information fed to it by the senses, if your senses become deluded you may think a person is wonder- ful without knowing what he truly is inside. You may think you have found your soul mate, so you enter into matrimony; and then end up in the divorce court. But intuition will never make such a mistake. It will not look at the magnetic power of the eyes or at the attractive face or personality of a person, but will feel and perceive accurately in the heart what that person is really like. By the power of intuition, which I learned to develop from my guru, Sri Yukteswarji, I have never made a mistake about human nature. Intuition has been very helpful to me in that regard. But I do not try to see the wrong side of people; to help others I give them unconditional love, even when I know they may misuse my trust. Many people, lacking intuition, put a lot of money into fi- nancial prospects that do not produce anything, and conse- quently they lose everything. I have been successful in every decision I have made through intuitive power. It never fails. As you develop, intuition comes as a certain feeling or a still voice.

Men are generally ruled more by reason than by feeling; but if they have fine intelligence balanced with feel- ing, that leads to intuition. Through Intuition, Know the Purpose of Your Existence If you use your intuition, you will know the very purpose for which you exist in this world; and when you find that, you find happiness. This earth is a stage, and God is the Stage Man- ager. If everyone insisted on being kings and queens, an unfold- ing drama would be impossible. The servant and the hero as well as the royalty must perform their parts well for the play to be- come successful. The villains are those who upset the righteous drama of the Lord. Those who choose such a role must pay dearly for their blundering disregard of divine direction. No matter what material position one possesses or fortune one has amassed, he cannot be called successful if it was gained by evil means. True happiness is possible only if one plays his part rightly, and not otherwise. The one who is playing the million- aire, and the one who is playing the role of a small business- man—both are the same to God. On the last day, God shears every person of all possessions and titles. What you have ac- quired in your soul is all that you take with you. Great ones like Jesus know truth because of their intuitive power. They perceive not only through the eyes and the mind, but through intuition that is so developed that they know everything. Jesus, who lived such a pure life, knew he would nevertheless be betrayed and crucified. But he knew also he would be ultimately in the arms of immortal God. So are we all the children of God, sent here to play our part; it is not the part, but how we play it, that concerns God. Never be discour- aged when your role is difficult. When you will be through with your acting, you will be received as a child of God. Until then, you will not be wholly free.

That voice has long been drowned in the mire of untrue thoughts. The surest way to liberate the expression of intuition is by meditation, early in the morning and before going to bed at night. As you keep your engagements for business, and for everything else that you think of as important, so should you not forget your engagement with God. You may think you are too busy, but suppose God were too busy to give you life? You would drop in your tracks! To keep your daily appointment with God you must reserve the time for Him. Meditate and pray deeply; and wait for His response. If you repeatedly call on Him with ever deeper concentration, He will answer your prayer. A joy and peace will strike your heart. When that comes, you know that you are communing with God. If you make the ef- fort, you shall contact that Power. Give yourself that opportunity. You cannot succeed unless you try. If you spend your life in constant excitement, you will never know true happiness. Live simply and take life more eas- ily. Happiness lies in giving yourself time to think and to in- trospect. Be alone once in a while, and remain more in silence. If the radio is going all the time, or other stimuli are con- stantly bombarding the senses, it truly affects the nerves and creates nervousness. And don't think so much about reforming others; reform yourself first. The greatest field of victory is your own home. If you are an angel at home, you can be an angel everywhere. The sweetness of your voice, the peace of your behavior, is needed in your own household more than anywhere else. Attain the Power That Never Fails When you contact God, intuitive perception of truth will guide you in everything you do. Seven years ago I came in a housecar to this site overlooking the ocean [Encinitas] and said, \"I feel there will be a great place here one day.\" And today we have here our temple and hermitage—the nucleus of an ideal center for God.

I am telling you today of the omnipresent Christ or Krishna Consciousness through which He may be found. An ordinary man is conscious chiefly of sensory impres- sions.

Although he is tied to his body, by his intelli- gence he can stretch his imagination to the heavens. He can discover that the light of a star which has been dead millions of years is still traveling to reach the earth. But no matter how he develops mentally, man is still sub- 114"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"THE OMNIPRESENT CONSCIOUSNESS OF CHRIST AND KRISHNA 115 ject to the limitations of his physical body. If a stone hits him, he is finished. Jesus proved by spiritual development a great scientific truth: the body is indestructible energy. It is not the physical solid that it seems. * By modern definition the physical vehicle of man is essen- tially an electromagnetic wave. If the body of a 180-pound man were placed in certain acids, it would dissolve completely. Where would it have gone? Seemingly evaporated, that body would have become a mass of gases. Its total atomic weight would still be 180 pounds. The only difference, when a body has been bro- ken up into its component atoms, is that you cannot see it any- more with the physical eyes; only scientific instruments can de- tect its presence as atomic vapors. The disappearance of the body does not mean that it has become nonexistent; it has merely changed form, remaining hidden somewhere in the ether. Metaphysically, the body may be viewed as a thought in the mind of God. It exists in His consciousness in much the same way that it exists in our consciousness when we behold it during the dream state. Our dreaming consciousness creates a body form out of concentrated thought and energy. It vanishes when our consciousness reenters the turbulent waking state. Jesus had attained that consciousness wherein he knew by direct realization that the body is only a mass of energy. Be- cause he had realized this, and not merely imagined it, he was able to resurrect his body after its crucifixion. Earlier, when one of his followers had cut off the ear of a servant of the high priest, Jesus put his hand on the wound and made the ear whole again.t Modern science has yet to discover how this is done. The ultimate goal is to realize that the body, and all else in this uni- verse, is essentially Spirit. The ordinary man is not aware of this. Jesus the Christ was. One needs to understand Jesus in the light of his spiritual ex- perience of the Cosmic Consciousness of the Heavenly Father pres- ent in all creation. His name was Jesus; his title was \"Christ\"— an ancient term that corresponds to the Sanskrit kutastha (\"the * A truth also demonstrated throughout the ages by great yogis of India, t \"And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him\" [Luke 22:51, Bible)."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"116 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION consciousness that is in every atom\"). He was Jesus the Christ. More than three thousand years ago, before the time of Jesus, there was born in India a great avatar whose family name was Jadava. \"Krishna\" (or \"Christ-na\") was his spiritual title, and it means the same as \"Christ\": the divine consciousness that is omnipresent in creation. He was Jadava the Krishna.* The scriptures tell of the wonderful powers of Christ and Krishna, showing that their consciousness was not tied to the body like the ordinary man's. Jesus and Jadava had expanded their consciousness beyond the confines of the fleshly human form to include the universe—their cosmic body. They were at- tuned to the divine consciousness that is simultaneously present in every atom. It was not imagination,- they had become one in consciousness with the Heavenly Father who is omnipresent and omniscient. That expansion of consciousness which Jesus and Jadava experienced had to be learned. All men can simi- larly expand their consciousness to infinity, through devotion and scientific meditation on the Lord. \"God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit, \"t So \"Jesus Christ\" means \"Jesus whose consciousness fills the entire universe.\" When his friend Lazarus died in Bethany, and Jesus, in another place, said to his disciples, \"Lazarus sleep- eth,\"t he didn't know this through any human informant. It was the universal Christ Consciousness manifesting in him that en- abled him to feel himself present not only in his own body but in the body of Lazarus. He referred to this omnipresent Intelli- gence when he said: \"Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without [the sight of] your Father. \"§ If you close your eyes and ask ten people to touch you, you know exactly when and where each touch falls. God similarly feels and sees everywhere in His great cosmos. Jesus Christ and Jadava Krishna had attained that omnipresent consciousness. Jesus therefore realized that his body was a creation of God's mind and, being in tune with that Cosmic Consciousness; * Reverentially referred to as Bhagavan (\"Lord\") Krishna, t John 4:24 (Bible). tjohn 11:11 (Bible). § Matthew 10:29 (Bible)"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"THE OMNIPRESENT CONSCIOUSNESS OF CHRIST AND KRISHNA 117 was able to re-create his body three days after it had been cru- cified and laid away in a tomb. Krishna had the same power and performed many similar spiritual feats. On one occasion he held a mountain aloft over the village where he was. Many such miracles are thought to be merely legends, but most of them are true. Krishna was one of the greatest yogis of India. Yoga teaches that body control by which you can understand that the flesh is simply condensed energy. And what is energy but the product of God's thought? He concentrated, or thought, and there was energy. The Universe Consists of Materialized Thoughts Suppose I dream that I have created man and water and earth and when I wake up I find that I have not created anything except ideas. Similarly, the difference between solids, liquids, and gases is only a difference in God's thought. Jesus understood this, and because he was attuned to the divine consciousness, he could walk on water and change water into wine. He beheld the body and the water as projected thoughts of God and real- ized that it was a simple matter for one thought (the water) to uphold another thought (his body). If you fall asleep and dream, you might see yourself walking on the water as Jesus did. Why doesn't the body in the dream drown in the dream ocean? Because both are merely thoughts. So once you realize, as Jesus did, that there is essentially noth- ing in the universe but mind or consciousness, you can do any- thing. The body is a materialized thought and the ocean is a ma- terialized thought and you can put one thought on another. Jesus and Krishna can appear to you in response to the call of your heartfelt devotion. The invisible will become visible, just as steam vapor can by a process of condensation be frozen into a solid piece of ice. The intangible God can be similarly \"frozen\" by your devotion into the visible form of Krishna or Jesus or any saint whom you yearn to behold. It is not necessary to see Christ in form when you meditate on him, though he can be seen in form. My theme today is the spiritual Christ. In order to know that Jesus you must know his spirit. His body was like any other man's but his spirit was in the whole universe. If you can't imagine this, close your"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"118 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION eyes for a moment. You do not see your body anymore. Yet in your mind you can travel millions of miles in any direction without the use of your body. Mind is the creator of every- thing. When you know the nature of the mind, you have con- trol of everything, for all is mind. These beautiful buildings and grounds sprang from thought. Nothing exists but that it came out of the Cosmic Mind. Therefore remember Christ as the universal consciousness that beholds us from the stars, that is aware of even the tiniest grain of sand on the shore. I hear His song in the bird and in the voice of the wind; I see His beauteous form in the sky and in the mountains and the ocean. Every thought I think comes from the consciousness of Christ. During each cosmic cycle of creation, Spirit divides Itself into the Trinity. In the role of the Father, Spirit is the Creator of the universe. As He thought, there came into being the electrons and atoms, and they began to condense into vapor, and the va- por into water, and the water into solids. Thus Spirit projected out of Itself the cosmic creation. This is His form, His body. The Intelligence throughout the cosmos is called Christ In- telligence or Kutastha Chaitanya. This is the \"only begotten Son,\"* or reflection of the Father's Intelligence present in all cre- ation. Jesus and Krishna were in tune with that Consciousness. Correspondence of the Trinity in Hindu and Christian Scriptures The Holy Trinity of the Christian scriptures, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, corresponds with the Trinity of the Hindu scriptures: Aum, Tat, Sat. God the Father is Sat, Spirit beyond all creation. The Son is Tat, the Kutastha Chaitanya or Christ Intelligence present in all creation. The Holy Ghost is Aum, or Amen, the Word or Cosmic Vibration that structures creation. When at the end of a creative cycle God dissolves every- thing within Himself, there is only one principle, Spirit: ever- existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss.

The ego is the pseudo-self, the soul responding to the world of duality while in a state of identification with the limited instruments of the physical body and mind. For the purpose of discussion, let us say that anything you do for the benefit of your self, either as the soul or the ego, may be called selfishness. In this usage, evil selfishness is that which you think you are doing for the good of yourself, but which goes against the interest of your true Self. Good selfishness, spiritual selfishness, consists of those actions by which the pure Self within you can be realized; it helps you continu- ously to manifest the perfection of that innate image of Spirit. Selfishness is characterized by different gradations. The actions of a child are performed more or less unthinkingly. When he sees somebody else playing with different toys, he wants to possess them. He wants to eat this thing or to do that thing because he sees someone else enjoying it. This is uncon- scious selfishness. I watched this reaction in my own child- hood. When I was very little and saw others playing with something, my first thought was to possess it. But soon I found that whenever I wanted something, there was always somebody else trying to get it or hold on to it. So I began to exert my strong will to possess what I wanted. But when this brought about fights with others, I wondered if it was right to assume such an attitude. My mother used to say, when giving some special treat of food to me, \"Share this with somebody else.\" Initially, my re- action was that she was trying to give me less. But immedi- ately I began to picture in my mind, \"Well, if I like this food 122"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"SPIRITUAL SELFISHNESS VERSUS EVIL SELFISHNESS 123 so much, maybe somebody else would also like it.\" So I de- cided I should share. Then came the thought, \"If I share with everybody, there will be nothing at all left for me.\" That be- gan to puzzle me. But my experience was that if I shared with others, then I enjoyed more—the joy received from sharing was even greater than the joy I got from the thing I had shared. That is why I have always parted with whatever I have loved. When- ever some possession was wanted or needed by somebody else, my mind would say, \"Well, he is 'sick' with this desire; you were healed of your wish for it, so now let him have that benefit.\" One by one I gave away everything that came to me— and my joy was multiplied. When I wanted something and got it, I enjoyed; and when I gave it to somebody else, I enjoyed it again. No desire has ever been permitted to take possession of my soul; that would be contrary to the ideal of spiritual self- ishness for the welfare of my true Self. Never love anything so much that it possesses you. The Idea of Possession Is a False Notion Whatever you give out, you will attract in kind. What you are will show in your countenance and actions, and others will feel the underlying vibration and respond accordingly. If you set an example of evil selfishness, others will want to take everything from you. But if you are the opposite, you will find everybody inclined to be generous toward you. Sup- pose you give me your favorite walking stick, and in return I want to give you something. But my mind says, \"You can't part with your umbrella, even though you know he has admired it.\" Then I reason, \"He loved his stick, yet he gave it to me ; so I wish to give him something I value.\" That is the spirit which predominates when a person shows unselfishness. You cannot own anything. You are only given temporary use of things on this earth. Sometime you will have to part with them—either by accident or theft or deterioration or death. So when you try to hold on to or save anything just for the sake of possessing, you are fooling yourself. Even this bodily house that you have lived in for so many years must one day be relinquished. So it is wrong to impose on the soul a conviction that you own something you cannot ever"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"124 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION own. When something is given to you, know that it is yours only for a little while, and be willing to share it with others. Great trouble lies in coveting more than you need. The Gita says: \"That person realizes peace who, relinquishing all de- sires, exists without craving and is unidentified with the mor- tal ego and its sense of 'mine-ness.'\"* No doubt you must have necessary necessities such as food, clothing, and some material security; but in aspiring after these, omit unnecessary \"neces- sities\"—the nagging desires that crave more and more. The World Family Is Your Greater Self Always have in your mind the ideal that while you are la- boring for your own needs you will help others acquire what they need, and will share with those less fortunate what you receive. Remember that you are a part of the world family, and you cannot exist without it. What would life be like with- out the carpenter or inventor or farmer? Through interchange God wants us to think of others. It is a grave error to live only for oneself. Whenever you think of your own happiness, think also of giving happiness to others. You are not asked to give away everything for the welfare of your world family. That is im- possible. But you should have consideration for others even as you have for yourself. God intended that man should thereby be truly spiritu- ally selfish, serving his greater Self in others. But the first, and often the last, thought of the ordinary man is for himself. Self- preservation is a strong instinct. The world creates in us that delusion of self-preservation by which we limit ourselves to our own bodies and those things we consider our own. How- ever, everybody is our own; for God is our Father, and we are all His children. God gave man intelligence and imagination that he might remember when he is cold or hungry that there are others around him who also know what it is to be cold or hungry. So in seeking your own comfort, reach out to provide comfort for * Bhagavad Gita 11:71."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"SPIRITUAL SELFISHNESS VERSUS EVIL SELFISHNESS 125 others also. Since you yourself do not like misery, you should assist those around you in order to allay their misery. They suf- fer just like you—and some even more so. If you say about your family and close friends, \"Well, these people are mine, and I in- clude in my happiness only them and no more,\" then you limit yourself and your misery starts to increase. Keep yourself ready to help others, and find happiness in giv- ing happiness to whoever crosses your path. Do not think of it as having to practice unselfishness. That makes it seem some- thing hard to do. Rather, feel that what you are doing is for your own pleasure—the joy you find in removing the unhappiness of others, physically, mentally, or spiritually. Without Evil Selfishness the World Would Be Heaven The whole world would be heaven today if it had given up evil selfishness and followed spiritual selfishness. In the error of evil selfishness lies the cause of all wars. First came stone clubs and then bows and arrows to protect one's own self- ishness against the selfishness of others. Then guns were in- vented, then machine guns, and now bombs and poisonous gases—all to protect the selfishness of one group of people against the selfishness of another group. Man's potential de- structive power has grown much more than his constructive power. The boil of evil selfishness must eventually come to a head. But more bodies will have to be broken before man comes to the realization that national selfishness is just as evil as personal selfishness. A nation is built of small commu- nities, and they are built of individuals. The right ideals must begin with the individuals; and you must begin with yourself. See what happened because of evil selfishness: wars in Spain and China, and the Depression. This country [America] first had national selfishness in which for years she enjoyed prosper- ity. Similarly, India in her golden age was extremely prosperous. But the karmic consequences of selfishness and pride, resulting in the misuse of the caste system, caused India to lose her free- dom.* America must not abuse her freedom nor forget her spir- * Reference to the long period of foreign domination that ended ten years af- ter this talk was given, when India gained her independence in 1947."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"126 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION itual ideals of equality or she could suffer a similar karmic fate. Prejudice based on race and skin color is one of the worst forms of selfishness. Climatic conditions will change, so that in the distant future much of the Western populace could well be- come dark-skinned, and those of the East become the \"white race.\" The boundaries and governments of the world are ever- lastingly subject to change. This country, for example, belonged to the native Indians before you claimed it; and in the ages to come, many, many others will yet hold title to it. Great Britain was once ruled by Rome. Genghis Khan conquered most of Asia; but where is he now? This is the paradox of the earthly drama. It is God's creation and we own nothing in it! What a great error it is to propagate misery through the evil selfish- ness of a false sense of possessiveness. Selfishness that seeks happiness with no consideration for the happiness of others, or that tramples on and destroys the rightful interests of others for its own ends, proliferates unhap- piness. That is what is happening in America today. Everybody had good jobs and there was plenty. But now the big industries are taking prosperity from the little ones and the little ones are trying to undercut the big ones. Profiteering is a great mistake. Communism, which on the surface expounds the good of the masses, will not work because it is based on suppression and force. But what Jesus and all truly great ones teach is unself- ishness based on spiritual willingness to share. That method avoids evil individual selfishness in business and communi- ties. When your neighbors and your nation will be your own self, then you will have spiritual selfishness. If you look only to the welfare of the hands and feet and do not look after your head, your brain will not work to guide your motor skills. You must harmonize the working of the en- tire body. Similarly, the brains (executives) of the nations must work harmoniously with the hands and feet (labor). When they are divided in their interests, there is bound to be disorder and suffering. You do not want labor to take control, for then you will have communism; and you do not want the capitalists to have sole rule, for then you will have dictatorship. There must be a"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"SPIRITUAL SELFISHNESS VERSUS EVIL SELFISHNESS 127 balance, and that equilibrium will never be perfect without individual unselfishness. The Joy in Being Unselfish Jesus Christ gave up his body for all, but he is enjoying eternal life. In being unselfish he was looking after his spiritual selfishness. You also must be able to give up your evil selfish- ness for a higher selfishness. Use your imagination! Materi- ally you will not lose anything, mentally you will not lose any- thing; but by evil selfishness you will lose everything. In this world there are two teachers. If you take God as your mentor, you will have a wonderful time; but if you choose the devil as your guide, you will have bullets of misery. The key word for most people as they go through life is \"myself.\" The spiritual man, on the other hand, thinks equally of oth- ers. Those who think only of themselves attract enmity from their associates. But those who are thoughtful find others wanting to be thoughtful of them. If there are one hundred peo- ple in a town and each one is trying to take from the other, each one has ninety-nine enemies. But if each one is trying to help the other, each one has ninety-nine friends. I have lived that way. I haven't lost anything by giving up everything. I have gained. The words of Jesus are wonderful: \"Everyone that hath forsaken all for my name's sake shall re- ceive a hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.\"* No matter what I have given up, much more has been given to me. I want nothing now, because what I have is far greater than anything the world can give to me. Everything man wants is for the purpose of acquiring happiness; so when you have true happiness with you all the time, you do not want or need the conditions of happiness. As regards material things, I have no bank account of my own. My security in this world lies in the goodwill of men. I do not believe in any other earthly security. If one is enthroned in the hearts of his fellow beings, that is the greatest kingship. By being unselfish, wholly unattached, you will be truly happy. If you set that example, others in your family or neigh- * Paraphrased from Matthew 19:29 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"128 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION borhood or business will follow you. Start with that spiritual selfishness in your life; do away with evil selfishness, which is the root cause of all trouble, whether individual or national. Unselfishness Expands the Consciousness As soon as you think kindly of somebody else, your con- sciousness has expanded. When you think of your neighbor, a part of your being goes forth with that thought. And it is not only thinking that is necessary, but being prepared to act on that thought. Even if you have an enemy, he is your neighbor. Do not exclude anyone's happiness from the vision of your mind. In marriage is a lesson in unselfishness. Two individuals learn to share with each other. Then children come and the parents share with them. But it again becomes selfish if they think only of their own little family: \"Us four and no more.\" In time, loved ones will be taken away,- it is a reminder that the purpose of human relationships is to stretch the conscious- ness by sacrificing for others and sharing with others. There is so much happiness in being unselfish. It is the greatest happiness, for in unselfishness you guard your own happiness. My goal is the happiness of others for the happi- ness of myself. You can never know the joy of that achieve- ment unless by unselfishness you include others when you think of your own happiness—not only those who are related to you, but all. Look at Gandhi. He had money, position,- but he gave up everything. And his wife followed him, not even demanding a few bonds for the security of herself and her sons. They gave up all and lived for others,- having nothing, they have everything. Gandhi has set a supreme example of humility and unselfish- ness in this age. Jesus said: \"Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased.\" * Egotism and selfishness must be destroyed out and out. These two kindred evils have driven from the earth the kingdom of God. The world got away from spiritual selfishness, which takes care of the entire man properly, and fell victim to evil selfishness.

Every one of you, start by applying the rule of selflessness. Live it. Don't be afraid for yourself. Suffer a little if it is necessary,- but don't give up that ideal of unselfish- ness. Live for others,- don't think first of yourself. Show the ex- ample by giving to others. This doesn't mean that you are to re- duce yourself to poverty; it means to be caring and sharing. Serve Others With Truth Through Your Example Live the principles of truth in your life,- and by your ex- ample and deeds share those ideals. You cannot teach un- selfishness to others unless you yourself are unselfish. Start it yourself, then others will follow suit. I have given my life to serving others with truth. I used to travel and speak before huge audiences. But I know I can better serve all through my writings. Crowds can be drawn, but they do not necessarily come to find God; rather, they come for a period of spiritual relaxation and inspiration. I am seeking souls who have a real desire for God. That is why I have always em- phasized the necessity of communing with God. This is of the utmost importance. All those on this path of Self-Realization who will seek God in earnestness, with serious attention and continuity of devotion, and with steadiness of meditation, will find Him. Meditate. Meditate and meditate! That is your watch- word. God drown Self-Realization if ever it becomes an organi- zation that is only eager to fill halls and draw crowds of people without having, foremost, the desire to give them Self-realiza- tion. I have done all this organizational work because it was the wish of the Masters.* I am not personally seeking anything from anybody. When I leave this earth and this body, nothing will belong to me. Therefore, I have mentally and materially renounced everything now for God. All I want from you is that you live the life of God. * In his Autobiography of a Yogi. Paramahansa Yogananda wrote: \"The found- ing in the West of a Self-Realization Fellowship organization, a 'hive for the spiritual honey,' was a duty enjoined on me by Sri Yukteswar and Mahavatar Babaji.\" In chapters 27 and 36 of that book, he recounts the events that led up to the establishment of Yogoda Satsanga Society of India/Self-Realization Fel- lowship.

Certainly. Long ago, in the bosom of the ether where we were created as souls, we all were sleeping beneath the shroud of God's wisdom. When He awoke us, we wandered away from Him, like the prodigal son in the Bible story, and forgot our divine kinship with one another. We be- came strangers. Having left our home in God, we are lone trav- elers of destiny on this earth. Do you realize how far away you have roamed, and that you have been wandering for many in- carnations? How many, it is hard to tell. Yet now and then, certain experiences, places, and faces awaken in you an inner feeling of familiarity that whispers of past knowing. Each soul is omniscient; but its external, body-identified ego-nature becomes limited to its present name, family, and en- vironment. On that day when your soul shall remember its di- vine origin, your consciousness will live again in the great man- sion of Spirit, and you will know everything that is in Spirit, just as you now know your little earthly home and family. It is a most wonderful experience to meet and recognize someone you knew before—someone with whom you have traveled the same pathway of life in former incarnations. All those in my family I knew from past lives. And every now and then I meet others who were known to me in previous incar- nations, such as friends of my childhood. Though they have nothing in common with my present life, they are souls I had known before. Even before I had left India to come to this country, and later, when I first arrived in Boston, I was aware that there were many true friends of past lives that I would meet again here.

And the call of that voice has brought you here. Why else, out of millions, were you prompted to come, if not that God has picked you? * Some souls—those who are slightly awakened from the slumber of ignorance that veils memories of past lives—will stop and think: \"Yes, I know what he is saying. Somewhere I have heard his voice before. It is not unfamiliar to me.\" I never saw my usually reserved guru, Swami Sri Yuk- teswarji, as excited as when we first met. He knew that I in- stantly knew who he was; and he knew more than I knew. As Krishna said to his beloved disciple: \"O Arjuna, many births have been experienced by Me and by thee. I am acquainted with them all, whereas thou rememberest them not.\"t I can never forget the joy of recognizing Master at that first meet- ing. Never in my life have I met anyone as great as he. He lived the spirit of God. Sri Yukteswarji was very humble and also very stem. If you associated with him as a friend, you would never have cause to be timid around him. But if you came to him as a disciple, woe unto you if you couldn't take incisive discipline! He never dealt with your words; he worked with your thoughts. Many couldn't take his strictness. But I rejoiced when I saw that he was clear- ing all wrong thoughts from my mind and filling me with divine wisdom.

Not one whom you think yours is yours. Isn't that true? No one is owned by another. Our karmic destinies have each their individual course, and no one can own or control any- one else. But in a different sense, you are not alone in this world. There are some close relationships that endure, and from which we draw support and joy. Who are these souls who are close to you? They are not always those born in your family, but those with whom you feel an inner tie of deep friendship. For in- stance, there are those around me here in the ashrams. I have nurtured them with my ideals. They reflect my thoughts and my perceptions. They are considerate of me, and I of them. I have planted my life in them, and the divine friendship we share is an eternal bond in God. The foundation of friendship is not secured in one life; many lives are needed to build the mansion of friendship. It is built with souls you have known before, life after life. That is why, from among the throngs, Jesus called his disciples to him one by one—those whom he had known before. They met again in the bosom of eternal friendship. Recognizing Those You Knew Before How can you recognize those you knew before? In a crowd of strangers, sometimes there is one whom you feel at first meeting you have known long ago. Others you never feel close to, no matter how much you associate with them. If you are unhampered by prejudices and not deluded by sexual at- traction, and you find souls whose faces and personalities draw you much more strongly than others, it is likely that you knew those souls before. A little test will also help to determine which ones are true friends of the past. You may have a lot of so-called friends,- and they will tell you that you are wonderful, and agree with everything you say. Such persons want you for something for their own benefit. True friends want nothing from you except the joy of your presence. Sometimes the test of friends is in how"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"134 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION they behave toward you when you have done something that happens to rouse or contradict them. Those who are your own will never be vengeful or forsake you, even though there may be disagreements. Those who were your true friends in other lives will have an unconditional love for you. No matter what you do, they will always be your friends. Anyone who loves you unconditionally is someone you knew before. That kind of friend you should be, also. In analyzing who are your friends of past lives, you can also tell by the attunement you share with one another. As you gradually concentrate your consciousness on developing true friendship with another, you find that you begin to know how that person will feel or respond, even before he reacts. If you can do this after only a short acquaintance, certainly you knew that person before. These are some of the signs by which we know who our past friends are. Be a friend to all, but don't expect all to be your friends, unless they have passed these tests. To those who fail, give your love and consideration, but remember that they are not ready for your friendship. You should not allow your heart or feelings to be hurt by them. The mansion of friendship must have a solid foundation. If you think differently from your friends, and lose their friendship because of it, then you know they were not really your friends. You should not try to build the mansion of friendship on the sand of those relationships. Most people are self-centered. They want to please others for what they can get from them. Such persons are \"yes\" peo- ple, led by the expediency of the moment. Never give up your freedom of will or compromise your conscience and ideals for self-gain. Hold fast to right principles. Sincerity Plus Thoughtfulness Be true, be sincere, and friendship will steadily grow. I re- member a discussion with Master about sincerity. I had said, \"Sincerity is everything.\" \"No,\" he responded, \"sincerity plus thoughtfulness is every- thing.\" He went on: \"Suppose you are sitting in the parlor in your home, and there is a beautiful new carpet on the floor. It is raining outside.

But Master had yet to make his point. \"You were sincerely happy to see each other,\" he said, \"but wouldn't you have liked it better if he had been thoughtful enough to take off his muddy boots before he came in and ruined the carpet?\" I had to agree he was right. No matter how well you think of someone, or how close you are to that person, it is important to sweeten that rela- tionship with good manners and thoughtfulness. Then friend- ship becomes truly wonderful and enduring. Familiarity that leads you to be inconsiderate is very harmful to friendship. Sincerity is one of the things I prize most. Do not mix with people who flatter you, for someday such friendships will be torn asunder; you will find that you have wasted your time on them. Always beware of flattery. It is good to encourage oth- ers with wholehearted praise and appreciation, but the insin- cerity of flattery is a poison that destroys the soul of both the giver and the receiver. If anyone prefers flattery to love, he doesn't deserve friendship. Those who give love do not give flattery. And those who give flattery do not give love. If you mix with people with real sincerity, thoughtfulness, and love, then you will attract those whom you knew before. Otherwise, you will never find your real friends. You have to be rid of all hypocrisy and insincerity. And never willfully hurt anyone. Never antagonize your friends, or give them cause to be angry. Never abuse or take advantage of a friend. Never give counsel unless asked for; and when you do give it, do so with sincerity and kindness, unafraid of the consequences. Friends help each other with constructive criticism. To be able to stand criticism is one of the greatest virtues. I learned that from my guru. I have always appreciated con- structive criticism. And I have never sought revenge on those who have unjustly criticized me; nor have I felt unkindly to- ward them, because I realize that even through our enemies God tests us. Isn't this so?

A fake rose can nevei be a real rose. And a real rose will shed its fragrance no mattei how much it is crushed. So never pretend to be what you art not. If you egotistically display yourself before others, the worlc will eventually cast you aside.

He comes only to those who are humble and true devotees. When you love Him, you will know Him; and you will know He is fully present in every soul It doesn't matter whether that soul is covered by a charcoal or 2 diamond personality,- God is equally present in both. But the di- amond mentality of the saint more fully reflects God. There is no joy comparable to that joy which comes when you have earned the friendship of God.

When Friendship Becomes Divine, You Will Love All When you love God, you can truly love others. Your per- ception of souls is pure—like a crystal-clear mirror.

He was well known for his philanthropies, and, like other men of great wealth, no doubt had cause to wonder about the motives of oth- ers he met; he didn't know what I was after. Without prelimi- nary, he asked, \"Do you accept my invitation to come to my home?\" To which I replied, \"I will be glad to, if you accept my invitation also.\" He agreed."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"DID WE MEET BEFOREf 137 Later, when he came to my apartment and saw me cook- ing the meal of curries, he said, \"You know, I like to cook, also.\" We became a little more friendly. Then I remarked ca- sually, \"Mr. Eastman, isn't it true that most rich men have no real friends? I want to meet you as a friend, not as a man of wealth.\" He smiled. From that moment, and during our two-hour visit, I saw a different Eastman, the real Eastman, * because I understood him and met him on the plane of sincere friendship. The next day he sent me a camera, which I have to this day. When you unconditionally love your friends, you will see that divine friendship in them. In my earthly father, and in so many souls on this path, I found that kind of friendship. When we develop friendship with true souls, one day the Friend of all will come and reside in that mansion of friendship. And as you develop true divine friendship, one day you will love all as Christ was the friend of all. Please pray with me: \"O Lord, in the noble character of true friends is Thy wisdom.

As we survey world civilizations and explore the deep nooks of past civilizations, we have a very large outlook before us. We find that man is both an individual and a gregarious ani- mal. Every human being is endowed with the desire for an in- dividual life and a social life; he has individualistic tendencies as well as tendencies to form into clans—even in the earliest savages there was the idea of gathering together as a group. In ordinary life, too much social interaction does not give much happiness, and neither does too much individual exclusive- ness. God wants us to maintain evenness in balancing our in- dividual and our social life. The individualistic and collective principles in man come from God. He is very individualistic: Apart from the stars and the universes and the thoughts of men, beyond all sensations and dreams, transcending all perceptions of matter, the Lord exists by Himself—alone, having no other company; complete within Himself; satisfied in His own Self. \"Where no sun or moon or fire shines, that is My Supreme Abode.\"* It is said that the omnipotent God so loves His eternal silence that He does not want even a little ray of light or tremor of vibration to disturb Him there. In that region of darkless dark and sound- less sound, the uncreated nothingness, the Absolute Essence of * Bhagavad Gita XV:6. 138"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"THE ART OF GETTING ALONG IN THIS WORLD 139 everything, He exists by Himself—all-sufficient unto Himself. No doubt it is easy for Him to get along with Himself; He has no one with whom He can disagree. But at the same time, one part of God is not secluded at all: He is collectively active in the flowers and in the birds and fishes and in all forms of life on this planet—in the millions of human beings and in every creature—and He is very busy in the electromagnetic laws of the universe, and in the copious laws He has set forth to govern the sphere of manifestation. So in this sense He is not individualistic; and He has to get along with the diversity in His creation—this vast variety in which He Himself is contradicting Himself. He is the Uncreated and the Created, the Brahma of which the Hindu sings. In the ultimate perception, there is no difference at all amongst God's diverse creations; though there seems to be con- trary dissimilarity, as between man and beast and tiger and its prey, still God is able to get along with all experiences in the material, delusive panorama of this world. He is harmony in eclectic activity as well as harmony within Himself as an in- dividual. He wants us, similarly, to learn to get along with our own self and with others. Importance of Getting Along With Yourself To be able to get along with yourself is marvelous. Most people know how difficult it is to get along with others. But have you ever given thought to getting along with yourself? That is most difficult. Separate your psychological percep- tions from yourself and you will see how you are constantly fighting with yourself. You do not like anyone or anything if you do not like yourself. If one does not get along with him- self, how could he be expected to get along with others? Get- ting along with self is the most important point in getting along in this world. So first and foremost you must learn truly to appreciate and love yourself. But when I say love yourself, I do not mean love for your egotism, selfishness, and self-interest. (It is instinct, of course, in man to save himself in the face of danger; self-preservation is the law of life.) Love yourself because you are a child of God with divine potentials,- it is your love and concern for this potential self that inspires and inspirits"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"140 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION unfoldment of your true soul-nature. You cannot get away from yourself, even if you fly away from civilization to the farthest corner of the earth. That is why God wants you to correct yourself where you are. Some people live in the worst circumstances and are wonderful in their ability to get along with themselves. Others have every opportunity in the world, but they cannot get along with them- selves; they are constantly at war within. You must not wait for your circumstances to change. If you wait for that, you will never make any progress. Say to yourself, \"I am all right in spite of my environment. If I want to meditate, I will find a way to meditate in spite of my sur- roundings. If I want to study to improve my mind, I will do so regardless of outer conditions.\" I knew a remarkable man in India who was versed in eighteen languages; yet he was so poor that he couldn't even afford a lamp to read by. So he used to go to the street corner and read under the streetlight. \"Where there is a will, there is a way.\" There is no excuse that you can- not correct yourself despite any outer conditions. You are the only one who knows whether you can get along with yourself, for you hide yourself very cleverly from others. That is why it is up to you to strive every day to find out whether you are at peace with yourself. Master [Swami Sri Yukteswar] used to say, \"Learn to be- have.\" In that lies great inner peace and happiness. When you learn to get along with yourself, you will know how to get along with everybody. That is what I learned. That is what Jesus demonstrated: He could say, \"Father, forgive them,\" for he had found that peace within himself. Your Conscience Will Help You Get Along With Yourself There are several practices that are necessary in order to know how to get along with yourself. One: Anyone who is ex- tremely emotional or is restless with bad habits can never get along with himself. If your conscience tells you all the time that you are doing wrong, how on earth can you expect to get along with yourself? And when you meet others you will find that they will not extend their trust and their goodwill toward you, because a person who goes against his conscience mis-"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"THE ART OF GETTING ALONG IN THIS WORLD 141 trusts himself and that reflects in his character. Man's con- science speaks to him all the time and is constantly prodding him to change and to behave rightly. It is true, of course, that you can blunt your conscience. But it will not remain blunt forever. If nothing else, the laws of one's country will disturb the complacency of those whose conscience becomes com- pletely dulled through misuse of free will. Criminals find out that their conscienceless acts did not pay. So always listen to your conscience, the voice of your in- ner self; it is there to help you get along with yourself. Evenmindedness: The Right Foundation for One's Existence Secondly, evenness of mind must be practiced. No matter what experiences you face in life, do so with an even mind. Evenness of mind, evenness of disposition, brings great happi- ness, not only to yourself but to others. That does not mean you should be spineless or without enthusiasm; it means you should practice calmness. It is all right to enjoy the good things of this world, but do not become overexcited by them. And when sorrows come, accept them manfully,- and think how to overcome them instead of permitting yourself to become dis- tressed and restless, losing your calmness within. Some peo- ple are always restless; only a few are most of the time calm and evenminded regardless of circumstances. But evenness must remain constant that it may serve as a foundation of your existence. That is what Swami Shankara* taught: \"Be thou al- ways of even mind if thou dost want the evenminded Lord to adorn the altar of your soul.\" Without that evenmindedness one can never find God. Just stop and think how well Jesus Christ got along with himself. That is how he could get along so well with the diver- sity in the multitudes. He behaved toward everyone and under all circumstances with the same evenness of mind, even dur- ing his greatest trial of crucifixion. \"The relativities of existence (birth and death, pleasure and pain) have been overcome, even here in this world, by those of fixed equal-mindedness.

When we understand them, we will know how similarly to pattern our lives. Deep Thinking: A Corridor to God and Intuitive Perception The next point in getting along with yourself is control of your thoughts. Learn to practice deep thinking. Learn the art of concentration so that when you put your mind on a partic- ular thought your attention does not become restless, hopping from one idea to another. Most people live on the surface of life. But it is by deep-sea diving in the ocean of thought that you receive the pearls of knowledge. Deep thinkers are happy people because they can get away mentally from the distur- bances of their environment. The average person has no escape. He is always living on the surface like the fish that is easily caught by the fisherman. By practice, cultivate the habit of deep thinking. Take a dif- ficult problem and ponder it. Go as deep into thought about that subject as you can. If you go deep enough, a solution will be forthcoming. And in that inner depth, a sense of peace will come over your soul. Why? Because in every deep-thinking state is a corridor to the kingdom of God. Without deep think- ing, concentration of the mind, one will never find the way to God. Even profound thinkers who do not know God are never- theless happy within themselves because they have made a deep inroad into intuitive perception and to God without con- sciously doing so. Those who are capable of thinking very deeply about different subjects, yet do not consciously connect with God, may fail in divine perception because they became hidebound in their thought. No one can find God without con- sciously seeking Him. But deep thinkers are at least nearer to God than those who live superficially in ignorance. There is no sin greater than ignorance. That is why I say, do not pass your time in idleness. Do something useful in life, something worth- while, constructive, that will deepen and broaden your con- sciousness; and you will be nearer to God. * Bhagavad Gita V:19."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"THE ART OF GETTING ALONG IN THIS WORLD 143 Those who think deeply get along better with themselves and with others; because of their ability to explore the depths of thought, they know how to act when confronted with a dif- ficult circumstance. Deep thinking is a mental preparedness by which you can surmount circumstances in a divine way. Common Sense Puts Deep Thinking Into Action Along with deep thinking, you have to develop common sense—that is, sense that is common to all, an intuitive sense. \"Well, my husband was very sick, so I began to think very deeply about it. And by the time I had concluded my deep thinking and decided to call the doctor, my husband had passed on.\" That kind of thinking is not helpful! One must use common sense. It is essential that you know how to put your deep think- ing into action. And no one can teach you common sense. It is an intuitive feeling that readily tells you what to do. Common sense is present in every soul, but very few people know how to develop their ability to tap that source of discrimination. You need to cultivate that power by which you can find out the right course of action in any given situation. Control Desires and the Habit of Wasting Time Lastly, in order to get along with yourself, you must con- trol desires. So-called merriment means burning all candles at once. No one has to chastise such people; they punish them- selves by their overindulgences, which create nervousness and anger and moods. They have no joy in anything because they are controlled by their insatiable senses. The true master is one who controls his senses. When he says no to temptations, he means no. And when he says yes to right action, he means yes. Never kill time. It is too valuable to waste on useless things. I never learned to play cards or checkers or any such thing because I saw they are just a means of killing time. Life is too precious to squander. God-consciousness has to be cul- tivated. Always be busy with God, then nothing and nobody will be able to distract you. How wonderful it is to lead a sim- ple life—a life of inner contentment is a heaven you know not. Even if I go to the movies once in a while to get away from organizational demands, I am not entranced with the scenes on"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"144 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION the screen, but rather with God-consciousness. I am not see- ing the movies, but the cosmic movies within. The consummate purpose of life is to find God. So do not waste your time in uselessness. Getting Along With Others Begins at Home While learning to get along with yourself, you should also practice the art of getting along with others—a great but diffi- cult art. Begin in your own home with the persons with whom you live. There is a saying: a street angel and a house devil. If you learn to get along with those in your own home, you will be bet- ter equipped to get along with the rest of the world. You need to correct your own behavior and attitude. If you instead try to es- cape from those who rile you, your temper and passions will nevertheless cling to you; wherever you go, you will continue to have difficulties. Why not cure your difficulties here and now? First of all, whenever you have problems with others look to yourself; blame yourself if that is where the fault lies. Do deep thinking and see if your behavior is right; see if you de- serve the criticism of others. And remember, example speaks louder than words. If you want to change someone else, change yourself first. If you want to teach someone else to get along with others, set the example. Getting along with human beings means getting along with God, provided those human beings are not behaving unjustly toward you. Jesus was unjustly per- secuted. But if persons justly criticize you, that means you have yet to make greater effort to correct yourself. Do Not Sacrifice Your Ideals to Please Others Getting along with people does not mean agreeing with everybody,- and it does not mean that you should sacrifice your ideals for their sake. That is not the kind of getting along that I mean. But you can maintain your ideals without being offen- sive. In fact, from that standpoint, Jesus Christ did not get along with many during his time. But he maintained his ideals with- out being repugnant. He certainly got along with himself, for he knew that what he was doing was right. And he said, \"To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"THE ART OF GETTING ALONG IN THIS WORLD 145 should bear witness unto the truth.\"* So above everything else, please God and live up to your own ideals; never compromise your ideals, and never harbor an ulterior motive. If you can live loving God and meaning no harm to anyone, and still the world wants to hurt you, that is all right. It is better to be cursed by the whole world and be a fa- vorite child of God than to be loved by all and forsaken by God. Getting along with others means getting along first with your conscience and with God, and then with people. That realization is one of the great blessings I received from my Master. There is nothing in the world that measures up to the joy that I received from his company. When you have the secu- rity of true joy, you have everything. You do not need the world. During my earliest years in this country, I was once invited as a guest of honor to a large party. I didn't know what an \"elite cocktail party\" was, so I didn't know what I was getting into. But I never before, or after, attended such a gathering. Everyone was drinking heavily. Late into the evening, they asked me to speak; so I gave them a talk that I think they never forgot. I did not speak in anger, but in truth: \"Is this your natural way of life? Are you really happy embalming yourself in drink? This is not fun, getting dead drunk and talking in an evil way. What is this?\" I know many of those present made an inner promise never to go to such parties again. I was not mad, for I kept myself inwardly aloof. In that way, I can get along fine with others. I do not have to follow their ways; rather I would try in a kind way to influ- ence them to follow my ways. With God in your breast, joy in your heart, wisdom in your mind, and all the power of heaven in your soul, you are in the joy of the Eternal Father. That is the power which I see and feel all the time. Behave in a truthful way that is not hurtful to others. If you cannot get along with others because of your ideals, then it is best to get away from those naysayers. If your goodness be- comes a torture to others, stay away from them. You should not feel you have to beat others over the head with a club to make them follow. If they do not want to follow you, let them go their way. But always be willing to share your understand- * John 18:37 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"146 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION ing with those who are seeking and who are thirsty for the nec- tar of the soul. Make them happy. Smile From the Soul Develop the habit of being pleasant. I do not mean that you should smile always like a Cheshire cat. Such a smile means nothing; it is shallow. But a smile that registers deep in the heart and expresses itself in the face is marvelous. It comes from be- ing sincere. Sometimes those who are much in the public smile in a lifeless, practiced way, while inside they are thinking of something else. There is nothing inside to make their smile real. But the smile that reflects from the soul is very attractive; few people can resist an individual with such a sincere smile. There are some persons who are chronic sourpusses. And many are hard-boiled, rigid in their reactions toward others. How to get along with such persons? First, make sure that no matter what the provocation nobody will be able to get you mad. That is one of the primary steps in learning how to get along with others. No matter what happens, let no one get your goat. It is difficult for those who have no self-control, but it is the easiest thing to do if you make up your mind. Do not boast that you never get angry, just practice it to the best of your ability. If you proclaim it, people have a tendency to take ad- vantage of you. And do not be outwardly docile while seething dangerously inside. Under no circumstances let anyone make you angry enough to do something that you will rue later on. Most people who lose their temper regret afterward what they have done. Affirm with conviction: \"I have perfect possession of my emotions.\" Persons who do not have their emotions un- der control are their own worst enemies. Every unfulfilled de- sire rouses their ire. When anyone can make you mad, it is be- cause some desire within you has been contradicted. Otherwise, no one could make you angry. There Is a Time to Remain Quiet but Firm In your efforts to get along with others, do not be a door- mat or everyone will want to run your life for you. If they cannot dominate you, they get angry; and if you listen to them and do their bidding, you become spineless. Then how"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"THE ART OF GETTING ALONG IN THIS WORLD 147 are you to behave? When you find resistance to your ideals, the best way is to just remain quiet but firm. Say nothing. Do not get angry. Verbal punch after punch you may get, but do not permit it to provoke you. Refuse to quarrel. Eventually those persons will understand that you do not mean to anger them, but at the same time you have your own good reasons for not wanting to do what they request of you. When people lose their tempers, get away from them un- til they are calmer. If you can get together and talk out your problems, it is wonderful. Communication is vital. But if any- one just wants to fight, simply say, \"I am going to take a little walk.\" Then return and be prepared to discuss. But if the per- son still wants to fight, go out again and take a longer walk. Refuse to fight. No one can quarrel with you if you noncoop- erate. Never supply more fuel to anyone's anger. The angry per- son is satisfied only if he can make you angry too. I can work with anyone, though I don't care to be with those who don't know how to live in harmony. When some- one has made up his mind to win a point, let him have the victory—it is a hollow victory. Don't argue. Great men sel- dom argue; they smile and say, \"I don't think so,\" but they don't fight. Use Tact; Persons Are Not Unfeeling Stones Learn to use tact with people. That does not mean you should be a hypocrite; it means consideration of others. You are not a stone; you are a thinking, conscious being, and you do not want to treat others as though they were unfeeling stones. Do not openly resist the desires of others. The person who always busies himself with the affairs of others is both a cause and an object of difficulties. If a person can take it, and if it will do some good, then speak out. But sometimes the recipient does not like it and will defiantly do exactly what you don't want him to do. When you can get along with others, you are like a fragrant flower. As you pass by a garden, sometimes you smell the fra- grance of roses or orange blossoms and you think, \"Oh, how sweet they are.\" That is how great souls are. When you come into their company, the perfume of their lives touches you; it is a fragrance that uplifts your soul. But when you are around a foul"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"148 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION odor, you do not like to remain there. When someone has a malodorous temperament of anger and quarrelsomeness, you don't want to be around that person. Those who are always in- harmonious are of that type. They are like human skunks ex- uding an obnoxious odor. In a religious organization, two classes of people are clearly distinguishable—those who are trying to change themselves for the better, and those who are quarrelsome and start trouble by trying to change everybody but themselves. The latter seem to take pleasure in trying to make others uncomfortable. I remember in the early days in Boston we were planning a banquet. Two middle-aged ladies were real crackerjacks in gossiping. Unsuspectingly, I had given them charge of the ban- quet. But someone said to me, \"Beware of these two. They have caused much trouble for other teachers.\" That put me on guard to watch their behavior. As banquet arrangements proceeded, my secretary put place cards on the head table des- ignating certain persons to sit there. These two ladies started fireworks: \"Why should these persons be on the platform and not us?\" To restore peace, these guests were seated down at the other tables. One day, these two ladies started disrupting organizational plans of the center. Their intention was to be the leaders of the work in Boston. So I called them aside: \"Do you accept me as your spiritual teacher?\" They said, \"Yes.\" I said, \"Will you lis- ten to me?\" They said, \"Absolutely.\" They thought I was go- ing to place them in positions of importance. After a little while I saw them separately, and I told each of them what I described as a secret and asked them to promise they would not divulge that information. They agreed. After a few days each one had \"secretly\" told many others what I had told her. When they re- alized what was happening, a feud broke out between the two of them. I then distanced myself from them. But they sought me out. I was in the Boston Plaza Hotel. They called me on the phone and wanted to see and talk with me. I said, \"I will see you provided you speak very calmly,- the minute you raise your voices, I will leave.\" When I came down to the lobby, they were trying hard to control themselves. They said, \"What is the idea of telling the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"THE ART OF GETTING ALONG IN THIS WORLD 149 'secret' to each of us?\" I answered, \"To show you that you cannot be trusted; that you are disloyal, and that you love to fight and to gossip. By this means I have convinced you about your wrong behavior. I told you something that was of no im- portance, just to see if you were capable of keeping a confi- dence or if you would give in to your habit of stirring up trou- ble with your gossiping. The fault did not lie in the teachers who have come to this town and whom you have criticized so freely. The fault is in your own natures. I asked one thing of you and you could not keep your word. Do you realize how your reputation makes you disliked in this city? Now the trou- ble you give to others has come back to hurt only you. If you cannot keep one promise of confidence given to your spiritual teacher, how can you expect others to have confidence in you? If you don't keep faith with me, you won't keep faith with any- body else. Are you truly at peace and happy within your own souls?\" I was sincere with them, but I gave them that day a very honest and earnest appraisal of their behavior. After doing so, I said, \"Now, I am not going to shut you out of my classes. But you must promise me that you will not talk against anyone dur- ing the class series. Do not think of yourselves as teachers. As long as there is prideful desire to teach, you are not qualified to teach. First you yourself must live it. If you do that, others will follow your example.\" And do you know that hour after hour they attended the classes and didn't once disturb anyone. They were the meekest of students. You see, I got along with them all right because I did not get angry. I used tact to bring them to the sudden realization of their mental weaknesses. But getting along with others cannot be done only by tact. It also requires example, calmness, evenness of mind, sincerity, joy, doing everything in an honorable way ; not clinging to pride and egotism; and not governing your actions by what every- body else does, but doing those things that please God. Find your peace by meditating regularly and deeply, and you will be sur- prised to see how your relationships with others improve. Also develop your power of usefulness. That is love. Think about that. Learn to be serviceful to others—useful with posi- tive thoughts; useful with your speech; useful with construc-"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"150 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION tive suggestions. But do not give advice where it is not wanted; if your suggestions are unwelcome, have the control to remain silent. And when sometimes you do good to others and then can no longer help them in a material way, if they become inimical because they continue to expect from you, never mind; go on doing what is right. Do the best you can and forget it. Be Sincere; Never Resort to Flattery Be sincere with everyone. You can get along with most people if you flatter them. But that destroys the character of both the giver and the receiver. Praise is not harmful if it is sin- cerely meant. Everyone likes encouragement and to be praised for one's good qualities and actions, if that recognition is sin- cere. But when someone gives flattery in order to get some- thing in return, that is wrong. If my love is not sufficient, I shall not bribe anybody with flattery. There was once a wealthy student from Milwaukee, a Mr. R , who came to stay at Mt. Washington. This was during a difficult early period when we had very little money to sup- port the work. He came to learn, but soon developed the habit of trying to teach everybody else instead. I called him to my study and said, \"I prohibit you from giving any more money to the organization. I gave you my love, but you want flattery from me. You came here to learn, but now you want to teach us.\" He became angry. I said, \"Don't think you have fooled me because I have remained quiet. All you need is a good dose of flattery and then you think you are all right. But I will not give you flattery.\" Tears came in his eyes and he said, \"But everything here will go to pieces. The magazine* will be stopped and Mount Washington will not last unless you take money from me.\" I replied, \"What of it?\" He was angry for a long time, predicting that everything would fall apart without him. But I said, \"Maybe not.\" Then I cautioned him, \"Beware, you are making dire pre- dictions; but I say unto you that if you go on in this way all your money will be taken away from you.\" He left Mount Wash- ington and later joined another society; they flattered him and * Yogoda Satsanga annual-series booklets (see glossary)."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"THE ART OF GETTING ALONG IN THIS WORLD 151 gave him an important position, and then divested him of all his money. He had to go back to where he started. What would we have been if we had accepted money from that man? I would have had to close my eyes to his evil ways—and this I could never have done. Right after that experience, one of the greatest friends and devotees came into the organization. That was St. Lynn. * I have seen great things in my life. Everything that you give up for God, He knows. What is it if by flattery you gain friends and followers if God is not there? You are forsaken by the world for insincerity and forsaken by God as well, going at death into the depths of the astral world without any assurance from your conscience nor from God nor from man. Relationships that are based on an exchange of sincerity and respect are wonderful. Do not sully friendship by becoming too familiar with anyone,- familiarity breeds contempt. No one has been able to be overfamiliar with me. Disrespect and taking someone for granted severely jeopardize a relationship. Whenever you mix with people, mix respectfully with love and sincerity. When you feel like being alone, get away from people; be by yourself. Do not keep company with people unless you are prepared to give them your full attention. In that regard, when I am with others I mix with concentration, with attention, with love. But when I am alone, I am alone with my God. Do not make a habit of associating with people uselessly. When it is worthwhile, it is all right. I like to be with people in worth- while activities and uplifting exchanges of friendship, but not in anything that is a source of inharmony. Keep your distance from whatever or whoever creates inharmony. Come for Truth That Flows From My Soul I wish these truths were taught in childhood. They should be dinned into the ears of your children. Lessons learned early * Mr. James J. Lynn, later known as Rajarsi Janakananda (see glossary).

In my own childhood, one day I made up my mind that I would never get angry; and I have never broken that vow. Sometimes I have talked sharply, but inwardly I am never angry with anyone. I don't like to speak forcefully, but I do it sometimes because an individual may better remember what is said to him with firmness. I have great peace within myself. If you are a man of peace, no one can steal that tranquility from you unless you yourself carelessly re- linquish it. From that inner center of peace, I teach with the principle of love and kindness; it is the better way. If that is mis- understood by anyone, I leave that person alone; I remain silent. You come here for pure truth that flows from my soul. And if even one person receives this truth and is changed, I shall have done more good than if thousands came rocking with emotion. I seek nothing of you but your joy in God. And you seek nothing from me but God's wisdom and joy. A spiritual man will get along with everybody—even if they may not always get along with him—because he will understand and sympa- thize and try to bring them to God. Jesus said: \"Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.\"* Prepare yourselves now to be instruments of truth. I used to tell the students in my school in India that they must not only speak truth and expect forgiveness, but that they must speak truth and willingly accept any unpleasant con- sequences.

I al- ways told him my foremost craving was to get along with God. Every day you should ask yourself, \"Have I gotten along with God?\" Do you know what are the signs that you have not gotten along with God? They are restlessness, unhappiness, and an uneasy conscience. But if you are getting along with God, your conscience is at rest; and you are drunk with inner happiness and contentment all the time. I have no other de- sire but to be in that happiness and to give those living waters of joy to whoever comes to me. The more you get along with God, the more you will be able to get along with the world. The world may forsake you for a little while, but it will come back to you. And when you are gone from this earth, those who had turned away will say, \"He has left footprints, following which we too will reach our home of eternal contentment.\" So strive always to keep your thoughts tuned to the Ab- solute. There is no happiness in any pursuit like the happi- ness you find in seeking God. Surround yourself with good thoughts, that those thoughts may help you to be closer to God. This truth has come here to last forever, because it has been transplanted into some great souls. What we build in the souls of men is eternal. It is to your advantage to follow this truth, for you will see in it such freedom that no tongue can describe.

An analysis of the psychology of touchiness shows that it is the result of misunderstanding, inferiority complex, and an ungoverned ego. Sensitiveness expresses itself in a lack of control over the nervous system. A thought of being offended runs through the mind and the nerves rebel against it. In react- ing, some persons seethe inwardly with anger or hurt feelings and show no irritation outwardly. Others express their emo- tions in an obvious and instant reaction in the muscles of their eyes and face—and often in a sharp retort of their tongue as well. In either case, to be touchy is to make oneself miserable, and to create a negative vibration that also adversely affects oth- ers. To be able always to spread an aura of goodness and peace should be the motive of life. Even if there is good reason for be- ing excited because of mistreatment, one who instead controls himself in such a situation is master of himself. It is a common trait of human beings to be touchy. And when this irrational emotion comes, it blinds the eyes of wis- dom. Even though the touchy person may be in the wrong, he perceives himself as thinking rightly, acting rightly, feeling rightly. It is when the scales of ignorance fall away from the in- ner sight that one is able to measure exactly the good points and the weak points of oneself and others without the preju- dice and intolerance of the emotional ego. One then worships only what is good, and remains transcendentally indifferent to what is psychologically unwholesome. Many persons think that they should pity themselves when criticized, and that sensitiveness brings a little relief. But such people are like the opium addict; every time he takes the drug"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"156 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION he becomes more steeped in the habit. Be as firm as steel against sensitiveness. Never be touchy or harbor self-pity. An oversensitive person frequently suffers in vain: gener- ally nobody has any idea that he has a grievance, much less what it is. So he feels further hurt in his self-created isolation. Nothing is accomplished by silently brooding over some per- ceived offense. It is best to remove by self-mastery the cause that produces such sensitiveness. In my youth I was very sensitive; and consequently the one who suffered most was myself—it was a process of self-torture. Because I was so sensitive, others seemed to delight in \"getting my goat.\" Your \"goat\" is your peace,- let nobody take away your peace. My discomfiture was not wholly the fault of the taunt- ing of others; it was also the result of my own sensitiveness to their remarks. I found that the more I argued with people who criticized me, the more satisfaction they got. At last, I made up my mind that no one would be able to destroy my peace. I de- cided, \"Let them criticize all they want to.\" I remained indiffer- ent to their unjust barbs, as untouched as if I were dead. They soon lost their enthusiasm to pick on me ; and many became my friends and followed me. It is futile to demand kindness and respect from others,- you must rather learn to merit it. If you are sincerely kind and respectful to others, and return any courtesy they show to you, you will always be treated respectfully. And do not paralyze the goodwill of others by being touchy when they offer constructive criticism. Cooperate whenever anybody tries to help you. My master, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, was very strict with me. He watched every nuance of my thoughts and freely corrected me. He was harsh at times, but it was always for my highest good. Many did not survive his sharp discipline; but I did, and words cannot thank him enough for undertaking the task of molding my life with his wisdom. Persons with well developed spirituality can clearly see the faults in others. When a clear- sighted well-wisher tries sincerely to help you, that person should not be looked upon as one who wants to exercise lord- ship over you, but rather as one who is trying to give you un- derstanding and strength to see and conquer your weaknesses. You should cooperate. Be courteous and kind; and if you start to"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TOUCHINESS 157 sink into the mood of touchiness, immediately control your- self. Intelligent people, those who possess true understanding, al- ways leave nonunderstanding persons alone. They do not want to waste their time and effort in dissembling with those who have no ears or willingness to hear. Within my inner heart, I never let myself become touchy. I am at peace with myself. It is when you are not at peace with yourself that you become touchy. This is to be small. To be great is to be big-hearted no matter how others hurt you. That is the way to live. Do not wait until tomorrow; begin today. One should be able to control his moods instantly. To let the fire of sensitiveness eat into one's heart, and to keep it smoldering there, will burn away the fibers of inner peace. A wise person controls his sensitivity, knowing that it is noth- ing but an agency of metaphysical Satan* trying to destroy the soul's peace. When anything distresses you, no matter how you justify your unhappiness, know that you are succumbing to undue sen- sitivity, and that you must not indulge in it. Sensitiveness is an unspiritual habit, a nervous habit, a peace-destroying habit that takes away your control over yourself and robs you of your happiness. Whenever a mood of sensitiveness visits the heart, its static prevents you from hearing the divine song of healing peace that plays within through the radio of the soul. Whenever sensitiveness appears, try immediately to conquer that emotion. There is a difference between emotional sensitiveness and spiritual sensitivity. Those who are spiritually sensitive are discriminatingly watchful of their own feelings and are keenly perceptive of the feelings of others, but they remain aloof from the disturbances of psychological impulses—just as butter can float in water and remain unchanged, undiluted, by its sur- roundings. But touchy sensitiveness is like a ghost that haunts you. It tortures your nervous system and makes you feel that the whole world is full of enemies. The person of extreme sen- sitivity often foolishly blames others for the hurt he feels; he should try to understand that his hurt is self-inflicted.

Nobody should catch you in a touchy mood. Quietly cor- rect yourself. If necessary, hide yourself in a room away from others until the fever of sensitiveness is gone. The face is the reflector of your inner self; the heart, the source of feelings, is the basis of that reflection. Your face should be an inspiring ser- mon. Your countenance should be a beacon for others to fol- low, a lighthouse by which shipwrecked souls can find the way to safety in the harbor of peace. Your face should be an altar where peace reigns, where God reigns—where all the votaries of psychological goodness as- semble to invoke the almighty God of peace and love: \"Heav- enly Father, bless us that we establish the temple of purity in ourselves—within our hearts, our thoughts, our feelings—that our countenance may be an illuminated altar of Thy peace and love.\""},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Why Love Succeeds Where Jealousy Fails First Self-Realization Fellowship Temple at Encinitas, California, April 10, 1938 Jealousy, anger, fear, all the negative physical and mental impulses that impel human beings to do wrong—where do they come from? Many say these are of psychological origin. But I say they come from the Evil Force. There are two forces in this world—good and evil. Wherever there is good, there is also evil. Man, endowed with independence and free will, suffers the consequences of his wrong actions, but he is not the cre- ator of the agents that influenced those errors. Plants commit no evil, and yet they succumb to diseases. The animals, which are governed by instinct with no consciousness of evil, similarly suffer. Side by side with every good there is a corresponding evil. God creates the sunshine and the Evil Force creates destructive storms and droughts. The beautiful flower blooms and is de- stroyed by insects. God says to love,- the Evil Force says be jeal- ous, you are justified to hurt and enfeeble an opponent. Don't listen to that dark power. It isn't you. Jealousy, anger, fear, are creations of the Evil Force. Recognizing this force as a conscious power, Jesus said, \"Get thee behind me, Satan.\"* Any time the voice of jealousy, fear, or anger speaks, re- member that it is not your voice, and command that it be gone. But you will not be able to expel that evil, no matter how you try, so long as you give that negative feeling a safe harbor in your mind. Eradicate jealousy, fear, and anger from within, so that every time an evil impulse tells you to hate and to hurt, another stronger voice within tells you to love and to forgive. Listen to that voice. * Luke 4:8 (Bible). 159"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"160 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION Just imagine, if we could take away from the world self- ishness, jealousy, and anger, there would be no wars. But these destructive perpetrators are tenacious, and constantly fight with goodness for supremacy. God speaks of peace and the Evil Force urges restlessness and discord. God is trying to coax you into actions of love,- the Evil Force is trying to lure you to fight. You are a free agent; you can choose as you please. Whenever you are jealous, you are in collusion with the cos- mic delusion of Satan. Whenever you are angry, Satan is guid- ing you. The voice of fear is his evil voice. But whenever you are filled with love and forgiveness, God is with you. Help Him to work through you,- He cannot do so unless you help Him. All Relationships Should Be Grounded in Friendship The followers of Satan have but one reward: misery. The fol- lowers of God have blissful peace. \"He finds peace who knows Me... as the Infinite Lord of Creation, and as the Good Friend of all creatures.\"* Heed the voice of Love within. Live love,- prac- tice it within and without; wherever you go, give love and un- derstanding. Become like a flower whose fragrance overpowers the noxious vapors of jealousy, fear, and anger. Spread the fra- grance of divine love and friendship to all with whom you come in contact. Those who refine their spiritual sensitiveness will feel the awakening of universal Christ Consciousness [ Kutastha Chai- tanya] in their expanding love.

When souls seek progress together in God, then divine friendship flow- ers. If the qualities of the heart are spiritualized and perfected with sincere friends, and that circle of love is expanded until it is all-inclusive, then one finds the Friend of all friends, the Di- vine Friend, behind all relationships. Jealousy Foreshadows the End of Happiness Whereas the love of God unites, the negative impulses of the Evil Force divide and destroy. Great havoc is wrought by jealousy and its cohorts of fear, anger, and hatred. Human re- lationships are devastated, homes are broken up, lives are de- stroyed. Jealousy foreshadows the end of happiness, first in the one who harbors it, and then in others who are objects of its vengeance—even innocent bystanders, such as the children of broken homes. Jealousy exists everywhere,- it is an ever present danger to all human relationships. I have so many times seen it at work in this world. Everybody wants the \"good position,\" but few want to make the effort to merit it or to assume the inherent responsibility. The divisive nature of jealousy transforms a heaven of harmony into a hades of discord. One jealous per- son can generate so much trouble! When possible, try to avoid giving anyone cause for jealousy. Go out of your way, if neces- sary, to create understanding. Jealousy Comes From an Inferiority Complex Jealousy comes from an inferiority complex, and expresses itself through suspicion and fear. It signifies that a person is afraid he cannot hold his own in his relationships with others, be they conjugal, filial, social. If you feel you have cause to be jealous of someone—for example, if you are afraid that the one you love is transferring his or her attention to another—first strive to understand if there is something lacking within your- self. Improve yourself; develop yourself. The only way to hold on to the affection or respect of another is to apply the law of love and to merit that recognition by self-improvement. Love and its counterparts can never be acquired or pre- served by demands or begging or bribes. I have observed how"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"162 J OURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION some people behave around those who are wealthy or influen- tial. I once said to a prince in India, \"Do you think these peo- ple who court your favor really love you?\" He replied, \"Yes.\" But I had seen them in a different light, and I cautioned him, \"Stop giving them money and gifts and you will find that they are not sincere. They mock you with their flattery.\" True love cannot be bought. To receive love, one must give it freely, without any condition. But instead of following this rule, the insecure person resorts to jealousy. This makes the loved one angry, and thus defeats its very purpose. Jealousy then responds to the anger with a desire to strike back. But any- time one wants thus to harm another, he ultimately hurts him- self even more. Evil acts have their source in evil thoughts; these caustic mental parasites eat away the very fiber of one's being. They burn and destroy inner peace—one's greatest wealth. \"Whatever Is Not Mine, Let It Go!\" Why be jealous? If you give someone your love and it is not appreciated, if that person does not want you, or gives to an- other the recognition you think you deserve, jealousy certainly will not hold that person or cure the strain in the relationship. Making prisoners of one another with jealousy and demands will certainly not produce happiness. Successful relationships can grow only in trust and love. Love survives in respect, use- fulness, and freedom from possessiveness. So what is the remedy? Any time jealousy tries to bind you, make strong affirmations: \"I am free from the bondage of jealousy and fear. Whatever is mine will be mine,- whatever is not mine, let it go!\" When you will be free from all jealousy and fear, your life will be wonderful. You can be free. What is yours will be yours, and what is not meant for you would not make you happy. Fulfillment lies in constantly improving your- self so that instead of your seeking others, others will seek you. Give love and friendship without expecting or demanding any- thing in return. Expectation will make you a victim of misery. Even while striving to improve yourself, learn to stand alone, secure in your own virtues and self-worth. If you want others to believe in you, remember, it isn't only your words that have an effect, but what you are and what you feel within—"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"WHY LOVE SUCCEEDS WHERE JEALOUSY FAILS 163 what is in your soul. Always strive to be an angel within, no matter how others behave. Be sincere, kind, loving, and under- standing. Anyone who does not respond to goodness is not worthy of your attention. Even if you have to lose a loved one, it is better to let him go thinking of you as an angel rather than as a green-eyed monster of jealousy. Leave with that person a beautiful thought of your love, and that love will ever remain in his heart. Thoughts Can Be More Effective Than Words Never speak harshly under the fire of jealousy. The mouth can be like a cannon, and speech more damaging than any ex- ploding shell. Be discriminate in your use of words. People do not like to be told their faults. If guidance or constructive crit- icism isn't welcome, withhold your words. Otherwise, the more you say, the worse you may make the situation. Thoughts can sometimes be more effective than words. The human mind is the most powerful broadcasting machine there is. If you constantly broadcast positive thoughts with love, those thoughts will have an effect on others. (Similarly, if you broadcast jealousy or hatred, others receive those thoughts and respond accordingly.) Ask God to put His power behind your efforts. If, for instance, it is the husband that is going astray, the wife should pray to God: \"Lord, help me to help my husband. Keep all taint of jealousy and resentment out of my heart. I only pray that he realize his error and change. Lord, be with him,- and bless me that I do my part.\" If your communion with God is deep, you will see that person change. The more er- rant a person is, the greater kindness you should give. Instead of succumbing to jealousy and fear of losing a loved one, strive for right attitude and behavior, keep yourself physically attrac- tive, and be strong mentally and spiritually. God Is the Ultimate Answer Never forget that God is the answer to all the questions life places before your soul. God is love, and love is the panacea for human suffering. There is nothing greater than love— God's quality of attraction and unity that is manifested in the soul of every being. This love, when expressed under all cir-"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"164 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION cumstances—in family, social, and national life—expands to embrace the whole world. Such universal love is the pure love of God. When you have achieved that love, then and then alone are you a citizen of the kingdom of God. Always be proud that you are a child of God; for just a little while you have been an alien in the kingdom of matter. Develop God's divine love in- herent in you, and you will reclaim your citizenship in His kingdom of omnipresence. When you learn to go within in meditation, you will find His kingdom. It is within you; God is within you. It is His power that is behind your ability to talk, move, and feel. Without Him you can do nothing. Though He is transcendent, beyond all things, He is also immanent; you can commune with Him right within you. If you remove the dust of restlessness from the mirror of inner silence, you will see Him reflected there. Never miss your daily engagement with God in medita- tion. Those who are wise make it their business to contact Him. If you are sincere, you shall know God in this life,- and to know Him is to be free. Diamond Mentalities Reflect the Light of God You know in your heart that you are not happy with the present state of your life. There is only one direct route to happiness, and that is to contact God. \"Naught shelters thee, who wilt not shelter Me.\"* God is the one who will never for- sake you. The way to find Him is to follow someone who knows Him. Attune yourself with the great ones who com- mune with Him; only they can show you God.

The Effectiveness of Single-hearted Devotion Most of you here today were born Americans. You do not know what you were before this incarnation or what nation- ality you may be in the next life; but you have always been and always will be the child of God. The time has come to merge our differences and unite in God. Break the ramparts of His si- lence. He remains hidden because He knows most people don't want Him. But if you make up your mind to contact Him, He will respond. If you are determined to find Him, you will know Him. No one can give Him to you, just as no one else can eat your food for you. You must make the effort. Jesus said, \"The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few.\"* * John 1:12 (Bible). t Reference to the Gurus of Yogoda Satsanga Society of India/Self-Realization Fellowship (see glossary), t Matthew 9:37 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"166 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION In the early morning and before going to bed at night, talk to God, again and again, in the language of your heart: \"Reveal Thyself, reveal Thyself.

Then during the day's activities, keep the thought of Him in the depths of your consciousness. You know how sometimes, no matter what you are doing, there is one thought revolving in your mind like a dynamo—its power generating the desired result. That is the way you should ceaselessly think of God. As Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita: \"I am easily reached by that yogi who is single-hearted, who remembers Me daily, continually, his mind intensely focused only on Me.\"* Very early in my life I learned the effectiveness of that single-heartedness. When I was a small child, I wrote a letter to God and dropped it in the postbox. Every day I waited anx- iously, with tear-filled eyes, for His answer. No reply came through the mail. But I never gave up the thought that He must answer that letter. Then one night, in a great light, I received His response, written in letters of gold, that He will ever pro- tect me and be with me. When you contact God, you will see that in all depart- ments of your life a silent Friend is helping. We love anyone who is useful to us ; therefore we should love God supremely, because He is useful as nobody else is. We love our parents and friends because of what they do for us. But no one can be as useful to us as God, for He can resurrect our souls and free us from all human bondage.

The Christ Spirit was born on earth in the physical vehicle of the infant Jesus; within his conscious- ness was omnipresent God. Behind the nascent brain of the little boy was the wisdom of Spirit. How else could he, as a young child, startle wise and learned men with his precocious words? Even though the spirit of God becomes incarnate in the birth of great souls, still those divine ones play the drama of in- fancy, youth, and all other phases of life and death. But it is to be remembered that behind their mortal consciousness is the immutable Christ Consciousness, the ever pure reflection of Spirit—which the sages in India call Kutastha Chaitanya or Krishna Consciousness. This conception of Jesus very few people have. If you know Christ in reality, you will know how to bring his universal spirit into your own consciousness. The Proper Observance of Christmas What is the significance of celebrating the sacred birth of Christ on a certain day? It is not just to provide an opportu- nity for festivity and gift-giving. It is especially and distinctly to revive in our thoughts the inspiration of his perfect quali- ties. If you hold a portrait before you, the image reminds you of the salient characteristics of that person; so is a day of re- membrance, when properly observed. It is sad when people forget the purpose of Christmas. Mil- lions are thinking only of the material side of this holy season. We shall not be among them. Tomorrow, we are going to have our meditation day. From ten to six o'clock we will be medi- tating on Christ. To feel his presence and his consciousness is our purpose. Christ has remained unknown to men. They have kept the gates of their devotion closed, locked with material desires, so that Christ cannot enter. When those portals are opened with love for Christ, he will come. I want everyone to take the spiritual celebration of Christmas seriously. Our aim is nothing less than to bring Christ into our consciousness. The Justice of God St. John said, \"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"170 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.\"* These sacred words reveal the justice of God. What would be our position and our hope if the Lord made and equipped only one man, Jesus Christ, with the insight and will power necessary to conquer temptation and attain God-union? Jesus was both human and divine, as are we all. If this were not so, then his trials and the pain he endured in crucifixion were just a farce. Rather, he was a perfect type and an ideal model that all God-seekers may fol- low in shouldering their own crosses. How could we be ex- pected to overcome the myriad temptations of maya unless we too are made in the image of God and are as much chosen and loved by Him as was Jesus? The primary difference between Jesus and most other beings is that he conquered the tests that they have yet to go through. He attained the divinity of Christ Con- sciousness by continuous effort and will power to overcome all mortal temptations and attachments. That Jesus was like us gives us courage and the desire to be like him. What an extreme test Jesus faced in surrendering himself to be crucified. Patanjali points out that even great saints feel attachment to the body on the last day, and are loath to leave it. My Guru [Swami Sri Yukteswar] explained that the hesi- tancy to leave the body at death is comparable to the experi- ence of a long-caged bird that fears to soar out of its prison into the skyey vastness. By his words on the Cross, Jesus re- vealed that he had to struggle to destroy the last shred of at- tachment to the body.t He fought his human nature and won ; that is why I see him as an ideal exemplar for all mankind. Millions of persons in this world have a charcoal mental- ity, unable to reflect the divine consciousness that is in their souls. You must become like the diamond, radiant with the sunlight of Christ Consciousness. If even one soul out of this gathering becomes enlightened, that is far better than if I were to speak to audiences of thousands who come just to hear an inspirational discourse. I know that some of you here have 'John 1:12-13 (Bible). t \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? (Matthew 27 A6, Bible)....Fa- ther, into Thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost\" (Luke 23:46, Bible)."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"INVITE THE CHRIST CONSCIOUSNESS WITHIN YOU 171 real communion with Christ. That pleases me most. There is a vast difference between imagination and Self- realization. If you only imagine, you may have subconscious dreams and inner \"visions\" of Christ every day. But that does not mean that you are truly in touch with him. The real visi- tation of Jesus is the communion with Christ Consciousness. If you are in tune with that Christ, your whole life will change. The Universality of Christ Consciousness The love of God uplifts and enlarges us. I can never think of myself anymore as exclusively in this body; I feel that I am present in all bodies. I have no awareness of race or other dis- tinctions at all. In my perceptions, just as I feel my own con- sciousness in every part of my physical form, I feel you all to be a part of me. Everything that is living I feel within this body. I know the sensations of all. It is not imagination; it is Self- realization. This consciousness is far beyond telepathy. It is awareness of the perceptions of every being. That is the mean- ing of Christ Consciousness. When that Christ comes within you, you lose your ego ; the \"I\" is demolished. In humbleness you find a valley of dreams redolent with blossoms of Self-realization, nurtured by the wa- ters of the Infinite Christ that gather and inundate all arid boundaries within you. You feel all things pervaded by One Life. Infinite Oneness: That is what God is ; that is what Christ is. If you would be like Christ, you must follow his ways. God could be cruel and destroy evildoers; in an instant He could destroy the whole world. But instead, He is using love to bring errant creation back to Him. Thus did Jesus teach: \"Love your enemies,\" for God \"maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\"* Bha- gavan Krishna similarly said: \"He is a supreme yogi who re- gards with equal-mindedness...friends, enemies...the virtuous and the ungodly.\"!

Remember, your enemies, too, are children of God, and are loved by Him as dearly as you are. The Lord is like a mother; no matter how a child behaves, the mother loves it just the same. Those who do evil have gone astray, and God wants in- tensely to bring them back to His fold. Another reason you should love your enemies is that transgressors for the most part are ignorant of their erroneous doings, feeling fully justified in their behavior. No thinking person wants to do wrong; most people simply do not realize the error of their ways. They act on impulse, with no clear vi- sion or power of reflection. That is why they \"know not what they do.\"* Such persons actually do great harm to them- selves, and therefore should be objects of our sympathy. It generally requires far more strength and purity of mind to love than to hate. But a sage finds it easier to love than to hate, because he \"beholds his Self (Spirit-united) in all crea- tures and all creatures in the Spirit.\"! He sees all beings as a part of his greater Self, indissolubly bound together by the universal Christ Consciousness. To bring divine awareness into our human consciousness we must outgrow the limited conventional conception of Christ. To me, Christmas is a thought of spiritual grandeur— a realization that our minds are an altar of Christ, the Univer- sal Intelligence in all creation. Who is the devotee that really knows what Christ is? To human vision he is the little babe born in Bethlehem, and the savior who healed the sick and raised the dead. To divine vi- sion he is the Christ-awareness in all space and in every atom. You should aspire to know that Christ within you. Banish every prejudice and love all beings.

How can you hate your own Self dwelling in any form? If you do, it shows that you do not know Christ—the Christ Consciousness that is just behind your human mind and feelings. When you hold a wrong thought about anybody you obliterate Christ from your inner vision Christ is born in the cradle of tenderness. Greater than the destructive force of hate is the compassionate power of love. Whatever you say or do to others, let it be with love. Harm no one. Judge not others. Hate none, love all; behold Christ in all. Whatever blessings you have, desire that all should have. The things you own are not really yours,- they are given for your use temporarily.

Circa 1938 Truth is neither Eastern nor Western—it is the inalien- able property of every soul that draws the breath of life. Like- wise, the true equality of man lies not in the social nor polit- ical nor economic equality that people wrongly imagine will arrive someday, but in the equality of every soul before God, and in their equality to seek Him and to know Him. Without intelligence, it is impossible to understand any- thing properly. Everything should be judged intelligently on its own merits, and not on baseless assertions or secondhand opinions. If one does not make an effort to discover truth be- neath any and all perplexing veils, then one will never even know his own real nature and will remain the sport of outside forces and the slave of circumstance.

It is ultimately the only savior that can rescue man from all the evils of the earth. Is religion per se really necessary for the upliftment of man! When he joins a particular faith or order, does he not rather circumscribe himself and thus create barriers between himself and those of other creeds! Dogmatic religions are bypaths, sometimes blind alleys leading nowhere,- but even so, a fairly good dogmatic religion can lead the sincere seeker to the highway of true religion, which in turn leads to God. That highway is yoga, the scien- tific process by which every soul reunites with Spirit. In the Bhagavad Gita, yoga is proclaimed greater than all other paths —greater than those of devotion, wisdom, and righteous action. Yoga is the science of how man descended from Spirit into flesh and became identified with the body and its senses and possessions,- and how he can reascend to God. The experience, or realization, of truth that comes from yoga practice provides proof of the underlying unity of all religions found in the per- ception of their one common denominator—God. Should religion take the form of an organized entity, such as Buddhism or Christianity, or should it rather be one of individual intuitive faith! Organized religion is the hive,- realization is the honey. Both are necessary. But it often happens that when organized religion concentrates on the outward tenets and ceremonial aspects it be- comes a dogmatic empty hive. At the opposite extreme, some yogis in the Himalayas gather the honey of God-realization in their hearts without providing hives of organized religion through which others might share that divine nectar. That is selfish. If organized religion is backed by great savants, it does much good in the world. If it is promoted only by egotistical, big- oted, or commercial people, it does little good and often much harm to people in general. If faith be intuitive, will it even then need a guru!

God therefore guides through the instructions of a guru who communes with Him. The preceptor must have divine attunement or we have \"the blind leading the blind.\" Does not religion take the form of a dogma after it is or- ganized and defined by symbols and conventions! Just as the nut is hidden within the shell, so is true religion hidden in the distorting dogmatic formalities of religion. But as a nutshell can be opened by a nutcracker and the meat found inside, so deep spiritual seekers, by the nutcracker of intuitive meditation on religious ideals, can break the dogmatic shell and get at the inner hidden truth. A crow may peck vainly at a hard walnut shell and never get at the meat; similarly, shallow spiri- tual seekers bite unsuccessfully at the dogmatic shell of reli- gion without ever getting to the kernel of truth. You believe there is a fundamental unity of all religions. If that be so, why is there jealousy and conflict between the followers of one creed and those of other persuasions! We read of such conflicts even in the ancient scriptures. The disciples of the great god Shiva extol him as supreme; the Vaishnavites consider Vishnu and his incarnations as Rama or Krishna to be the highest. * Worshipers within the divisions of religion have not the full realization of those whose lives have inspired true paths. I have often said that if Jesus, Krishna, Bud- dha, and other true emissaries of God came together, they would not quarrel, but would drink from the same one cup of God-communion. The varying views of religionists are akin to the story told in India about six blind brothers who were washing an ele- phant. The first brother proclaimed that the elephant is like a huge wall; he had been washing the sides of the pachyderm. Hearing this, the second brother disagreed, asserting that the ele- phant is like a flexible bamboo pole; he had been washing the trunl^.

Hearing these absurd pronouncements, the fourth brother corrected them with his definition that the ele- phant is like a large fleshy roof supported by four pillars; he had been washing the legs. The fifth brother laughed derisively, for to him the elephant was just two pieces of bone; he had been washing the tusks. Now the sixth brother knew they were all crazy and declared definitely that the elephant was only a piece of rope hanging from heaven,- he had washed the tail and, being the youngest and smallest, he couldn't reach the top of the tail and so assumed it descended from the celestial regions of the gods. At the height of the quarrel, their sighted father arrived and explained, \"You are all right, and you are all wrong. Right, be- cause you correctly described what you experienced, but wrong because each of you experienced only a part of the whole. The elephant is an aggregate of all of these parts.\" Man's consciousness evolves through incarnations and grad- ually experiences more and more of the nectar-ocean of truth. Each person can absorb only to the degree of his individual ex- perience. These differences in perception are the cause of argu- ments and controversies, each seeing only a part of the whole truth. An exchange of differing views is constructive if done with openness and respect; but destructive, ending in quarrels, if there is bigotry and fanaticism. Do you find similarities between the Hindu and Christian faiths! The Bhagavad Gita and the Christian Bible, especially the New Testament, I consider the greatest of all scriptures because they both point out the same yoga highway to God. The Bha- gavad Gita teaches: \"He is a man of realization who sees Spirit equally in all.\"* And the Bible says: \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?\"+ The Revelation of St. John in the Bible is an allegory of the same principles of yoga cited in the Gita. My Guru sent me to the West especially to show the underlying yoga highway to God * \"He sees truly who perceives the Supreme Lord present equally in all crea- tures, the Imperishable amidst the perishing\" (Bhagavad Gita XIII:27). t I Corinthians 3:16 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"182 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION to be found in both the Bible and the Bhagavad Gita.

Has not man in his fear and greed cre- ated such a Being after his own image, rather than that a Divine Creator formed man after His imageI The presence of so much evil and suffering in the world would seem to support this view. Man's view of the universe is perversely limited by the cir- cumscriptions of his limited mind and senses. Thus he sees cre- ated things, but not their essence nor their Creator.

The same is true about God's ever-changing motion picture of creation. Savants who realize their oneness with God see creation as a motion picture of forces emanating from Him.

As the waves of the ocean cannot exist without the ocean, so soul-waves, or individualized expressions of being, could not exist without the ocean of God's presence. So long as soul-waves play with the storm of delusion, they rise out of the sea and are shattered and broken. That is why it is essen- tial to return to the calm deeps of the oceanic bosom of God. What is Bliss, the final emancipation! Is not man born once and his individuality lost forever in death! Man lives in one body and with one name only once. He never reincarnates again with the same form and identity. A per- son may wear a garment for some time and then discard it, never to use it again. Similarly, the soul wears a different body in each of many lifetimes until, through reincarnation and spiritual evolution, it ascends back to Spirit. Thus you live only once as any particular person, but the soul, the eternal you, lives through numerous reincarnations, carrying with it the cumulative per- sonality and karmic tendencies of its past existences. The mind, or sentient consciousness in man, is subject to alternating waves that agitate the soul and keep it separate from God: the wave of sorrow; the wave of pleasure,- and the wave of indifference or boredom. When these waves, created by the storm of delusion, have been dispelled by yoga, man experi- ences the negative state of peace, or the absence of these agita- tions.

Sorrow, pleasure, and indifference are transitory experi- ences of the incarnate soul; but the state of Bliss is an integral part of the Self, and as such is eternal.

Jesus said, \"No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.\"* The omniscient God brings shallow seekers in contact with lesser teachings and spiritual books,- from these they derive some benefit commensurate with their degree of spiritual desire and understanding. But deep seek- ers of God are brought by Him into contact with fully realized gurus who are able to commune with God and to serve as channels in imparting divine guidance. It is their duty to intro- duce the devotee to God. So it is ultimately God who brings together guru and disciple, but there is also a desire on their part to come together. Through earnest spiritual longing the disci- ple, perhaps unconsciously at first, seeks the guru—one who can lead him to God. And the true guru, when he intuitively knows a disciple sent by God, makes an effort to draw him, and goes out of his way to help him.

In this way, from prehistoric days down through the Christian era, the karma of thousands of wars gathered like a snowball into the first World War. And what did it accomplish? It only accumu- lated in its wake more trouble, more disaster. The second World War came,- and now, when we analyze the results, don't we wish that we had the world as it was before this devasta- tion occurred? As Jesus Christ and Gandhi said, \"If you use the sword, you will fall by the sword.\"* Man 's Use of the Atom The snowball of bad karma is growing bigger and bigger, and now the politicians are speaking again of war! Why? They should know very well they will not be safe—not even in the White House or the Kremlin—because the atomic bomb has spread the threat of devastation everywhere, affecting combat- ants and noncombatants alike. On the other hand, we can see that the Lord has given unto man—through the great scien- tists—the use of atoms; and we know now that the latent power in droplets of water could furnish the city of Chicago with enough electricity to keep it running for three days! If con- structively used, this atomic energy could bring the millen- nium. It could eradicate all the slums of the world. Man would not have to work more than two hours a day.

No matter how dark you think the picture is, do not be too discouraged. I know there is a God who gives to the nations of the world what is for their good. They reap good or bad results according to their karma; and very few realize that the good karma of America and the good karma of India are on the ascendant.

I know that the atomic bomb is a very bad thing; but I know also that it is better in the hands of America than in the hands of anybody else.

Many cartoons have been drawn to ridi- cule him. And still in his life he had shown that evil travels with the wind, but the power of Truth travels against the wind. He demonstrated that. I was talking once to a band of students who criticized Mahatma Gandhi because he did not provide any financial se- curity in the form of bonds for his wife or children,- and his son recently announced: \"Father has not left us anything.\" I am going to write to him: \"Your father has left to you, to us, to all the millions of people in India, and to every nation, the riches of the spiritual truth he proved: that political freedom can come to four hundred million not by the sword, nor by the firing of a single shot, but by the power of love.\" Mahatma Gandhi s son has received freedom; all India has received freedom, by spiri- tual means through Gandhi.

Once, in Bombay, the native soldiers of the Indian army re- volted and were firing on and killing English people. It is al- leged that Churchill threatened to send an army to bomb India out of existence. Then Mahatma Gandhi wrote to him, saying, \"You don't need to do that. I will stop them.\" And he went to them, amidst the shots that were being fired. They stopped fir- ing, and he said, \"Peace unto you. You will not gain freedom by killing a few British people. Conquer them by the greater force of love.\" They remained peaceful, and Mahatma Gandhi by his appeal got the British to forgive the native insurrectionists. I said that after the war, India would be free; it was pre- dicted in our magazine, East-West.* I was laughed at for say- ing this, and for declaring that this World War II was being fought for the freedom of India and all downtrodden nations. Yet it has come true. India would never have been free if this war had not come about. God did not bring about this war,- but because people believe in war and create karmic causes, there is war. God does not need to use atomic bombs and mir- acles to destroy the devil. The devils kill themselves by using power wrongly. But we find that Mahatma Gandhi conquered by the literal application of the methods of Jesus Christ. Facing Death Never has any religious or political leader been so hon- ored at his death as Gandhi. He is even more powerful today than when he was alive. He retained his powers and exempli- fied his teachings to the very end. Only one week before his death, he was the target of a bomb, which barely missed him, but he asked his followers not to be hard on the traitors! He said that God was keeping him there to do a little more work; and that when it was done, God would take him away. The night before his death, he told his grandniece, \"Abha, Abha, bring the important letters. I'll sign them. Tomorrow it may be too late.\" He knew his time had come.

Mahatma Gandhi was of God. He may not have been as great as Christ, or the masters I knew, but he knew God. When he was shot, he had a smile on his lips, and made a sign of for- giveness with his hand. With that gesture, Gandhi was asking the Father's forgiveness for his assassin. This was as inspiring as Jesus' words on the cross: \"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\" What of the Future? Gandhi is living today in the hearts of men, to remind them that violence is the law of the brute. When brutes such as the big saber-toothed tiger infested the earth, they didn't rule the earth. Man, by superior intellectual power, overcame larger, more powerful creatures, even without being equipped with ma- chine guns. The President and Stalin should remember that if the strong destroy each other, the meek shall inherit the earth. The spiritually meek shall never be destroyed. Their weapon is Christ's method: loving the enemy, and conquering the enemy by love. This is a time when God is bumping the heads of Com- munism, Imperialism, Capitalism—all isms that believe in the power of force. I make one prediction now: The world is not going down to destruction. So don't be frightened. Believe in your Father. He will protect you if you remember His ideals, if you keep faith in Him.

I predict this; and that America's democracy and practi- cal material power combined with India's spiritual power will prevail and conquer the world.

Publisher's Note The following words of Paramahansa Yogananda's, written in 1951, put into perspective the Master's view of war: Wars of aggression and suppression are heinous crimes against the heritage of humanity as freeborn children of God. A war thus motivated is unrighteous action by the aggressor, and it is not unrighteousness to defend ourselves against such evil. To protect one's country and its helpless citizens against evil is righteous action. Spiritual power is the greatest force; it should be the bulwark behind every form of resistance and de- fense. The first line of action should be to use all spiritual and moral power possible to counter evil; and to strive to change the world's inclination to war and violence by removing the causes that strengthen evil—poverty and hunger, disease, in- justice, greed, and selfish interests.

And when depression starts in one place, it begins to spread every- where, owing to the vibrations that travel through the ether. The last world war [World War I] created wrong vibrations in Europe first, which then spread all over the earth; and where there was no war, influenza appeared. The agonies of the people who died in the world war created the subtle cause of the epidemic of Spanish influenza, which immediately followed the war and killed 20 million people while the war itself killed about 10 million only. In the present Spanish Civil War, vibrations of the death struggles of thousands of men, women, and children are float- ing in the ether—causing floods in America, storms in England and Portugal, and earthquakes in India. And so the peoples of the world, instead of creating more conflicts and getting into wars, should try their utmost to use peaceful means and non- cooperation—for example, blockades—to stop war. The murder of thousands of Ethiopians* (who didn't want war) and the vibrations of injustice done to them, has upset the equilibrium of the world.

The war in Spain is a war of ag- gression. According to the League of Nations, a war of aggres- sion is untenable. But since the world ignored the divine man- date and divine rule of outlawing wars of aggression (which came as a great lesson from the last world war), the world is again headed towards the self-created, Satan-influenced possi- bility of a greater world war and greater destruction.

On the other hand, those patriots are foolish who think that they would lose na- tional advantages by espousing international patriotism,- for in- ternational good includes the national good, and partial national good should be sacrificed for international good. But if the na- tional good acts against the interest of international good, it will defeat its own purpose.

If you will remem- ber that, you will find great satisfaction in the understanding you will receive from Him about the anomalies of life that have mys- tified you. Man came on earth uniquely endowed with individuality and free will. He was put here to evolve his intelligence, and thereby rediscover and express his true nature, the soul: a re- flection of Spirit. He was to gradually develop his innate in- telligence, not merely through books or lectures and sermons, but also through his own efforts to exercise his mind and im- prove the quality of his thoughts and actions.

Though the light of God is in all equally, we cannot deny that it is more manifest in some than in others. If the light of God were fully manifest in all people, then human beings would remain con- stantly in their native state of perfection. But we see that in most people there is room for improvement; they have yet to evolve to a higher level of intelligence. The flexibility of human life shows that there is a divine power lodged in all. That some show greater development than their fellow beings simply indicates that they have made more ef- fort.

And if the \"hope- less\" condition in the brain of a moron were corrected, his soul would be able to manifest more of its native intelligence. The History of Leadership Looking back through history, we see that as some individ- uals developed more intelligence than others, they stood out from the crowd and became leaders. Their leadership was gained and secured through demonstration of physical prow- ess; the strongest and cleverest of the tribe became the leader. In this way different clans developed. Gradually, to become stronger in order to accomplish common purposes, several clans united under one leader. Those leaders became kings, elected according to their demonstration of physical power and intelligence. But some of them abused their position and became tyrants. They further established that their descendants were to be the successors to the crown. The right to rule by virtue of birth, rather than capacity, vitiated this form of leadership. The evil crept in because even if the kingly offspring was physically, mentally, or otherwise unqualified, he nevertheless inherited, and usually insisted on exercising, the right to rule. In some cases, incompetent heirs were manipulated by scheming minis- ters in their service. So we see that the system based on inheritance was de- fective. Some nations eventually became weary of this kind of tyranny and rebelled against their rulers. Many kings were slain, and others dethroned. Then came the idea of a republic. Countries such as France and America chose to have presidents elected by the people. George Washington qualified himself for this position by all he did to help bring freedom to this land. He loved this country and had its highest interest at heart; he was a real president. Under his able leadership, this great land took its first important steps as a new nation.

Those who feel qualified to castigate others for their failings should be willing to stand up and confess their own shortcomings, too. But politi- cians know they won't get elected that way. So sometimes they get the vote simply because of their shrewdness in putting them- selves over through their speeches. Then, after they get to the top, they do just as they please, in spite of all their promises to the people. Voters don't really know a candidate. Usually they are not in a position to make a personal judgment of his charac- ter. They know only what they read or hear about him. If he is said to be capable and a nice person, they feel inclined to vote for him. But where is the ground for judgment? Where is the standard of truth with which to measure each politician? None has been established. Thus the masses too often are swayed by propaganda and sentiment, without really knowing what is going on. Even an unworthy candidate can get votes if he has the money for a good publicity program. But it is wrong to ad- vertise how good he is if he hasn't the qualities to back it up. The system of voting for candidates is spoiled when money, rather than merit, can make the difference in getting someone elected president; and politicians, unfortunately, have a repu- tation for seeking out the moneyed people for help. Worthy candidates without such contacts may remain too little known to attract the voters-. Of course, to be wealthy is not necessar- ily to be involved in influencing elections!

It used to be a com- mon attitude in India that if someone said, \"I read it in the pa-"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"210 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION per,\" people automatically took it for granted that it must be false. Newspapers are often biased, and this makes people skep- tical. Truth and sympathetic justice, not expediency and ex- ploitation, will restore integrity to news reporting and reestab- lish people's faith. So we find that though democracy is the best ideal, the present system of voting is extremely inefficient because the decision too often has to be made on what the candidate says about himself or against others who are running on the ticket. Too little attention is paid to the real character of the candi- dates. If only saints and others who are truly capable of ana- lyzing character went to vote for our leaders, we would be as- sured of a good president in the White House; we would always have worthy ones to guide us. A truly great president is one who looks to the good of the nation first, and includes in that the well-being of the whole world. So, because of the discrepancies in the voting system, we get some good presidents and some bad ones. Still, this demo- cratic system is certainly far better than any other present-day alternatives. Inept kings and those who rule by force cannot be demoted without violence, but the people can lawfully re- place presidents who prove unworthy. Now we come to the modern-age form of dictatorship. Dic- tators are a classic example of politicians who make promises and then break them after they get in office. Dictators usually start out with the desire to help their people, but while they may be loyal to their own country, their self-interest makes them very disloyal to all other nations. Through jealousy and overzealousness, they bring trouble to the whole world as they rise to power. When they get to the top, they begin to rule by force to prevent anyone else from taking their position. Right or wrong, their word is law. This is the flaw of dictatorships. In the beginning, the dictator gains power by doing some good for his people. He stirs their faith in him, because he rules by merit. But when he gets to the top, he rules by force. In One Sense, God Is a Dictator Now comes the question: Is God a dictator?

We did not ask to be created. Who told Him to create us? That is the one question God does not answer. I often tell Him He had no busi- ness to create us and put us in a body so susceptible to disease and suffering. Even a car has parts that can be easily replaced from time to time, but not this human machine. You have a right to say to God, \"Lord, since You created me, redeem me.\" This is the way you should pray to Him. You are His responsibility. The Pattern of Creation Is Set by God Why did God create women, men, and animals, and iden- tify the soul with the particular limitations of consciousness peculiar to the form in which it is encased? It is in this sense that God is a dictator. Animals have no chance to improve themselves; they remain just as they are, bound by instinct. And human beings take advantage of the poor creatures. We don't wear shoes made of human skin because humans would resist that idea. But we feel free to take the flesh and skins of animals because in the God-created order of the world they cannot defend themselves against man. I say that in these ways God is a dictator. But just the same, He is responsible for us, because we are thrust into this world without being asked if we want to come, and without being told why we are here. Yet we can see that His purpose must be good. This whole creation shows that it is the work of some great Intelligence. There are the senses through which we perceive and relate to this world. There is food to satisfy our hunger, and we have been given the ability to look after this body and fill its other needs. Each life form follows a more or less set pattern. The av- erage life of man is less than a hundred years,- the redwood tree lives up to four thousand years. After a relatively short time, the ordinary house plant dies, no matter how carefully you look after it. Some insects live only a few hours. All this shows that there is a Dictator who has ordered things as they should be. He has set the standards by which all living things are governed. Spiritual Dictatorship Now the difference between the leadership of Joseph Stalin and Mahatma Gandhi is an important one. They both rule"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"212 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION millions of people, but Gandhi is a spiritual dictator. He leads through love, not force; and people follow him out of love, not fear. Similarly, I think God can be said to be a spiritual dicta- tor. If He were to come on earth in human form with all His wondrous qualities unmasked, which He could very well do, everyone would follow Him without question. He does come, but in the guise of His avatars, in whom He keeps His powers partially hidden so that He might play a specific human role for the good of man. Thus God was born as Jesus, who let himself be crucified even though he could have destroyed the world with a glance. He who could raise the dead could certainly have annihilated his enemies by the command of Spirit within him. The fol- lowers of Jesus expected him to be an emperor of this world. But instead he wore a crown of thorns, and by so doing he be- came a real emperor, ruling the hearts of millions through the ages. Where are Napoleon and Genghis Khan today? They are mere chapters in history books. But in every nation there are those who love and follow Jesus. The life of Jesus shows that God is not like the ordinary dictator. He is almighty, yet He does not use His power to de- stroy His enemies. You can curse God, deny Him, and call Him all the evil names you want; He will never punish you for those insults. But because you have filled your mind with evil thoughts, you won't be at peace with yourself. God Refuses to Dictate to His Children God has created this universe to run according to law; if we break one of the cosmic principles, we punish ourselves. Jump from the top floor of a high building, and your bones will be broken. You can't ignore the law of gravity without ex- periencing the consequences. So in this world man can act freely only within a limited scope. If he goes against divine laws he will punish or destroy himself. In the sense that God has established inexorable laws, He does seem to be a dicta- tor. But the fact that He Himself remains absolutely silent, and calls us only through love, proves that He doesn't like that role. If God spoke to us directly, we would in that instant lose our free choice, because we would immediately feel impelled to"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"IS GOD A DICTATOR! 213 obey Him; we couldn't resist His wise and loving influence. For the same reason, no saint has been permitted by God to exert spiritual force to change the world. Great saints have tremendous power. My Master could raise the dead, but he never used his power to force the world to change. If people are shown miracles, they will be attracted by phenomena in- stead of being drawn to God out of the soul's spontaneous love for Him. So God does not allow any saint to draw souls to Him by the use of spiritual power in a way that imposes on the free choice of those souls. Down through the ages, in fiery speeches prophets have warned that God Himself will come out of the clouds to destroy the wicked. But God has never done that. When people are evil—when they break His divine laws—they set in motion the cosmic forces that produce the inevitable consequences of their wrong actions; thus they punish themselves. I don't think God Himself has ever come down to chastise anyone. If that were His way, He would be punishing wrongdoers right now, for He knows who is right and who is wrong in this terri- ble war* that is going on. God is humble and has hidden Himself. He doesn't want to come and say to mankind, \"I am God. You have to obey Me.\" But He does try to keep us from harming ourselves by speaking to us through His laws and through great souls. Christ said: \"He that is least among you all, the same shall be great.\"+ He who is truly humble in the eyes of God is like God Himself.

They should be given not only academic education, but also the highest education in cultivating soul qualities and spreading by example the broth- erhood of man. National patriotism based on selfishness has been the cause of many disasters and untold suffering all over the earth. There- fore we must teach, along with patriotism, the brotherhood of man. When the seeds of brotherly love take root in the hearts of people, wars will cease. Consider how much discrimination there is in the world; we have an example in America's citizenship laws.

Some Worthwhile Ideas From Francis Bacon Francis Bacon wrote a perceptive treatisef that gives us stimulating food for thought. He tells of a party of voyagers who had been blown off course by strong winds, and found them- selves in a new and unfamiliar region. They came to a wonder- ful island, on which was cradled a beautiful city. An official, wearing silken robes of azure blue, came out to the ship and invited the lost travelers to stay for a time with their people. The city was a scientific Utopia. Marvelous discoveries and in- ventions were disseminated to the citizens from a place called * With the urging of President Truman, a bill was finally passed in 1946 mak- ing it possible for emigrants from India to become citizens of the United States, t New Atlantis."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"IS GOD A DICTATOR! 215 Solomon's House, whose members consisted of exceptionally learned men—the \"shooting stars\" of the arts and sciences. All were of noble and scientific mind, interested in truth alone. The foremost purpose of their research was to reveal for the benefit of man the wonders immanent in God's creation. The progress and well-being of this Utopia were thus dependent on and guided by the finest people of the community. India, in its Golden Age, went even deeper than this, hold- ing to the ideal that leaders of the people should be not only scientists, but saints; because scientists without spiritual real- ization can be blind to the true highest good of the people. In those ancient times in India, wise saints advised the ruling kings. Leaders of men should be guided by great souls. The earth's problems would then be solved, because saints who love God look to the good of all, and would not institute in any country unjust laws that would foment troubles. Great saints look upon the whole world as their kingdom. Therefore the saints have always advised kings to keep harmony not only in their own country, but to help promote it in other countries as well. This requires the broadness of spiritual patriotism, which opens the borderlines of nationality to embrace all. Gandhi has said that his India consists not only of Hindus, but whoever loves India and follows Truth—no matter what his nationality or religion. And when we think of Lincoln, we think of another wise and understanding man. There may be more like him today: \"many a flower is born to blush unseen.\" * Man's worthiness and desire for trustworthy leadership must be there to encourage such noble souls,- then gradually they will reveal themselves.

We Have to Make a Start Somewhere People have not been educated into this kind of unselfish thinking. That is why it is not possible yet to have a Utopia on earth. True happiness for all can come only under the spir- itual government of the soul. We have to make a start somewhere. In governments there should be a standard and exchange of highest wisdom. It is starting even now. In the government of India there are certain chairs for philosophers. But this is not enough. Ordinary ex- change of trade between governments has created wars. Mer- chants of wisdom would bring such understanding between nations that all participating countries would learn how to exchange and share material commodities without fighting. This must come to pass. Don't think that the world is going backwards. We will gradually come to this state. The war will help to clean out politics. It will bring to light many of the causes of the ills of the world. Just think, in peacetime, anyone who bombs a house is put in prison. But in war, the person who destroys masses of homes gets a medal for it. What a wonderful concept! We must begin now to put into effect new concepts, spir- itual ones. Don't minimize your own abilities, for the almighty Father is within you. The minute you recognize that Power within, you will be able to do great things. The ocean consists of drops of water. If the drops were taken away, there would be no ocean. And there would be no works of God in this world without us. Think in terms of the whole world when you think of what service you can render. You are made in the image of God, and must not look upon yourself as a frail human being. Develop your love, that you can give it to your nation and to all nations of the world. God wants you to know that you are sent here to develop love for your world family. Incarnation after incarnation death takes you away, that you may not be- come too clannish and too identified with only one national- ity and a few loved ones. Jesus showed us the way.

One said, \"Look, brother, the potatoes are jumping up and down.\" The wiser boy said, \"But it is the fire that makes them jump.\" God is the fire that animates all beings. You think you are doing everything; you forget that it is God who is working through you. It is God who loves through you; it is His love alone that ex- presses through all forms of love on earth. Friendship is the purest love of all; in that love lies the potential to love the whole world, for true friendship is unconditional. Loving your family is just the first lesson in learning to love all mankind. The world has come to the state wherein it is essential that we be schooled not only in patriotism, but also in divine brotherhood. Jesus said: \"Love thy neighbor as thyself.\"* Every nation must love every other nation as its neighbor. A Dictator Wouldn't Give Us the Right to Throw Him Out So we may say that in creating us without our consent, God is a dictator. But on the other hand, He is not a dictator because He has given us complete freedom to throw Him out and never think of Him. That is why some good people who never even think of God seem to get along all right. If God were a dictator, He would say: \"Oh, there is that man. I will fix him so that he will have to think of Me.\" But God doesn't do that. You will not suffer so long as you follow His laws, even though you have totally forgotten Him. It is only when you break His laws that you punish yourself with suffering. But God's laws are subtle: It is difficult to avoid breaking them without seeking His help. So, even though God has all physical, mental, and spiritual power, He doesn't use it when we go against Him. You may curse God every day of the year, and He won't punish you for that. But love Him, and He will come to you. He is working through love to draw you back to Him. Though God has given us freedom, He also realizes that we are still very much hemmed in by our own self-imposed limitations. Therefore, He has given us intelligence through * Matthew 22:39 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"218 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION which we can get out of this mess. We have no one to blame but ourselves if we don't use that intelligence rightly. Even God can't help us if we break His laws and bring suffering upon ourselves. Some people go through life dull-minded—eating and sleep- ing, enjoying a few pleasures, very seldom thinking deeply. So many people don't really think. They have the consciousness that material life is everything. But this life is only a passing dream. So why should you live trying to please the world? Bet- ter to try to please God first, and then you will better be able to please all. God will eventually give freedom to everyone, but it won't come to you until you have used rightly your free choice. Otherwise, there would be no point in His having given us free will. Animals have no freedom. God bound them by in- stinct. But in man He has implanted wisdom. Human beings have the free choice to go up or down, to become better or worse. And since He has given us this freedom, He remains silent; because He knows if He talked to us, we would be to- tally influenced by Him. He would be able instantly to con- vince us against doing wrong. And if He did that, He would indeed be a dictator. So even though He is almighty, He can't do anything for us that will interfere with our free choice. Do you not see that? Therefore, because He keeps Himself out of our decisions, remaining quiet, hiding His power, He is not a dictator. He knows we are in trouble, but there is no way He can redeem us unless we cooperate with Him through our own effort. By our own free choice we alone decide whether to accept Him or cast Him aside. You Are Potentially Equal to God Another thing, ordinary dictators never want anyone else to be like them. They are inimical to each other because they want to be unique and supreme. But God is not like that. He made you in His image,- you are potentially equal to God since you are a part of Him. Each one of us has the ability to become godly, if he would cast off the eclipse of ignorance. You don't have to acquire anything; you have it already. The gold of the soul is right there within you, covered with the mud of"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"IS GOD A DICTATOR! 219 delusion. All you have to do is scrape off that mud. So you see, on the one side God is a dictator because He created us against our will. But He is surely trying to rectify that by being a spiritual dictator. He speaks only through His laws and draws only with His love. But because He doesn't manifest Himself on earth and demand to be elected as the almighty ruler, He is not a dictator. The Lord isn't campaign- ing for election, except in the individual election of your heart. When your heart will sparkle with the light of your soul's love for Spirit, when that love will destroy all the psy- chological prisons that have held captive your free choice, then He will come without your asking. He will say: \"Your love is so dazzling, so enticing, that I would like to come to you, if you will let Me.\" So God as a spiritual dictator will never use force, nor ap- pear to the world and proclaim: \"I am the Lord of the Uni- verse.\" It is only when your soul will call to God and your heart will melt with love for Him that you will know Him."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Receiving God's Answers to Your Prayers This article is a composite of introductory material written by Paramahansa Yogananda for early editions of his book, Whispers from Eternity. When Paramahansaji revised Whispers for the then forthcoming eighth edition, he wrote a basically new Introduction. While the instructions in this article refer specifically to the in- vocations in Whispers from Eternity, the principles expressed eluci- date a science of prayer that is applicable to all who seek divine aid in changing their lives through the power of prayer. God made man in His image. All those who know how to receive Him can realize the divinity sleeping within them by expanding the powers of the mind. Being children of God, we have potential dominion over all things in His universe, even as He has. The question arises, Why is it that many of our wishes are not fulfilled, and that many of God's children suffer in- tensely? God, with His divine impartiality, could not make one child better than another. He originally made all souls alike, and in His image. They also received the greatest gifts of God: freedom of the will, and power to reason and to act accordingly. Somewhere, sometime in the past, men have broken the various laws of God, and accordingly have brought about law- ful results. All men have been given absolute liberty to use human reason wrongly or rightly. Misuse of God-given reason leads to sin, which is the cause of suffering; the right use leads to virtue, the precursor of happiness. God, with His infinite nobility, would not punish us ; we punish ourselves through our own un- reasonable actions, and reward ourselves through our own good conduct. This alone explains why God's responsibility ended when He endowed man with reason and with free will. Man has misused this God-given independence and thus has brought upon himself ignorance, physical suffering, pre- 220"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"RECEIVING GOD'S ANSWERS TO YOUR PRAYERS 221 mature death, and other ills. He reaps what he sows. The law of cause and effect applies to all lives. All the todays in one's life are determined by the actions of all the yesterdays, and all the tomorrows of one's life depend upon the way in which all the todays are handled and lived. Thus it is that man, although created in the image of God and potentially endowed with His powers, loses his claim and birthright to dominion over his Father's universe, through his own faults and self-imposed limitations. The misuse of rea- son, and the identification of the soul with the transitory body, or with environmental or hereditary or world influences, are responsible for man's despairs and miseries. How a Sleeping Son of God May Become an Awakened Son of God Yet the fact remains that every human being, however wrong outwardly, is potentially a son of God. Even the great- est of sinners is but an unawakened son of God, a sleeping im- mortal, who refuses fully to receive His light by clarifying his consciousness. In John 1:12 we find written: \"But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.\" The ocean cannot be received in a cup unless the cup is made as large as the ocean. Likewise, the cup of human con- centration and human faculties must be enlarged in order to comprehend God. Receiving denotes capacity acquired by self- development; it is different from mere belief. How the Belief of Being a Son of God Can Become a Realization The purport of St. John's words is that those sleeping sons of God who awake, by following the law of spiritual disci- pline, receive or feel God by developed intuition and thus re- gain their latent powers as sons of God. It is ignorance that prompts man to imagine his littleness and limitations. Igno- rance is the sin of all sins. It is the man sleeping in delusion who acknowledges and emphasizes his dream of human weaknesses. It is wrong for a soul (in the garb of the ego) to believe itself limited by the body,"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"222 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION instead of knowing itself as part of the unlimited Spirit. It is good and right to believe that one is a son of God, rather than the son of a mortal only, for it is metaphysically true that man is essentially made in the image of God. It is an error, therefore, for one to imagine that he is a perishable creature. Even by belief alone, one may gradually cultivate his intuitive knowing and some day realize his true soul nature as a son of God. Hence, a wayward child must start by believing this truth, as belief is the initial condition for testing and knowing a truth. When in trouble, one automatically prays to an unknown God and expects relief. If freed from trouble, even inciden- tally, he believes his prayers were heard and responded to by God. But should his prayer request remain ungranted, he be- comes confused and begins to lose faith in God. Demand Versus Prayer My purpose in presenting these sacred demands [in Whis- pers from Eternity], * received in the course of my various fruit- ful communions with our Father, is to enable my fellow beings to contact Him effectually. I prefer the word \"demand\" to \"prayer,\" because the former is devoid of the primitive and me- dieval conception of a kingly tyrant-God whom we, as beg- gars, have to supplicate and flatter. There is a great deal of beggary and ignorance in ordinary prayer. People pray haphazardly. Few know how to pray and touch God with their prayers; nor do they know whether their prayers are responded to or not, or whether things happened, unaffected by prayers. Nor do they distinguish between things that they need and things that they want. Sometimes it is very good that we do not receive what we think we want. A child may want to touch a flame, but to save it from harm the mother does not grant the child's wish. God, though all-powerful, does not act unlawfully or arbi- trarily merely because one prays. He has given independence * Similar prayer-demands may be found in Scientific Healing Affirmations and Metaphysical Meditations, also by Paramahansa Yogananda (published by Yogoda Satsanga Society of India)."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"RECEIVING GOD'S ANSWERS TO YOUR PRAYERS 223 to man, who does with it what he pleases. To forgive human shortcomings so that man can continue his misbehavior with- out consequences would mean that God contradicts Him- self—disregards the law of cause and effect as applied to the law of action—and handles human lives, not according to the laws created by Himself, but according to His whim. Nor can God be moved by flattery or by praise to change the course of His immutable laws. Must we then live without the interces- sion of the grace and mercy of God, and remain helpless vic- tims of human frailties? Must we then inevitably face the fruits of our actions as if by preordination or so-called fate? No! The Lord is both law and love. The devotee who with pure devotion and faith seeks the unconditional love of God, and who also brings his actions into harmony with divine law, will surely receive the purifying, mitigating touch of God. Any sin, and its consequence, can be forgiven the repentant devotee who loves God deeply enough, and thereby puts his life in tune with the all-compassionate Lord. The best way lies neither in begging for favors or for am- nesty from evil results, nor in being resigned and sitting idle, inviting the law of action to take its course. What is done by ourselves can be undone by ourselves. We must adopt the prop- er antidotes for our poisonous actions. For example, ill health can often be overcome by obeying laws of good health. But when chronic diseases and sufferings are beyond the control of human care,- when the power of human methods fails to cure ills, physical or mental, revealing its limitations, then we must ask God to help—He who is unlimited in power. And we must lovingly demand as sons of God and not as beggars. Every begging prayer, no matter how sincere, limits the soul. As sons of God, we must believe that we have every- thing the Father has. This is our birthright. Jesus realized the truth, \"I and my Father are one.\" That is why he had domin- ion over everything, even as his Father had. Most of us beg and pray without first establishing, in our own minds, our di- vine birthright; that is why we are limited by-the law of beg- gary. We do not have to beg, but to reclaim and demand from our Father that which we, through our human imagination, thought to be lost."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"224 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION It becomes necessary at this stage to destroy the wrong thought of ages—that we are frail human beings. We must think, meditate, affirm, believe and realize daily that we are sons of God—and behave accordingly! This realization may take time, but we must begin with the right method, rather than gamble with the unscientific beggary of prayers and con- sequently be subject to disbelief, doubts, or the jugglery of su- perstition. It is only when the slumbering ego perceives itself not as a body, but as a free soul or son of God, residing in and working through the body, that it can rightfully and lawfully demand its divine rights. Deep Attention and Devotion Are Necessary These sacred demands reveal a few of the attitudes of the soul that have met with successful response from God. How- ever, it is not enough merely to demand in another's language. One should not rely on a book on love when he meets his be- loved, but should use the spontaneous language of his heart. If one uses another's language of love in demands addressed to God, he must make the words his own, by thoroughly under- standing and dwelling upon their meaning, and applying to them the utmost concentration and love; even as it is not amiss when a lover addresses his beloved in the language of a great poet, and enlivens those words with his own love and feeling. Blind repetition of demands or affirmations, without con- comitant devotion or spontaneous love, makes one merely a \"praying Victrola,\" which does not know what its prayer means. Grinding out prayers vocally and mechanically, while inwardly thinking of something else, does not bring response from God. A blind repetition, taking the name of God in vain, is fruitless. Repeating a demand or prayer over and over again, mentally or orally, and with deepening attention and devo- tion, spiritualizes the prayer, and changes conscious, believing repetition into superconscious experience. The Divine Being cannot be deceived by a mockery of prayer, because He is the fountain of thoughts. He cannot be bribed at any time, yet it is easy to move Him with sincerity, persistency, concentration, devotion, determination, and faith."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"RECEIVING GOD'S ANSWERS TO YOUR PRAYERS 225 Furthermore, repeating a long, intellectual prayer with the mind absent develops hypocrisy; and to pray or demand with- out understanding develops ignorance, fanaticism, and super- stition. Repeating a demand with deepening concentration and faith is not mechanical repetition, but a changing, pro- gressing power and mental preparation which, step by step, sci- entifically reaches God. These sacred demands are logical, devotional, deep soul- outbursts. If one prepares the mind by concentration, and then deeply, with ever-increasing faith and devotion, mentally (or aloud, in congregations) affirms these scientific divine demands, one is bound to receive results.

Sow your demand-seed in faith, and water it by repeated daily practices in demanding rightly. Never be discouraged if results are not forthcoming immedi- ately. Stand firm in your demands, and you will regain your lost divine heritage; and then, and then only, will the Great Sat- isfaction visit your heart. Demand until you establish your di- vine rights. Demand unceasingly that which belongs to you, and you will receive it. In demanding rightly, there is no room for superstition, disappointment, or doubt. Once you learn to operate the right chain of causation that effectually moves God, you will know that He was not hiding from you, but that you were hiding from Him behind the shadow of self-created darkness. Once you feel, through intuitive knowing, that you are a son of God, then by the steady effort of mental discipline and devo- tional meditation you will have dominion over all things.

Some Practical Hints Select a demand from the contents according to your need. Sitting motionless on a straight chair, with spine erect, calm your mind.

The flame of inspiration is hidden within the lines of the prayer-demands in this book; but since they are presented through the mute medium of printer's ink, paper, and intellectual meanings, one must use his own intuition and devotion to bring forth their inner illumining flame. By the Christ-command of your deep intuitional perception, resurrect the inmost substance of words from the sepulcher of hollow, intellectual concepts. Different minds reading the same prayer may interpret it differently. The vast ocean of truth can be measured and per- ceived only according to the capacity of one's own intelli- gence and perception. Similarly, the inspiration behind these prayer-demands will be felt according to the depths of one's own intuition and feeling. In order to benefit fully from the God-warmth within these prayer-demands, one should take only a paragraph at a time from any demand, mentally picture the meaning, visualize the imagery of the figure of speech, and meditate deeply on it, un- til the fiery essence emerges, free from word limitations. One may wish to read a complete prayer-demand to get a quick view of its entire meaning. But if he will then reread it, over and over again, many times, and then with closed eyes repeatedly try to feel the deep inspiration behind and within it, he will spiritualize that prayer—that is, rouse the inspira-"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"RECEIVING GOD'S ANSWERS TO YOUR PRAYERS 227 tion slumbering beneath the thick silken quilt of words. With eyes closed and lifted to the point of spiritual con- centration between the eyebrows, meditate on the meaning of the demand you have selected, until it becomes a part of you. Saturate the demand with devotion as you meditate upon it. As your meditation becomes deeper, increase your devotion and mentally offer the demand as your own heart's outburst. Imbue yourself with faith that your heart's craving, expressed through this specific demand, is being felt by God. Feel that just behind the screen of your devotional demand God is listening to the silent words of your soul. Feel this! Be one with your heart's demand—and be thoroughly convinced that He has listened to you. Then go about your duties, seek- ing not to know whether God will grant your demand. Believe absolutely that your demand has been heard, and that you will know that what is God's is yours also. Unceasingly med- itate on God; and when you feel Him, you will acquire your rightful inheritance as His divine son. Daily Blossoms From the Ever-living Plant of Prayer-Demands These demands were given to me by the Universal Father; they are not mine. I only felt them and gave them expression through the avenue of words that I might share them with you. My blessing goes with them; and I pray that they may strike an answering note on the living harpstrings of your heart, so that you may feel them just as I have felt them. Prayer-demands are like ever-living plants that ceaselessly put forth new blossoms. A prayer-plant retains the same branches of words, but daily yields fresh roses of God-feeling and inspiration, if one regularly waters the plant with medita- tion. The prayer-plant must also be protected from the ravages of doubt, distraction, mental idleness, leaving-meditation-until- tomorrow (the morrow that never comes), absentmindedness, and thinking-of-something-else while imagining that the mind is wholly on the soul force of a prayer. Such parasites on the prayer-plants should be destroyed by faith, devotion to God, self-control, determination, and loyalty to a teaching.

But I am afraid that the karmic theory as sagely explained by the masters of India has been so distorted by nonunderstanding minds that the Western peoples have garnered a wrong idea about this great cosmic principle of cause and effect. You have relegated the word karma to a limited meaning, to refer only to the past. But this is erroneous. Karma, in general, means action, not merely the effects of past actions. It can refer to action performed in the past, or now, or that might be done in the future. When you say \"water,\" you may be referring to water in general, or you may specifically mean fresh water, or salt water, or any other kind of water. So the real meaning of the word karma is any ac- tion you perform,- and the sum total of all your actions, both good and bad, present and past. Actions that you are performing now are called present karma. Actions that have already been performed are called past karma. And when you refer to the ef- fects of past actions you would say, \"This is the result of my past karma.\" Even then you are not telling what kind of karma— beneficial or pain-producing. Then comes the question, What are the springs of action? What influences you to act and behave in a certain way? Now we have launched into the heart of the matter. You act in a certain way today, and you say, \"I have been acting this way all of my life.\" We get into deeper water when I ask you to consider the influences on those actions. There are two ways you work: prompted by your own free choice and by influences. So many subtle influences are interwoven with your decisions that it is very difficult for you to judge which 229"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"230 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION actions are performed according to your own free choice and which are performed under karmic compulsions of the past, or any other influences. It is rare to see a truly \"free\" man. Most people think they are free, while their minds are utterly fettered by psycho- logical chains. These are harder to get rid of than ordinary chains,- for in their subtlety they are difficult even to recognize, not to speak of how to destroy them! It requires a great deal of knowledge to cut those psychological restraints. There may be a million years of actions of past lives pur- suing you. That is why an ordinary individual finds himself so helpless to destroy the binding effects of his karma. He feels hopelessly bound by those invisible chains—influences result- ing from all the actions he chose to perform in past lives, through free will or through prevailing influences: As tabloid tendencies, the actions you have performed in the past are present in the brain. Diagnosing those karmic in- fluences is not a simple matter. But according to your salient features, inclinations, and moods you can detect what propen- sities have been trailing you and how strong an influence they are on your present life and your present actions. The Influences on Man's Freedom of Action Now, in addition to your karma from the past, what are the influences on your present life? World civilization is one of them. In whatever era a man is born, he is influenced by the civ- ilization of that age. If one is born in the eighth century, he is influenced by that century. You are all dressing, for example, according to the present civilization. You have more materials to choose from than in past centuries. You are thinking more of comfort and style than of mere warmth and necessity. Simi- larly, you are all eating now according to the present civiliza- tion,- for instance, there was no talk about vitamins in the sixth century. So your present consciousness and actions or be- havior are influenced by this present-day society. Then the next strong influence upon man is nationality. The soul identifies itself with the body and says, \"I am Ameri- can\" or \"I am a Hindu\" and so on. It is not easy to get rid of that influence, of that identification. But why should you think"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"THE WISDOM WAY TO OVERCOME KARMA 231 that you are an American, or an Indian, or a Frenchman? And why did I used to think that I was a Hindu? You see, I say I used to think; because I am one with all mankind. I have trained myself that way—not to be prejudiced by nationality, race, or any other circumscription that limits the universality of the soul. I am subtly telling you how to overcome your karma too: Always remain universal in your attitude and habits of life. Then you become free. The soul has worn many garbs: today you are an American and in the next life possibly Chinese, and so on. That is why it is unwise to hate any nationality, for hate attracts just as love attracts. Anything you hate, you attract to yourself that you may learn to overcome that prejudice. That is the law. For instance, those who hate a dark race will be born in that race—invariably. The greater the hatred, the stronger will be the karmic attraction to the object hated. The origin of the light and dark races was influenced by climatic conditions. Cli- mate will so change that someday it will be natural to see the white races in the East and the dark races in the West. That will happen; but many years from now. Then man is influenced by the community in which he lives. He is influenced by his neighbors: If he lives in an aris- tocratic neighborhood, he tends to behave in an aristocratic way; if he lives among businessmen, he behaves like them. Dif- ferent kinds of people have different kinds of habits that influ- ence you. Mix with artists and you will think that is the only way to be. (I am not condemning artists, but they need to be more practical-minded. You cannot live on beauty alone. \"I slept, and dreamed that life was Beauty,- I woke, and found that life was Duty.\"* You must see beauty in duty.) Remain in the company of spiritual persons and you will think spiritual thoughts. Environment is stronger than will power. If you want to be spiritual, seek good company and don't mix with those whose bad habits may wrongly influence you. You are also strongly influenced by your family. You think that you belong to a particular group of people, the family unit. They have put a trademark on you, and their habits encumber you. * From \"Beauty and Duty,\" by Ellen Sturgis Hooper (1816-1841)."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"232 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION Lastly, everyone is drunk with some habits. Sometimes man is crazy about money, and sometimes he is crazy for love, and then for fame, and so on—all the time battered and bludgeoned by the influence of his own habitual past actions of this life and past lives. That is the hypnosis of karma. Regaining Your God-given Freedom Where is your freedom? How little freedom you have left! The freedom that God has given to you as His own, to touch the Milky Way and to feel your presence in the flowers and in the stars!—that freedom has gone completely because of the many influences upon you. Most people are like psychological antiques, brittle with set ideas, with set influences. The minute you sit on them, they break! That is why our Indian astrologers say we are all puppets. I do not believe that. I believe you can destroy any karma you want to. If you close all the doors and windows in a room, darkness is there. But if you bring in the light, that dark- ness is gone instantly. Even the darkness that has permeated a cave for thousands of years is vanquished immediately when light is brought in. Will you reason that it will take light a hun- dred years to destroy those aeons of darkness? That is foolish. So, we may have karma of past lives, under whatever civ- ilization, nationality, community, and family we have lived; and of this life with the influences of this present civilization, nationality, community, and family,- but if we realize we are gods, we will be free from that karma now. Every human be- ing is made in the image of God. If you find that image within you, how can you have any karma? God as the Master of this universe has no karma,- if you know that you are one with God, there can be no karma for you. A venomous snake is not affected by the poison within it. It is also true that while delusion, or maya, is in the manifes- tation of God in creation, and that it affects us, it does not af- fect Him. That is not fair, is it? That is why He has to give us salvation,- but it will not come unless we demand it. Being made in God's image, we can be free from karma provided we claim our divine heritage from Him. You have been led to believe exactly the opposite. To believe in karma is"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"THE WISDOM WAY TO OVERCOME KARMA 233 to give strength to it. Why should you believe you are bound? You should think: \"I am not a mortal being; I am a child of God.\" Then you cut at the root of karma: \"Beyond the flights of fancy, formless am I, permeating all limbs of life. No freedom do I crave, nor bondage do I fear. For I am free—ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss. I am free. I am He, I am He, Blessed Spirit, I am He.\"* But as soon as you give in to the delusion that you are a human being, you have permitted all the karma of the past to envelop you. This life is a den of thieves; its influences rob you of your divine inheritance. When you say, \"I don't belong here,\" and you make the effort to get out, you will no longer be an un- willing captive. Salvage Your Freedom With Wisdom and Discrimination You must salvage your freedom. When you have made cer- tain resolutions, have you been able to carry them out? If you have not, you are bound by karma. But if you have been able to do the things you wanted to do, guided by your discrimination— and not because of the influences of your past or present karma, or because of your national or social or family life—that is free- dom. Judge everything from the standpoint of discrimination and wisdom. Let not your actions be governed by habits or blind obe- dience to social customs according to what other people think. Be free. Once in a while you see a free man—one who doesn't walk in dead men's shoes, one who is free because his actions are not influenced by anything but wisdom. That is the mark of Mahatma Gandhi's greatness. When he went to England and visited the king and queen, he didn't put on a dress suit, as was the custom. He was received by them in his simple village loincloth and shawl. He enjoys great freedom because he lives his ideals and is not bound by social custom. Whenever you do anything, ask yourself whether it is merely because of what other people may think about you, or whether you are following discriminative wisdom. That is the criterion by which I act. Even as freeborn Americans you do * Paraphrase of a well-known Sanskrit chant by Adi Shankaracharya."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"234 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION not know what real freedom is. Many people think that what- ever comes into their brains they may do—and believe that to be freedom. But true freedom lies in doing what you should do when you ought to do it. Otherwise you are a slave. Be ac- tuated by wisdom alone. If you are not able to do that, you are going to remain a slave for centuries of incarnations. Now, to follow truth doesn't mean you have to bludgeon others with your convictions. Share truth only when it is wel- comed or asked for. Otherwise, learn to be quiet; keep your own counsel. But when you feel you should speak, speak. Stand against the world if necessary. Galileo said that the earth goes round the sun ; and he was crucified for that. Later it was found that he was right. But never do anything out of pride. To do so is to fall. Learn to Act Wisely by Attunement With a True Guru In every action, be guided by wisdom; never by a desire to hurt anybody. But if anyone is hurt because of your doing the right thing, you should not be afraid; you have to answer to yourself, not to anyone else. Even God is not your judge,- you are your own judge. If you act wrongly, you are going to punish yourself. If you act rightly, you will free yourself. That is the justice of the law of karma. You are dictated to neither by God nor His angels, but by the law of action: What you sow, you reap. Whenever you meet with misfortune, do not put the blame for it on God. The blame rests with you alone—resulting from your past actions. If you lack the wisdom to discern what is right, then tune yourself in with the wisdom of a wise man. Often what you think to be wisdom is not wisdom at all, but your own desires and karmic inclinations. That is why you should have a guru. Guru is one who is sent by God to free you. When you are in tune with his wisdom, you find freedom. Otherwise, you remain a slave to your whims. The way to freedom is to follow those who themselves are free. When I met my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar, he told me to tune in my will with his will. He said that my will was strong, but governed by instincts,- but when I tuned my will with his will, I found it governed by wisdom. No one can incite me to do anything I know I should not do.

Comprehending that wisdom from a guru, thou wilt not again fall into delusion.\"* It is so hard to progress on your own on the spiritual path, but it is the easi- est thing if you have a true guru to whom you surrender your- self and whose interest is only in your spiritual welfare. I gave myself completely to my Master, and I found he gave his all to me. And through that surrender I found freedom. That freedom every soul craves. That is the way to overcome your karma. A guru's only interest is to help you progress spiritually. If the teacher wants something from the disciple, he is not a master. The master's only desire is to give, not to take. But if the disciple has the wish to help the work of the master, that is to his credit—he is helped by giving to God's cause. The masters create a few disciples who carry on their work. Masters are interested in souls rather than in crowds—souls that will follow and are really willing to discipline themselves. A true disciple is one who seeks liberation by accepting the guru's discipline, and who disciplines himself by the wisdom- guided instructions of the guru. But most disciples want to be gurus instead! Here in the West the church members expect the minis- ter to cater to them; he becomes their slave. I never ask for any- thing from you all for myself. I have suggested at times that you help the work, but I have kept myself free from enslave- ment to people. Even when sorely tried by financial problems of the work, I have not bowed down to anyone nor compro- mised my ideals. I have kept myself free. If Mt.

I remember in my youth I couldn't eat this or that food; but when I came under Master, he ironed out all those kinks of thought. First he found out what I didn't like to eat. He said, \"So, you don't like this; you don't like that.\" After seven days he asked me how I liked the food I had been eating in the ashram. I said that it was marvelous. He told me then that I had been eating in the various preparations the very foods that I thought I couldn't eat! He helped me to conquer likes and dis- likes by such discipline. Most people of the West think only of comfort. Master never bothered about where I slept; and if I tried to be more comfortable in the human way, he criticized me. By such con- structive criticism and training I found complete freedom from food consciousness, dress and social consciousness, and body consciousness. I was so happy, free from the prison of my own making. Master gave me that freedom by his guidance—free- dom from habits and moods and limiting thoughts. So, let not your will be the prisoner of your habits and whims. That doesn't mean you should not use your will. Learn to use it with discrimination, for then you are using the will of your Father. Learn to compare your developing discrimination with the wisdom discrimination of the guru,- for only then can you be sure when you are right. We are much too fond of our own thoughts. Whatever our notion, we want to drag out a whole body of scripture to support it. But when you compare your will with the master's will, and are guided by his will, then you know whether you are following wisdom or following instincts and your past karma. The scriptures say you must have a visible master—that is, one who lived on earth. To follow the counsel of a true guru is the only way you can be sure your actions are leading you to freedom from karma.

He will tell you what is best for you; and no matter how many times you falter, or leave him, he will always speak the truth to you for your own good. He cannot be bribed in any way,- such was my Master. He was the one among many who never hesitated to tell me my faults. He used to say, \"There is the door; anytime you want to go, you are free to leave.\" Many fled; but I didn't leave. I knew he wanted nothing from me, but I wanted that Something which he had. Master told me his discipline would smart sometimes; but if I promised to be obedient, I must honor that promise. And I did. Here in America the teacher is made to feel he must deal with the church members with kid gloves. But Master's way was strong. He told me: \"Your methods will be much milder than mine; but this is my way. Take it or leave it.\" I took it gladly! It made me a free person.  *  But no one can free you unless you make the effort to free yourself. God wants you to be free. He has given you free choice to follow the path of wisdom or to follow the path of karma. Try to do everything with wisdom,- and at night exam- ine yourself and see if you have succeeded. Be self-disciplined. If you can obey guru's guidance and remember to do what he says, and be ever watchful of yourself, you will suddenly see that you are free. Then every day you will feel freedom. Wisdom Destroys the Roots of All Misery Imagine what freedom you feel when you are free from the influences of this world, or your past, or your family, or neigh- bors, or your habits! You realize you are pure Spirit. You be- long to no group, no nationality, no family, no habits. Karma be- longs to the den of thieves where karmic people live. Always think, \"I and my Father are one. I have no karma; I am free.\" \"O Arjuna, as enkindled flame converts firewood into ashes, so does the fire of wisdom consume to ashes all karma.

By rebuilding his body-temple after death, he showed that he was free from karma. To admit karma means to accept yourself as a mortal be- ing. Do not admit you are a helpless mortal governed by karma. Affirm: \"I am a child of God. I am His.\" That is the truth. Why shouldn't you proclaim the truth? As soon as you realize this truth, your status is changed. But when you admit you are a mortal, you bind yourself with the chains of the mortal being. You are the sons of God; you are gods. How could karma influ- ence you? Refuse to be bound by karma; it is an old supersti- tion of the ignofant to believe you cannot change your destiny. Never say you are a sinner. How can you be a sinner? God is your Father. If He created this world with its potential for many evil ways, you would have to say that He too must be a sinner. That is the way I talk to God. It never hurts to speak truth to Him. If God can be away from the evil of His creation, so can we. As He is free, we can be free. Never again identify yourself with evil. You may have made a mistake, but it doesn't belong to you if you give it up. Destroy your karma by wis- dom. Live in the consciousness of Spirit. Today you say \"I am Spirit\" and tomorrow you do some- thing wrong and want to give up. Don't accept your weak- nesses. Jesus on the cross didn't give up! Even in the midst of the greatest torture or temptation, if you can hold on to your perception of wisdom, you will in the next minute be free. The wise retain that freedom even when facing death; but the ignorant fall back on their old mortal habits. If you give up and think that there is no chance for you, you have pronounced your own fatal judgment. You are the one who created your good and bad karma,- and when you say there is no hope, you have failed.

The True Purpose of Religion Do you see how much the church movement needs refor- mation? They expect people to follow religion by proxy. But truth has to be lived; it has to be realized as a part of one's own being. The church movement has done a lot of good, but it must really reform each individual. One moon gives more light in this world than all the stars—so is every truly reformed individual. To keep your minds on God, I seldom think of so- cials for our churches. I only discuss wisdom with you. I do not divert you from the real purpose of religion: to know God. That is why Self-Realization Fellowship is creating churches of all religions, * that all people can feel the spiritual barriers gone * Paramahansaji envisioned Self-Realization Fellowship temples as sanctuar- ies for the perpetuation of the ideals of actual God-communion and a com- mon spiritual brotherhood. \"Self-Realization Fellowship,\" the Guru explained, \"signifies fellowship with God through Self-realization, and friendship with all Truth-seeking souls.\" He included in his prayer invocations not only God and the Gurus of the YSS/SRF path, but also \"saints of all religions.\" In this same spirit, when founding his Self-Realization temples in Hollywood and San Diego in the early 1940s, he referred to each of them as a \"Church of All Religions.\" In using such terms as the \"unity of all religions\" and \"uniting all religions,\" he explained that he was not suggesting the merging of various beliefs and practices from different religions into one homogenous hybrid, which would be highly illogical and unnecessary considering the vast cultural and psycho- logical diversity of the human race. Indeed, each expression has its place, even as he defined his work of Yogoda Satsanga Society of India/Self-Realization Fellowship as a \"special dispensation.\" In his book The Science of Religion (published by Yogoda Satsanga Society of India), he speaks of the true basis of religious unity: \"If religion means primarily God-consciousness, or the realization of"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"240 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION and come together to really seek God.

Hives without the honey of God-communion are nothing. Jesus warned that the \"blind cannot lead the blind.\" If you have not God, you cannot give God to others. I told Master I would never stand before a congregation and talk about God un- less he gave me the experience of God. That is the important thing, to have that divine experience of God.

Then they struggle and struggle for money, and when they are dying of starvation they say: \"If only I had health and money, how happy I would be.\" So they rein- carnate with plenty of money and health, but without happiness. On their deathbed they think: \"If only I could have happiness, I would forgo health and riches.\" The next time they come back to earth very happy but without health or riches, for which they soon realize a need—and so the cycle continues. In this way immortal souls repeatedly punish themselves, because they never can find on this earth complete satisfaction. who cling to the cosmic illusion must accept its essential law of polarity: flow and ebb, rise and fall, day and night, pleasure and pain, good and evil, birth and death....The world illusion, maya, manifests in men as avidya, literally, 'not-knowledge,' ignorance, delusion.

Some people die longing for perfect human love. Others die dreaming of perfect happiness through the attainment of wealth and fame; but they are all deceived, for to own this whole earth and be adored by all its people is very little compared to what is lost by remaining a prodigal mortal. To contact Om- nipresence is to own the whole cosmos with all its entertain- ment and ever new immortality. In comparison, to own this earth is nothing; it would be fraught with sorrows, and at the time of death the delusion of its being wrested away from you would torture the soul. Material things cannot be owned by anybody, for at death they must be left behind and given to others. We are only al- lowed to use the objects of this world. So it is foolish to be pos- sessed by material possessions. Just pray to be given the use of what you need, and the power to create those things at will. Since death compels us to give up everything, even a mil- lionaire dies poor. Rather be like Jesus: he was materially poor, but rich with God; he had nothing material in life, yet having God he had all, even after death. Worldly-minded rich people have everything in this life and nothing hereafter. Remember, no matter who you are or what your condition is, do not think your trouble is the worst in the world. Even if you are playing a part fraught with poverty or disease, there are others who are enacting a part worse than yours. In this earth life, to be a millionaire or a poor man is the same if you but understand. If you see yourself as an actor in this earthly movie-house, all you have to remember is to play your role, small or big, cheerfully and well. That is all. During the playing of your part, agreeable or otherwise, do not wish to play somebody else's role. Complete your own as- signment, or you will have to spend aeons of time in the en- actment of imperfect human parts, changing from one to an- other according to the change of your desires.

Of course, you will say: \"Our desires are conditioned by our needs. We want food because hunger was given to us.\" I admit that; but I am talking of a greater freedom in mind and soul. When you attain that, not even tattered robes or death by starvation can produce inwardly an iota of unhappiness. When you possess the all-in-all God-consciousness, even if you have nothing of material possessions, yet you have all. Peo- ple who really contact God can never feel poor or left out; nor can they consider the rich as more fortunate than themselves. Instead, the man who is intoxicated with God-happiness pities everybody else. When Jesus said, \"Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests,- but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head,\"* he was not bemoaning his poverty. Rather, he was signifying that he was the owner of the cosmos,- one with Omnipresence; thus he could not remain caged in a small place as earthly creatures do. Jesus had no bank account; nor did he exhort people to dem- onstrate prosperity first, as some modern religious organizations do—teaching their members to pray to God or to go into the si- lence with both eyes fixed on the granting of material desires. Jesus warned: \"Bread, the men of the world (matter-loving, shortsighted people) seek after; but seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things (prosperity, wisdom, happiness, riches) shall be added unto you\"—without your having to pray for them. The person who finds God owns the cosmos; and owning the cosmos he owns everything in it. Jesus had full realization of his oneness with the Father. That is why he could do many things that deluded mortals could not do. He raised the dead. He rebuilt his mutilated body. Compare a millionaire on his deathbed, forced away from his home and fortune without a penny, with Jesus Christ after death, who owned the Kingdom of Omnipresence. So, do not desire to be a millionaire; it is a waste of time to delude yourself with material desires. Rather wish and strive to be a Christ.

During your sojourn on earth, remember that you are only a movie actor. You may be called upon to enact any part, trag- edy or comedy,- you must play it well, and as you watch your tragic portrayals say: \"That was a fine, sad picture and I played my part well.\" Likewise, if you can say: \"Lord, I played the parts of birth and death well; I played the sad and joyous parts well, and my roles brought me great satisfaction and joy,- and, Lord, I was highly entertained with Your marvelous earthly movies, but I did not create any new desires to play new parts,\" then perhaps He will say: \"All right, you need not stay in the movie colony of the earth any longer.

Joy that is always the same may cause boredom, but Joy of God, which is ever new and continuous, will entertain you forever. Such Joy can be found only in deep meditation. Deluded immortals travel through many corridors of in- carnations—rising, falling, hoping, rejoicing, weeping. Nature keeps excitement-loving individuals entertained with variety, a mixture of sorrow and pleasure. Christlike souls are busy with the ever new, continuous, changeless Joy in everything—in God. Christ, one with God's omnipresent consciousness, is blow- ing with the wind, laughing in the brooks, twinkling in the stars, blushing in the sunset, and gently smiling in the blossoms with his fragrant presence. Christ is dancing on the sea of human emo- tions and thoughts. Christ is joy in all hearts and in all things. Those who have their eyes of wisdom closed perceive the dark qualities of suffering, death, disease, sorrow, and fleeting pleasure.

Whatever your branch of study, once you have put your mind on a particular subject, your thought can go on indefinitely in that direction. There is no end to the wisdom or information you can draw upon. Do you know that each one of you is interpreting what I am saying in a slightly different way? Each person experiences a mental process that differs from everyone else's. What is that mental process? Suppose someone pinches you. First you feel a physical sensation. From the stimuli of the sensation comes perception. Then, having perceived the sensation, your mind forms the thought, \"I have been pinched.\" That is conception. The process from sensation to perception to conception is an individualized response. Because the inner being and working of each person is unique, the sum total of his reactions to any given experience will be different from that of any other person's. This totality of what you are inside—your thoughts, feelings, responses, moti- vations—determines the quality of your magnetism, your power of attraction. Magnetism is the greatest force through which you can draw unto yourself friends and goodwill. We all like to be no- ticed; no one wants to feel ignored or forgotten. Even a child will deliberately act up to get attention. We also like to be thought well of; we want others to like us. But how many of us give to others the understanding and consideration we think we merit from them? We express the greatest compassion and forgive- ness toward our own weaknesses, while all too readily we crit- icize and condemn others for their faults. Can we as easily stand up before others and tell all our own faults since child- hood? No. But unless we learn to behave, we can't show others how to behave, and have no right to be intolerant of their short- 247"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"248 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION comings. The world is full of those who want to reform others, but not themselves. Unless we develop a constructive critical es- timate of ourselves, we will go on year after year unchanged. What is important is self-reform: for if we ourselves have re- formed, we shall reform thousands by our example. Example does speak louder than words. Begin by Being Kind to All How to become a king of hearts, loved by all? Become more saintly, so that like a true king you sit on the throne of love in the hearts of others. Begin by being kind to all. Unkindness is a spiritual disease. If you indulge in unkind acts and feelings, you make yourself miserable and damage your nervous sys- tem. When you see others behaving unkindly, it should give you greater determination to be kind. I practice this all the time. No matter how hurtfully others behave, they cannot make me re- act with meanness. The more unkindness people show to me, the more understanding I give to them. Sometimes, in order to stress an important lesson, I speak very strongly to those who have come to me for training. But I am never angry or unkind. Those who receive such discipline have seen that at the height of the scolding, when I seem to be most displeased, I can shut off fiery speech and use the gentlest of words. That self-control has tremendous power. Never allow your voice to be harsh out of anger or vengefulness. Like a flower, shed petals of kindness when you are aggravated by others or attacked by the evil in them. By self-control and right behavior you will ultimately realize that you are a part of the Eternal Good; you do not be- long anymore to the wrong ways of this world. The Inner Self Must Be Cultivated To be truly attractive, you must be attractive mentally and spiritually as well as physically. The present generation links attractiveness to the style shops and beauty parlors. But beauty has to be more than external. You can be looking at the most handsome man and the most beautiful woman in the world; yet right beneath their pleasing appearance you may discover much hidden ugliness. They are like the magnificent sar- cophagi from the tombs of ancient Egypt: How beautiful, how"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"INCREASING YOUR MAGNETISM 249 perfect the carved images look! But when you lift the cover, you find nothing beautiful in the dead form within. If the spir- itual qualities of our true soul-nature are dead, an attractive physical body is little more than a casket to hold the inner withered consciousness. It is fortunate, of course, that some physical attractiveness covers the ugliness of our bones, sinews, and internal organs. But why be so preoccupied year after year in adorning only the outer form? America seems very much a place where people concentrate on keeping up their outer image in order to hide their age. I have seen many people looking forty who were really sixty. And that is good. Why shouldn't you keep the body fit and attractive? You can make your body whatever you want it to be. Why be careless and let it \"go to pot,\" as they say? Watch your weight. If your form is disproportionate, it is most likely be- cause of laziness or overeating. Some people diet or fast one day, and then more than make up for it the next day. Get plenty of exercise and leam to be more careful about what you eat. But such are the infinite potentials of life—so much to learn and to do—that if you are primarily intent on enhancing your physical being, you won't have time to do anything to im- prove yourself inwardly. Beautifying oneself before the mir- ror—painting the face, coloring the hair—may help one to be noticed in the business or social world, and there is nothing wrong with that; but it will not improve the inner personality, the inner self. My point is that you have to give some time to the inner self also. In the East, the concentration is mostly upon inner attrac- tiveness; and in the West, more emphasis is placed on physical attractiveness. What is necessary is a combination of both. I would rather be mentally attractive than physically attrac- tive. But if I can be both, that is even better. We must learn to simplify the externals of our life and take time to beautify our inner self. That is the way to develop true magnetism. You might be quite conscious of someone's homeliness, at first meeting, and then realize that his inner personality is very attractive and magnetic. Socrates was like that. So was Lincoln. They had a magnetism born of beautiful inner qualities that drew others to them. When you have that kind of divine attrac-"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"250 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION tiveness, the physical features are of less importance. Your physical appearance, especially the eyes, shows more or less what you were like in previous lives, so deeply does the inner being impinge on the outer form. The eyes are one's most significant physical feature. You should learn to make your eyes beautiful. How? The eyes clearly reflect what you are within. So there is but one method that can beautify the life and expression in the eyes: the inner cultivation of beauti- ful thoughts and feelings. Some eyes are very cruel; others are mean, or selfish. No matter how sweet such a person's words or actions are, you can see what he is really like through the expression of the eyes. He cannot hide himself behind those open windows. So think wholesome thoughts, constructive thoughts. As a being priv- ileged to be made in God's image, you have no right to disfig- ure your inner life. Develop peaceful eyes, calm eyes, strong eyes, divinely lov- ing eyes, by cultivating these qualities within. By this method alone you can develop an inner attractiveness that completely transcends the limitations of physical appearance. Turn Your Trials Into Triumphs It is never too late to improve oneself. Watch your thoughts, feelings, and actions, and guide them rightly. At the end of each day, analyze yourself: How have you lived this day? To be really living is to strive constantly to improve oneself; physically, men- tally, morally, spiritually. A person who has not become sta- tionary, but continues to change for the better—day after day, year after year—develops magnetism. Use every trial that comes to you as an opportunity to im- prove yourself. When you are passing through the difficulties and tests of life, you usually become rebellious: \"Why should this happen to me?\" Instead, you should think of every trial as a pickax with which to dig into the soil of your consciousness and release the fountain of spiritual strength that lies within. Each test should bring out the hidden power that is within you as a child of God, made in His image. Our tests are not meant to destroy us. Only those who are cowards, and who don't ac- knowledge the all-perfect image of God within, become rebel-"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"INCREASING YOUR MAGNETISM 251 lious and surrender to their trials as though those tests were unconquerable destructive forces. It is an injustice to your po- tential as a human being to so regard your tests. The right atti- tude is to use each trial as a stimulus to strengthen your inner self. If the wrestler doesn't fight with stronger opponents, he will not become stronger himself. So when you face all your dif- ficulties bravely, with spiritual strength, you become even stronger and more powerful. By conquering when you are tested, you will revive the forgotten image of God within you, and be- come consciously one with the Father again. So we must re- member to use our God-given strength to overcome our trials, and thereby strengthen our inner lives. That divine inner strength is the source of our magnetism. The Power of Good Company and Deep Attention Another help toward developing your magnetism is deep at- tention: by this power you can draw on others' magnetism. Learn to put your full attention on everything you do. Whenever you are with someone, be a good listener. By attentiveness, tune in with people who have those attractive qualities you wish to de- velop. If you want strength, mix with those who are strong. If you want to develop your business sense, be with businessmen. If you want to develop all-powerful divine magnetism, mix with those who love God. You will develop much faster this way than if you merely read books on these subjects. Saints and others who have accomplished much in this world have had great magnetism. By thinking deeply of great men you can receive their vibrations. Ordinarily, we receive knowledge through the senses of sight and hearing: by reading books or listening to discourses. But greater than these is di- rect contact with a man of wisdom. You gain knowledge much quicker through such association. Even if that great soul lives ten thousand miles away from you, if you think of him and con- centrate on him with deep attention, you can receive his vi- brations. You will begin to get something that is beyond mere words: you can receive another's magnetism through the men- tal channel of thought. Krishna, Buddha, Jesus—these great ones manifested the highest quality of magnetism. Every time I see an image of one"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"252 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION of the great ones, or think of them, I get their vibrations. When I contact Jesus I feel the consciousness of God as the Father. When I think of Ramprasad, * I feel the vibration of God as the Mother. This attunement with divine ones does not come about merely by thinking of them for a few moments. It is only by meditating day after day on a great saint that you will begin to receive the spiritual vibrations of that saint. There is also great value in visiting places where saints have lived. Assisi, the abode of St. Francis,- Bodh Gaya, where Bud- dha attained enlightenment; Jerusalem, where Jesus preached— such places are forever permeated with the vibrations left there by the divine souls who walked those grounds. Their vibrations will remain until this earth is dissolved. Where souls have com- muned with God, there you will find greater communion and re- sponse from God. Often such pilgrimages completely change one's life for the better. Direct association with a God-realized man of wisdom may be through personal contact or deep meditation. The impor- tant point is to attune your consciousness with his. When you are in tune with a great soul who loves God, that attunement gradually changes your life in a most wonderful way. Your will does not become enslaved; it becomes expanded. This is the dif- ference between attunement to an ego-centered person and be- ing in tune with a true guru. The magnetism of a God-realized soul will put you in tune with the magnetism of God. God Is the Supreme Magnetic Force Jesus said: \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God...and all things will be added unto you.\" God is the Supreme Power behind all powers; the Supreme Love behind all loves; the Supreme Artist behind all art. When you put your mind on God, the Supreme Magnetic Force, you surcharge yourself with divine magnetism; and you can attract unto yourself all things. If you think of God in deepest meditation, if you love Him with all your heart, and feel completely at peace in His presence, without wishing for anything else, the divine magnetism of God will attract unto you * A Bengali saint, Ramprasad (1718-1775) composed many songs in praise of Kali, one of the aspects of the Divine Mother."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"INCREASING YOUR MAGNETISM 253 everything you ever dreamed about, and much more. In every de- partment of my life I have demonstrated this truth: If you love God for His own Self, not because of what He can give you; and if you are completely attracted by His divine magnetism, that power from Him goes out of your own heart and mind, and by your slightest little wish, you will attract unto yourself the ful- fillment of that desire. If you have unconditional love for God, He drops thoughts in others' brains, and they become instru- ments to fulfill even your unspoken desires. So divine magnetism, by which you can attract anything unto yourself, is the kind of attractiveness you want to develop. Always desire that which is good, that which is noble, that which is pure. Then, as a divine man, filled with the magne- tism of God, you can never fail to attract anything you want. Meditate deeply, and send forth the call of your soul to God: \"Lord, Thou must come into my body temple. Whether it is broken by disease, old age, or other imperfection doesn't matter. Whatever the condition of my temple, I know Thou wilt enter it as soon as Thou knowest I truly love Thee and I know that Thou dost love me.\" When this realization comes, the body that was so dear to you does not mean that much to you anymore—you want to give more importance to your inner life than to vain material pursuits. The divine man who loves God more than self finds that the attractiveness within himself is God; he then loses his attachment to the gross body: \"O Lord, whether my body walks the pathways of earth singing Thy name, or falls asleep in the ocean of death, I am ever with Thee. Life and death may sing their songs, but I am one with the Song of Eternity. I cannot die, for I am the Breath of Eternal Life.\" Now, please pray with me: \"Father, I have thrown off all negative thoughts. I was bound by the iron chains of material- ism, but Thy magnetic presence is changing me; I realize I am made in Thine image. I am a divine magnet.

Reincarnation is not compulsory unless you make it so. Life is a vast school. There is a lesson to be learned in everything. But just as naughty boys in school engage in mis- chief, try to distract the other children, pay no attention to the teacher, and then fail to graduate and have to take the same class again, so it is with most people. They are \"bad boys\" in the school of life, always getting into trouble because they don't listen to the teacher. Life is teaching you all the time,- you are a bad student if you don't pay attention. Think about that; it is the sum of what I want to tell you. \"Bad boys\" who fail their exams have to return again and again in shame to confront the same lessons. Good students, however, develop into wise men. Christ, Krishna, Buddha, and all the enlightened ones finished their training, graduated with honors, and went back to God. They don't have to come to this school of life anymore, unless of their own free will they return again as teachers, \"saviors,\" to help others. Reincarnation means that you did not finish your school- ing; you have yet to pass in all the grades of physical, mental, and spiritual unfoldment, which will earn for you a diploma of perfection and freedom.

Human beings start life programmed with set ten- dencies and unfulfilled desires from the past. Then, with their little remaining free will, they imitate each other's desires and actions. If they associate with businessmen they want to be like them,- if they are with artists, art becomes everything. God meant us to be practical in this world—He has given us hunger that has to be satisfied—but to go after only food and shelter, money and possessions, is to forget the true Source of happi- ness. Satisfy your needs, pursue your worthwhile goals in life, but give yourself to God first. Your schooling will then come under His wise and loving tutelage. He knows all your stored- up karma and what is best for you. Don't resist Him. Unfulfilled desires are the root cause of reincarnation. You don't have to be a king in order to have complete fulfillment. Nor do you end desires by giving up everything and becoming a poor man. You have your own self-created destiny with its lessons to be learned, and you must play well that part for which you were sent here. If everybody on the stage wants to be a king or queen, there will be no play. An actor with even a minor part can ruin the entire production by a poor perfor- mance. Every role is important; everyone should interact har- moniously for the success of the play. The Lord has been try- ing to make a good drama out of His creation, but I am afraid that most actors have bungled it. The ideal is to do your best, but be objective, nonattached. Pay attention to the studies life places before you. They con- tain the lessons you must learn. Don't play at random and cre- ate new desires, endless desires. The Hindu scriptures say that it takes about eight million incarnations (progressing upward on the scale of evolution) before one becomes a human being. And now, after gaining a human form, how can you waste so much time on things that are fruitless? Time is so precious. At long last, your soul has a vehicle capable of the full expres- sion of divinity, of manifesting \"the image of God\" in which you are made.

Once when talking to Amelita Galli-Curci, the famous op- eratic prima donna who had such an angelic voice, I asked her, \"Have you finished your desires?\" She replied, \"Of course.\" I continued about other things, and then suddenly asked her, \"What are your feelings about music?\" \"I love it,\" she said; \"I want to sing in heaven!\" \"Then you will have to come back to earth again,\" I re- plied. \"That desire is not finished.\" Then she understood. When I started on the path to God, my family tried to in- terest me in other things. An important position was offered to me, and I prayed to God for guidance. He said, \"What do you want with it? Go after supreme happiness first.\" My cousin [Prabhas Chandra Ghosh] got my job and also my wife-to-be. Through God's grace I was free! If You Keep Your Mind With God, You Will Be Free When desires come, be guided by wisdom, not by whim or stubbornness. If you can control your senses and keep your mind with God, you will be free. But if, on the last day, when the time comes to go to the Heavenly Father, the angels say, \"Do you like strawberry shortcake?\" and you answer, \"Oh, yum, yum!\" they will tell you, \"Then you have to go back to America.\" Or they may ask, \"Do you like curry?\" \"Yes, Lord!\" \"Then go back to India. You can't stay with the Father be- cause your earthly desires are not finished.\" The divine man enjoys everything, but is not bound by anything. He appreciates the use of the objects in God's cre- ation, but when he is through with them, he is through. Do not harbor traces of desires. Live in this world working only to fulfill God's will. Tell Him, \"I did not ask for this body; but You gave it to me, so I will look after it and see to its needs, and use it as an instrument to serve Your will on earth.\" When you are impersonal with the body in this way, you be- come personal with God.

Otherwise, God will have to send you here again and again until you outgrow your ignorance and realize your true Self. Become so conscious of God that you know He is the only Reality. The more you meditate, the more that thought will be paramount. Try as it may, the world will not be able to take that consciousness away from you. When I started my search for God, I shunned everything that took my mind from Him, as though it were poison to me. I even avoided too much contact with people who were not of like mind, because I did not want to be influenced by them. Milk will not float on water; it will mix, and become diluted. But when milk is churned into butter, the butter can float on water. Similarly, as a serious seeker, make firm your conscious- ness in God. Free yourself first. Then no one will be able to exert any wrong influence on you; you will change them. Otherwise, if your will is weak and somebody suggests some nice temptation to you, you will run after it. But when you are convinced that true happiness is within yourself in your relationship with God, then nobody can pull you away from that; others will instead follow your example. God is for all who will seek Him. Give your nights to Him. The days belong to the Devil, because he keeps us busy and embroiled in the relativities and delusion of this existence. But if you give your nights to God, and strive in the daytime to remember Him in the midst of your activities, you will be drunk with Him all the time. The divine man is always intox- icated with the Lord. Work doesn't take my consciousness away from Him,- it is the greatest pleasure. I have hardly even been sleeping these days. I feel the greatest joy, the greatest blessing of God I ever had. That is what I live for. To be with Him and to work out His wishes; on these two things my life revolves.

Renunciation of material duties to serve only God is all right, because it is to Him we owe our first allegiance; no duty could be performed without the power borrowed from Him. The Lord forgives whatever sins accrue from the nonper- formance of lesser duties by those who forsake all else for Him.* Renunciation means to put God first, whether one fol- lows the path of the world or the path of monasticism. My brother said to me, \"Money first; God later.\" He died before he had a chance to find God or to use his money. Re- member the words of Christ, \"But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness,- and all these things shall be added unto you.\"t When you find God, everything comes to you. When He takes hold of you, you can never fall. Your mis- takes will be righted; your errors will be transformed into wis- dom. That is what I have found. The Right Attitude Toward Suffering There are two kinds of seekers: those who are like the baby monkey and those who are like the kitten. The baby monkey clings to the mother,- but when she jumps, it may fall off. The little kitten is carried about by the mother cat, content wherever she places it. The kitten has complete trust in its mother. I am more like that; I give all responsibility to the Divine Mother. But to maintain that attitude takes great will. Under all circum- stances—health or sickness, riches or poverty, sunshine or gray clouds—your feeling must remain unruffled. Even when you are in the coal bin of suffering you don't wonder why the Mother placed you there. You have faith that She knows best. Some- times an apparent disaster turns into a blessing for you. * \"Forsaking all other dharmas (duties), remember Me alone,- I will free thee from all sins (accruing from nonperformance of those lesser duties)\" (Bha- gavad Gita XVIII:66). + Matthew 6:33 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"PREPARING FOR YOUR NEXT INCARNATION 259 When the Golden Lotus Temple went,* I at first thought it was a terrible catastrophe,- but it turned out otherwise, because it made me go on to found other temples and ashram centers. Gloom is but the shade of Divine Mother's hand out- stretched caressingly. Don't forget that. Sometimes, when the Mother is going to caress you, a shadow is caused by Her hand before it touches you. So when trouble comes, don't think that She is punishing you,- Her hand overshadowing you holds some blessing as it reaches out to bring you nearer to Her. Suffering is a good teacher to those who are quick and will- ing to learn from it. But it becomes a tyrant to those who re- sist and resent. Suffering can teach us almost everything. Its lessons urge us to develop discrimination, self-control, nonat- tachment, morality, and transcendent spiritual consciousness. For example, a stomachache tells us not to eat too much and to watch what we eat. The pain from loss of possessions or loved ones reminds us of the temporal nature of all things in this world of delusion. The consequences of wrong actions im- pel us to exercise discrimination. Why not learn through wis- dom? Then you won't subject yourself to unnecessary painful discipline from the hard taskmaster of suffering. Finding the Divine Love Behind Human Love There is suffering inherent even in the satisfaction de- rived from human love. Devoid of the quality of divine love, human affection is a blind alley that entangles and limits us. I realized this when my mother was taken away by death. How disillusioned millions of people have been who thought hu- man love was the only thing to live for. They were fooled, and thereby did themselves a great injustice. Where are all those they loved and lost? What is the lesson to be learned? It is to love the Love behind human love. Who is your father or mother but the Divine Father- Mother who has taken human form to love and care for you? * The first Self-Realization Fellowship Temple, dedicated in 1938 on the grounds of the SRF Hermitage in Encinitas, was on a bluff overlooking the Pa- cific Ocean. This temple was lost to the gradual erosion of the shoreline; it was later replaced by another SRF temple in Encinitas."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"260 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION Why doesn't someone else's father feel for you in the same way as your own? Because the Divine took a personal interest in you and planted that paternal feeling in a particular being to whom you were karmically attracted. God also became the mother to love you unconditionally; hers is a blind love unless it is imbued with divine consciousness. The father's love is more tempered with reason and law. The Bible teaches: \"Honor thy father and thy mother....\"* But it further commands: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might, \"t When I say father or mother these words have an absolutely different meaning for me now. I have realized the Father-Mother behind my parents, the Someone Else who was loving me through their parental love. If you remembered all the mothers and fathers you have had through incarnations, you would not know which ones to love as your own. You think of your present home as where you belong. But if you were to die and be born next door to your former parents they would not love you in the same way as they did before. Who loves you but God? It is He whom you must seek. I once had a vision in which I realized it was the Mother Divine who had taken the forms of my mothers in many lifetimes to love and guide me. Now in every woman I behold the motherly quality of the Divine Mother. Thus should we learn to see the Mother behind all mothers, the Father be- hind all fathers, and the Friend behind all friends. Friendship—The Purest Form of Love Friendship is the purest form of God's love because it is born of the heart's free choice and is not imposed upon us by familial instinct. Ideal friends never part; nothing can sever their fraternal relationship. I have never lost a true friend. Even though two to whom I gave sincere love became inimical, I am still a friend to them. To be a true, unconditional friend, your love must be anchored in God's love. Your life with God is the inspiration behind true divine friendship with all.

The guru-disciple relationship is the highest expression of friendship, for it is based on unconditional divine love and wisdom. It is the loftiest and most sacred of all relationships. Christ and his disciples were all one in spirit, as are my Mas- ter [Swami Sri Yukteswar] and I and those who are in tune with me, because of the common bond of God's divine love. Drink- ing His love together from the chalice of sincere hearts is the unifying sacrament of this relationship. In human friendship familiarity should be avoided, or after a little while friends may take advantage of each other. But in di- vine friendship there is ever-increasing respect; each one thinks only of the highest welfare of the other. That is the nature of the divine friendship between guru and disciple. One who par- takes of this relationship is on the way to wisdom and freedom. Whenever I speak to others, as in these services, one form appears before me: my Guru. His influence is paramount in my life. Even now, though he is no longer on this earth plane, he is always with me. Spiritual Ideals for a Fulfilling Marriage If you seek the One Friend behind all friends, true friend- ship can be established in all of your relationships—familial, fraternal, marital, and spiritual. Friendship is vital in a marital relationship. Sex alone will not bring a couple closer together; in fact it will all too soon throw them apart if the higher instinct of true love and friend- ship is not predominant. When sex is made the most important part of a marriage, the couple lose interest in one another when the initial blush of sensual gratification pales. Those who do not discriminate between true love and sense attraction are disil- lusioned again and again. People who want to marry should first have to learn to con- trol their emotions. Two people placed together in the arena of marriage without this training battle worse than opponents in a World War! Wars, at least, come to an end after a time,- but some marital partners engage in combat throughout life. You would think that in a civilized society people should know how to get along, but few have learned this art. A marriage should"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"262 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION be nurtured on high ideals and the wine of God's inspiration,- then it will be a happy and mutually beneficial union. Once in Boston I was invited to speak at the silver wed- ding anniversary celebration of a supposedly ideally happy cou- ple. The moment I entered their home I felt something was wrong. I asked two trusted students to quietly observe the cou- ple throughout the evening. They told me that when the hus- band and wife came before others they smiled and addressed each other sweetly, \"Yes, my dear,\" \"Of course, my dear\"; but when they thought they were alone in the kitchen or pantry, they fought like anything. So I talked with them: \"Why do you behave like this? I feel great inharmony in this home. There is a lot of iron in this silver wedding.\" At first they were offended. But I pursued the matter. \"What do you gain by fighting all the time?\" I gave them a good talking to. They approached me later and asked my forgiveness. I told them, \"You stay together just because of your reputation as an ideal couple, but I want you to truly live that way, for your own happiness.\" One's ideals should be lived in behavior, thought, and speech. If two people come together and their moods are wrong, they become insincere with each other. When deception creeps in, the marriage is \"on the rocks.\" Why this hypocrisy? Such mistakes should be prevented from the very beginning. Balancing Feminine and Masculine Qualities It seems there has always been a rivalry between man and woman. But they are equals; neither one is superior. Be proud of what you are in this life. You are a soul that has been in both male and female bodies in different past incarnations. If you are a woman now and you envy men, you will have to reincar- nate as a man. And take heed: if you are a man now and feel superior to women, you may have to be born as a woman. Man argues that woman is emotional and cannot reason,- and woman complains that man cannot feel. Both are incorrect. Woman can reason, but feeling is uppermost in her nature; and man can feel, but in him reason is predominant. The ideal is to balance reason and feeling in one's nature. Those who are too womanish do not find soul freedom, and neither do those"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"PREPARING FOR YOUR NEXT INCARNATION 263 who are too mannish. Each sex should strive toward a balance by learning from one another through friendship and under- standing. In the great saints we see combined the ideal mas- culine and feminine qualities. Jesus was like that; so were all the masters. When you have attained that perfect reason-feeling equilibrium, you will have learned one of the major lessons for which you were sent here. Life is meant for God-realization. Don't live in a one-sided materialistic way. Have self-control, master all of your senses, act with wisdom, conquer life, and find freedom. The average life span is seventy years of schooling. When death comes you will not have finished your education and will have to come back to this school again, unless you have found God, and ac- quired all His wisdom, and expressed all His blessings in your life. Start in earnest on this path of learning. From the begin- ning saturate yourself with God. Love Him more than His gifts. He has everything except your love. He created us, that perchance we would use His gift of free will to seek Him. The only reason we are here is to find God and go back to Him. Love God first and make your body a temple of God. Do every- thing with the thought of Him. Go after the Supreme Happi- ness, and share Him with others. Perfect your love in God's love, and include all humanity in your love. If you have children, train them in the right ideals to help bring them back to God. Every one of you has a tremendous work to do: Convert others to God by your spiritual example. To help others find God is the highest gift you can give. So remember, God first! Start today, not tomorrow. \"If thy hand offend thee, cut it off.\"* You need will power and right guidance to succeed. Exercise your will guided by your guru's wisdom, and you will overcome all impediments in your path.

Finish your lessons for good, that you may not be sent here again and again against your will. Free yourself from this school. Conquer all. Live for God, work for Him, think and will for Him. Body, mind, soul, will, senses—everything must be with God. Then you will be free and ready for the journey Home. And you won't have to come back to the troubles and difficulties and wars of this world. When your schooling is done, and the end comes, and people are crying at your passing, you can rejoice and say, \"Beloved One, Master Death is opening for me the gate to freedom. I have had enough schooling now. I shall be a pillar in Thy temple, and shall go no more out, * unless You will me to do so. If You wish it, I will come again and again to help free others.\" My incarnation is voluntary. I have finished my schooling, but I don't want to go back to God until others have been freed. As long as there will be a brother weeping by the wayside I shall come to wipe away his tears and take him with me to God. Many people hurt and destroy themselves through igno- rance and wrong desires. I have come to help them, to teach them and take them with me to that Infinite Shore from which there is no compulsory returning. It is wonderful to learn all of life's lessons and then teach others how to finish theirs. Then, when the last day comes, there is no fear or regret. As the dying divine youth said, \"Don't cry for me, ye who are left on this desolate shore, still to mourn and deplore; it is I who pity you. My Beloved comes in the dazzling chariot of death to take me away to the Kingdom of Deathlessness, to the Palace of Bliss-Dreams.

As such, man is meant to use that power to improve him- self and to get the most out of life. Superior intelligence was not given to the human being merely to be used to eat break- fast, lunch, and dinner,- marry and beget children. It was given that man might understand the meaning of life and find soul freedom. Beyond all the books that are written, it is God's Book of Nature that remains the most difficult to understand. But the whole of creation, including the chapter of human existence, can be read when God becomes your teacher. India has shown the way to divine communion with Him through the right methods of meditation. God-contact becomes possible when by meditation one has attained mastery over the restlessness of the mind. One cannot meditate with uncontrolled thoughts running in every direction. A mind that does not belong to you, a mind that is wholly occupied by the senses, can neither be offered to God nor received by Him. Wherever your heart is, there will your mind be also. If you can control your feelings and sensations, then you can put your mind on God. * Having God, you shall have everything else. That is why Jesus said, \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and * The path of Kriya Yoga as taught in Paramahansa Yogananda's Yogoda Satsanga Society Lessons includes scientific techniques of interiorizing the conscious- ness and freeing the mind from sensory distractions, so that one is able to be- come wholly absorbed in divine inner communion. 265"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"266 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION all these things shall be added unto you.\"* As you commune with God through meditation, you will find yourself resurrected in His Being. His spirit alone can right all evils in the world and in oneself. But man must make the effort to realize that Divine Consciousness and to manifest the Lord's infinite goodness within himself. The earnestly striv- ing devotee knows that virtue is more charming than vice; and that acting under the influence of good habits is more pleasant than acting under the deceptively benign influence of bad hab- its. Good habits bring joy ; bad habits bring sorrow. Habits of yielding to passions result in suffering. Habits of yielding to the mechanical routine of worldly life beget monotony, indif- ference, vexation, worry, fear, disgust, disillusionment. Habits of attending church and sacred lectures produce fitful inspiration and momentary desire for God. But habits of devotional meditation and concentration produce realization. Meditation may seem to be one of the most difficult habits to form, for the beginner is subject to many delusive thoughts about getting speedy results. The results of meditation come slow, but sure. Many novices desire some form of spiritual \"en- tertainment.\" Others expect their efforts to be rewarded right away with the manifestation of heavenly lights, saints, and deities; but this expectation is premature. Real visions come by prolonged and steady spiritual advancement. Premature ex- periences of phenomena are generally hallucinations. To avoid the intrusion of such false imagery from the subconscious mind, it is helpful during meditation to keep the eyes half-open and fixed firmly at the point between the eyebrows—the seat of concentration and superconscious perception. Above all, do not love or desire visions more than God.

Ap- ply this law to your material, mental, moral, and spiritual life and you will find it a complete, comprehensive definition of success. People think of success in different ways, depending on their aim in life. You even hear of it in connection with steal- ing: \"He was a successful thief\"! This shows that not all kinds of success are desirable. Our success must not hurt others. An- other qualification of success is that we not only bring harmo- nious and beneficial results to ourselves, but also share those benefits with others. Suppose a wife engages in the spiritual practice of prolonged periods of silence, and at such times re- fuses to talk even to her husband and children. Though she may succeed in keeping silent, and thereby gain some degree of per- sonal inner peace, her behavior is selfish and detrimental to her family's happiness. She is not truly successful unless the ac- complishment of her good intention also benefits those to whom she has a responsibility. Likewise, the attainment of material success means more than that we are individually entitled to enjoy our prosperity,- it means that we are morally obligated to help others to cre- ate a better life as well. Anyone who has the brains can make money. But if he has love in his heart, he will never be able to use that money selfishly; he will always share with others. Money becomes a curse to the miserly, but to those who have heart it is a blessing.

Rather, he provides work and a livelihood for many. If Henry Ford makes money by giving others pros- perity too, he is successful in the right way. He has greatly helped the masses; American civilization owes much to him. Even the greatest of saints are not fully redeemed until they have shared their success, their ultimate experiences of God-realization, by helping others toward divine realization. This is why those who have that attainment are dedicated to giving understanding to those who don't understand. Thus, if you find joy and pleasure in the culture of your mind to achieve true success, not only do you insure your own happiness, but that of others as well. A Different Standard of Success in East and West There is a different standard of success in the East and in the West. But the East is fast imitating the worst of what it sees in movies from the West. The storybook ideal of happiness that the movies depict brings some solace to your heart; but when you look at real life, you see that success is not so simple. Life can often be cruel. You have to fight even to live. Think of all you have to do just to feed the body and keep it strong and free from disease. Even if you succeed, that success is only tempo- rary, because eventually the body has to be dumped into the earth again. To have a successful existence you have to fight so many forces, within and without, that would rob you of worthwhile achievement. The West concentrates on the partial or temporary success that belongs to this present life. The East concentrates on the complete success that belongs to eternity. Those who have at- tained eternal success we call siddhas, * which means those who have been judged successful by the Master of the Universe. Such a one is completely happy in body, mind, and spirit. He may have few or no possessions, yet he has great wealth—men- tal contentment, and spiritual understanding of the correlation of the soul and Spirit, and of the body and its essential relation- * Sanskrit, \"one who is successful\"; i.e., one who has attained Self-realization, union with God."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"270 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION ship with the Cosmic Life. That is true success. In the East, they nurture in the child's mind the desire for this kind of suc- cess. In the West, you give your child a little bank and teach him to look to money for fulfillment. To strive for sufficient mate- rial means is good, but children should also be taught the value of success that will never fade. Soul wealth lasts forever in the bank of eternity, and you can draw happiness from it any time. But even spiritual success can be one-sided, if you have ma- terial responsibilities and are unable to meet them. Only a great yogi who has freed himself from the laws of nature can com- pletely ignore all material concerns. In the East, the doctrine of spiritual happiness was nurtured and material sufficiency was more or less neglected. In the West, you have some physical comforts, but very little mental happiness. What is needed is balance between the two. If you only go after one thing in life, no matter what it is, you will become one-sided. For example, an artist may concentrate on his art to the exclusion of other important considerations. The result of this imbalance is that he becomes nervous and unhappy. But art and God together are a marvelous combination! Business and God, science and God, service and God—such combinations make for all-round suc- cess and happiness. Wealth on the one hand, and disease and trouble on the other, have numerous aspects. The beauty of the West is your cleanliness. Here the mosquitoes and bedbugs haven't much chance to survive, whereas in the East they are plentiful. But don't congratulate yourselves too much about that; for here you have worse things—such as unpaid bills and financial wor- ries from living on the installment plan—that bite your peace. There Is More to Life Than Mere Existence God didn't create this earth as a place for us to just eat, sleep, and die; but to find out His purpose. A few wise ones have beheld the divine schema, but so many others are blind and don't see it. The earth becomes a torture chamber to those who live in ignorance of God's plan. But when you use life's experi- ences as your teacher, and learn from them the true nature of the world and your part in it, those experiences become valu- able guides to eternal fulfillment and happiness."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"FOCUSING THE POWER OF ATTENTION FOR SUCCESS 271 The Lord has made delusion so strong! We are living in a bed- lam. You think money means happiness, but when you get it you find you are still not happy. You may have money and lose your health; or have good health and lose your money,- or you may have money and health, and lots of troubles with people. You do good to others, and they give you hatred in return. Without God, nothing in this world will satisfy you. And it is significant that God tries to tempt us away from Him with material lures; He wants to know whether we want the Giver, or only His gifts. If God had wanted us to live only in worldly consciousness, we would be wholly content with the things of the world, with following the ways of the world. Have you ever watched a flock of sheep? One jumps and all the others jump after him. Most peo- ple are like that. Somebody starts a fad or sets a pattern of ac- tion, and everybody else follows. Through the ages it has been like that. Each nation has its own customs,- and we can't say they are all perfect. But who is to say whether a particular kind of life or custom is ridiculous? One way to judge is to remember that, in the beginning, all customs had a reason behind them. If we find that reason still applicable, the custom has a useful pur- pose,- but it is foolish to follow custom blindly. We have to find out what is truth and what gives real happiness, and follow that. Life Should Be Simplified If you analyzed objectively the idiosyncrasies of human be- havior, you would see how humorous some of our habits and customs are. Here in America you follow so many rules! You dress just so: dinner jackets for dining, evening jackets for go- ing out, sport jackets for leisure—I even saw an advertisement for smoking jackets! And wives wonder why men like to get out into the country for a holiday where they don't have to wear socks and neckties. Once in a while it is good to get away from conformity to a monotonous schedule. To be methodical and efficient is commendable, but to become overly organized is a detriment to happiness. In India, homes are simple, dress is simple. Here, life is so complicated that happiness flies away while you are trying to do things in a certain way. Why complicate life by insisting that the table must be just so, the house must be just so? When we"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"272 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION invite people to our homes in India, everyone dances with joy. They look forward to it. In America, you invite guests and then spend frantic hours in preparation to be sure everything is ex- actly right. By the time your guests come, you can hardly wait for them to depart! Living should be simple,- dress should be simple; eating should be simple. I used to think it was not economical to eat in a restaurant, but once in a while it is. You can't afford to spend so much time in the kitchen that you haven't time for other more important things. When I was traveling and teach- ing, I used to simplify my diet, and just kept a bottle of milk and some lettuce and cheese on the windowsill. It was all so easy! Heaven Is Within, Not in Things Our training in the ashram in India was severe. We learned to curb our desires, and not to cater to our likes and dislikes, nor to have preferences. We were grateful for everything that came to us. With all that you have here, many of you are just as mis- erable with your possessions as you would be without them. Your wants are endless. In the morning, after the husband shaves and dresses, the first thing he wants is breakfast. At the table, he wishes his wife had fixed something different, and she wishes she had better dishes and silverware. Day after day, they go on wanting this and that, until nothing satisfies them—not even each other, nor their children! They are not happy at all. And because they are discontented, they turn on those closest to them. The wife nags the husband, the husband shouts at the chil- dren, and the children rebel and get into trouble with wrong friends. The thing is this: it is not wrong to have possessions, but it is wrong to be possessed by possessions. You must be free from attachment.

It seems so wonderful when you buy something new. But after a while the newness wears off and you have no time for it, or you forget about it and want something else. But the bills don't forget you!

Save more than you spend on unnecessary \"necessities.\" And always include some- one else in your happiness. When you do for others, you your- self will never be left wanting.

This is not a boast; I have seen that force working in my life. Whether I am floating on the surface of life or drowned in the depths of the sea, I know that I am with God and nothing can touch me.

Your Success Is What You Have Attained Within When you see the masses who have no real happiness or success, don't think that life is meant to be this way. You can make of yourself whatever you want to be. It is what you have attained within that determines your success. If you have noth- ing within, you have no happiness.

This is why moral success—freedom from the dictates of wrong habits and impulses—gives more happiness than mate- rial success. In moral success there is a psychological happiness that cannot be taken away by any physical condition. You can spend all your time making money, but it won't produce the lasting comfort and security you are looking for. In fact, it will bring more misery, because peace and happiness are in the mind, not in things. If you do not also devote time to the dis- cipline of your mind, no amount of material prosperity will sat- isfy you. This discipline is not a process of torture, but the training of the consciousness to adopt those thoughts and ac- tions that lead to happiness.

When I was young, I used to feel very impa- tient when someone told an untruth about me; but then I found it is much better to have the satisfaction of my conscience than the approbation of people. Conscience is intuitive reasoning, re- porting the truth about yourself and your motives. When your conscience is clear, when you know you are doing right, you are not afraid of anything. A clear conscience mirrors a certificate of merit from God. Be immaculate before the tribunal of your con- science and you shall be happy and have the blessing of God. If you don't make money, it is because you don't really concentrate on it; similarly, if you aren't happy, it is because you don't concentrate on being happy. The mule that carries a bag of gold on its back doesn't know the value of that load. Likewise, man is so absorbed in toting the burden of life, hoping for some happiness at the end of the trail, that he does not realize he car- ries within him the supreme and everlasting bliss of the soul. Be- cause he looks for happiness in \"things,\" he doesn't know he al- ready possesses a wealth of happiness within himself. Put Your Duties in Proper Perspective The teaching of Yoga does not advise you to fly away from your duties in the world.

Certainly that effort is commend- able. But it is much greater to be able to be in the world but not of it—to perform your true duties for the benefit of others while keeping your mind on God. \"By forsaking work no one reaches to perfection....O Arjuna, remaining immersed in yoga, perform all actions, forsaking attachment (to their fruits).\"* You must think of greater and lesser duties in proper per- spective. And don't let one duty contradict another. In the San- skrit scriptures there is a divine law, one of the most beautiful laws ever given to the world: \"If one duty contradicts another duty, it is not a true duty.\" If you seek financial success at the cost of health, you are not fulfilling your duty to the body. If you are so crazy about religion that you neglect your material re- sponsibilities, you are not balanced; you have allowed one duty to contradict your obligations to your body and family. If you lose sight of your duty toward God because you give all your attention to fussing about your family, that is not duty. Many ask, \"Shall we first acquire material success to ful- fill our worldly obligations, and then seek God? Or should we have God first and then go after success?\" By all means, God first. Never begin or end your day without communion with Him in deep meditation. We should remember that we could not perform any duties without the power borrowed from God. So it is to Him we owe our first allegiance. If you do your other duties but forget God, He doesn't like that at all. The ideal is to perform all duties with the sole desire to please God. To speak of seeking God and material fulfillment together sounds good; but unless you meditate deeply and regularly so that you anchor your consciousness in God first, the world will claim all your attention and you will have no time for Him. Without the consciousness that God is with you, your ma- terial duties usually turn into methods of torture. But if you have God with you all the time, and do your duties with the consciousness of God, you can be the happiest person. \"Their thoughts fully on Me, their beings surrendered to Me, enlight- * Bhagavad Gita 111:4 and 11:48."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"276 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION ening one another, proclaiming Me always, My devotees are contented and joyful.\"* If I had not had the training of my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar, which gave me that divine con- sciousness, I would have lost heart long ago, trying to help peo- ple and to build this work, and sometimes getting slaps instead of cooperation. I used to argue with Guruji that organizations are hornets' nests. Everyone expects you to please him. But I have found that if God comes first, spiritual organization is a hive and God is the honey that nurtures others with divine love and peace. If you rule others with the attitude, \"I am king,\" they will soon dethrone you. But if you guide others with sincere love, you can be a king of hearts. Of course, your love is re- flected more in true hearts; and when you love all impartially, you can recognize those who respond to that love. Jesus al- luded to this, when he upheld the devotion of the woman who anointed his head with costly ointment, t and the \"good part\" that Mary had chosen as she sat absorbed at his feet instead of helping her sister Martha with serving the other guests.* Divine Love Is Unsurpassable If you could but realize the romance that some devotees have with God! No other experiences can equal that joy. I knew a saint who was so engrossed in God, his face was aglow with the Divine. I asked him about his family life. He said, \"That is past and gone. I know no other life now than that which I have in God.\" I told him about my father and how much he had done for me. He said, \"You are ungrateful; you have forgotten that the Heavenly Father gave you your good earthly father. When I felt the call of God I reasoned, 'Suppose I died; who then would look after my family? The One who has given me life will look after them.' I knew that He would.\" And God did help him because he sincerely gave his life to God alone. § \"He who watcheth Me always, him do I watch; he never * Bhagavad Gita X:9. t Matthew 26:7-13 (Bible). t Luke 10:39^2 (Bible). § To the devotee who has freed his soul from all earthly desires and attach- ments, and is anchored in supreme love for God, the Lord says: \"Forsaking all"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"FOCUSING THE POWER OF ATTENTION FOR SUCCESS 277 loses sight of Me, nor do I lose sight of him.\"* In every nook of nature, hidden in the flowers and peeking through the sparkling window of the moon, my Beloved plays hide-and-seek with me. He watches me always through the screen of nature, the veil of delusion. Never ignore the Lover behind all lovers. Let not your heart beat with the emotion of the world, but with the thrill of divine love. That love is unsurpassable. The moment divine love pos- sesses your heart, your entire body becomes blissfully still: \"When the Master of the Universe came into my body temple, my heart forgot to beat, and all the cells of my body forgot their duties. They were transfixed, listening to the voice of Life Immortal—the Lover of all life, the Life of all lives. My heart, my brain, all the cells of my being were electrified, immortal- ized with His Presence.\" Such is the love of the Lord. The sorrow produced by hatred and war proves that spiri- tuality and kindness are superior forces. Hate is destructive,- love is the greatest constructive force. So, dear friends, from the stu- pidity of hatred and the madness of war, learn to love God. His love bestows an all-fulfilling success that nothing else can give. Love alone will bring fulfillment to the world. If all nations loved each other, and were anxious to help each other—not by force and wrong methods, but by love and kindness—there would come true and lasting worldwide success. Think of the billions spent on killing one another in war! Shame on humanity! Where will it all end but in suffering and destruction? The only way to bring this misery to an end is by love. As long as one nation builds bigger weapons for defense, other nations will try to find even better methods to defend themselves, and people will live in constant terror. Why don't all nations cultivate love and understanding instead of hatred and war? A universal religion of love is the real answer. Love makes other dharmas (duties), remember Me alone; I will free thee from all sins (ac- cruing from nonperformance of those lesser duties)\" (Bhagavad Gita XVIII:66). * Bhagavad Gita VI:30, as frequently paraphrased by Paramahansaji, who has given this literal translation: \"He who perceives Me everywhere and beholds everything in Me never loses sight of Me, nor do I ever lose sight of him.\""},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"278 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION you victorious; it makes you a conqueror.

You become so engrossed in material duties, you say you have no time for God. But suppose God says He has no time to beat in your heart, to think in your brain. Where will you be? He is the Love behind all loves. He is the Reason behind all reason. He is the Will behind all wills, the Success behind all success, the Power behind all powers,- the blood in your veins,- the breath behind your words. If he takes His power away, my voice will be silent and I shall speak no more. If His power doesn't express through our hearts and brains, we will he dumb forever. So re- member, your most important duty in life is your duty to God. The Practicality of Seeking God First All scriptures teach: \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God.\"* But see how people separate from their daily lives the spiri- tual doctrines they read or hear about in church. When you practice and apply principles of truth, you will realize the practicality of all spiritual, mental, and physical laws. When you read scriptures superficially, you don't get anything from them. But if you read truth with concentration, and really be- lieve what you read, those truths will work for you. You may want to believe; you may even think you believe; but if you really believe, the result will be instantaneous. There are various degrees of belief. Some people don't be- lieve at all. Some want to believe, others believe a little bit, and some believe until their belief is tested. We are so certain of our convictions, until they are contradicted; then we become confused and insecure. Faith is intuitive conviction, a knowing from the soul, that cannot be shaken even by contradictions. The practical purpose behind the scriptural injunction to seek God first is that once you have found Him, you can use His power to acquire the things your common sense tells you are right for you to have. Have faith in this law.

Nurture the thought: I must find God. Let that thought pre- dominate throughout the day, especially in the gaps of time be- tween your other duties. Transfer your attention to the more important concerns in life. Too much time is wasted in super- ficial interests. When students are with me, I always turn their attention toward God. They may say, \"The ocean is lovely,\" or \"The grounds are beautiful.\"* I say to them, \"Remain quiet. Don't feel you have to talk all the time. Go within and you will see the Loveliness behind all beauty.\" Most people are like butterflies, flitting aimlessly. They never seem to really get anywhere or to stop for more than a moment before they are attracted by some new diversion. The bee works and prepares for hard times. But the butterfly lives only for today. When winter comes, the butterfly is gone, while the bee has stored-up food to live on. We must learn to gather and store the honey of God's peace and power. Restless butterfly types are concentrated on movies and use- less activities. If you have God first, it is all right to go to movies once in a while, but mostly they are a waste of time. In the early stages on the spiritual path, you must seek quiet places where you can regularly get away by yourself and be free to think of God. When you are with people, be with them wholeheart- edly,- give them your love and attention. But also take time to be alone with God. I seldom see anyone in the mornings,- that is my time of seclusion. And don't mix too much with the \"social set.\" There is no happiness in it. Be selective about your com- pany. Choose a wise man or some good friends who will instill spiritual thoughts in you; and get busy with God.

Your trouble in meditation is that you don't persevere long enough to get results. That is why you never know the power of a fo- cused mind. If you let muddy water stand still for a long time, the mud will settle at the bottom and the water will become clear. In meditation, when the mud of your restless thoughts begins to settle, the power of God begins to reflect in the clear waters of your consciousness. Do you know why some people are never able to acquire health or make money, no matter how hard they seem to try? First of all, most people do everything half-heartedly. They use only about one-tenth of their attention. That is why they haven't the power to succeed. In addition, it may be their karma, the effects of their past wrong actions, that has created in them a chronic condition of failure. Never accept karmic limitations. Don't believe you are incapable of doing any- thing. Often when you can't succeed at something it is because you have made up your mind that you cannot do it. But when you convince your mind of its accomplishing power, you can do anything! By communing with God you change your status from a mortal being to an immortal being. When you do this, all bonds that limit you will be broken. This is a very great law to remember. As soon as your attention is focused, the Power of all powers will come, and with that you can achieve spiritual, mental, and material success. I have again and again used that power in my life; and you can do so too. I know that power of God can never fail.

But when your attention becomes divinely centralized, it will burn always as a great light that will reveal God. When a problem thwarts you—when you find no solution and no one to help you—go into meditation. Meditate until you find the solution. It will come. I have tested this hun- dreds of times, and I know the focusing power of attention never fails. It is the secret of success. Concentrate, and don't stop until your concentration is perfect.

Then you will find that as soon as your attention becomes fo- cused, it burns out all deficiency from your mind, and you feel the power of God come over you. That power can destroy all seeds of failure. Keep Your Attention Concentrated When I first started on this path, I was very restless in meditation; but the time came when I sat for forty-eight hours, completely absorbed in the ecstasy of God. Think of that pow- er! Concentrate on that power. Watch your time. Don't waste it. You decide to make a quick trip to town to get something you need, but how easily other things distract you. Before you know it you have been gone for hours. At the end of the day, you see how your attention was scat- tered. It lost all its accomplishing power. The mind is like a bag of mustard seed. If you spill those seeds on the floor it is hard to pick them up again. Your concentration must be like a vacuum cleaner, drawing those scattered seed-thoughts together again. When you have finished your duties at the end of the day, sit quietly alone. Take a good book and read it with attention. Then meditate long and deeply. You will find much more peace and happiness in this than in restless activities in which your mind runs riot in all directions. If you think you are meditat- ing, when all the while your mind is scattered, you delude yourself. But once you learn to concentrate on God, there is nothing like it. Test yourself. Go on a picnic, go into town, so- cialize with friends; at the end of the day you will be nervous and restless. But if you cultivate the habit of spending time alone at home in meditation, a great power and peace will come over you. And it will remain with you in your activities as well as in meditation.

Very few of us are aware of how much we can put into and get out of life if we use it properly, wisely, and economically. First, let us econ- omize our time—lifetimes ebb away before we wake up, and that is why we do not realize the immortal value of the time God has given us. Too much time is spent in rushing, in get- ting nowhere. We should stop, think, and try to learn what life can give to us. Most people do not think deeply at all—they just eat, sleep, work, and die. Sixty years is the average lifespan, but do you know how many years you actually live? Most people sleep from six to ten hours a day—one-third of their life, twenty to twenty-five years, is gone, spent in unconsciousness. Thus only forty or thirty-five years are left. About five or ten years are spent in gossip or talking about nothing, and amusements. That brings it down to thirty—and out of those thirty years, what else do you do? Eat and do nothing, and of course attend to business. Business is necessary for the purpose of maintaining the bod- ily animal, which takes most of your time. Actually scruti- nize your life—you have left hardly ten years!

Life's Purpose Is to Grow in Knowledge and Wisdom In your sixty years of life, many things are necessary just to keep the body vehicle all right; but that is not the sole purpose of life. Do not think that in order to be well-clothed and fed you have to have millions—you don't have to lead a sophisticated life in order merely to feed and care for the bodily animal. Life's goal is much more than that. This world is a vast school in which we ought constantly to strive for greater knowledge and wisdom. Ask yourself now this question: How many good books have I read in this life? Every day about two dozen new books are being printed in America on ethics, music, literature, botany, logic, science, the scriptures, immortal truths—how are you go- ing to pack all this knowledge into your ten years of life? Then again, sixty years is not the life of everyone,- just the lucky ones have even that. What assurance have you got that sickness will not come and shorten your life? And yet you are idling and hav- ing bridge parties! I have no objection if you have a good pur- pose for doing so. But are you going to fritter away your time standing on the sidewalk, watching the crowds pass by or look- ing through the windows at many things you don't need and want to buy? Are you going to waste your time by the wayside? How are you going to learn all the things you want to learn? Doesn't your heart throb to learn everything worthwhile that is going on in the world? How is it possible for the aver- age human being to attain all wisdom? How are you going to find time to read of Jesus, of Aristotle, of all the great poets? Life seems hopelessly short when you think of that. You read a few books, and think you know it all. In the cities you have wonderful libraries, but few people go there. Think of all the knowledge and wisdom that human beings have gathered from the school of life; how, in these few years, are you going to pack it in your brain? Is it possible? As long as you live on this earth, as long as the power in the eye enables you to see the stars, as long as you enjoy God's sunshine and breathe His air, so long will you yearn for knowledge."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"QUICKENING HUMAN EVOLUTION 285 Most human beings walk through life with an empty skull. They think there is a brain there—they think it, that is all; they walk in emptiness. \"Oh, yes, I have a wonderful library at home. Come on, I will show it to you.\" Beautiful but untouched! Mu- sic, poetry, science, everything is there. With all the things you want to learn, you don't want to waste your time. You are filled with unhappiness most of the time because you do not keep the mind worthily engaged. Think of Plato, Shakespeare, Maeterlinck, Lord Shankara, and their works. Think of the priv- ilege you have. You can converse with all of them at will through their wonderful books. Instead of that you are wonder- ing all the time what show you are going to see next! * It is good once in a while to be entertained; but if you spend your life in useless pastimes, and in gossiping about others—being interested in others' faults rather than recogniz- ing your own—the loss is yours.

In the morn- ing he began looking around for a Singer sewing machine. His narrow habit was still with him, even though in heaven he had no need for clothing; he was clad in garments of light. You, too, are wasting priceless time on nonessentials when the treasures of God are around you, ready to be received. Wisdom comes, knocks at your gate, gently asking, \"Let me in,\" but there is no answer, no thought, no response there.

If you cul- tivate a liking for rotten cheese, you lose your taste for good, fresh cheese.

Evolution Can Be Accelerated Still, knowledge is so vast, spiritual wisdom is so vast. And though the earth is but a speck in the universe, it is immense to us. Yet with the march of human progress, our world is be- coming small—every day it is growing smaller, due to modern transportation facilities. Soon we will have to take a trip to other planets to have adventure in travels! Electricity goes any- where in a second—why can't we, whose bodies are essen- tially electromagnetic waves? But we are progressing in nu- merous ways, doing ordinary things more quickly. The adoption of better methods in business and transportation, mass pro- duction by huge machinery, have quickened evolution. Think of the time of life used up just in weaving of cloth by hand in the past! That time has been saved by modern machinery. So the evolution of society has been quickened by the adoption of increasingly better methods. Why can't we accelerate hu- man evolution as well—to learn how to weave lives more quickly into all-round success? How is the human brain going to acquire in a lifetime all knowledge and wisdom? That is my question. When I met Luther Burbank, he showed me a walnut tree and said, \"I took off more than one hundred years from its * Reference to the Yogoda Satsanga Society technique of meditation on God as Aum (see glossary).

I grew that tree in twelve years.\" And you could see that the tree was already bearing walnuts! If the walnut tree can be made to mature in twelve years instead of one hundred and fifty years, there is a chance for human beings also. In sixty years of existence, it is possible for a human being to develop so that he can be a center of all knowledge. That is the point I want to drive home in your mind. I have cited how machinery hastened world evolution. Where did machinery come from?—from the factory of hu- man minds. As man quickened evolution in society and busi- ness, so he can quicken his evolution in all branches of his life, including the faculties of his inner life. Burbank also made almonds have soft shells, made over the tomato, and created the Shasta daisy from bulbs and the cactus without thorns. In primitive times the different animals used to eat the cactus, so the cactus developed protective thorns. When one life begins to hurt another life, that life develops weapons of defense. Burbank told me that during his experi- ments in developing the spineless cactus, every day he went into the garden and talked to the barbed plants: \"Please, beloved cactus, I am Luther Burbank, your friend. I am not going to hurt you at all, so why develop thorns?\" And so the thornless cactus was developed. By talking, by attention, by thought-force and knowledge of nature's laws, you can impress certain vibra- tions on protoplasm, and thus consciously guide and hasten the process of evolution. Increasing the Receptivity of the Brain Professor James of Harvard said that most of our habits come through heredity. Feeblemindedness in people, science says, cannot be helped. Scientists take measurements and be- lieve too much in the stamp of heredity. They have yet to learn how by awakening the brain cells man can quicken his evolu- tion. The power of receptivity of the brain cells can become so heightened that a man can receive, in a single lifetime, all the knowledge he wants to absorb within himself. In education there is a vast difference between the meth- ods applied by teachers in India and in the West. In the West they pump ideas into the brains of children. \"How many books have"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"288 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION you read; how many teachers have you had?\" A man returned from college with a Ph.D. in making sugar from different fruits. He was asked if sugar could be made from the guava fruit. After some deep thought he said, \"I did not study that. It was not in my curriculum.\" Using common sense was beyond him. It is not a pumping-in from the outside that gives wis- dom; it is the power and extent of your inner receptivity that determines how much you can attain of true knowledge, and how rapidly. The man who has the power of receptivity quickly grasps everything. People with no receptivity may be exposed to the same experiences or information, yet not really see nor fully comprehend what is there. An intelligent man lives far ahead of the idiot. Your experiences bring wisdom according to the measure of the cup of your receptivity. Focused Concentration Makes You Keenly Receptive to Wisdom How can you increase your receptivity, and thus quicken your evolution? By consciously condensing all your experiences through the power of concentration. Concentration means to gather in your attention, focusing it to one point; condensa- tion means to use that concentrated attention to do something quickly that ordinarily would take a long time. By concentra- tion you can condense each experience and garner whatever wisdom is to be learned from it. By condensation of individual experiences you can compress all your experiences, and the wis- dom they contain, into a shorter length of time and thus gain much more than if you go through life haphazardly. I will tell you of such an experience. A friend of mine said I was all right as a spiritual man, but that I could not succeed in business. I replied, \"I am going to make five thousand dol- lars in business for you, within two weeks.\" He said, \"You will have to show me. I am 'from Missouri.'\" I did not rush to invest money on unwise things. I used concentration, disengaged my mind from all disturbances, and focused my attention one-pointedly within. Most of you have the searchlight of your attention turned outside all the time in- stead of inside; you should turn the searchlight of the mind within, to reveal the Divine Source. (We are living on the outer"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"QUICKENING HUMAN EVOLUTION 289 side of the universe; the inner side is more tangible and real, for there the subtle laws operating behind all outer phenom- ena can be perceived. Every change in business, every change in the planetary system, in our physical bodies—everything is recorded there.) Ordinarily, men do not concentrate—the mind is restless, and the restless mind jumps at conclusions and races for something that does not rightfully belong to one. You must obey divine law. Remember: Concentrate, and then ask Divine Power to help you. So I touched that Source,- and as soon as I had made that contact there were shown to me lots of houses. But I did not sit quietly in my room and say, \"The Heavenly Father will open the ceiling and drop five thousand dollars in my lap\" because I had favored Him with a fervent prayer. I bought the Sunday pa- pers and looked at real estate advertisements. I picked out a few houses, and told my friend to invest his money in them. He said: \"Everything seems pretty shaky,\" and I said, \"Never mind, doubting Thomas, don't spoil success by your doubts.\" In two weeks there was a real estate boom and prices of houses went way up high. He sold the houses and had a clear profit of five thousand dollars. I showed him that the power of God works through the mind wherever we apply it with faith. Concentration, when directed by Divine Power, does not allow you to ramble through wrong investments; you go straight to success. If that mind power can be applied in busi- ness it can be applied in other things—in music and writing, for example. I always start from within to bring knowledge out, and not from without to pump knowledge in. All the musical instruments I play I learned that way. Perhaps I was too proud to think about going to a teacher; I thought, \"Well, the first man who started to make music did not learn from anybody,- why can't I do the same?\" (It is all right to say that, but if you stand and wait while you reinvent the trolley car, you will be a long time getting to your destination!)

How an Ignorant Devotee Found That the Divine Must Be Sought Within There was a Hindu devotee who was puzzled trying to de- cide what scriptures he should read, and what idol he should worship. (Idols are used in India to help fix the mind in con- centration on a particular aspect of the one formless Spirit, and are respectfully kept covered in a temple so that the birds and weather will not destroy them.) So this devotee said, \"Which god shall I worship?\" He would buy one idol, and then he would be afraid the others would get angry. So he would buy another. He had two big trunks in which he carried all his holy books and images, suspended from his shoulders on a pole. Every day somebody would tell him he had better wor- ship this god or that god, and read this or that holy book—so heavier and heavier the trunks grew. He saw he would have to buy a third trunk! But he thought, \"It is not possible to carry three trunks.\" He sat by the side of a pond and began to weep: \"Infinite Spirit, tell me which book to read, and which idol to worship. As soon as I worship one god I think the others are getting angry.\" It so happened that a saint passed by that way, and seeing the crying man, said: \"Son, why are you weeping? What is the matter?\" \"Saint, I don't know which book to read; and look at these hundreds of idols! I don't know which one to please.\" The saint said, \"Close your eyes and pick up any book and follow that book throughout life,- and drop the idols on a rock and break them one by one. The one that does not break, worship that one.\" So he picked up one book. Most of the idols were made of clay, and all broke except one that was made of solid stone."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"QUICKENING HUMAN EVOLUTION 291 Then the saint suddenly came back and said, \"I forgot to tell you something. Now that you have found your god, go back home. But if you find a more powerful god than this one, wor- ship him.

Every day he dis- covered the fruit was gone, so he thought, \"The saint cer- tainly told me of the right idol. Since he has eaten the fruits he must be a living god.\" One day, overcome by curiosity, he thought he would watch how a god eats. He opened his eyes just a little, and while he was praying he saw a huge mouse come and eat the fruit. Then he said, \"Look at that stone idol. It cannot eat the fruit, but the mouse can, so it is a more powerful god.\" He caught the mouse by the tail and tied it on the altar. His wife said, \"You have gone crazy.\" \"No, I have not gone crazy. I am just following the in- structions of the saint to worship whatever form of God is the most powerful.\" So he put the stone aside and began to wor- ship the mouse instead. One day he was meditating when suddenly he heard a great noise. Opening his eyes he saw a pussycat eating the mouse. He thought, \"That is interesting. The pussycat is more powerful than the mouse. So I must worship the cat.\" He got hold of the cat and made a place for it on the altar. The cat did not have to catch mice anymore, receiving an offering of milk every day without any labor on its part. Day after day the man's medita- tion grew deeper and the cat got fatter. After each meditation the man used to drink a bowl of milk placed before him by his wife. The pussycat was not sat- isfied with what she got, so she concentrated on the man's bowl of milk. One day she drank it up and went back and sat on the altar. The wife came in, saw the milk gone, looked at the cat sitting on the altar feigning innocence, and went and got the broom. Her husband's meditation was broken by the noise of the broomstick falling on the yowling cat. He looked at his wife chastising the cat, and he thought, \"That is inter- esting.

To which the wife apologetically replied, \"Master, I did not deliberately put charcoal in the rice. Forgive me; I am thy servant.\" Then he said, \"Ah, that's interesting.

Kriya Yoga: Scientific Method of Accelerating Human Evolution It is impossible in this life to read all the Vedas and bibles, and to follow all the systems given to be godlike. How then are you going to achieve the goal of your evolution? You must search within, just as the devotee in the above story found out. You cannot possess all wisdom unless your brain is evolved accordingly. Everything depends upon the receptivity of your mind, brain cells, and the subtle astral centers of life and con- sciousness in the spinal column. This body changes every twelve years,- that is why at twelve, twenty-four, and thirty-six years we find distinct changes occurring. If there were no ob- struction of disease and other karmic consequences of break- ing natural laws, with the change of years and change of body the mind would change correspondingly. Disease and wrong liv- ing retard that evolution, but normally in twelve years your brain develops in such a way that it displays a slight refine- ment of mentality. If natural evolution takes twelve years of growth and change of tissues to manifest improved patterns of thoughts, then to make the brain receptive to all wisdom would seem to require"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"QUICKENING HUMAN EVOLUTION 293 that you wait almost indefinitely. To accelerate this process of evolution, there is a method that the masterminds of India have taught of revolving specific vital currents around the spine and brain. By practicing this method—revolving the current around the six (twelve by polarity) astral cerebrospinal centers—you can gain the result of one year's ordinary physical evolution. That is how many saints quickly acquire spiritual knowledge, far beyond that of theoretical theologians. Things which they perceive instantly would require years of ordinary study and ex- perience. Revolving this current around the centers of divine life and consciousness in the spine and brain develops their re- ceptivity. In a year of such practice—even twenty minutes a day—you can get the result of many years of natural evolution. Jesus Christ did not go to college, yet not one among the world's great scientists knows of God and nature's laws as he knew. * Experiential knowledge ordinarily comes through the channel of the senses,- but the senses do not give you more than the knowledge of phenomena—the superficial appearances of the real substance. When by concentration and practice of the above-mentioned method all the fine spinal and brain cells are tuned to the cosmic source, they become highly magnetized, * The practice referred to is Kriya Yoga. In Autobiography of a Yogi Parama- hansaji recorded that Kriya is \"the same science that Krishna gave millenni- ums ago to Arjuna,- and that was later known to Patanjali and Christ, and to St. John, St. Paul, and other disciples.\" \"The ancient rishis discovered that man's earthly and heavenly environ- ment, in a series of twelve-year cycles, push him forward on his natural path. The scriptures aver that man requires a million years of normal, diseaseless evo- lution to perfect his human brain and attain cosmic consciousness....Through proper food, sunlight, and harmonious thoughts, men who are led only by Na- ture and her divine plan will achieve Self-realization in a million years. Twelve years of normal healthful living are required to effect even slight refinements in brain structure; a million solar returns are exacted to purify the cerebral tenement sufficiently for manifestation of cosmic consciousness.... \"The Kriya Yogi mentally directs his life energy to revolve, upward and downward, around the six spinal centers (medullary, cervical, dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal plexuses), which correspond to the twelve astral signs of the zodiac, the symbolic Cosmic Man. One-half minute of revolution of energy around the sensitive spinal cord of man effects subtle progress in his evolution; that half-minute of Kriya equals one year of natural spiritual unfoldment.\""},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"294 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION charged with divine intelligent power. Some say that our brain cells ^at birth have come already patterned with fixed traits and, therefore, cannot be remolded. This is false. Since God made us in His image we cannot have limitation. If we probe deeply enough within ourselves we will know that this is so. Even in the feebleminded, God's power is present as much as in the greatest man. The sun shines equally on the charcoal and the diamond; it is the charcoal that is re- sponsible for not reflecting the sunlight as does the diamond. All congenital limitations come through man's own transgression of a law sometime in a past incarnation. But what has been done can be undone. If the brain cells of a feebleminded person are awakened with the searchlight of concentration focused within by the above method, he will display the previously eclipsed in- telligence the same as the intelligent man. Your body is made up of 27,000,000,000,000 cells. Every cell is like an intelligent being. * You have to educate the dor- mant intelligence in each cell in order to know all there is to know in this world. But you have never trained those cells. That is why you are all the time full of melancholia and pass- ing fancies, and suffering from lack of understanding. The great scientific method of mental and spiritual prog- ress is to magnetize the cells by sending life current around the brain and spine, thereby securing the evolutionary advance- ment of one year's healthful, harmonious living. Twenty min- utes of this practice daily will greatly refine your mentality. When you have revitalized the brain cells, when the divine magnetism touches them, every cerebral cell becomes a vi- brant brain,- and you will find within yourself myriads of awak- ened brains ready to grasp every vestige of knowledge. With these awakened brains, the multitude of cellular mentalities in the body will awake and all things will be apprehended by you.

All Knowledge, All Success, Are Achievable in This Life Whenever you want to know something, don't start with data—retire within and concentrate. Seek guidance from with- in. When the mind is receptive, then bring the data,- start working out the business or mental solution. Do not be filled with discouragement and say it cannot be done. Every human being is a representative of the Infinite Power. You should manifest that Power in everything you do. Whenever you want to produce something, do not depend only upon the outside source; go deep within and seek the Infinite Source. All methods of business success, all inventions, all vi- brations of music, all inspirational thoughts and writings, are recorded in the annals of God. First, determine what your goal is ; ask divine aid to direct you to the right action whereby your objective will be fulfilled; then meditate. Afterward, act according to the inner direction that you receive; then you will attain what you want. When the mind is calm, how quickly, how smoothly, how beautifully you will perceive everything! Success in everything will come to pass in a short time, for Cosmic Power can be proved by the application of the right law. The scientific man or the businessman or anyone seeking success would accomplish more if he concentrated upon in- creasing the receptive quality of his brain cells, instead of de- pending just on books and college work for his progress. The world starts with books and outside methods, but you should start by increasing the receptivity of your intuition. In you lies the infinite seat of all knowledge. Calmness, concentration, and condensation of experiences by intuitional perception will make you master of all knowledge. Do everything with full at- tention, never in a haphazard way. Do not try to do too many things at a time,- perform the most important duties of life first, with heartfelt enthusiasm and closest attention. Do not indiscriminately swallow useless ideas.

Each of these things is disparate in appearance. But they are all the result of a differentiation of one universal vibration. How is it that this one vibratory cosmic energy becomes solids, or liquids, or gases? By what mysterious process are these varying rates of vibration so coordinated as to make human life possible? Behind all manifestation there must be a guiding Intel- ligent Force that is the prime cause of all creation. For instance, we are here on our little earth, somewhere in space, orbiting the far distant sun of our universe. Without the cooperation of the sun's light and warmth, life on earth could not exist. We have the sensation of hunger, and Nature supplies our need for food; when ingested, some unknown Power transforms that food into energy and tissues for the body. All the miracles of life that we take for granted are proof of the existence of an omnipresent di- vine Intelligence behind the processes of nature.

And through the right use of our God-given human intelligence we begin to see that all life is linked to one Supreme^Intelligence. We may some- times think we are puppets of destiny; but when we project our intelligence beyond limited delusive forms and examine the extent of our consciousness and mental perception, we realize that within us there is a spark of the divine Power, That which is creating and sustaining all life, just waiting to be kindled. In the scriptures of every true religion we read that God is all- powerful, infinite, and eternal. Through the windows of the scrip- tures we glimpse the divine Power in which all things are rooted. But our minds with their finite understanding, condi- tioned by the laws of causation, cannot encompass eternity; so we live within the limited circle of our mental capacity. Al- mighty God is both within and beyond that circle. In the Bhagavad Gita it is said, \"Some behold the soul in amazement. Similarly, others describe it as marvelous. Still oth- ers listen about the soul as wondrous. And there are others who, even after hearing all about the soul, do not comprehend it at all.\"* In countless ways, human reasoning shows us that God is the cause of all things. But proof of the existence of God can- not be had by intellectual deduction alone. If we are to realize God, which is the sole purpose of our existence, we must learn to go beyond ordinary thought processes, for He is beyond the measure of human reason. He cannot be fully grasped by a mind always occupied with objects of desire and with emotional dis- turbances of pleasure and pain. To attain a higher state of consciousness and divine percep- tion, it is necessary through meditation to withdraw the mind from its continual restless activity.

All matter, however insignificant, has a particular purpose and effect. This is true also in regard to the thoughts or senti- ments that present themselves to our consciousness and then pass away. We little know what effect such notions produce in us, or in what lies their utility for which reason they were created within us. If you think of a piece of copper, you know its usefulness. But when you consider a single thought, what is its utility? Analyze that query. As the world is composed of atoms and molecules, so the inner being, the nature or charac- ter of a person, is composed of \"atoms and molecules\" of thoughts. If you wish to understand the quality of your inner light, trace the growth of every thought and in the balance of your judgment weigh its relative utility. Today we shall weigh the sentiments of doubt, belief, and faith. These are the crux of controversy in religion. Great teach- ers exhort people to believe and have faith in God and scripture, and warn against the potential devastation of doubt. But without (hscrimination the utility of this counsel may not be understood. Since nothing has been created without having some use, I cannot agree with scriptural moralists who at the very men- tion of doubt turn up their noses at an angle of 120 degrees. Instead let us judge why the principle of doubt has come into the world at all. Wherein is doubt bad—or good!—for human beings? Unless we analyze the psychology of doubt, and of be- lief and faith, we cannot reasonably adopt or reject these sen- timents on the basis of their being beneficial or destructive. By analysis, we find in the concept of doubt a construc- tive as well as a destructive element, according to its applica- tion. I need not discuss at length the destructive element, for its adverse effects are commonly acknowledged. Because of its 300"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"DOUBT, BELIEF, AND FAITH 301 potential harm, some religionists, particularly those who hold blindly to dogmatic beliefs, advocate the eschewal of all doubt in favor of unquestioning acceptance. But to avoid doubt is to choose not to think. Destructive doubt is paralyzing. It inhibits constructive thought and the power of will. It blocks receptivity to the benef- icent workings of higher forces and laws in the universe, and to the ever-ready-to-help grace of God. It produces an inner dis- quietude and sense of hopelessness. It resists progress and re- jects ideas on the whims of ignorance, prejudice, or emotion. But let us consider the constructive element of doubt. If Man Could Not Doubt, He Could Not Progress The predominance of matter before our eyes in the form of objects and beings prevents our perception of the whole of truth. It is by doubting the preeminence of matter that the ex- istence of God is established. If matter, a conglomeration of atoms, is all there is, then how do these invisible particles hold a parliament and bring forth and govern such an organized uni- verse? It is impossible that inanimate atoms could put them- selves together and produce intelligent beings. So the acceptance of God, an Intelligent Consciousness as the creator of this world, was established from materialism by applying the constructive, progressive element of doubt. This constructive element is the scientific current of thought by which we question in order to know what is true. Without this, if we merely accepted things as they appear to be, man would become as animals. Some an- cient civilizations held the view that the sun, moon, and stars were deities governing their lives. Man outgrew that concept by the process of doubt. Through constructive questioning, such belief was found to be wanting. If man could not doubt, he could not progress,- the world would be mired in ignorance. We would not be able to differentiate theory or fallacious arguments from the truth if we did not question. It is therefore right to ap- ply the laws of reason. Doubt decides a hypothesis. Scientists take such a theo- rem and investigate it along with their ever present examiner, Mr. Doubt. Nothing is taken for granted. The proposition is carried to a conclusion to see whether it works or not. If it"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"302 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION doesn't, it is set aside or restructured. If scientists remained satisfied with the status quo of knowledge, there would be no furtherance of civilization. There is a great lesson therein. In regard to religion, scientists should employ the same openness of the constructive element of doubt with which they approach their research in science. For far too long science has been locked into the destructive element of doubt in dismiss- ing religion offhand as superstitious dogma. If it were the aim of the consortium of construction workers only to demolish all defective buildings rather than reconstructing them, or with- out replacing them with improved structures, that would be disastrous. It is the same with those who would do away with morality and religion, leaving behind no structure for the hous- ing of divine principles that can be proven essential to the welfare and happiness of human existence. Of course, even the destructive element of doubt may be necessary to rid us of long-held errors; but if that process obliterates truth as well, then it is harmful to humanity. Constructive Doubt Moves Us Toward Truth Doubt is dynamic energy that should be properly har- nessed to move us to progressive actions. If by constructive doubt we destroy some of our cherished theories, even that is better than just blindly and dumbly following others—\"the blind leading the blind.\" Constructive doubt in regard to divine mat- ters will move us toward truth more quickly than will dog- matic belief. The latter makes us lack the clarity of mind nec- essary to perceive correctly the truth already given to us by God. Dogmatism confounds the ability to fathom the depth of the ver- ities preached by the great ones, such as Jesus in the New Tes- tament and Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. Religion, like science, should be given a proper test. That is how the God- knowing rishis of old attained their realization: they investi- gated, found, and proved for themselves those invariable princi- ples that demonstrate and make manifest the Eternal Reality. The great masters ask us to believe, but they do not say we should not use constructive doubt to question. Suppose some error is printed in scripture,- instead of \"Do not steal,\" the word not is left out so that it reads \"Do steal.\" To accept blindly is"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"DOUBT, BELIEF, AND FAITH 303 to accept errors that creep in—the slip of the pen of the writer, the error of the printer. Apply the test of reason. If you can analyze ideas with un- prejudiced respect and discrimination, you will more readily ap- prehend truth and discern what is untruth. You are endowed by God with the power to understand if you but use your in- struments of intelligence according to the laws He has given. Treat religion with the same spirit applied to the sciences. Without doubt and investigation, many will not reach truth. Reasonable questioning will destroy the shaky supports of dog- matic fanaticism and help to build instead a strong foundation of beliefs whereon the superstructure of faith might rest. Faith Begins With Constructive Belief Belief and faith are often used synonymously, and thus not always correctly. Faith is something much more than mere be- lief, as will be shown. In belief, as in doubt, there is a construc- tive and a destructive element. Applied constructively, adher- ence to valid beliefs leads to realization. Noumenal truths cannot be understood by the sensory mind. Phenomena can be interpreted by the intellect from sensory experience, but not the substance, or noumena, underlying it. This requires inner en- lightenment. Thus does the teacher who has attained realization say to the undeveloped disciple, \"Until you are able to under- stand, believe and follow me.\" That does not mean blind accep- tance. Constructive belief has reason within it. Reason and feeling confirm that there is some truth behind every valid be- lief. If one can gain access to his inherent discriminative intelli- gence, he can arrive at that truth—the inner comprehension of truth that is attainable only by the spiritual development of the soul's intuitive powers of perception. Until then, there might be contradiction between the devotee's reason and the master's realization. So true masters must ask their disciples to believe, to take for granted certain concepts on their authority, knowing that in time they can realize those truths for themselves. Such is the principle of any investigation.

First you have to take pencil and paper and obey his in- struction. Then if you do not get the promised results you will be justified in doubting. But you must be careful before you pro- nounce judgment; be sure you <^o not commit any error in solving the problem. So you see, you must begin with belief. The Fundamentals of Belief Belief is a state or habit of mind in which trust, confidence, is placed in some person, thing, or doctrine; such as a persua- sion of the truths in religion. Belief is a conviction or feeling of the truth or reality of that which is believed. The elements of belief are assent, credence, assurance, re- liance, persuasion, conviction, faith. Belief, faith, persuasion, conviction, are present singularly or in combination in the idea of assent. Belief and faith differ chiefly in that belief as a rule suggests little more than intel- lectual assent, while faith implies total trust or confidence— as in one whose persuasion or belief has ripened into faith. A persuasion is an assured opinion, an idea of which one has convinced himself, as \"It is my persuasion that he is a dis- honest person.\" It implies that this assurance is induced by one's feelings or wishes, rather than by argument or evidence. Conviction stands for a fixed and settled belief, as \"His persuasion has been forged into a feeling of certainty.\" Credence gives substance to belief; something must be considered believable to be held as true. Belief depends also on reliance, which is confidence in the thing believed arising from supportive evidence. Implicit in belief are the elements of will and imagina- tion. Without willingness one cannot believe. And since belief is an uncertain waiting in the hope of obtaining a result, it in- volves also imagination. John imagines that he will be suc- cessful in the jute business. Hence, he is said to believe in his business venture. The elements of will and imagination in be- lief make it a powerful force for good or ill.

Such injudicious beliefs achieve little more than bitter experiences. A hypocritical friend may long command our belief in him, a doomed business may sim- ilarly persist in our minds as worthy of support, but sooner or later they are sure to lose our belief through the revelation of facts. Hence, in material things wrong beliefs are liable to be less wasteful, since our minds are bent toward tangible results. In contrast, concerning spiritual matters, our mental attitude often remains vague and visionary. Teachers or doctrines exhort us to believe and have faith, while offering very little explana- tion or understanding as to the nature of this virtue and how to possess it. Blind acceptance is the general rule and the only re- course for most adherents. Hence, belief and faith in connection with religious life are least understood. Their dynamic power, for the majority of religionists, remains something nebulous, in- definite, unculturable—the possession of a gifted few on whom God has bestowed His grace. For the many others, belief in spir- itual matters is employed blindly, because things of the Spirit are deemed mystical and beyond human ken. An erroneous belief, if held to without scrutiny, develops into tenacious dogmatism. A belief that is disproved changes from dogmatism to unbelief. On the other hand, if one believes in a true doctrine and follows it persistently, that belief gradu- ally crystallizes into conviction and faith. So we see that a be- lief, whether false or true, is provisional. It can only be tempo- rary, for it is subsequently metamorphosed either into dogmatism or unbelief, or into faith. Rudimentary or immature belief not secured in truth is of three kinds: (a) blind, (b) steady and strong, (c) curiosity- awakened. (a) Belief born of emotion or sentiment begins with high- sounding \"faith,\" as \"I will follow you unto death.\" But it ends in violent denunciation when tested with criticism or con- tradiction. (b) The followers of the second group add tenacity to blind belief. They live and die in the same emotional convictions, even if wholly erroneous. This is little more than the savage state of existence, which is controlled by superstition. (c) Persons are a bit safer with beliefs that begin and end"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"306 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION in curiosity. When they find out that their inquisitiveness has led them down a wrong path, they quickly give up that pur- suit and are delighted to seek after something new. Beyond these three is investitive belief. This is based on logical acceptance. It always keeps its eyes and ears open, ever ready to inquire about anything to which it has been attracted by persuasion or interest. This form of belief, however, can easily develop into a habit of fickleness; it may capriciously give up not only that which is erroneous, but also that which is true. The Genesis of Faith What is needed is investigative belief with sincerity and reverence, followed up with persistence in true beliefs, or at least in those beliefs that constantly manifest convincing re- sults. Through the aperture of patience, drop by drop, the chem- ical of truth enters and crystallizes such belief into solid faith. But unless belief is founded on truth, it will not sustain the con- viction that produces progress toward faith. Faith may manifest itself in many areas of belief if there is truth inherent in one's sincere convictions: • Firm belief or trust (as in a person, thing, doctrine, or idea), such as faith in God, faith in medicine. • Recognition of spiritual realities and moral principles as supreme. • Historical faith, as in the truthfulness and authority of scriptural narrative and teachings. Or practical faith— through the acceptance by the intellect, affection, and will—in God's favor extended to man through His di- vine emissaries. • The aggregate of that which is believed: a system of re- ligious beliefs, as the Christian faith or Vedic authority. The result of faith is the stable quality or state of faith- fulness, fidelity, loyalty.

To be constantly at the mercies of nature—surely that is not freedom. Our enthusiastic minds are rudely seized by a sense of helplessness when we are victimized by floods, torna- does, or earthquakes,- or when, apparently without rhyme or reason, illness or accident snatches our dear ones from our bos- om. It is then that we know we really haven't conquered much. In spite of all our efforts to make life what we want it to be, there will always remain certain conditions introduced on this planet—infinite and guided by an unknown Intelligence, oper- ating without our initiative—which preclude our control. At best, we can only work and make some improvements. We sow the wheat and make the flour, but who made the original seed? We eat the bread made from the flour, but who made it possible for us to digest and assimilate it? In every department of life there seems to be, in spite of our instrumentality, an inevitable Divine dependence without which we cannot get along. With all our certainties, we still have to abide an uncertain existence. We do not know when the heart is going to fail.

Never mind that today you make the resolution that you are free and undaunted, and then tomorrow you catch the flu and become miserably sick. Don't weaken! Command your con- sciousness to remain steadfast in its faith. The Self cannot be contaminated by sickness. Maladies of the body come to you through the law of self-created habits of ill health lodged in your subconscious mind.

The more this newfound faith will work its dynamic influence on you, the more your slavery to weakness will wane proportionately. Not a corpuscle of blood can move, nor a puff of breath en- ter your nostrils, without the commandment of the Lord. Hence, absolute surrender to God is the criterion of faith. This surrender is not laziness, expecting God to do everything for you—your utmost effort to bring about the desired result is also necessary—rather, it is a surrender through love for God and veneration of His supremacy. No matter what the obstacles, I would work to the last breath in me in complete surrender to God, but I would never surrender through cowardice or fear of failure. Faith Is Ever Secure—Direct Perception of Truth Faith not only produces results in healing or in other suc- cesses, it is also the power that reveals the outworking of spir- itual laws that underlie all so-called miracles. \"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\"* Hoped-for \"impossibilities\" will be real- ized through the power of this faith—which believes without seeing, which believes even in the face of all odds. Faith is realization itself. It harbors no destructive element, as does belief. Belief can be swayed or destroyed by contrary evidence and doubt; but faith is ever secure, because it is direct perception of truth. Once the world was believed to be flat, but with the progress of science it was found to be round; so that was only a belief, which had to be given up. But faith cannot be contradicted, for it is the developed expression of the un- erring intuition within us, which brings us face to face with theretofore unseen realities. One may thus rightly refer to blind belief, but not blind faith. The soul's realization of truth expresses itself to us through intuition, and the resultant knowing is faith. Intuition is that point wherein a conviction suddenly changes into the direct perception of the truth of that belief. It requires no intermedi- ary, no proof from the testimony of the senses or reason. *Hebrews 11:1 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"DOUBT, BELIEF, AND FAITH 309 For example, how do you know you exist? You know be- cause you know. There is no doubt. Nothing in this world would make you believe otherwise. Even if you were paralyzed and could not see yourself, still you would feel or experience your existence through the perception of the soul. Faith is the A,B,C,D of intuition. It is a deep feeling of knowing within you. Most everyone has experienced a hunch that has come true. That is a manifestation of developing or un- controlled intuition. Intelligence directed to the outward world interprets phenomena; faith turned inwardly interprets by its contact with noumena the intuitions of the soul. All things can be brought to light by the power of faith. In Calmness, Intuition Gives Birth to Faith The Sanskrit word for faith is wonderfully expressive. It is visvas. The common literal rendering, \"to breathe easy; have trust; be free from fear,\" does not convey the full meaning. San- skrit svas refers to the motions of breath, implying thereby life and feeling. Vi conveys the meaning of \"opposite,- without.\" That is, he whose breath, life, and feeling are calm, he can have faith born of intuition; it cannot be possessed by persons who are emotionally restless. The cultivation of intuitive calmness re- quires unfoldment of the inner life. When developed sufficiently, intuition brings immediate comprehension of truth. You can have this marvelous realization. Meditation is the way. Meditate with patience and persistence. In the gathering calmness, you will enter the realm of soul intuition. Through- out the ages, those beings who attained enlightenment were those who had recourse to this inner world of God-communion. Jesus said: \"When thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\"* Go within the Self, closing the door of the senses and their involvement with the restless world, and God will reveal to you all His wonders.

Know that God is with you and that you are His child, made in His image. Surrender to Him through love. That conviction will gradually transform itself into faith through in- tuition. Beyond the senses and intellect, intuition manifests in the calm consciousness as feeling, p^ceived mostly through the heart. When such feeling comes in meditation, you receive through it a definite sense of right direction and unshakable conviction. Increasingly you will be able to recognize and fol- low this intuition. That doesn't mean you give up reason. Calm impartial reason can also lead to intuition. Use common sense. But remember that arrogant or emotional reasoning leads to misconceptions and mistakes. Reject the destructive element in doubt and belief, and ap- ply the constructive element. March on to the kingdom of faith. This is the way of development.

The following article is one of his early commendations of his spiritual motherland, and what India had to offer to and receive from the West. Though the passage of many decades has wrought changes in circumstances and conditions in India and throughout the world, the underlying premise of this \"vision of India\" in the 1920s remains both valid and valuable as an overview of East-West unity. The central theme of India's spiritual message to the world is the importance of the unfoldment of the higher Self, which inspired Paramahansaji's words in the second half of this article. India is an epitome of the world—a land of diverse cli- mates, religions, commerce, arts, peoples, scenery, stages of civilization, languages. Her civilization dates back many thousands of years. Her great seers, prophets, and rulers left records behind them that prove the great antiquity of the Aryan civilization in India. * Many Western travelers visit India, see a few of the street magicians, sword-swallowers, or snake-charmers, and think * The ancient name for India is Aryavarta, literally, \"abode of the Aryans.\" The Sanskrit root of arya is \"worthy, holy, noble.\" The later use of Aryan to signify not spiritual, but physical, characteristics, is considered by some eth- nologists, including the renowned Indologist Max Muller, to be a misinter- pretation of the original meaning. In Autobiography of a Yogi, Paramahansa Yogananda wrote: \"Nothing in Hindu literature or tradition tends to substantiate the current Western histor- ical theory that the early Aryans 'invaded' India from some other part of Asia or from Europe.

The real life and secret of India's vitality is her spiritual culture, from time immemorial, which has made her the motherland of religions. Although the West can teach India much about methods of sanitation, business, and development of resources—and although India needs \"business missionaries\" like Henry Ford and Thomas Edison—yet the Western lands too are thirsty, consciously or unconsciously, for the practical spir- itual lessons in which India has specialized for centuries. In Western cities, science has progressed so far that the physical man is usually well taken care of, fed and clothed and sheltered. Yet physical and material comfort without mental and spiritual peace and solace is not enough. As the spiritual model of all religions, India has been the unproclaimed re- former, the grand inspirer of human minds and souls. Her greatest and richest legacy to mankind has been the techniques for the scientific spiritual culture of man, discovered and handed down through the centuries by her saints and seers. India is a land of mystery, but of mystery that reveals itself to the sympathetic inquirer and seeker. India has the grandest and highest mountains in the world—the Himalayas.

In the north, we find blue-eyed and blonde-haired Hindus, and in the hotter south, the dark sun-kissed skins of the trop- ics. From start to finish, India is a land of surprises, of contrasts and extremes. Life becomes prosaic with too much business, too many dull certainties,- so in India one feels that life is a great adventure, an experience of mystery and surprise. India may not have material skyscrapers and all the some- times spiritually enervating comforts of modern life—she has her faults, as all nations have—but India shelters many unas- suming, Christlike spiritual \"skyscrapers\" who could teach the Western brothers and sisters how to glean the fullest spiritual joy out of any condition of life. Those scientific mystics and seers—who have known Truth by their own effort and experi- ence rather than remaining satisfied with ordinary, personally unverified beliefs—can show others how to develop their intu- ition and bring forth the fountain of peace and satisfaction from beneath the soil of mysteries. Though I have had the ad- vantage of some Western education, yet I feel that in India alone I found the true solution to the mysteries of life. Visions of India's Life-giving Philosophy From time immemorial, India's greatest minds have spe- cialized in discovering and understanding the philosophy and meaning of life. One of the oft-disputed philosophical ques- tions is whether the goal of human life is service or selfishness. Once I had a big controversy with a European who repeatedly and blindly affirmed that the goal of life was service, while I maintained that it was higher selfishness. I asked him again and again for his reasons in believing in \"service\"; but instead of satisfying my discrimination, he kept on reiterating, \"Ser- vice is the goal of life. It is blasphemous to doubt that.\" Finding him so dogmatic, I asked him, \"Is service the goal of life because the Scriptures have declared it?\""},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"314 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION \"Yes,\" he vehemently replied. \"Do you believe everything literally in Scripture?\" I ques- tioned him. \"Do you think Jonah was swallowed by a whale and came out alive after a few days? How do you account for it?\" \"No, I do not understand how he could do that,\" my friend said.   ^   That was just the point. In order really to know the truth contained in scriptural stories—and in order to understand what is erroneous or right, literal or metaphorical, in scriptural writings—one must use reason, discrimination, and the power of intuitional verification developed through meditation. Many people think that whatever is in print must be correct. In particular, most religionists believe that anything wearing the robe of scriptural authority is absolutely beyond question. But putting on an outward garb cannot make one infallible. Writers of scriptures can also make mistakes; or more traditionally, hide truths in the veils of allegories, metaphors, and parables. In or- der to know the truth of a given doctrine, we must live it and find out if it works or not—give it the acid test of experience. Let us get out into the world beyond dogmatism and compare our reli- gious beliefs with the religious experience and realization of true teachers. Let us be iconoclastic of errors within us that need to be abolished. We should not harbor an undigested mass of theology and thus suffer from chronic theological indigestion. The Ideal of Service as Explained by India's Sages The law of service to others is secondary and corollary to the law of self-interest or self-preservation, which may be termed \"selfishness.\" No sane man ever does anything with- out a reason. Religious doctrines and instructions may be based either on blind superstition or on real religious experience. The real reason behind the scriptural injunctions to \"Serve thy fel- lowmen,\" and \"Love thy neighbor as thyself\" is that the law of service to others is to be obeyed by all devotees who would expand the limits of their own self. No action is performed without reference to a direct or indirect thought that is selfish; the very giving of service is in- dispensable to receiving service. To serve others by giving fi- nancial, mental, or moral help is to find self-satisfaction. If any-"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"VISIONS OF INDIA: EVOLVING THE HIGHER SELF 315 one knew beyond doubt that by service to others his own soul would be lost, would he serve? If Jesus had felt that by sacri- ficing his life on the altar of man's ignorance he would dis- please God, would he have acted as he did? No! He knew that although he had to lose the body he was gaining his Father's favor and the emancipated rejoicing of his own soul. Such im- mortal sons of God, and all martyrs and saints, make a good in- vestment—they spend the little mortal body to gain immortal life. Nothing worthwhile is gained without paying a price. Thus not even the most self-sacrificing act of service to others can be shown to be done without any thought of self. It is logical, therefore, to say that higher selfishness, or acting for the good of the higher Self—rather than service to others without thought of self—is the motive of life. Man knows that he must give service to others, or other- wise he cannot rightly receive service from them. All beings are to some degree interdependent. If farmers gave up agricultural work, and businessmen gave up their service of transportation and distribution, not even the renunciant could maintain him- self. Nowadays, with increased population and wealth, even forests are divided off and owned by big landowners who plac- ard the trees with signs warning the trespasser that he will be prosecuted for coming onto another man's property. So the re- nunciant cannot logically say, \"I will not work or earn my liv- ing—I will subsist on the wild fruits of the forest.\" He must contribute some service for which, in return, he is entitled to re- ceive material sustenance. Hence, service given and received— whether by the businessman who serves in a material way or by the spiritual renunciant who serves in a divine way*—has reference to the goal of a lower or higher selfishness. Three Kinds of Selfishness—Evil, Good, and Sacred We should, however, clearly distinguish the three kinds of * \"Solitude is necessary to become established in the Self, but masters then re- turn to the world to serve it.

Evil selfishness is that which actuates a man to seek his own comfort by destroying the comforts of others. To be rich at the cost of others' loss is sin, and is against the interests of the higher individual Self of the person who engages in such selfishness. To delight in hurt- ing others' feelings by carping criticism is also evil selfishness,- this malignant pleasure is not conducive to any lasting good. True and good selfishness motivates a man to seek his own comfort, prosperity, and happiness by also making others more prosperous and happy. Evil selfishness hides its many destruc- tive teeth of inevitable suffering beneath the apparently inno- cent looks of temporary comfort-assurances. Evil selfishness en- closes one in a small circle and shuts out the rest of humanity. Good selfishness takes everybody along with one's own self into the circle of brotherhood. Good selfishness brings many har- vests—return services from others, self-expansion, divine sym- pathy, lasting happiness, and Self-realization. Good selfishness should be practiced by the businessman, who, by sincere, honest, wholesome, constructive actions and labors, enables himself to look after his own and his family's needs and provides a useful service to others. Such a businessman is far superior to one who thinks and acts only for himself, with no regard for those he serves or those dependent on him for sup- port. The latter is acting against his own best selfish interests; for according to the law of cause and effect, he himself will in time attract suffering. The wealth of many misers is left to rela- tives, who often squander it on wrong self-indulgences. Such self- ishness, in the end, helps neither the giver nor the receiver. To avoid the pitfalls of evil selfishness, one should first fol- low and establish himself in the pattern of good selfishness, where- in one thinks of his family and those whom he serves as part of himself. From that attainment, one can then advance to a practice of sacred selfishness (or unselfishness, as ordinary understanding would term it) in which one sees all the universe as himself.

The man of sacred selfishness counts all his consequent earthly losses as sacrifices deliberately and willingly brought about by himself for others' good, and for his own great and ultimate gain. He lives to love his brethren, for he knows they are all children of the one God. His entire selfishness is sa- cred, for whenever he thinks of himself, he thinks not of the small body and mind of ordinary understanding, but of the needs of all bodies and minds within the range of his acquain- tance or influence. His \"self\" becomes the Self of all. He be- comes the mind and feeling of all creatures. So when he does anything for himself, he can only do that which is good for all. He who considers himself as one whose body and limbs con- sist of all humanity and all creatures certainly finds the Uni- versal All-Pervading Spirit as himself. * He does not act with any expectation; but, with his best judgment and intuition, goes on helping himself as the many, with health, food, work, success, and spiritual emancipation. Working with good selfishness and sacred selfishness brings one in touch with God, who rests on the altar of all-expanding goodness. One who realizes this works conscientiously, only to please the ever-directing God of Peace within. * \"He sees truly who perceives the Supreme Lord present equally in all crea- tures, the Imperishable amidst the perishing....When a man beholds all sepa- rate beings as existent in the One that has expanded Itself into the many, he then merges with Brahma\" (Bhagavad Gita XIII:27, 30)."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"Miracles of Raja Yoga Compilation of a lecture and article of the same title, circa 1926-27; with quotations from Autobiography of a Yogi A \"miracle\" is commonly considered to be an effect or event without law, or beyond law.

Miracles are noth- ing but the operation of supermental and cosmic laws. Jesus and the masterminds of India know how to operate them. To ordinary people such works appear as miracles, but they are re- ally the result of natural operation of certain higher, hidden laws. Yoga unites mind power with cosmic power. The Raja Yoga principles of concentration were easily practiced even by the rajas or royalty of India who were engrossed with the mul- tifarious duties of their states. These methods, which bring power over one's own destiny and which can turn failure— material, moral, social, or spiritual—into success, can fit in equally well with the busy and worried life of the Western ra- jas and maharajas, the American millionaires and billionaires. Human nature is everywhere the same. The American needs poise and spiritual strength just as much as the Hindu does. The American makes the machine work hard for him, while the Indian has to make his living by doing his work man- ually. Theoretically, therefore, the American businessman has more time than the proverbially spiritual Hindu to devote to developing mental miracles. The superiority of acquiring \"miraculous\" mental powers over the acquirement of business skill is that the former has no limitations as does the latter. The ordinary intelligent busi- nessman may be broken down by hard competition. When his business intelligence is exhausted, he utterly fails.

In the nineteenth century, in the court of Prince Ranjit Singh—emperor of the Punjab—and under the seal of French and other European doctors, the miraculous performance of Sadhu Haridas was historically recorded. After Haridas's body was waxed all over, sewn securely in a sack, and then sealed in a stone chest, the emperor buried the sadhu several feet below the earth in the royal courtyard. Careful watch was maintained over the site for six weeks. Millions of people waited for the news about the sadhu's disinterment af- ter the six weeks had passed. The stone chest was opened, the cloth and wax were removed, and the body was examined by French and English doctors and pronounced dead. Yet in a few minutes Sadhu Haridas blinked his eyes and came back to life.

My teacher's teacher, Lahiri Mahasaya, was seen by my mother in an ecstatic state in which for a prolonged time he suspended all life processes. * But it is considered a spiritual degradation and blasphemy against God's laws for great yogis to demonstrate their powers merely to satisfy the idle cravings of curiosity-seekers. It took me a long time to recognize the miraculous power of my master, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, though I had close contact with him.

During my college days, I used to visit and stay with him in his ashram almost every day, absorbed in the wisdom of his pres- ence and in the practice of meditation. My studies were so much neglected that I hardly knew where my college books were. Five days before the university examination, I told Master I wasn't going to appear at the examination. His warm counte- nance changed suddenly, and he said, \"Then all my relations with you cease this instant.\" He insisted and said, \"All I ask of you is to appear at the examination.\" He declared I would pass even though I had not studied. I agreed reluctantly, thinking just literally to carry out his behest \"to appear,\" and that I would fill up the answer pages with his teachings. Next he asked me, at first gently, then vehemently, to seek the help of a certain friend of mine, Romesh Chandra Dutt, an honor student. Every morning of all those days that my A.B. examination lasted, I was to ask Romesh whatever questions came to my mind, and to remember his answers. Romesh tu- tored me in my various subjects and answered all my queries. This Calcutta University A.B. degree, in some respects, is more difficult to obtain than even a Harvard A.B. degree.

After the first day I confidently declared to the world that I was going to pass; and when indeed I received the A.B. degree, my father and friends, who had given up all hopes about the success of my college life, told me I had performed a miracle. That is why I am fond of putting the A.B. after my name in all my books and articles; the title reminds me of this singular experience and blessing bestowed by my Guru's divine power. * When I had questioned Master as to how this had become possible, he just replied that faith, works, and knowledge of supermental law can work miracles, where physical efforts of man fail. I remember that a friend of mine, seeing me a devout fol- lower of Master and negligent of my studies, had once ridiculed me and said, \"I am sorry to tell you that your Guru and God won't make you pass your examinations.\" And half in faith and half for the sake of argument, I replied, \"Why not?\" Little did I dream at that moment that I would see such a dramatic ful- fillment of my declaration. My Master is still living in flesh and blood in India, and I dare not tell all the wonderful things I have seen.t This much I can say: Throughout the whole western world I have not found a single one like him. I would accept all the poverty, famine, inconveniences of life in India in preference to the comfortable American life, to sit at the feet of one like my Master. By the mere touch of the hand or feet of a God-realized master, a re- ceptive disciple becomes entranced in the great spirit of God. * Shortly after this talk, Paramahansaji gradually dropped the use of his uni- versity title, feeling that it had served the purpose for which Sri Yukteswar had helped him to secure it—to introduce him to a skeptical Western audience: \"Someday you will go to the West,\" Sri Yukteswar had said. \"Its people will be more receptive to India's ancient wisdom if the strange Hindu teacher has a university degree.\" t Swami Sri Yukteswar entered mahasamadhi, a yogi's final conscious exit from the body, on March 9, 1936.

Each word represents an ideal con- ception of the Infinite, because behind each word and thought is a manifestation of Spirit. Many waves of thought are danc- ing in the waves of consciousness; but behind that, there is the great unceasing Ocean of Truth. Our thought expressions are waves of this ocean of understanding. What is the meaning of resurrection? To live again! To rise to renewed life! What rises again—and how? We must under- stand in what way resurrection means to live again. Every- thing is undergoing a process of change. These changes are ei- ther detrimental or beneficial to the object that changes. For example, if I take a dirty glass and strike it on the floor, it will be changed, will it not? But this change will not be beneficial; it will be harmful to the object. However, if I wash the glass and make it shine, that change is beneficial. Resurrection means any beneficial change to an object or to a human being. You can resurrect your old furniture in the carpenter's or up- holsterer's shop. You can resurrect your house through the help of architects. But we are talking of resurrecting the human body. In this context, resurrection means any uplifting change. You cannot remain at a standstill. You must either go forward or backward. That is a great and inspiring truth, that in life you cannot remain stationary. Either you must accept changes that are harmful to you or those that are beneficial to you. * Under the direction of Paramahansa Yogananda, portions of this talk, as well as of other early talks and articles, were incorporated into the compila tion of the Yogoda Satsanga Society Lessons. 330"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"RESURRECTION 331 Every human being is an expression of the vast, immea- surable Spirit. Isn't it marvelous, when we see how human be- ings, without any motors, without any wires, without any vis- ible source of power, run smoothly? The human machine wakes up in the morning, eats breakfast, goes to work, goes to lunch, goes back to the office, has dinner, goes to the movies (or per- haps enjoys some hobby at home); then it goes to sleep, to wake up and do the same things all over again, day in and day out. As mortal beings, we are controlled by something that oper- ates like radio—the intelligent active and vital energy let loose by God in the creative laws of Nature. * Ships can be moved by radio,- similarly, we are controlled by the \"broadcasts\" of nat- ural laws of the infinite omnipresent Spirit. But the point is, we are not automatons. Our soul is a re- flection of Spirit. Just as the sunlight falling on a body of mov- ing water becomes broken up into myriad scintillations, so Spirit, shining on vibratory creation, has become reflected therein as individualized Spirit, or the soul, in each human body and mind. Now, although this soul is a reflection of Spirit, it has become identified with the body, and has put on all the limitations of the body and of the mind. Yet it is trying very hard through processes of evolution to resurrect itself from the distortions caused by thralldom to the body and mind. But it is easier said than done, isn't it? Resurrecting the reflected soul-image signifies taking it away from the distorting rest- lessness of body consciousness and reuniting it with the orig- inal all-pervading undistorted Light of Spirit. Theory and Practice There is a story that when a certain charismatic preachert met God in Heaven, he said to Him, \"Don't You remember me? I introduced You to crowds in big halls and sent them up to Heaven by the carloads.\" Then God said, \"You sent them all right, but none arrived.\" Sometimes we pray theoretically,- and we think we are resurrected from our blemishes, but it is * Prakriti: the active expression of Spirit as Creator. t Evangelist Billy Sunday (William Ashley Sunday, 1862-1935), as told in the humorous satire, Heavenly Discourse, by Charles Erskine Scott Wood."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"332 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION only imagination. The facts of our words and actions prove something different. Resurrect your Self. Resurrection must take place not only theoretically; it must occur practically. Even theoretical prayer is better than nothing at all, but some- times it is a detriment to practical understanding. Let us study first about mental resurrection. In the begin- ning of life, the soul plays with the body instrument; gradu- ally it becomes the slave of the body. Hence we must learn to live a life above the physical plane. Mental development is a product of physical development, or evolution. We find, ac- cording to natural evolution, that the soul resurrects itself to the plane of intellect or the plane of prosperity—manifesting the unique endowments of human beings—and then rises to the plane of spiritual realization, which gives a meaning to all prosperous development and intellectual attainment. Intellec- tual attainments are undoubtedly helpful—all good things help. Gradually, we understand the way to resurrect the body into the Spirit, by spiritualizing the body and mind to become fit instruments for the expression of Spirit. Resurrection means to free the soul from the cage of ig- norance; to uplift and release the soul from the bondage of mor- tal consciousness. Human life is sometimes very beautiful, but one who is attached to it is like a bird of paradise in a cage. You open the bird's cage, but because of attachment and habit, it may not want to fly away. Isn't it a pity that the bird does not want to go out into the boundless freedom whence it came? Yet it is afraid. We also, feeling ourselves slipping out of body con- sciousness in deep meditation, may think: \"Will I slide into the Infinite and never come back?\" We are afraid to try the skies of limitless consciousness. We have lived too long identified with the body; and now we shrink from entering our infinite omnipresence, frightened to resurrect the omnipotence and omniscience of our soul. To resurrect our innate wisdom from the bondage of the body is spiritual resurrection. Bodily Freedom Is Not Real Freedom I will talk of body resurrection now, of promoting those up- lifting changes in the body that are beneficial to you. What I have to say first is about living-dead people walking on the streets."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"RESURRECTION 333 Many people think that they are free because they can think and speak, move their hands and feet, and walk freely on the city streets. But they are not free. They are in bondage, chained by Na- ture and their subconscious habits, like men walking in their sleep. There are many forms of physical bondage. If you have not been able to resurrect yourself from the bondage of sickness, for example, then you are still imprisoned behind the bars of matter. To resurrect yourself from disease by right living is extremely nec- essary. After many years of deep study, I found \"in a nutshell\" how to express health—by contacting Cosmic Energy. * We must also understand about food values. Meat is detri- mental to your system; but so is an improperly cooked vegetable dinner of killed vitamins. Resurrect your mind from the bad habits of wrong eating. Vitamins are absolutely necessary to the system for the harmonious development of physical strength. Vitamins are the brains of the food. Vitamins are rearranged in the system to give vitality to the body. They are sparks that set the gunpow- der of chemicals in motion. Unsulphured figs and raisins are nature's candies. The or- dinary figs and raisins are mummies. They are so treated that they do not decay; but they have no life. You can write these figs and raisins into your will and leave them to future genera- tions as heirlooms! Sun-dried figs live only three months. In the mummy kind, the sulphur fumes passed through them kill all the vitamins. Isn't it too bad to preserve things by killing the good part? It is good to boil eggs hard because they may contain germs from sick hens.

I shall broadcast this information. Nature will not listen to ex- cuses of your years of transgression against her health rules.

Though sometimes I was sickly in my youth, I have very strong muscles now. Of course Yogoda [Self-Realization Fellowship techniques], and not only food, helps that. Right Food Must Be Taken I recently met a man called Uncle Billy Ries—seventy- nine years old. He has grown a full shock of hair on a per- fectly bald head. He said that he had been for years carrying a bay window in front, and was given up to die at twenty-five years of age. He resurrected himself. He began by thinking, \"If there is a God, He has no business in making me sick\"; then he began to think it must be his own fault. You see, he was res- urrecting himself from the disease that he had been con- stantly attracting to himself through his own fault. He found that sixteen elements are necessary to the body. So he altered his diet accordingly and got back his health completely. He kicks way up high in the air, and he successfully pitted his strength against mine. We are great friends. Much valuable health information I owe to him. Since you have to eat, why not eat rightly? You can have a whole meal often, yet be on a starvation diet; whole meals of white bread and sugar and pies might satisfy one's hunger, but would kill in a few months. So resurrect yourself from the bad habit of eating wrongly. A rattlesnake gives you warning be- fore it strikes, but rich gravy and white flour won't tell you; they look and taste so very nice. Everything white—refined flour, sugar, and grains—is not always good; sometimes brown a large percentage of raw fruits and vegetables, he advised: \"If your diet has consisted chiefly of cooked foods, introduce raw foods into it gradually, until your system becomes accustomed to the change. When cooking vegetables, it is better to steam than boil them. Vegetables cooked in water should be eaten with the broth in which they were prepared.\""},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"RESURRECTION 335 things—whole, unpolished grains, and natural sugar in fruits and honey—are very nice. We used to have unprocessed cereals until the mills came and we began to refine things; and now, by a roundabout way, the best is taken out of the grains. Colonic poisoning comes with white bread. You cannot afford to have constipation.

You won't die—you will live\\ Once a month fast two or three days consecutively, liv- ing only on orange juice, t There is so much bondage to mat- ter—of fear to miss a meal.

When you fast on orange juice it scrubs every cell. At least once every month you should give a thorough house- cleaning to your body by fasting. Do not let poison accumu- late in your system. When you suddenly become sick you has- ten to pray to God for healing. Don't let yourself get sick. The greatest way to maintain health, and the simplest, is to fast on orange juice one day every week and for two or three days consecutively once a month.

That is more important than trying to use even meditation or physical means to seek a remedy when you are sick. According to experiments by German scientists, many people are better off because they do not constantly ana- lyze their physical condition or suffer from mental discourage- ment because of their maladies. There is a close relation be- tween the mind and the body, so destroying the consciousness of disease is vitally important. Many times diseases have left us, but our consciousness of disease brings them back again. While meditating late one night, a certain saint saw the ghost of the dread smallpox disease entering the village where he lived. \"Stop, Mr. Ghost!\" he cried. \"Go away. You must not molest a town in which I worship God.\" \"I will take only three people,\" the ghost replied, \"in ac- cordance with my cosmic karmic duty.\" At this the saint un- happily nodded assent. The following day three persons died of smallpox. But the next day several more died, and each day thereafter more villagers were overcome by the fearful disease. Thinking that a great de- ception had been played on him, the saint meditated deeply and summoned the ghost. When it came, the saint rebuked it. \"Mr. Ghost, you deceived me and did not speak the truth when you said you would take only three people with your smallpox.\" But the ghost replied, \"By the Great Spirit, I did speak the truth to you.\" The saint persisted. \"You promised to take only three per- sons, and scores have succumbed to the disease.\" \"I took only three,\" said the ghost. \"The rest killed them- selves with fear.\" You must resurrect your mind from the consciousness of disease—from the thought of disease.

You must give the whole credit to God, remembering that you are living directly by His power. Resurrect yourself from the consciousness of physical disease. God did not create disease. Resurrect yourself from the disease consciousness that has been handed down by your forefathers. Do not mind difficulties; be unafraid. These are the truths that have been preached in India from ages ago. Truth that shall make you free! Then comes resurrection from our mental habits. The silk- worm weaves threads around itself into a cocoon. Then, be- fore it develops wings and slips out of the cocoon, the manu- facturer gets hold of it, and the silkworm meets its death in its self-created prison. We all are similarly entrapped. Before the wings of spirituality grow, we foolishly weave threads of fear, worry, and ignorance around ourselves until disease and death come and destroy us. We find ourselves in bondage cre- ated by ourselves. What is most destructive? Our own mis- guided thoughts, our own wrong ways of living—thinking indiscriminately and then acting on it. We must resurrect our- selves from spiritually deadening anger thoughts, from the thoughts that engender selfishness, from the clamor of inhar- monious living. \"Let the Dead Bury Their Dead\" Many people think they are awake, but they are not. Mostly they are walking dead. You have heard of people walk- ing in their sleep, crying \"fire\" or lecturing. Most people are like that.

You should help to resurrect those who have buried themselves under their wrong living. In order to do that, you must be able to smile from your own resurrected soul. Not a smile like this: \"I am DEElighted to meet you\"—not that kind of smile. When you smile when God smiles through the heart, through the soul, and when the soul then smiles through the heart and the heart smiles through the eyes, then the Prince of Smiles is en- throned beneath the canopy of your celestial brow. Let no rebel hypocrisy ever destroy it. Smile though the storms of suffer- ing shriek around you. God knows that it is because you are beclouded by self- created ignorance that you are tossing on a sea of trials, un- able to see the omnipresent Spirit pervading everything. He knows that you are adrift in the little bark of your life and must battle the storms around you. But He also knows that you are moving toward Him. When trials come, pray to the Father: \"I have launched my boat on a dark sea, but I have heard Thy call. I know that Thou knowest I am coming.\" You must battle; even when the hands seem to break, you must battle, you must not give up. Then, when the clouds will vanish and the life of happiness and prosperity will be back again, you will forget your trials. Trials do not come to destroy you, but to help you appre- ciate God better. God does not send those trials. They are of your own making—the effects of conscious or unconscious actions in the past, somewhere, sometime.

My power to overcome is greater than all my trials, because I am a child of God.\" Those who receive God are those who develop their mental powers by serious application of spiritual laws. When your mental powers expand, your cup of realization will become big enough to hold the Ocean of Knowledge. Then you have resurrected yourself. Give and Forget Resurrection was celebrated last Easter, honoring Jesus whose life was such a great example. People to whom you do good may turn around and slap you.

Do you ever think that you have been completely unset- tled by circumstances—ruffled, shattered, whipped, lacking power? Banish such thoughts! You have power,- you do not use it. You have all the power you need. There is nothing greater than the power of the mind. Resurrect your mind from the little habits that keep you worldly all the time.

But I said, \"Tomorrow you may not be here to carry a cent. Have you opened your 'bank account' with God?\" Later he invited me to lunch, but he was still inwardly antagonistic to me. Then we talked again, and he became more reasonable. \"Do not rely on riches,\" I advised. \"You may die and not even have a chance to make a will. These material riches are not yours.

Later, when in Boston, I was in the hotel where he had told me he stopped. When I inquired about him, the hotel manager said, \"Don't you know what happened to him?

That alone is everlasting; it is the one thing that will live forever. This I say not to frighten you, but to quicken your under- standing, to quicken your efforts, so that you do not keep your soul buried under a false satisfaction."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"RESURRECTION 341 Open your \"bank account\" with God—it will never be lost. You can use it through all your travels, now and in eternity, whether in an airplane or an astral plane. You should say to your- self: \"From star to star I will fly ; whether on this side of eternity, or the other side of eternity, or whether surging through the waves of life, from atom to atom—flying with the lights, whirling with the stars, or dancing with human lives—I am an immortal! I have resurrected myself from the consciousness of death.\" Resurrect yourself from anger, from melancholy, from fail- ures. You must succeed to know that you are God's child. Success is not limited to spiritual matters. Success must come in everything. Resurrect yourself from the consciousness of disease, from mental habits and weakness. Have a strong smile that will never be shattered by the trials of your cir- cumstances. Spiritual Resurrection Then comes spiritual resurrection. Spiritual resurrection means metaphysical relaxation, to withdraw the consciousness from the tenacious habit of identification with your body. In meditation you release yourself from identification with your mental body by stilling the restless sensory mind. You must similarly relax the life force from the internal physical organs, and thus do away with body consciousness. In that relaxation of your hold on body consciousness you become free; your soul nature is revealed and you know that you can live without the body though living in the body; it is separate. Resurrection is not a change that takes place only after death. You must res- urrect yourself while living in this body. You do it every night in sleep, which is unconscious resurrection. You must learn to do it in meditation, which is conscious resurrection. There were saints in India who, having entered a deathlike state, were buried, and later disinterred and brought back to life and con- sciousness after several days under the ground. They have proved that resurrection of the body is possible.* St. Paul, St. John, and other of Christ's disciples knew also the spiritual sci- * See story of Sadhu Haridas on page 324."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"342 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION ence of conscious relaxation of the life from the body in med- itation and restoration of it at will—St. Paul thus declared, \"I die daily.\"* To do without food and still live is another kind of conscious resurrection. The resurrection of Jesus Christ is different. It is higher still. This higher resurrection means you understand cre- ation—how to free the soul from the bondage of ignorance, the great delusive power of maya. We have no physical existence except in the universal sense. The body you see is nothing but materialized energy. How could energy be sick? Sickness is a delusion. But simply saying that it is delusion is not enough. If in a dream you strike your dream head on a dream wall, you will have a dream skull fracture. Wake up and you are healed of your dream injury. Yogoda teaches that only by contacting God can one see that God has become the universe, and that the human body—and all things else—are naught but a mass of condensed energy; and energy is \"frozen\" Cosmic Consciousness, or God. We should not call it mind. Mind is different. To say that everything is mind is incorrect. It is Cosmic Consciousness that causes us to be aware of different things, to have a consciousness of so- called matter and a consciousness of Spirit. I have written plainly in my Scientific Healing Affiima- tionsf why it is we do not see Spirit in matter. Jesus Christ had the power to see it. Resurrection means not only to resurrect body and soul to another sphere of existence, as did Jesus, but to change the atoms of the body (as well as to spiritualize them and release them along with the mind). Everything—skin, hair, eyes—is nothing but frozen energy and frozen conscious- ness of God. When Peter cut off the ear of the centurion, Jesus restored it. How? The atoms obeyed him, because he knew that the atoms were controlled by the consciousness of God. They do not obey you because you are not attuned to that controlling power of Cosmic Consciousness, which is holding this flower together as a flower. You have the illusion of mat- ter as a solid reality. By meditation you will be able to sepa- * I Corinthians 15:31 (Bible), t Published by Yogoda Satsanga Society of India."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"RESURRECTION 343 rate the soul from the illusion of the solid body. You will know that the cosmic golden cord that binds the atoms is the tender consciousness of Spirit. It is with this cord that He binds the atoms to become the flower, or the human body. He takes myriad electrons, like a child modeling in clay, and throws them into eternity to become stars or universes. Imagine how very little we are to Him—I think nothing more than bacteria. Though we are so very small, yet as souls made in His image we are very big! A little story—about bigness. We think our accomplish- ments are marvelous, but they are not so big to God at all. One day I saw a tiny ant crawling up a snowy mound of sand. I said, \"To the ant this must be like scaling the Himalaya Mountains!\" The pile no doubt seemed gigantic to the ant, but not to me. Similarly, a million of our solar years may be but a moment in the mind of God. We should train ourselves to think in grand terms: Eternity! Infinity! The Crucifixion of Self-sufficiency Last of all, resurrect your mind from formal faith—beliefs which may have given you a little satisfaction, but which you have outgrown; religions which you lived with under the con- viction that you know—while you don't know. The greatest crucifixion of the soul is the crucifixion by the arrogant self- sufficiency of the ego—thinking how wonderfully big and wise we are. Your soul must be released from bondage to the littleness and limitations of the body and the suffering that the body is subject to. When you think of the devastation of disease, you think it an injustice of God; but know you are immortal—not to be crushed by mortal lessons, but to learn and manifest your immortality and smile. Say: \"I am immor- tal, sent to a mortal school to learn and regain my immortal- ity. Though challenged by all the purifying fires of the earth, I am the soul and cannot be destroyed. Fire cannot burn me ; water cannot wet me ; breezes cannot wither me ; atoms can- not shatter me ; I am the immortal dreaming the lessons of immortality —not to be crushed, but to be entertained.\" In the dreamland, sickness and health are the same, prosperity and failure are the same—only dream imaginings. But surely, a"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"344 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION dream of prosperity is better than a dream of failure. So if you have to have dreams, why not have good dreams in this life? If you have too many bad dreams, you will be very busy crying and not have time to know that it is all a dream. Far better are the dreams of health and prosperity and wisdom. Never Acknowledge Defeat Resurrect your soul from all dreams of frailties. Resurrect your soul in eternal wisdom. What is the method? It includes many things: self-control, proper diet, fortitude, an undaunted mental attitude, and relaxation of the consciousness from body identification by faithful daily practice of scientific concentra- tion and meditation principles. Refuse to be defeated. Do not acknowledge defeat; to acknowledge defeat is greater defeat. You have unlimited power,- you must cultivate that power, that is all. Meditation is the greatest way of resurrecting your soul from the bondage of the body and from the shackles of all your trials. Meditate at the feet of the Infinite. Learn to satu- rate yourself with the consciousness of God. Your trials may be heavy, may be great, but the greatest enemy of yourself is yourself. You are immortal; your trials are mortal. They are changeable,- you are unchangeable. You can unleash infinite powers and shatter your finite trials. Two frogs, one a big one and the other a small one, fell into a pail of milk. The sides of the pail were shiny and smooth, too slippery and steep for the frogs to climb out. They were bat- tling to stay alive; but every time they lifted their mouths to catch a little oxygen, down they went. They paddled around and around. After a while, the big frog gave up and drowned. But the little frog said, \"Life is too sweet. I don't want to die. I will keep paddling no matter if my little feet fall off.\" So it was battling for hours, when suddenly it found something solid under its feet—the milk was churned to butter! Out jumped the little frog! That is just how life is!

The cosmic influence on this natural evolution is cyclical. * In the upward arc of the cycle, first comes material, then intellectual, and then spiritual development. Then the general trend of life again returns to the intellectual and the material planes. God's cre- ation is in this manner constantly going on. We, the actors of many races, play again and again the drama of life on the stage of time. We should understand the purpose. We are here to play our parts well, but without becoming so enmeshed in and iden- tified with our roles. We have a distorted perception of life because we see with eyes of narrowness and selfishness. If only we would see instead with the eyes of God. When we open our inner eyes of soul wisdom, we behold the omnipresent Light of God. With- in this Light is the consciousness of Christ, the \"Son\" or pure reflection of God present everywhere in the universe.

Stars, planets, plants, animals, and human beings are all let loose on a beautiful cosmic stage, with each one playing an assigned part. Very few people understand the meaning of the play because they do not pause to think deeply about it. To the unenlightened, the drama often seems chaotic and unjust. But God purposely did not automatically make all people poor or all people millionaires, because if everyone were alike this drama could not go on. Diversity is the basis of Na- ture, and self-evolution is one means of maintaining this diver- sity. By the law of cause and effect, action and reaction, we make of ourselves what we presently are and what we will be. The result of this variety, created by both man and Nature, is what we experience as the cosmic drama. However, God does not want us to suffer because of these differences. He wants us to know that whether one is currently playing the part of a king or of a servant, he must do his best, but never forget that as a soul, made in the image of God, he is only enacting a temporary role. Therefore, it doesn't matter whether we scrub floors, or whether we are the leaders of great nations; unless we know that we are merely playing a part on the stage of time, we will suffer from the dualities inherent in the consciousness of being identified with these different stations and conditions. Stage actors do not bemoan their particular parts, but enact their roles to the best of their ability, knowing they are temporary portrayals. Do you see? It is only when we take life too seri- ously that we suffer.

There is but one reli- gion of God, one Truth underlying the different names of reli- gion. That universal state of consciousness is very hard to at- tain unless one has Self-realization, the knowing that we are souls and that all souls are a part of the One God. The small waves and the big waves all arise from the same ocean. So, when we stand aside spiritually and view every person and every religion impersonally, we shall see that everything is made of God. Until we see all waves of creation in this way, there will always be differences, with their accompanying troubles and difficulties. No man, no prophet, will ever be able to wipe away all the inequalities and divisions on this earth. But when you will find yourself in the consciousness of God, these differ- ences will vanish and you will say: Oh, life is sweet and death a dream, When Thy song flows through me. Then joy is sweet, sorrow a dream, When Thy song flows through me. Then health is sweet, sickness a dream, When Thy song flows through me. Then praise is sweet and blame a dream, When Thy song flows through me. * This is the highest philosophy. Do not be afraid of any- thing.

He loved all races as the children of God. Try to feel that brotherhood with all nationalities. Real brotherhood can never come unless we feel it in our hearts. Such feeling can be at- tained only through Self-realization and the actual contact of God in our hearts. Everything will betray you if you betray God by forgetful- ness of Him. So it is time to realize your unity with all by ex- periencing your oneness with God. Practice that feeling of unity in the vastness of your expanded consciousness in meditation. Be very determined in that respect. Shut out the world in the si- lence of meditation, lest the lesser things of God's creation at- tract your attention away from Him. Let naught else approach that inner temple. In the sanctum of your heart there must be enshrined one power, one joy, one peace—God. If you have that realization, you will find the Infinite Christ baptizing your consciousness in the unity of God's omnipresence. Your outer life also must be clean—pure in word, thought, and action. Be kind to all; even if the greatest of sinners comes to you, consider him a brother—albeit a sleeping brother. Hurt no one; judge none else but yourself. Destroy moods; trample them to dust. Learn to Guide Your Actions by the Inner Will of Conscience Master [Swami Sri Yukteswar] used to say to me, \"Learn to behave.\" That is the most difficult thing to do. You should learn to guide all of your actions by the inner will of your con- science attuned to the will of God, and not by your emotional feelings and instincts. When I first met my Guru, he said, \"Al- low me to discipline you.\" He did not mean that he was going to make a mechanical man out of me, a blind follower. He said, \"I will give you divine sight.\" When I tuned my will with Master's, it became strengthened and guided by wisdom. God's will is governed by wisdom and justice. Those who are in tune with Him are not bound by any dictates of whims and habits. They live in the freedom of God, their will governed by His wisdom and justice. So it is important for the spiritual novice to tune his will with those who are in tune with God. Such obedience is not negation of one's own will. It requires"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"350 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION the cultivation of tremendous will power to become attuned to wisdom. It took all of my self-control to heed the counsel of my Guru rather than listen to my own prepossessed habits and in- stincts.

By fol- lowing him wholeheartedly, I gained complete control of my- self—a freedom I might never have found on my own. Neither God nor Satan—nor anyone—can influence you except by your own use or misuse of will. Use your God-given free choice to seek Him. Then you shall surely find freedom. And remember that it is of the utmost importance to sur- round yourself with the best company, those who will inspire you and strengthen your discrimination and will power. Flies do not discriminate between filth and honey,- they flit from one to the other. But the bee is attracted only to the sweetness of honey. Similarly, there are indiscriminate hu- man beings who, like flies, are drawn to material desires, no matter how impure. Some may once in a while feel attracted to God and meditation; but as soon as another temptation comes, they are captivated again by material life. The devotee is like the honeybee. Devotees love only what is beautiful and pure. They see, hear, smell, taste, and touch only what is good. They will and feel goodness, and ever seek the sweet nec- tar of God's presence in meditation. Above all, be sincere with God. Be humble as you try through inner receptivity to learn everything from the lips of God. Cast out of your life all that keeps you from God. \"If thy hand offend thee, cut it off.\"* Remove all impediments in your path—anything that obstructs your spiritual development.

But strange to say, I saw him this time with blue eyes. They were so beautiful. Never have I seen such eyes! As I was beholding them, they then became wondrously dark; and the voice of Christ said, \"Why-do you want to see me in form? See me as Infinite!\" All saints who have merged in God have the power to don again the forms that they once had on earth. How few people re- alize the immanent presence of the angels and the great masters. Just as songs passing through the ether may be timed in when you have a radio, so is it possible to tune in with saints, who are just behind the etheric veil of space, if only you will meditate. When a great teacher comes on earth, his presence bestows power and inspiration, filling his disciples with much joy. But after he leaves, they may feel bereft and lost if they have no motivating spiritual power of their own.

When Paramahansaji spoke again, he began with the following true story:] A materialistic doctor once sought out a particular saint, thinking that he would set the master straight about a few mat- ters. \"If only I can meet this saint,\" he was thinking, as he walked along toward the master's hermitage, \"I will twist his ear and show him that the world is real and that God is unreal.\" Even as the doctor was thinking this, a disciple of the saint came running up to him and said, \"My master wishes to see the physician who would twist his ear and teach him that God is unreal.\" The doctor almost fainted with surprise. When he reached the saint, whom he found seated under a tree, he said, \"For the first time I am penitent. I feel it was God who told you about me. Please tell me if I will ever meet this God who talks with you.\" \"Twice in your life,\" the saint replied, \"if you pray very earnestly day and night.\" \"But the mind wanders,\" protested the doctor. \"It doesn't matter how many times the mind wanders,\" the saint answered. \"If again and again you pray to God, He will answer.\" One month after this incident, the wife of the doctor's brother became very ill. She was under the care of a naturopath who advised that recovery would depend on her having fresh grapes. But the fruit was out of season. When the doctor, her brother-in-law, heard this, he remembered the words of the saint: that God would hear his prayers. He whispered to his brother, \"I will get some grapes.\" The doctor sent a servant to the shops, but there were no grapes to be had. So the doctor prayed for a way to find some of the precious fruit. Day passed, and evening; at midnight he heard a knock on the door. He went to open it and there stood a man with a basket of grapes.

He took the grapes to his brother's wife, who with the aid of the blessed fruit recovered quickly from her illness. The doctor himself told me this story. The experience had changed his life. However, one should not seek God for the sake of such ex- periences. As long as there is a desire for phenomena, God Him- self will not come. Let no one know what is in your heart, what your soul feels. Inwardly you must continuously ask for His presence. He will come. This is the day above all others that you should try to receive Him. Forget the past. This can be the greatest day of your life, if you will only make the effort. You have passed so much time thinking of worldly pleasures. This day you should pray with all your heart; this is the greatest op- portunity you have ever had to offer the bouquet of your devo- tion to God. Often, when I have least expected it, God has come. Many times as I have walked by the ocean in Encinitas He has come. Saint Francis and the Great Ones have come. Even now they are all here with you. The astral heaven is just behind the gross vi- bration of this world. Last night dear Seva Devi's spirit* in a perfect astral form came to me and said, \"I am free.

What is the purpose of cele- brating, if not to experience the birth of Christ Consciousness in ourselves? Just realize what that means! It is wrong to deviate from the purpose of Christmas, which is to worship Christ in spirit. It was Christ who inspired me to hold these long medita- tions a day or two before Christmas. Many people in this coun- try are now following this observance, and I hope that in time every church and family that honors Christ will observe a pre- Christmas day of silence and meditation. Silence is the altar of God. We must not only silence our thoughts,- we must commune with Christ. Christ is everywhere present, within you and without—a resplendent light. The baby Christ is born in the cradle of our love. Think of this today. Make every day a new birth of Christ Consciousness in your life. Spread this message everywhere. I hope each one of you will sponsor this idea in your home and in every other home. You minimize your power. Awaken souls who have closed their eyes to God.

It is up to you to see that light in yourself by long, deep communion— by a continuous expression of your love to the Almighty. As in watching an engrossing movie one easily forgets all else, so the lover of God forgets everything but the Beloved. The ordinary man doesn't have enough devotion to feel God's pres- ence, because his mind is habitually on material things rather than on Divinity. If movies and sex and worldly pleasures can hold one's attention for hours, then think how engrossing must be communion with God, the most entertaining Being in the uni- verse! The trouble is that most people don't try to know Him. If you know Him, hours slip away in the greatest divine intoxica- tion. I find no joy in anything else, no matter what I am doing, unless God is with me. And when I am disgusted with this world, I shut the doors of the senses and commune with God alone.

All possible variety is there; you don't find it because you don't wait for it. But after you cross the threshold of the subconscious mind, you begin to feel a great superconscious joy that intoxicates mind and body and soul. In that state hours and hours pass and the devotee is not conscious of the world. There is a smile for the world on many a face, but it loses its luster if there is not behind it the smile of God. I see the end of everything; I see that all human pleasures lead down blind alleys. God doesn't want to impose Himself on you. You must seek Him out. He has given you the love you feel in your heart, and you misuse it to tie yourself to a few other human beings, whom you think of as your own. You forget, in binding your- self to your own little family, that they will all be snatched away from you. It is God you are loving in them, and it is you He is loving through them. No one can love God who has not love for his family and friends; but he who loses himself in human love will lose God. It is He who loves us as father, mother, children, and friends. When we forget the purpose of this drama we punish ourselves by our own ignorance. Don't be deluded by worldly goals. Even though I am ambitious for the work of Self-Realization [Yogoda Satsanga], I am free in my heart, knowing that the drama is being performed at God's will. I know He loves me and I love Him. I love Him more than anything else. There is nothing else at all that enthralls my at- tention.

Don't waste your time. Once in a while let your mind run here and there, but don't be bound by attachment to anything. Shut yourself in seclusion and meditate.

No matter how Satan tries to take me away (and he does try, even after years of my following this path), I see that I have God. He is always in my heart.

The taste of matter is as poison in my mouth; I drink of Thy nectar now. There is nothing to compare to this experience, O Lord! I dedicate my life, my thoughts, my desires unto Thee. I found my desires to be but blind alleys, leading to infinite disappointments; but I have learned the les- son that in desiring the things that Thou dost wish me to have, Beloved God, I find all-fulfillment.

If you befriend yourself, you will find accomplishment.* There is no law of God preventing you from being what you want to be and ac- complishing what you want to accomplish.

Let nothing weaken your conviction that you can be what- ever you want to be. There is no one obstructing you unless it be yourself. Though my master Swami Sri Yukteswarji again and again told me that, it was hard to believe it at first. But as I used the God-given gift of will power in my life, I found it to be my savior. Not to use the will is to be inert like a stone, an inanimate object—an ineffectual human being. The Power of Thought So many people are not only physically lazy but mentally idle as well. Constructive thought will absolutely, like a great hidden searchlight, show you the pathway to success. There is always a way to be found if you think hard enough. People who give up after a little while bedim their power of thought. In order to gain your end, you must do your utmost to use thought until it is luminous enough to reveal to you the way to your goal. The power of suggestion is very strong. The ability to ac- complish is all in the mind. Your body itself is virtually sus- tained by thought. Food is only incidental; the main power sus- taining you is your mind, your consciousness. It is thought that brings energy into the body. When thought is neutralized, the body feels weak and begins to decay. God's thought is the essence of everything. It is living, it is infinite. Out of the Infinite Vastness, everything Has been drawn. God pulls a thought out of His consciousness and that thought becomes a living being. He pulls out another thought and tells it to become a flower, and it becomes a certain kind of blossom; other thoughts become mountains, or gems, or stars. Cast away all negative thoughts and fears. Remember that as a child of God you are endowed with the same potentialities as the most excellent among men. As souls, none is greater than another. Attune your will to be guided by the wisdom of God as expressed in the wisdom of the sages. If your will is yoked to wisdom, you can achieve anything. Fear inhibits progress.

Fear of death is ridiculous, because as long as you are not dead you are alive, and when you are dead there is nothing more to worry about! It is something we all have to go through, so it couldn't be so bad. We are waves on the surface of the sea; and for a time in death our consciousness becomes enwrapped in the Infinite Oneness whence we came. It is noth- ing to regret, but rather a rest, a pension, from the travails of life—a promotion to a greater freedom.* Retain evenness of mind under all circumstances. In every situation be calmly active and actively calm. Banish all disillu- sionment, all disappointments you might have found in losses and suffering. These constraints on the power of thought and will must absolutely be done away with. Your trials did not come to punish you, but to awaken you—to make you realize that you are a part of Spirit and that just behind the spark of your life is the Flame of Infinity; just behind the glimmer of your thoughts is the Great Light of God; just behind your dis- criminative reason is the omniscience of Spirit; just behind your love is the all-fulfilling love of God. If you would just realize that! Do not disconnect yourself from God. He did not make anyone more privileged than another. All are made alike in His image; but not all reflect equally His Divine Light, due to their desires and bad habits. Your fulfillment lies not in obtaining the objects of your desire, but in the unfoldment of your soul qual- ities in making the effort to succeed in worthwhile endeavors. There is nothing to prevent you from feeling that great Power behind your life. It is your bad habits that tell you otherwise. Bad Habits Are Your Worst Enemies Bad habits are the worst enemies you can have. You are punished by those habits. They make you do things you do not want to do, and leave you to suffer the consequences. You must drop bad habits and leave them behind you as you move forward.

Never concede that a habit has a hold on you. \"How can I be made to do what I don't like to do?\" That very thought keeps you going ahead in spite of habits that try to hold you back. Your conscious mind has been conditioned to think that it is self-hypnotized by bad habits. When the thought comes that you are used to smoking or overeating, you feel immediately that you have to smoke or to eat. But when you refuse to acknowledge that habit, that is the end of it. You must develop \"won't\" habits. And stay away from those things that stimulate bad habits. Do not test yourself with temptation. Bad habits are constantly telling you that you cannot suc- ceed in conquering them,- but you can do it. Deny completely your wrong habits. Make up your mind to succeed. The mind is everything; it is all-powerful. Mind can control life and death. So let this New Year be one of determination. We have no right to bring the dead happenings of the past year into the new year. You are the child of God. What of past evils that have been done? You are awakened; nothing can hold you back unless you give it permission to do so. You are the master of your own fate. You are fortunate because God has no partiality,- He loves you just as much as He loves Jesus and the great saints. He is Unconditional Love, because He Himself is in everything.

Balance material and spiritual duties in your life; that will bring you supreme happiness. Be ambitious for God, which will help you to play your part well. God would not have given you a brain if He didn't want you to think and rea- son. He would not have given you a will if He didn't expect you to use it.

Nevertheless, you do have to keep busy just the same; but do not forget that this life is just a play. You must play well, but with the thought of God. Do your duties because you want to please God. Flying away from your dutiful activities will not save you, because that is not His plan. He Himself is eternally busy running His universe for our benefit. Nothing could be created or accomplished by anybody unless it was first born in the mind of God. We are only His instruments empowered to innovate changes and modifications for the betterment of our- selves and others. Use your God-given creative ability; that is the basis of success. Whatever has been done, try to improve upon it. The man of creative ability is among God's best in- struments. He makes improvements on himself and on what evolution has thus far given to his earthly environment. God moves through such willing innovators. Be active and use your will power and reason, all the time thinking that just behind your life is God's life, just behind your will is God's will. To find out what the Lord's will is, use your reason,- don't just sit by and wait for things to come your way. Use your will; but ask God to guide you, and believe in His guid- ance.

Never wish to be in the shoes of someone else who you think is better off than you are. It is best to wish for nothing, but to ask the Lord to give you what is for your highest good. You are a part of the Lord's creation; He needs everybody to carry on this drama. Never compare yourself with anybody else. You are what you are. Nobody is like you.

Do not let your resolutions and pos- itive thinking be poisoned by bad company. Even if you cannot find good company to inspire you, you can find it in medita- tion.

In that state you re- alize: \"I am not the ego ; I have feeling, but I am not the feel- ings; I reason, but I am not the intellect; I have a body, but I am the Spirit.\" Your devotion, like a plummet, must go deeper and deeper into the sea of divine perception. Those whose eyes of inner sight are opened in meditation will perceive the Presence of God right here, in the heart. As long as there will be a demon dance of restlessness and desires in the temple of the body, the Father will be away.

In sleep you are not the body; you have no body. When you wake up, you limit yourself to the delusion of the flesh, but when you close your eyes you can feel your consciousness unbounded. I see this little body as frozen sky ; and as I meditate, the body becomes the vast sky, swept up in the infinitude of God. Frozen sky means frozen fancy, frozen imagination, as the im- ages in a dream. In dreams you see people born and laugh and die, but when you wake up everything is gone. Similarly, this body is a condensation of the vastness of space. But that is not how it appears to you. When you are awake in ordinary con- sciousness, the body and its circumscriptions seem real, but you are actually dreaming. When you will forsake the dream of delusion in the true wakefulness of meditation, you will real- ize that your earthly experiences were frozen thoughts of God. Dreams in subconscious sleep are our own frozen thoughts, and we are the frozen dream-thoughts of God. To get out of this dream, you must wake up in Him. That wakefulness is reality. That is what I see every minute, every second; that conscious- ness remains always with me. I am telling you these things as I am feeling them within. I don't want to lecture anymore.

That is why your peace is to be guarded above everything else. If you can retain your inner peace, therein lies your su- preme victory. No matter how you are situated in life, never feel justified in losing your peace. When that is gone and you cannot think clearly, you have lost the battle. If you never lose your peace, you will find you are always victorious, no matter what the outcome of your problems. That is the way to conquer life. You have nothing to fear. If you have to be afraid at all, be afraid only of yourself. But if you do everything with sincerity and love in your heart, you do not have to fear anybody or any- thing. As you find your soul-reservoir of peace, less and less controversy will be able to afflict your life. One who loves God lives in the soul, his true Self. He does everything for God, nothing for himself. He loves every- body, because he sees the world as the Lord's cosmic show. He can never be provoked to say or do anything in anger or with egotism, but only with desire to be of help to all. That is the attitude you must have. It has to be lived. It cannot come by any amount of pretense, but only when you see God in every- one—when you love everybody as a part of your love for God. With each one of you that I am working for I feel that same tie that you feel with your families—I feel the same sense of oneness with all humanity as you feel with your closest rela- tives. No one can describe that feeling. When it comes, that is when you begin to understand the meaning and beauty of life.

In the temple of the soul is the most beautiful perfect pres- ence of God. Those who have complete love for God, who are floating in the love of God, can see His wonderful presence in all; but at the same time, they can see the blindness of those persons whose eyes are closed in error and ignorance. The lover of God thus sees both the darkness and the light in others. For example, there is a magnificent temple: those whose eyes are open see the beauty; but those who keep their eyes closed see not the temple but darkness. So it is that great souls are able to see God's glorious presence in all soul temples; but with that same light they see those who are stumbling in darkness be- cause their eyes are closed. I never wanted to be a teacher. I observed that that status often gives one the consciousness of knowing much when he knows very little. It was only when Master [Swami Sri Yuk- teswar] said to me, \"You would not have received this wisdom if I had not given it to you,\" that I dedicated my life to teach- ing. As my Master gave this truth to me, so did he encourage me to give it unselfishly to others. If you would be a teacher, you must be sincere. Whatever you say, you must feel from within. If you are upright and hon- est, your spirit can never be bribed to deviate from God's prin- ciples. You cannot be unkind because you are not activated by egotism or anger. What you do, you do with the utmost sincer- ity. Behave in that way—whether you are teaching from the pul- pit or by the life you live—and see what happens to transform your life and the lives of those you seek to help. Be sincere and fearless in truth from this moment on. Wherever you go, let the Lord, not your ego, speak through you. You do not have to be shrewd with people; you have to be genuine. If you are gen- uine, everyone who is sincere will be harmonious with you— you will receive genuine feeling from them. If you approach others not with the attitude of bossing or anger but with sincere love, there are very few people who will misunderstand you.

If one loves the Father of all, and if he has the slightest thought of revenge toward anyone or desire to punish anyone, he falls a million miles away from God. One who loves God dares not entertain thoughts of doing injury to anyone. It would be wrong, of course, to support anyone blindly. But nonsupport of the wrongdoing in others does not mean that anyone should vengefully hurt others. A philosopher once said: \"The best sort of revenge is not to be like him who did the injury.\" We should have respect for others' opinions as we wish others to respect our opinions,- there is no room for ugliness. We should lovingly disagree as well as lovingly agree. Judge Yourself Before God and Your Conscience It is easy to be a master in words, but it requires a tremen- dous amount of strength to be a master living with people. Every- one sees and judges you according to his own mind. Years ago there was a young boy who traveled with us on a lecture tour from the East Coast to Los Angeles. He went out of his way to criticize everything. Before lecture time I used to comb my long hair. He was always analyzing me, but he didn't know that I had my mental camera on him also. After two weeks I said to him, \"I would like to have a chat with you. What have you been writ- ing about me in your letters?\" He looked startled and said, \"Someone has been opening my letters.\" I said, \"Then you ad- mit it. Since I knew you were doing so, I wanted to give you something to write about, so I have taken special pains to stand before the mirror and exaggerate the combing of my hair.\" He was ashamed. What you are before God and your own conscience, that is what you are. Even if the whole world misunderstands you, nothing is lost; you are what you are. To stand criticism is a very effective way of becoming a better individual. Though it is eas- ier to criticize others than to find fault in yourself, it is of prime importance to correct yourself first. I learned from Master to pick myself to pieces when criticized. If I find any flaw there, I correct myself; and when I do not find anything, I smile. Conviction of truth is the paramount factor in satisfying your soul; never surrender or compromise that. When some-"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"382 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION body criticizes or contradicts just to satisfy an egotistical de- sire to appear superior or dominant, that is wrong. Intelligent people can quickly find a level of agreement because they have a sympathetic attitude. My Master had such awesome wisdom that I used to enjoy engaging him in controversial discussions. When my understanding was faulty, he stood firm on his points. Sometime later I would understand and see where I was wrong. When your vision is guided by Divine Power, you do not swerve at all. You always feel the guiding hand of Spirit. That is the attunement you want to maintain in your life. Be fearless, sin- cere, and loving and you will be able to look everyone in the face, knowing that you have done your best, sincerely. If you want to prove to somebody your sincerity, let your actions speak for you. God sends to you those experiences you need, that you might profit by them. If you run away from those lessons, you will still have to learn them sometime, somewhere else. Every experience is a good teacher if you learn from it; but it is a tyrant if you abuse that opportunity with resentment and nonunder- standing. With right attitude, life is very simple and very easy. Only Spiritual Relationships Are Lasting I hope all of you will understand my words. I have given myself entirely to God; and whatever He says to me I tell you. I believe that whatever God gives me has some practical value, and that it applies to all those who are near and dear to me. As I have said, I have no relatives. Each one of you who loves God is my own. The nature-ordained compulsion of the famil- ial relationship is misleading; but the spiritual relationship is lasting, because God is our Father and we are His children. A mother loves her child now; but if that child dies and is reborn next door to her, she won't recognize that child in the same way. But the spiritual relationship is the strongest bond be- cause it is continuous from one lifetime to another. In the ultimate sense, as we are all the children of God we must learn to love everyone wholeheartedly and completely and impartially. I remember when my Master asked me, \"Do you love everybody equally?\" I said, \"Yes.\" But he said, \"Not yet, not yet.\" Then my youngest brother came to study in my school"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"BE A CONQUEROR OF HEARTS 383 at Ranchi, * and I had that consciousness that he was mine. I realized then why my Master had said, \"Not yet.\" Gradually that consciousness wore off, and I realized that my brother was but a part of all humanity which I loved. That is not an insen- sitive, inhuman attitude. You love all alike, as God does. Then you learn to do for others as you would do for your own. One day, again, Master asked me, \"Do you love the whole world?\" I just said, \"I love.\" And he smiled and said, \"Your work is finished.\" It was the greatest joy when I went back to India in 1935-36 and found that my love for the land of my birth was not nar- row, but that I felt that same love for all nations. When years earlier I was leaving my family home to follow this path, my father, who was the dearest to me after my mother's death, said, \"Who will look after your brothers and sisters if I die?\" I said, \"Father, I love you more than anyone in the world; but He who has given you to me, I love greatest of all. I could not have appreciated you, nor could you appreciate me, if it were not for God. Someday, when I come to you with that Father's con- sciousness throbbing in my bosom, you will feel more that I was worthy of your love.\" God's love is the supreme love. There is no love greater than that. The love that is bom of instinct has its defects because it is compelled. That is why I sang to God as Divine Mother, \"In this world, Mother, no one can love me,- in this world they do not know how to love me.\"+ Only the divine love of great ones is bom of wisdom. That love is infinitely greater than parental or any other form of human love—Jesus gave up his life for the world. Who cares for my soul but God and my Master. It was Mas- ter who guarded me always—guarded me from ignorance, actu- ated only by love. He showed infinite love to give me wisdom. I can see those eyes in which there was naught else than the Supreme Love. * Yogoda Satsanga Vidyalaya, founded by Paramahansa Yogananda in 1918.

The love of the mother is close to the perfection of God's love, because she loves us when no- body else does; and she forgives when we are in error. But the ultimate expression of God's love is the love of a true guru. He loves us unconditionally,- and out of that sublime love he in- structs and disciplines us for the everlasting welfare of our souls. Though I shall always dearly love my mother, my love for my Master is supreme. Real Love Versus Selfish Love Do everything with the attitude of love—love for God and for God in all. It is hard for the ordinary person to tell the dif- ference between a desire for others' good and a desire to sat- isfy self-love. Often one who is well-intentioned in caring for others is carried away instead by self-love. When the desire for self-interest is gone completely from the consciousness, and the only desire is to serve others and do the highest good for all, that is wisdom. It is very difficult to do ; but when selfish love completely goes, then one tastes divine love. Real love is when you are constantly watching the prog- ress of the soul. As soon as you cater to someone's physical de- sires and bad habits you are not loving that soul anymore. You are just pleasing that person to avoid ill will. No matter how unpleasant it is to tell a friend that he is wrong, if you say it with love in your heart and stand firm on it, sometime that person will respect you if you are right. If you are wrong, even then he will know that you did it with sincerity, out of love. Never agree with anyone who is wrong, not even those who are nearest and dearest to you. To agree with wrongdoing is to bribe your soul in order to be looked upon favorably by the wrongdoer, and that will come out later on in some disastrous results. Do not fight; that is not the way to convince them. The way to influence others is by your love. Say what you have to say once or twice and then disband it from your mind. Be humble and free from anger. Just say, \"Let us wait and see. Time will tell.\" Time brings out everything; and if there is a"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"BE A CONQUEROR OF HEARTS 385 sympathetic understanding between friends, there will be no \"I was right and you were wrong\" attitude. So this is my prayer to you, that all of you learn how to be true friends, how to be truly loving souls. If you have that divine attitude, you will be conquerors of hearts. There is noth- ing more satisfying than that. You will never be alone, for you will attract to yourself real souls. Even if you are left alone, you are with God. You do not know how wonderful is that kind of love. It is sublime. At times you glimpse it when you are very happy and feel that oneness with God in others—when you love each other because .God is your Father, irrespective of any human relation. Attachment Cannot Form a Spiritual Bond; Love Can We are gathered here to travel together for a little while. Then in diverse directions we have to go; but if we have di- vine love in our souls, no matter where we go we shail meet again in the kingdom of the Lord. We can never remain apart; we will be drawn to one another again. Attachment cannot form this spiritual bond; love can. Nature is dancing this danse macabre, the dance of death. Love outlasts death and the rav- ages of time. All those that I have loved before, in this or other lifetimes, I love the same now. Attachment is disastrous, because it is that which is com- pulsive and limiting. As soon as a child is born the mother falls in love with it. That feeling is impressed on the mother by nature, otherwise she would not take care of the helpless infant. The compulsion to love our family members was given to us as our first lesson in learning to give love to all, uncondi- tionally. But attachment spoils family love, and all forms of human relationships, because it excludes others and is blindly possessive. Disband attachment and learn to give true, sincere love to all. True love is impersonal and is not bound by any- thing. Our eyes bubble over with love, and we feel a wonderful togetherness,- we feel we are one. Once in a while that is felt in ordinary life, but then it is so easily mutilated by familiarity and lack of respect. We must learn to love our family purely, to love our friends purely, to love our country purely, and to love all mankind"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"386 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION purely.

Karmically, her wealth and power were broken by foreign domination when under the influence of egotism the upper classes said, \"We are Aryans,\" and began to exclude and demean others in the demarcations of the caste system.* But India will regain her former status because of her spirituality. The perfected love of family, the perfected love of friends, the perfected love of nations, the perfected love of all man- kind—that is the love of God, when impartially you are ready to live and to die for all. That is the reason I take this interest in all of you. As I enjoy God in Encinitas, He has made me feel that I have been neglectful of you.t It is that sense of spiritual duty, born of my love for God and for you all, that has brought me here to you. I have no other desire but the desire for God, and no other ambition than the ambition to work for God. It is God who has brought us together. It is the greatest opportunity that anyone could have—to be able to serve God. When we will be gone from this earth, many souls shall come and feel our vibrations here. Whenever we leave good vibra- tions behind, we leave a part of our eternal lives. Shakespeare is gone, Lincoln is gone, but they have left some immortal part of their lives here. So have my Master and Paramgurus.t As long as the name of this earth shall last, vibrations left by great souls shall last; and whenever this earth shall go, that record shall rest in the bosom of the Father. So shall we leave \"footprints in the sands of time\"—spir- itual footprints of good vibrations, which those who come af- ter us will feel. If we increase those vibrations by our love for God and service to His work, think how wonderful will be what we leave behind us. * See caste in glossary. t Since his return from India in 1936, Paramahansaji had been spending much time at the Self-Realization Fellowship Hermitage in Encinitas, where he could work on his writings in relative seclusion, t See glossary."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"BE A CONQUEROR OF HEARTS 387 Cooperate With One Another for the Good of All In an institution the law of freedom depends on a common law.

A man of humility easily exercises a spiritual influence on others. Such a one has the satisfaction that he has done his best on this earth. That is what the avatar King Rama said: \"I am Rama whose throne is the hearts of all.\" Those who reign in true hearts, they are the real kings. No one can feel egotism if God is in the heart.

If we all have God's love in our hearts, we shall one day reach that land where all the screens of misun- derstandings will be gone—when our souls and our thoughts shall be crystal clear. We came on earth to love each other with God's perfect love, free from any selfish desires. We all feel that way some- times, but then it is taken away by Satan. Satan is inharmony and misunderstanding. God is Love and Love is God. Do not take it too seriously if anyone says unkind things about you. Just give love in return. Whoever does not understand you, just look at that person with love in your eyes, love that is born of com- plete understanding, and you will see how that person changes. \"Whatever I Have Said, I Have Said From My Heart\" What I say is not merely words, but what I feel for all of you. It would be the easiest thing to remain silent, or to go away and live under a tree with God alone. If ever I have of- fended through ignorance, I ask your forgiveness. My con- science is clear. I have nothing to fear. Whatever I have said, I have said from my heart. If you follow, you shall please God; and if you do not, it shall grieve God. But nothing you could do could cause me to feel anger toward you, because I have no desire of my own; my only desire is to please God and serve you all for your own sake. Let us pray: \"Heavenly Father, give us true love for all; and help us especially to practice that love with sincerity toward one another. Let us feel and manifest that love that we may enjoy eternity with all liberated souls, for Thou, O God, art that Love.\" The Lord gave me a vision of the entire world, just now as I am talking to you. He said, \"I love all and have given freedom to all to cast Me away or accept Me. If they follow My wishes or go against Me, still I love them all. Though I gave the world My love, heedlessly they are destroying one another with hatred, killing each other with bombs—still I love them all. They shall feel My love if they seek it in the temples of hearts.

If by free choice one walks that narrow path with single-heartedness, and doesn't flinch or give up because of its incisiveness, he will reach God. It sounds difficult; but I maintain that the path is very simple if one makes up his mind to go all the way for the love of God. Whosoever loves God can never think of turning back. Though the right attitude makes the path simple, that does not mean one will not encounter any conflicts and trou- bles along the way. But they do not dismay the true devotee. Among the tests that might be faced, doubt is a devastat- ing obstacle. So many people get caught in the indecisiveness of doubt—in speculation about God; in wondering if it is re- ally possible to know Him, and if so, whether they them- selves have the capability to find Him. Several incarnations are often wasted in such irresolute thinking. I see how many seekers come and go on the path, giving in to the ways of delusion. I look at their karma from the past; and though I am saddened by their lack of determination, I understand. That is why I am never overencouraged when devotees come, and never discouraged by those who leave. I know exactly where the karma of each person is leading. But that pattern need not remain an absolute. If one listens to a master, he can change that self-created blueprint; he can over- come his karma. If one is in doubt about proper diet, he doesn't give up eating.

That is the sure way to succeed on the spiritual path. The Blind Cannot Lead the Blind There are many who are trying to lead others, but who have no right to lead. The blind cannot lead the blind. No one can take you to God unless he himself has found God. Societies develop around charismatic personalities, but they die out with those personalities. A true guru has no personal ambition for name or fame,- his one desire is to serve others with the real- ization of God. I sought all over India to find a true master. I searched in books; I journeyed from temple to temple, from one holy place to another; but my doubts followed me everywhere. But when I found that one who had realization—my guru, Sri Yuktes- warji—and saw that spirit divine in his eyes, all doubt went away. Through his blessing my whole life changed. That is why I stress to you the importance of following a true guru and his teachings. I told Master I would never teach about God unless I had tasted Him. By following Guru unconditionally, I found God. When you are steadfast in the principles of the guru-disciple relationship, the spiritual path becomes very easy. You cannot then go astray. No matter how delusion tries to pull you away, the master who has experienced God knows your trouble and will help you to steady yourself on the path again. That is what the guru does for you if you are in tune with him. Even though you and the guru may be thousands of miles apart, his help will reach out to you. I feel Master with me all the time, even though he is no longer incarnate on this earth plane. To have the guid- ance and grace of guru with you—that is the easiest way to move along on the spiritual path.

So why this seeming separation?\" Haphazard seekers ex- cuse their spiritual lethargy by rationalizing: \"My mind is too restless/' or, \"I am too sensual,\" and so on. Never concentrate on your faults. By doing so you identify yourself with them. You are the one who puts the veil of delusion in front of your wis- dom's eyes. Whatsoever you think, that is what you are. During the day you are tied to the remembrance of your weaknesses, but every night when you forget the world in sleep you also forget your limitations. In deep sleep you are pure Spirit, one with your Infinite Self. Why can't you realize that in the daytime? Every night God shows you what you are; why doubt it? You are not the bundle of bones and flesh at all. Con- sciously or unconsciously you are with God. Beyond the dream state, the true Self is manifest. \"Beyond the flights of fancy, form- less am I.\"* Your consciousness is expanded in the omnipresent Spirit. Hold on to the thought that every night you are with Spirit; only temporarily do you forget Him in the daytime. Of all the things God has given to man, it could be said that His greatest gift is sleep, because it is the forgetting of this mortal dream, a respite from mortal consciousness. The ordi- nary man has no other escape, but even the crudest man has spiritual refreshment in the unconscious samadhii of sleep. Yet in contrast to conscious samadhi, sleep is a sort of nar- cotic. I have played with sleep. I have approached the sleep state, and then remained in between wakefulness and somno- lence. And sometimes I do sleep deeply, and can at the same time watch myself sleeping. By the control of these states of consciousness, different realizations of the workings of the soul and ego came to me. Tonight when you drift into deep sleep you shall forget all of your weaknesses gathered through countless incarnations. You will be locked in the embrace of the Spirit.

Kriya Yoga meditation helps you to establish your consciousness in that state. Regain Your Divine Nature It isn't only meditation that I emphasize. Meditation plus keeping your mind with God during activity is what -is neces- sary. Half the battle will be won by meditation, for the soul power that you bring out by meditation will influence your thoughts and behavior during activity. When you meditate deeply, that gives substantiation to your spiritual thoughts. The longer and deeper you meditate on a regular basis, the more you will find there is no difference between work and meditation. That is to say, whether you are working or meditating, you remain immersed in the divine consciousness of the blissful Spirit. You no longer identify yourself with the activities and aches and pains of a mortal body; you realize you are pure Spirit. The body is a nest of delusion. It makes us believe in the reality of this finite world. But when we are with God, that seeming reality is gone. It is that simple. In the samadhi state of meditation, we consciously enjoy the blissful awareness of God as the Sole Reality. Why do you give up your divine nature? Why do you put on all kinds of moods and emotions, which distort the expres- sion of what you really are? Practice evenminded calmness all the time. Become a king, an absolute monarch, of your own mental realm of calmness. In calmness, the mind is wholly free of emotional agitations. Unless the mind is calm, God will be obscured. So let nothing disturb your peaceable kingdom of calmness. Night and day carry with you the joy of \"the peace of God, which passeth all understanding.\"* Moods are your greatest enemy. Don't indulge in them; de- stroy them, for they are a formidable stumbling block in the path of your progress. With the relentless might of watchful- ness guard yourself against moods. No matter what trials come, I never permit moods to enter my consciousness. And I prefer not to mix with anyone who is moody. I won't give heed to their moods, because they are very contagious.

And don't find fault with others,- correct yourself. The whole world may mistreat you, but why should you mistreat yourself by wrong behavior? Do Not Accept Limiting Influences Remember that all of your troubles are only grafts on your consciousness. They do not belong to your soul. So why accept their limiting influence? Why be fearful or doubtful? Why say that you are restless or moody, or that you can't meditate? Such statements are a lie, for they contradict the truth of your real Self. Rather, inwardly affirm, \"I am a child of God. I am with Him,- He is with me.\" For these many years since childhood, even though sometimes my mind might have been restless, still I do not remember a week or a day, or even a minute, that I have not been inwardly with Him—night and day. That is the way to live your life. In the beginning—and perhaps for years— you have to make constant effort; and then the need for effort is past, for you are always with God. The would-be concert pi- anist must practice and practice, until finally the music becomes a part of him. As the writer is always thinking of his composi- tions, and as the inventive engineer is always thinking of me- chanics, so the divine man is all the time thinking of God. To have that constant remembrance of God is to be intensely happy. Nothing can describe that divine joy. Yesterday I was busy all day with people, and it was late before I could get to my time of silence. But when I sat in my room to meditate, my mind was instantly with God. I prayed, \"Lord, You are myself.\" And as soon as I said that, the world floated away from my consciousness and I was in complete ecstasy with God.

Every day I scold Him. I say, \"Lord, haven't You gathered much bad karma for creating this troublesome world?\" But I know He has no karma. And when you realize your oneness with Him, that you are made in His image, you have no karma either. That is why I do not stress too much the theory of karma. The more you hold on to the concept of limitation, the more you bind yourself. Jesus said, \"Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?\"* The advanced attitude is not to dwell on the idea of sin, for it is a lie. When a sleeping prince is dreaming that he is a beggar and cries out in anguish at his poverty and hunger, you do not say to him, \"Beggar, wake up!\" You say, \"Prince, wake up!\" Similarly, why should anyone call himself or another a sin- ner? Forget that notion. No matter what mistakes you have made, hold constantly to the thought, \"Lord, I am made in Thine image.\" You have within you the power to be good! Want Naught Else but God What is the use of just crying and bewailing your lot? Make up your mind that you can have God in this lifetime. To Him you must go, because in Him is your home. As long as you stay away from God, there will be no end to your trou- bles—physical, moral or mental, or spiritual. You do not know what you may have to go through. But you have enough intel- ligence to know your Self and to realize that you must go back to God whence you came. Your love for God should be so great that you want naught else but Him. I cannot think of any desire to ask of Him. Some- times I do ask for something in connection with His work, and He grants it—often immediately. But I can never ask for anything for myself except, \"Be Thou with me always. It doesn't matter what trials come to me ; just give me the strength to meet them with Thy consciousness. But never test me, Lord, with Your absence.\" * John 10:34 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"396 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION Often I tell the Lord: \"I am on to Your tricks now. You have created this world enticing to the senses to find out whether we love You or Your creation. I want only You, my Lord. There is no one who can help me or fill my heart but You—only You.\" Talk to God in that way. He will make you think He is not responding. But when you are least looking for it, if you have complete love and trust, He will answer you. Even when you think God is away from you, if still you are continuously long- ing for Him—\"Why isn't He coming?\"—He is with you. Re- member that. He is watching you. He knows every thought you think, every feeling you feel. To keep the mind full of rubbish is foolish. Fill your mind with thoughts of God. Pray for the un- ceasing remembrance of God. Think of Him before you act, while you are acting, and after you have finished your duties. \"He who perceives Me everywhere and beholds everything in Me never loses sight of Me, nor do I ever lose sight of him.\"* He is nearest of the near, dearest of the dear, closer than the closest. Hold on to the truth that God is the most important thing in your life. So long as you cling to human love, or life, or beauty, or fame, or money, or anything else as more important, He will not come to you. You were sent on earth to experience God's cosmic show and then return to your abode in Him, but you have made this movie-house your home. This is no longer a home for me. To the worldly person, that seems very strange to say; but it is the most wonderful consciousness. What else could you want when you have established yourself in never-ending happiness? When you are in that ever new joy, how can you be in a mood or angry or crave this or that? You have no time for such mor- tal entanglements. I find that I am inwardly aloof from every- thing now, locked in oneness with God. I am not interested in anything else—except in those who are interested in God. The idea of joining a religious congregation in order to acquire health or wealth or power is nonsense. These are diverting ideas. Of course health is better than sickness, and success is better than failure, but the purpose of religion is to take you to God. Somehow you must get back to Him. * Bhagavad Gita VI:30."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"HOW TO QUICKEN YOUR SPIRITUAL PROGRESS 397 The only way we know to please God is to cast away all de- sires, even the desire for health.

Neither should you be- come too engrossed in the world, because then you will not be able to remain inwardly nonattached. Those who out of laziness forsake all duties on the pretext of seeking God in seclusion multiply their troubles. Their moods, their passions, their weak- nesses accompany them wherever they go. Dutiful action com- bined with meditation is the surer way to conquer the little self. Why Should God Amuse Us With Powers and Miracles? Another flaw common to unsettled spiritual seekers is that they begin to feel spiritually stale when the Lord doesn't give them phenomenal demonstrations. Why should God amuse us with powers and miracles? If you are inclined toward these, you do not want God; and you will not find Him. When you truly desire God, you do not crave anything else, and that includes powers. The attainment of the ability to perform miraculous feats is not necessarily an indication that one knows God. The divine man doesn't care for such capabilities; he worships the Sole Power—God. When you know God, you may not yourself possess miraculous powers, but at your command lies all the power of the universe if you need it. God gave me many pow- ers in this life, but I gave them back to Him; I use them only if He tells me to do so. There is a story of the mystic Madhusudan, and his meet- ing with Gorakhnath, the saint of Gorakhpur, where my body was born. When I heard this story, that cured me of any wish for miraculous powers. Gorakhnath had attained all the eight powers, or aiswaryas, of a fully enlightened yogi. * At the time of his departure from the body, he wanted to bestow his pow- ers on some worthy soul. The masters can do that, even as * The aiswaryas or siddhis, divine powers that manifest as the yogi advances through the highest stages of spiritual evolution, are discussed by Patanjali in his Yoga Sutras, section EH; and by Swami Sri Yukteswar in chapter 4 of The Holy Science (published by Yogoda Satsanga Society of India)."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"398 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION the mantle of Elijah's power was passed to Elisha. * One day Gorakhnath saw in vision a young man, a very spiritual soul, standing by the Ganges in Banaras.

You are obstructing the sun.\" The saint replied, \"Do you not know who I am? I am Gorakhnath.\" \"I know,\" the young man said, \"but I am busy now with my devotions.\" After some time the devotee inquired of the saint, \"What is it you want of me?\" Gorakhnath explained, \"I have eight powers,- and the one to whom I give this chintamani [a mystical gem that grants all wishes] will have these powers. I wish to offer them to you.\" Madhusudan said, \"All right, give them to me.\" Where- upon, to the great astonishment of Gorakhnath, he took the mystical gem and threw it far out into the waters of the Ganges. \"Why did you do that?\" Gorakhnath demanded. Then the young man said, \"Delusion still, delusion still. Those powers were given to me to do with as I wished, were they not? Well, that is the only use I have for them. Compared to That which I already have, they are nothing.\" The great Gorakhnath bowed down to him and said, \"You have rid me of the last delusion that was keeping me from God.\" Even the great ones sometimes get distracted from the Goal. Gorakhnath was so enamored with his powers that he had not gone beyond them to God. But when at last he re- nounced attachment to that treasured possession, he attained God-union. You see, delusion takes many forms; but the divine devotee is like the single-hearted Madhusudan in this story. When you love God, you do not desire anything else, because God is the most lovable of anything you could possess. The devotee will accept no substitute for God. He knows that God is all in all, that He is ever present, and that He alone is a sure refuge from the travails of life. * II Kings 2:9-14 (Bible)."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"HOW TO QUICKEN YOUR SPIRITUAL PROGRESS 399 Live in the Unchanging Reality At one time, this world seemed so real to me.

In- tellectual discourses about the Creator will not give you God. But by seeking Him within, making the effort every day, you will find Him.

Those who inwardly converse with God are outwardly more silent. No matter what their surroundings, they are ha- bitually more quiet. Because the devotee has plenty to say to God, he has very little to say to others. When those who have much to say to God do speak, their words are of God, and are full of wisdom and understanding. When the perception of God begins, you have no time for useless things. You want to remain by yourself—God and your- self. And you do not want to waste a precious moment that could rather be spent with Him. Even when such devotees are active, that activity never diminishes their perception of love for God. Idle talking causes one to lose devotion for God. It feeds mental restlessness that takes the mind away from Him. Yester- day I was sitting by the pool here in Encinitas. There was a lot of chattering going on. But I was in that Infinite Light wherein the sky and everything was absorbed in divine radiance. I was prac- ticing silence all the while.

So how can I limit that memory by calling them my father and mother? Devotion to parents is next to devotion to God, because your true Parent appointed them to look after you. But your first loyalty should be to God, the Parent behind father and mother. God is your Father, God is your Mother, God is your Supreme Love. With God, parental and other human relation- ships are wonderful; but without God, they are only an inter- play of the laws of karma and nature for this one lifetime. Those relationships would mean nothing if God had not put His thought and love in our hearts. If only you knew how beautiful your soul is, and how you have marred its expression in the ego and jarred that divine con- sciousness through wrong action, you would be astonished. Most people think of this life as so attractive; yet in time they tire of it, and in death go back unconsciously toward the soul. My consciousness is exactly reversed. I live in the soul now, and yet somehow carry on my work in this world. But I do not al- low myself to be attached to anything, for I see the inequities and temporality of life. I see the cruelties—the big fish eating the little fish, one animal living on the flesh of another, life fighting life, the horrors of poverty and disease. I say, \"Lord, this is Your show. So be it.

But now see how life is. All those dreams are gone. In the same way, this episode in life will pass away. But as long as it exists for you, have but one trend of thought in your mind—God.

We are the ones who must free ourselves from delusion; and the only way is through wisdom. The more you will deeply seek understand- ing from God, the more you will receive His answers. The true devotee, even when enmeshed in many doubts, never loses his devotion and determination. Even true devotees think sometimes that God does not an- swer their prayers. He does answer silently, through His laws; but until He is absolutely sure of the devotee He will not an- swer openly, He will not talk to the devotee.

You have to know that even as you pray He is listening to you. Then He will make Himself known to you. He cannot then turn a deaf ear to your prayer. Our relationship with God is not a cold impersonal one, like that between employer and employee. We are His children. He has to listen to us! There is no way that we can get away from the fact that we are His children. We are not merely creatures created by Him; we are a part of Him. He made us princes, but we have chosen to become slaves. He wants us to become princes once more, to return to our Kingdom. But no one, having renounced his divine heritage, will regain it with- out effort. We are made in His image, but we have somehow forgotten that truth. We have succumbed to the delusion that we are mortal beings, and we must sunder the veil of that delu- sion with the dagger of wisdom. To attach any reality to the outward show of life expresses lack of true wisdom, but God has so impressed us with His maya —the cosmic illusion that causes us to see as real that which is only a play of light and shadows—that it is very hard not to be influenced by it. When you are hungry, it is maya that makes you think you will starve unless you eat. Yet, there are many persons who have fasted as long as seventy days. I have undergone long fasts, and after thirty days there is not even any sensation of hunger. But if your mind believes you cannot live without food, you will not live. That is a common delusion; its basis is solely in our minds. Because of the small number of ex- ceptions to what appears to be a rule, science declares that hu- man beings cannot live very long without food. There are cases, however, of people who live entirely without eating: Therese Neumann of Bavaria, and Giri Bala of Bengal, are two saints of the twentieth century who live without eating. * We ordinarily think we cannot live without breath also, yet when in deep meditation we practice Kriya Yoga , we know it can be done. Saints of East and West have often entered the breathless samadhi state. Mortal life is simply a system of sug- gestions that makes us think we must conform to a certain pat- * See chapters 39 and 46 in Paramahansaji's Autobiography of a Yogi."},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"REALIZING GOD IN YOUR DAILY LIFE 405 tern of eating, breathing, and so on. But as soon as you meditate and permit your consciousness to retire within to its source, the immortal soul, you realize that you are not subject to these limiting patterns. You know then that fire cannot burn you, water cannot drown you, that both health and sickness are dreams. In the lusty heat of our desires and moods we have formed a conception of the world that is not true. The truth is embodied in the wisdom of the great ones that reveals to us the world as it really is. Had it not been for the training I received in this wisdom, I would not have liked to remain in this world. \"Get Away From This Ocean of Suffering\" The truth is, only fools are attached to this world. \"Fools\" are those who live in ignorance, those to whom the world is real because they think it is the only way of life. Ignorance is like an eczema. The more you try to get relief by indulging its de- mand to be scratched, the more it will itch; but the more you leave it alone, the less it will bother you. That is why Krishna tells Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita: \"Get away from this ocean of suffering.\"* Be in the world and do your part, but do not be caught up and bound by its delusions, or you will be enslaved. Those who live on the sex plane all the time think they can't do without sex. But one who abstains and transmutes that energy never desires it. Smoking brings on the same delu- sion. People who have never smoked, or who have broken the habit, never miss tobacco. God Is the Greatest Need of Your Life You must cease to think you are a mortal being if you would find lasting happiness. Practice this truth in your daily life. It is a battle you have to fight throughout this life and incarnations to come, so it is better to start now! Do not put it off, thinking that you will start meditating tomorrow. Tomorrow will never come. Long ago I passed a whole year in this attitude, and still I was saying, \"tomorrow.\" Then I made up my mind: \"I will start meditating today.\" Since then I have never missed a day. You must first resolve in your mind the importance of * Paraphrase of XII:7."},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"406 JOURNEY TO SELF-REALIZATION God. You must realize inwardly that He is the greatest need of your life. First practice the presence of God in daily life by making your meditations very deep. It is better to meditate a little bit with depth than to meditate long with the mind run- ning here and there. If you do not make an effort to control the mind it will go on doing as it pleases, no matter how long you sit to meditate. Next, practice long meditation with depth. That is what takes you to His kingdom. Until you learn to practice medita- tion both long and deep, God will not reveal Himself to you. Gandhi devoted one day a week to silence and meditation. All saints who have found God sought that silence. I give my nights and mornings to Him. It is not possible to do exactly that in the business world, but if you will try, you will be sur- prised how much time you will find to devote to thoughts of God. We delude and deprive ourselves when we think we can wait until tomorrow to make that great effort to be with God. Delusion is destroyed by good company, by the company of saints, and by devotion to the messengers of God. Even the thought of saints will help you to remove delusion. It is not per- sonal association so much as attunement of thought with the messenger of God that destroys delusion. The true guru has no desire to place himself in the hearts of others, but rather to awaken in their consciousness the consciousness of God. Master [Swami Sri Yukteswar] was like that: he was one with us—never any show of his greatness. If anyone in the ashram wanted recognition or a high seat of authority, Master would give him that position. But I wanted the heart of Master, the divine con- sciousness he had within,- and as a result, he is forever here in my heart. That is the attunement you want with the great ones. Perform Your Duties With the Thought of God Along with periods of meditation you should think day and night of God. \"Door of my heart, open wide I keep for Thee....Night and day, night and day, I look for Thee night and day.\"* We must uplift our consciousness so that even the most worldly duties are performed with the thought of God. * From \"Door of My Heart\" in Cosmic Chants by Paramahansa Yogananda."},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"REALIZING GOD IN YOUR DAILY LIFE 407 There are two kinds of duty: that which you do for yourself (which keeps you bound), and that which you do for God. Duty performed as an offering to God is as spiritually benefi- cial as meditation. God loves that devotion which makes of ac- tion as well as silence an oblation to Him. But you cannot find Him by good works alone: You must give your deepest love to Him. He wants you to surrender heart, mind, and soul. He wants to know that you love Him. You have to seek Him in both activity and meditation. When inwardly you walk with God, and also carry a heavy load of earthly duties on your shoulders, He loves you even more. So before you perform an action, while you are performing an action, and when you have finished that action, think of Him. The Gita says: \"He who watches Me always, him do I watch. He never loses sight of Me, nor do I lose sight of him.\"* Meditation must be practiced every day. Start now! Do not look to the future. Begin this very moment to think of God. In this thought you are a king. Why be a prisoner of mortal moods and habits? Is it not true that when you introspect you see that you have done things you did not want to do? To carry out one's resolutions is a constant battle. It is good to resolve to do a thing and then follow through. You must develop a strong, silent, cool will. Never give up your good resolutions. Cultivate the will to think of God during activity. It is ex- tremely important that you make this a part of your daily life. Don't follow this course a few days only and then forget all about it. Follow it as best you can every day. Even if you slip back into old habits, keep on trying. You will become spiritu- ally strong and healthy in due time. God Responds When We Make the Effort God responds when we make the effort. Then you know that He is. He will no longer be a myth. He will respond in- visibly to your desires, playing hide-and-seek with you. And af- ter that He will come to you openly. Your past mistakes do not matter.

You have the power to hurt yourself or to ben- efit yourself. It is up to you to keep away the ants of igno- rance that bite your flesh. If you do not choose to be happy no one can make you happy. Do not blame God for that! And if you choose to be happy, no one can make you unhappy. If He had not given us freedom to use our own will, we could blame Him when we are unhappy, but He did give us that freedom. It is we who make of life what it is. You may ask, \"Why, if we have free choice, do things not turn out as we wish them to be?\" It is because you have weak- ened your will, your consciousness of divine powers within you. But if you strengthen your will by practicing self-control and meditation, it becomes free; and as soon as your will is free, you are master of your fate. But if you find that day by day you are living a life against your conscience, you will never be free. You must take time to do the things that are good for your own welfare. No one stops you but yourself. You make yourself a prisoner of your own moods and bad habits. That is why you must train your will to be more elastic. Keep your will under control by doing the best things in life—thinking more of God, meditating more, practicing self-control, and so on. The Dynamic Power of \"Mental Whispers\" Of greatest help in your development is the habit of mental whispering to God. You will see a change in yourself that you will like very much. No matter what you do, God should be con- stantly in your mind. When you want to see a special show, or to buy a dress or a car you have admired, is it not true that no matter what else you may be doing your mind is continually thinking how you can get those things? Until you fulfill your strong desires, your mind will not rest; it ceaselessly works toward fulfilling those desires. Your mind should be on God night and day in the same way. Transmute petty desires into one great desire for Him. Your mind should continually whisper, \"Night and day, night and day, I look for Thee night and day.\" Mental whispers develop dynamic power to reshape mat- ter into what you want. You do not realize how great is the power of the mind. When your mind and will are attuned to the Divine Will you do not have to move a finger in order to ere-"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"REALIZING GOD IN YOUR DAILY LIFE 409 ate changes on earth. The divine law will work for you. All the salient accomplishments of my life have been achieved through that power of mind in tune with the will of God. When that divine dynamo is on, whatever I am wishing has to come to pass. When this new temple of ours came to my mind, there was a force behind it I knew could not be stopped. I saw the great will of God working. Things that the mortal mind could not even hope to expect were nevertheless done. * Whatever you intensely believe in your mind will materi- alize. Jesus said, \"Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.\"+ Do not discourage yourself by entertaining the thought that you are a sinner and that God will never come to you. You then paralyze your will. Sin is a temporary delusion, and what is done is finished. It doesn't belong to you anymore. But you should not commit the same error again. Do Not Accept Your Bad Karma Deny karma. Too many people misinterpret the meaning of karma, adopting a fatalistic attitude. You do not have to ac- cept karma. If I tell you that somebody is standing behind you ready to hurt you because you once hit him, and you meekly say, \"Well, it is my karma,\" and wait for him to strike you, of course you will get a blow! Why don't you try to mollify him? By pacifying him you may lessen his bitterness and remove his desire to strike you. When you realize yourself as a child of God, what karma have you? God has no karma. And you have none, when you know you are His child. Every day you should affirm, \"I am not a mortal being; I am not the body. I am a child of God.\" That is practicing the presence of God. God is free from karma. You * Reference to the Self-Realization Fellowship Temple in Hollywood, dedicated August 30, 1942.

The best way to remove your weaknesses is not to think about thetti; otherwise you will be overwhelmed. Bring the light in and you will feel that darkness never was. In that thought is one of the greatest inspirations of my life. If light is admitted into a cave where darkness has existed for thousands of years, darkness will vanish instantly. So will our faults and weaknesses vanish when we bring in the light of God. The dark- ness of ignorance can enter nevermore. That is the philosophy of life by which we should live. Not tomorrow, but today, this minute. There cannot be any ex- cuse for not thinking of God. Day and night, rolling in the background of your mind, God! God! God! instead of money or sex or fame. Whether you are washing dishes or digging a ditch or working in an office or a garden—whatever you may be doing—inwardly say, \"Lord, manifest to me! You are right here. You are in the sun. You are in the grass. You are in the water. You are in this room. You are in my heart.\" And when great love for God comes in your heart, you do not miss anything; no matter what you have or do not have in this world, you nevertheless feel fulfilled. Divine love transmutes all material desires—even the longing for human love, that mortal passion which so often brings pain either from its fickle nature or because it is snatched away by death. Loving the Lord, you can never turn back to being satisfied by lesser loves. In Him you will find all the love of all hearts. You will find completeness. Everything that the world gives you and then takes away, leav- ing you in pain or disillusionment, you will find in God in a much greater way, and with no aftermath of sorrow. Every Minute Is Precious Life seems such a tangible reality, and yet it is elusive. Every minute is precious. Today you are; tomorrow you are not. I remind myself of this every day. One by one we slip away. Others will come and we shall go. But the body is only a garment. How many times you have changed your clothing in this life, yet because of this you would not say that you have changed. Similarly, when you give up this bodily dress at death you do not change. You are just the same, an immortal soul, a child of"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"REALIZING GOD IN YOUR DAILY LIFE 411 God. Reincarnation means merely a change of mortal dress. But your real self will never change. You must concentrate on your real self, not on the body, which is nothing but a garment. I sometimes think that sense perceptions are the worst en- emies of man, because they make us believe we are some- thing we are not. The sensation of cold makes us think we are cold, and the sensation of heat makes us think we are hot. If we would but deny these sensations in our minds we would feel neither cold nor heat. One night long ago in Duxbury, Massachusetts, I went to bathe in the ocean in the moonlight. Dr. M. W. Lewis and his son Bradford accompanied me. The water felt very cold, but I reminded myself that everything is made of electricity,- that the same electricity that makes cold also makes heat, and the wa- ter itself is nothing more than a manifestation of electrical en- ergies. Just as I was thinking these thoughts Bradford looked at me strangely, then turned to his father and exclaimed, \"Swamiji* has a light around his body!\" The light of God had come over me as I refused to accept the sensation of cold and reaffirmed instead the truth that everything is made of Divine Electricity. Catch God in the Net of Unconditional Love But if you speak about these things too much they are taken away from you. God is like a little child. He knows no guile. But if you play the slightest deceit or trick on Him He is gone. That is why it is so hard to get hold of Him, You have to catch Him in the net of your unconditional love. Love means craving for God. God appreciates love more than devotion: In devotion there is distance and awe, perhaps fear; in love there is unity, at-one-ment. Do not despair if you do not yet feel an unconditional love for God. Salvation is for all. If you choose to delay on this path of evolution, it is your loss.

To be redeemed is to drop the ignorance that covers the soul. You cannot see a nugget of gold if it is covered with mud. And so long as the mud of ignorance besmears the golden soul you cannot see it. You are unable to think of yourself as a soul be- cause you know only the body. The human form is the mud that you have put over your soul, and that is why you do not know what you are. Wash away the mud, forget the body by meditation, and you will know what you are. How can you be anything but perfect, since you are God's child? But you have to realize your inherent divinity. You must be very secret about your love for God. And you have to be very silent about His love,- you must not speak about His being with you. Be like the great ones, who in- wardly think constantly of the Beauty behind the flowers; the Light behind the sun; the Life that twinkles in all eyes, that beats in every heart; the Motion that walks in all feet, that works in all hands; the Mind that is working through all brains; the Love that is behind all loves. God is so great, so marvelous! To live in the realm of divine consciousness is to see this mundane world—ignorant of God— as a nightmare, and to have eternal freedom from its terrors. You waste precious time each day. Every little moment you spend with God will be spent to your best advantage,- and whatever you achieve with the desire to please God in your heart will stand unto eternity. God is freedom from all mis- ery. God is the wealth and the health you seek. God is the love you seek. The desire of the soul for God is behind all other desires. Worldly desires camouflage the longing of the soul to be reunited with God-Bliss. Only God can satisfy all the desires of this life and of past incarnations. I have found it so. Nothing Can Match the Experience of God So search for Him night and day. Nothing can match the experience you will have if you do this. God is the Goal you seek. You cannot live without Him.

A world teacher whose presence among us illumined the path for countless souls, Paramahansa Yogananda lived and taught the highest truths of life. Born in Gorakhpur, India, in 1893, Parama- hansa Yogananda was sent by his guru to the United States in 1920 as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Lib- erals. Subsequent lectures in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia were enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. For the next decade Paramahansaji traveled extensively, giv- ing lectures and classes in which he instructed thousands of men and women in the yoga science of meditation and balanced spiri- tual living. The work he began, with the founding of Yogoda Satsanga Society of India in 1917 and the establishment of the international headquarters of Self-Realization Fellowship in Los Angeles in 1925, continues under the guidance of Sri Sri Daya Mata. In ad- dition to publishing Paramahansa Yogananda's writings, lectures, and informal talks (including a comprehensive series of lessons for home study. See page 419), his society oversees ashrams, kendras, and meditation centers around the world; monastic train- ing programs,- and the Worldwide Prayer Circle, which serves as a channel to help bring healing to those in need and greater peace and harmony among all nations. Seekers in India and surround- ing territories are served by Yogoda Satsanga Society of India. The life and teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda are de- scribed in his Autobiography of a Yogi, which has become a classic in its field since its publication in 1946, and is now used as a text and reference work in many colleges and universities throughout the world. 417"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"ALSO PUBLISHED BY YOGODA SATSANGA SOCIETY OF INDIA AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A YOGI by Sri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda This acclaimed autobiography is at once a riveting account of an extraordinary life and a penetrating and unforgettable look at the ultimate mysteries of human existence. Hailed as a landmark work of spiritual literature when it first appeared in print, it remains one of the most widely read and respected books ever published on the wisdom of the East. With engaging candor, eloquence, and wit, Sri Sri Parama- hansa Yogananda narrates the inspiring chronicle of his life — the experiences of his remarkable childhood, encounters with many saints and sages during his youthful search throughout India for an illumined teacher, ten years of training in the her- mitage of a revered yoga master, and the thirty years that he lived and taught in America. He records as well his meetings with Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Luther Bur- bank, the Catholic stigmatist Therese Neumann, and other cel- ebrated spiritual personalities of East and West.

That ancient science is embodied in the specific principles and meditation techniques of Kriya Yoga (see glossary, and chapter 26 in Autobiography of a Yogi). Lost to humanity for centuries during the dark ages, Kriya Yoga was revived in modern times by a line of enlightened mas- ters—Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Swami Sri Yukteswar, and Paramahansa Yogananda. To disseminate the liberating spiri- tual science worldwide through Yogoda Satsanga Society of In- dia/Self-Realization Fellowship was the mission entrusted to Paramahansa Yogananda by his guru and paramgurus. During his lifetime he traveled extensively, giving lectures and classes in India, the United States, and Europe. Yet he knew that many more than he could teach in person would be drawn to the yoga philosophy and practices. Thus he conceived \"a series of weekly studies for the yoga seekers all over the world\"—to per- petuate in their original purity, and in written form, the teach- ings handed down to him by his lineage of gurus. The Yogoda Satsanga Society Lessons present the methods of concentration, energization, and meditation taught by Parama- hansa Yogananda that are an integral part of the Kriya Yoga sci- ence.

The Sanskrit root word or seed-sound symbolizing that aspect of Godhead which creates and sustains all things; Cosmic Vibration. Aum of the Vedas became the sacred word Hum of the Tibetans; Amin of the Moslems; and Amen of the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Jews, and Christians. The world's great religions state that all created things originate in the cos- mic vibratory energy of Aum or Amen, the Word or Holy Ghost. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....All things were made by him [the Word or Aum] } and without him was not any thing made that was made\" (John 1:1, 3, Bible). Amen in Hebrew means sure, faithful. \"These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the cre- ation of God\" ( Revelation 3:14, Bible). Even as sound is produced by the vibration of a running motor, so the omnipresent sound of Aum faithfully testifies to the running of the \"Cosmic Mo- tor,\" which upholds all life and every particle of creation through vibratory energy. In the Yogoda Satsanga Society Lessons [q.v.), Paramahansa Yogananda teaches techniques of meditation whose practice brings direct experience of God as Aum or Holy Ghost.

Lord Krishna and his disciple Arjuna on the eve of the historic battle of Kurukshetra, the Gita is a profound treatise on the science of Yoga (union with God) and a timeless prescription for happiness and success in everyday living. The Gita is allegory as well as history, a spiri- tual dissertation on the inner battle between man's good and bad tendencies. Depending on the context, Krishna symbolizes the guru, the soul, or God; Arjuna represents the aspiring devotee. Of this universal scripture Mahatma Gandhi wrote: \"Those who will meditate on the Gita will derive fresh joy and new mean- ings from it every day. There is not a single spiritual tangle which the Gita cannot unravel.\" Unless otherwise indicated, the quotations from the Bha- gavad Gita in this volume are from Paramahansa Yogananda's own translations, which he rendered from the Sanskrit some- times literally and sometimes in paraphrase, depending on the context of his talk.

Caste in its original conception was not a hereditary sta- tus, but a classification based on man's natural capacities. In his evolution, man passes through four distinct grades, desig- nated by ancient Hindu sages as Sudra, Vaisya, Kshatriya, and Brahmin. The Sudra is interested primarily in satisfying his bodily needs and desires; the work that best suits his state of development is bodily labor. The Vaisya is ambitious for worldly gain as well as for satisfaction of the senses; he has more creative ability than the Sudra and seeks occupation as a farmer, a businessman, an artist, or wherever his mental energy finds fulfillment. The Kshatriya, having through many lives fulfilled the desires of the Sudra and Vaisya states, begins to seek the meaning of life,- he tries to overcome his bad habits, to control his senses, and to do what is right. Kshatriyas by occupation are noble rulers, statesmen, warriors. The Brah- min has overcome his lower nature, has a natural affinity for spiritual pursuits, and is God-knowing, able therefore to teach and help liberate others. causal body.

In the consciousness of causal beings, the physical and astral universes are resolved to their thought essence. Whatever phys- ical man can do in imagination, causal man can do in actuality— the only limitation being thought itself. Ultimately, man sheds the last soul covering—his causal body—to unite with om- nipresent Spirit, beyond all vibratory realms. chakras.

These centers are referred to as chakras (\"wheels\") because the concentrated energy in each one is like a hub from which radiate rays of life-giving light and energy. In ascending order, these chakras are muladhara (the coccygeal, at the base of the spine); svadhisthana (the sacral, two inches above muladhara); manipura (the lumbar, opposite the navel); anahata (the dorsal, opposite the heart); vishuddha (the cervical, at the base of the neck); ajna (traditionally located between the eye- brows,- in actuality, directly connected by polarity with the mudulla; see also medulla and spiritual eye); and sahasrara (in the uppermost part of the cerebrum).

By following the master's teachings and discipline, the disciple is able to fulfill his soul's desire for the manna of God-perception. A true guru, ordained by God to help sincere seekers in response to their deep soul craving, is not an ordinary teacher: he is a hu- man vehicle whose body, speech, mind and spirituality God use as a channel to attract and guide lost souls back to their home of immortality.

Effects of past actions, from this or previous lifetimes; from the Sanskrit kri, to do. The equilibrating law of karma, as expounded in the Hindu scriptures, is that of action and reaction, cause and effect, sowing and reaping. In the course of natural righteousness, every human being by his thoughts and actions becomes the molder of his own destiny. Whatever energies he himself, wisely or unwisely, has set in motion must return to him as their starting point, like a circle inexorably completing itself. An understanding of karma as the law of justice serves to free the human mind from resentment against God and man. A person's karma follows him from incarnation to incarnation until fulfilled or spiritually transcended. (See reincarnation.) The cumulative actions of human beings within communi- ties, nations, or the world as a whole constitute mass karma, which produces local or far-ranging effects according to the de- gree and preponderance of good or evil. The thoughts and actions of every human being, therefore, contribute to the good or ill of this world and all peoples in it. Karma Yoga. The path to God through nonattached action and service.

Samadhi is attained when the meditator, the process of meditation (by which the mind is withdrawn from the senses by interiorization), and the object of meditation (God) become One. Paramahansa Yoganandaji has explained that \"in the initial states of God-communion (sabikalpa samadhi ) the devotee's consciousness merges in the Cosmic Spirit; his life force is withdrawn from the body, which appears 'dead,' or motionless and rigid. The yogi is fully aware of his bodily condition of suspended animation. As he progresses to higher spiritual states (nirbikalpa samadhi ), however, he com- munes with God without bodily fixation,- and in his ordinary waking consciousness, even in the midst of exacting worldly duties.\" Both states are characterized by oneness with the ever new bliss of Spirit, but the nirbikalpa state is experienced by only the most highly advanced masters.
