In India I have been in the presence ofsaints while they were talking with the Heavenly Father. And all of you, also,may communicate with Him; not a one-sided conversation, but a real talk whereinyou speak to God and He responds. Everyone can talk to the Lord, of course. ButI am discussing today how we may persuade Him to reply to us.Why should we doubt? The scriptures of the world abound in descriptions of talksbetween God and man. One of the most beautiful of these incidents is recorded inI Kings 3:5–13 in the Bible: “The Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night;and God said, Ask what I shall give thee. And Solomon said....Give therefore Thyservant an understanding heart....And God said unto him, Because thou hast askedthis thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked richesfor thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked forthyself understanding to discern judgment; Behold, I have done according to thywords: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart...And I have alsogiven thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honour.”David, too, held converse many times with the Lord, and discussed even mundanematters with Him. “And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against thePhilistines? and wilt Thou deliver them into mine hand? And the Lord said untohim, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.”1[part0009.xhtml#id_8DFEOMjaRH6IsULkYGtuFA385]God Is Moved Only by LoveThe average man prays to God with his mind only, not with all the fervour of hisheart. Such prayers are too weak to bring any response. We should speak to theDivine Spirit with confidence and with a feeling of closeness, as to a father ora mother. Our relationship with God should be one of unconditional love. Morethan in any other relationship we may rightfully and naturally demand a replyfrom Spirit in Its aspect as the Divine Mother. God is constrained to answersuch an appeal; for the essence of a mother is love and forgiveness of herchild, no matter how great a sinner he may be. The relationship between motherand child is the most beautiful form of human love that the Lord has given us.A definite conception of God (such as that of the Divine Mother) is necessary,otherwise one does not receive a clear response. And the demand for the Lord’sreply should be strong; a half-believing prayer is not sufficient. If you makeup your mind: “He is going to talk with me”; if you refuse to believedifferently, regardless of how many years He has not answered you; if you go ontrusting Him, one day He will respond.I have written in Autobiography of a Yogi about some of the numerous occasionson which I have talked with God. My first experience in hearing the Divine Voicecame when I was a little child. Sitting on my bed one morning, I fell into adeep reverie.“What is behind the darkness of closed eyes?” This probing thought camepowerfully into my mind. An immense flash of light at once manifested to myinner gaze. Divine shapes of saints, sitting in meditation in mountain caves,formed like miniature cinema pictures on the large screen of radiance within myforehead.“Who are you?” I spoke aloud.“We are the Himalayan yogis.” The celestial response is difficult to describe;my heart was thrilled. The vision vanished, but the silvery beams expanded inever widening circles to infinity.I said, “What is this wondrous glow?”“I am Ishwara (the Lord). I am Light.” The Voice was as murmuring clouds.My mother and eldest sister Roma were nearby when I had this early experience,and they too heard the Divine Voice. I received such happiness from God’sresponse that I determined then and there to search for Him until I would becomewholly one with Him.Most people think there is only darkness behind closed eyes. But, as you developspiritually and concentrate on the “single” eye in the forehead, you will findthat your inner sight is opened. You will behold another world, one of manylights and great beauty. Visions of saints, such as those I saw of Himalayanyogis, will appear before you. If your concentration goes still deeper, you toowill hear the Voice of God.Again and again the scriptures tell us of the Lord’s promise that He willcommunicate with us. “And ye shall seek Me, and find Me, when ye shall searchfor Me with all your heart.”—Jeremiah 29:13. “The Lord is with you, while ye bewith Him; and if ye seek Him, He will be found of you; but if ye forsake Him, Hewill forsake you.”—II Chronicles 15:2. “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock:if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will supwith him, and he with Me.”—Revelation 3:20.If you can just once “break bread” with the Lord, break His silence, He willtalk often with you. But in the beginning it is very difficult; it is not easyto become acquainted with God, because He wants to be sure that you reallydesire to know Him. He gives tests to see if the devotee wants Him or somethingelse. He will not talk with you until you have convinced Him that no otherdesire is hiding in your heart. Why should He reveal Himself to you if yourheart is filled only with longings for His gifts?Man’s Love Is His Sole Gift to GodThe whole creation was designed as a test for man. By our conduct in this worldwe disclose whether we want the Lord or His gifts. God will not tell you thatyou should desire Him above all else, because He wants your love to be freelygiven, without “prompting.” That is the whole secret in the game of thisuniverse. He who created us yearns for our love. He wants us to give itspontaneously, without His asking. Our love is the one thing God does notpossess, unless we choose to bestow it. So, you see, even the Lord has somethingto attain: our love. And we shall never be happy until we give it. So long as weare wayward children, pygmies crawling on this ball of earth and crying for Hisgifts while we ignore Him, the Giver, we fall into many pits of misery.As God is the Essence of our own being, we cannot truly express ourselves untilwe learn to manifest His presence within us. This is the truth. It is because weare Divine, a part of Him, that we are unable to find lasting satisfaction inanything material. “Naught shelters thee, who wilt not shelter Me.”2[part0009.xhtml#id_8DFEOMjaRH6IsULkYGtuFA373] Until you attain contentment inGod, you will not win contentment from anything else.Is God Personal or Impersonal?Is God personal or impersonal? A little discussion of this point will help youin your attempts to communicate with Him. Many people don’t like to think of theLord as personal; they feel that an anthropomorphic conception is limiting. Theyconsider Him to be Impersonal Spirit, All-Power, the Intelligent Force that isresponsible for the universe.But if our Creator is impersonal, how is it that He has created human beings? Weare personal; we have individuality. We think, feel, will; and God has given usnot only the power to appreciate the thoughts and feelings of others but torespond to them. The Lord is surely not devoid of the spirit of reciprocity thatanimates His own creatures. When we permit it, our Heavenly Father can and willestablish a personal relationship with each one of us.Considering the impersonal aspect of God, we get the impression of a RemoteBeing, One who merely receives the prayer-thoughts we offer, without respondingto them; One who knows everything, yet maintains a heartless silence. But thisis a philosophical error, because God is everything: personal as well asimpersonal. He created persons, human beings. Their Originator could not bewholly impersonal.It satisfies a deep need in our hearts to think that God may take a human formand come to us and talk with us. Why doesn’t He do it for everyone? Many saintshave heard the voice of God. Why can’t you? “Thou, O Lord, art invisible,impersonal, unknown, and unknowable; yet I believe that by my devotion’s frost,Thou canst be ‘frozen’ into a form.” God can be persuaded to take a personalform by your intense devotion. You, like St. Francis of Assisi and other greatones, may see the living body of Christ, if you pray deeply enough. Jesus was apersonal manifestation of God. He who knows Brahma (God) is Brahma himself. Didnot Christ say: “I and my Father are one”?3[part0009.xhtml#id_8DFEOMjaRH6IsULkYGtuFA393] Swami Shankara also declared: “Iam Spirit” and “Thou art That.” We have the word of many great prophets that allmen are made in the image of Divinity.I receive much of my knowledge from God, rather than from books. I seldom read.I tell you what I have perceived directly. That is why I speak with authority,the authority of my direct perception of Truth. The opinion of the whole worldmay stand against it, but the authority of direct perception will always beaccepted eventually.Meaning of “The Image of God”In the Bible we read: “For in the image of God made He man.”4[part0009.xhtml#id_8DFEOMjaRH6IsULkYGtuFA386] No one has ever fully explained inwhat ways man is the image of God. God is Spirit; and man, in his essentialnature, is also Spirit. That is the primary meaning of the Biblical passage, butthere are many other true interpretations as well.The whole human body and the consciousness and motion in it are a microcosmicrepresentation of God. In consciousness is om-niscience and omnipresence. Youcan imme-diately think you are at the North Star or on Mars. In thought there isno gulf between you and anything else. By virtue of the consciousness withinman, therefore, he may be said to be made in the image of God.Consciousness is aware of itself; it intuitively feels itself. God, through Hiscosmic consciousness, is aware of Himself in every atom of creation. “Are nottwo sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the groundwithout [the awareness of] your Father.”5[part0009.xhtml#id_8DFEOMjaRH6IsULkYGtuFA392]Man also has the innate power of cosmic consciousness, though few develop it.Man also has will, whereby he, like the Creator, can create worldsinstantaneously; but few develop that power which is within them. The animalscannot reason, but man can. All the attributes that God has—consciousness,reason, will, feeling, love—man has too. In these qualities man may be said tobe made in the image of God.The Physical Body Is Not Matter, but EnergyThe energy that we feel in the body implies the existence of a vaster power thanis required just to operate the individual physical vehicle. The power of cosmicenergy that sustains universes is vibrating in our bodies also. Cosmic energy isone aspect of God. Therefore we are made in His image even from the physicalstandpoint.What is the energy we have in the body? Our physical form is made of molecules,molecules are made of atoms, atoms are made of electrons, and electrons are madeof life force or “lifetrons”—countless billions of specks of energy. With yourspiritual eye you can see the body as a mass of scintillating specks oflight—the energy that is emanating from your twenty-seven thousand billioncells. Only through delusion do you see the body as solid flesh. In reality itis not matter, but energy.It is because you think you are made of flesh and blood that you sometimesimagine yourself to be a weakling. But if you register the consciousness of Godin your body, you will realize that flesh is nothing more than a physicalmanifestation of the five vibratory elements of earth, water, fire, air, andether.Five Universal Elements Compose Man’s BodyThe whole universe—which is God’s body—is made of the same five elements thatcompose man’s body. The starlike shape of the human body represents the rays ofthese five elements. The head, the two hands, and the two feet form the fivepoints of the star. So in this way, too, we are made in the image of God.The five fingers also represent the five vibratory elements of the CosmicIntelligent Vibration that maintain the structure of creation. The thumbrepresents the grossest vibratory element, earth; hence its thickness. The firstfinger represents the water element. The second finger represents the dartingfire element; that is why it is the longest. The third finger represents air.The smallest finger represents ether, which is very fine.Rubbing each finger animates the particular power that it represents. Hencerubbing the middle finger (representing the fire element) and the navel(opposite the lumbar or “fire” centre in the spine, which governs digestion andassimilation) will help one to overcome indigestion.God manifests motion in creation. Man has developed legs and feet because of theurge to express motion. The toes are materializations of the five rays ofenergy.The eyes epitomize God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost in the pupil, iris, andwhite. When you concentrate at the point between the eyebrows, the current inthe two eyes reflects as one light, and you behold the spiritual eye. Thissingle orb is the “eye of God.” We have developed two eyes because of the law ofrelativity that prevails in our dualistic universe. Jesus said, “If thereforethine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.”6[part0009.xhtml#id_8DFEOMjaRH6IsULkYGtuFA389] If we look through the spiritualeye, the single eye of God, we perceive that all creation is made of onesubstance, His light.One With God, One With God’s PowerIn the ultimate sense man has all power. You can change anything you want towhen your consciousness is united with God’s. Automobile parts can be replacedor changed, as needful; but to effect a similar change in the physical body ismore complicated. Mind, which controls all the cells, is the basic factor. Whena man attains full control of mind, his bodily cells and parts may be replacedor changed as often as desired, and at will. For example, he could, just by athought, cause the bodily atoms to change and bring into being a whole new setof teeth. There is complete control of matter when one is advanced spiritually.The Lord is Spirit; the Impersonal is invisible. But when He created thephysical world He became God the Father. As soon as He assumed the role ofCreator, He became personal. He became visible: this whole universe is the bodyof God.In the form of the earth He has a positive and a negative side—the north andsouth poles. The stars are His eyes, the grass and trees are His hair, and therivers are His bloodstream. The ocean’s roar, the skylark’s song, the cry of thenewborn babe, and all other sounds of creation are His voice. This is thepersonal God. The heartthrob behind all hearts is His pulsing cosmic energy. Heis walking in mankind’s twenty-six hundred million pairs of feet. He is workingthrough all hands. It is the One Divine Consciousness that is manifestingthrough all brains.Because of God’s law of attraction and repulsion, the cells of the human bodyare harmoniously held together in the same way that stars are kept in balance intheir proper orbits. The omnipresent Lord is ever active; there is not a placeanywhere without some form of life. With illimitable prodigality God incessantlyprojects protean forms—inexhaustible manifestations of His cosmic energy.The Divine Spirit had a specific idea or pattern in mind when He created. Hefirst externalized the whole universe, then created man. In forming for Himselfa physical body of planetary systems, God manifested three aspects: cosmicconsciousness, cosmic energy, and cosmic mass or matter.These three correspond respectively to man’s ideational or causal body, astralor energy body, and physical body. And the soul or Life behind them is Spirit.Spirit manifests macrocosmically as cosmic consciousness, cosmic energy, and thebody of universes; and microcosmically as human consciousness, human energy, andthe human body. Again we see that man has indeed been made in the Divine Image.God “Talks” Through VibrationGod does appear to us in physical form. He is more personal than you canimagine. He is as real and actual as you are. This is what I want to tell youtoday. The Lord is ever responding to us. The vibration of His thought isconstantly being sent forth; this requires energy; the energy manifests assound. There is a very strong point here. God is consciousness. God is energy.“Talking” means vibrating. In the vibration of His cosmic energy He is talkingall the time. He has become the Mother of creation that materializes Herself assolids, liquids, fire, air, and ether.The invisible Mother is continuously expressing Herself in terms of visibleforms—in flowers, mountains, seas, and stars. What is matter? Nothing but aparticular rate of vibration of God’s cosmic energy. No form in the universe isreally solid. That which appears so is merely a compact or gross vibration ofHis energy. The Lord is talking to us through vibrations. But the question is,how to communicate directly with Him? That is the most difficult accomplishmentof all: to talk with God.If you speak to a mountain, it doesn’t answer. Talk to the flowers, as LutherBurbank did, and you may feel in them a little response. And of course we cantalk to other people. But is God less responsive than flowers and human beings,that He lets us keep on talking to Him and yet fails to answer us? It appearsthat way, doesn’t it? The trouble is not with Him, but with us. Our intuitivetelephonic system is out of order. God is calling us and speaking to us, but wedo not hear Him.Cosmic Vibration “Speaks” All LanguagesBut saints hear Him. Whenever a certain master I knew would pray, God’sanswering voice would seem to come from the sky. God doesn’t need a throat inorder to speak. If you pray strongly enough, those prayer vibrations bring avibratory response immediately. It manifests in whatever language you areac-customed to hearing. If you are praying in German you hear the reply inGerman. If you talk in English you hear the answer in English.The vibrations of different languages originate in the cosmic vibration. God,being the cosmic vibration, knows all languages. What is language? It is acertain vibration. What is vibration? It is a certain energy. And what isenergy? It is a certain thought.Though God hears all our prayers He does not always respond. Our situation islike that of a child who calls for his mother, but the mother does not think itnecessary to come. She sends him a plaything to keep him quiet. But when thechild refuses to be comforted by anything except the mother’s presence, shecomes. If you want to know God, you must be like the naughty baby who cries tillthe mother comes.If you make up your mind never to stop crying for Her, Divine Mother will talkwith you. No matter how busy She is with Her housework of creation, if youpersist in your cries, She is bound to speak. The Hindu scriptures tell us thatif for one night and one day, without a moment’s interruption, a devotee talksto God with intense devotion, He will respond. But how few will do it! Every dayyou have “important engagements”—the “devil” that keeps you away from God. TheLord will not come if you just say a little prayer and then start thinking ofsomething else; or if you pray like this: “Heavenly Father, I am calling to You,but I am awfully sleepy. Amen.” St. Paul said, “Pray without ceasing.”7[part0009.xhtml#id_8DFEOMjaRH6IsULkYGtuFA367]Patient Job held long conversations with God. Job said to Him: “Hear, I beseechThee, and I will speak. I will demand of Thee; and declare Thou unto me. I haveheard of Thee by the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye seeth Thee.”8[part0009.xhtml#id_8DFEOMjaRH6IsULkYGtuFA387]When a lover protests his devotion mechanically, his beloved knows that hiswords are not sincere; she is “hearing” what is really in his heart. Similarly,when God’s devotees pray to Him He knows whether their hearts and minds are dryof devotion and whether their thoughts are dashing wildly everywhere; He doesnot respond to halfhearted calls. But to those devotees who day and night withutmost intensity pray and talk to Him, He does appear. To such devotees He comeswithout fail.Do Not Be Satisfied With Less Than the HighestDon’t waste time in seeking little things. Naturally it is easier to get othergifts from God than the supreme gift of Himself. But don’t be satisfied withanything less than the highest. I haven’t cared about the gifts that have cometo me from God, except that I see, behind them, Him who is the Giver. Why areall my desires materialized? Because I go deep; I go straight to God. In everyaspect of creation I see Him. He is our Father; He is nearer than the nearest,dearer than the dearest, more real than anybody else. He is both unknowable andknowable.God is crying for you. He wants you to return to Him. It is your birthright. Youwill have to leave this earth someday; it is not an abiding-place for you. Earthlife is only a school in which He has put us to see how we shall behave here;that is all. Before He will reveal Himself God wants to know whether we desireearth’s tinsel glory or whether we have acquired enough wisdom to say:“I am through with all this, Lord. I want to talk with You alone. I know You areall I really own. You will be with me when everyone else is gone.”Human beings are seeking happiness in marriage, in money, in wine, and so forth;but such people are puppets of destiny. Once this realization is attained, onefinds out the true purpose of life and naturally begins to seek God.We must claim our lost divine heritage. The more unselfish one is, the more hetries to give happiness to others, the more likely he will be to think aboutGod. And the more one thinks of worldly goals and of human desires, the fartherhis soul’s happiness recedes from him. We were not put here on earth to grovelin the mud of the senses and get nipped with sufferings at every turn. Thatwhich is of the world is evil because it suppresses the bliss of the soul. Thegreatest happiness comes by immersing the mind in thoughts of God.Why Postpone Happiness?Why don’t you think ahead? Why do you consider nonessentials so important? Mostpeople concentrate on breakfast, lunch, and dinner, work, social activities, andso on. Make your life more simple and put your whole mind on the Lord. Earth isa place of preparation for getting back to God. He wants to see if we love Himmore than His gifts. He is the Father and all of us are His children. He has aright to our love and we have a right to His love. Our troubles arise because weneglect Him. But He is always waiting.I only wish He had put a little more sense in all of us. We have the freedom tocast God away or to accept Him. And here we are begging, begging, begging for alittle money, a little happiness, a little love. Why ask for things that must betaken away from you one day? How long shall you be moaning about money andsickness and difficulties? Seize immortal-ity and the kingdom of God! That iswhat you really want.A Divine Kingdom Is at StakeThe saints stress nonattachment so that one strong point of material attachmentmay not prevent our attaining the entire kingdom of God. Renunciation doesn’tmean giving up everything; it means giving up small pleasures for eternal bliss.God talks to you when you are working for Him, and you should speak to Himconstantly. Tell Him any thought that comes into your mind. And say to Him,“Lord, reveal Thyself, reveal Thyself.” Don’t take silence for an answer. Hewill first respond by giving you something that you have wanted, showing youthat you are in His attention. But don’t be content with His gifts. Let Him knowthat you will never be satisfied until you have Him. Finally He will give you ananswer. In a vision you may see a face of some saintly being, or you may hear aDivine Voice talking to you; and you will know that you are in communion withGod.To coax Him to give Himself takes steady, unceasing zeal. Nobody can teach youthat zeal. You have to develop that yourself. “You can take a horse to water butyou cannot make him drink.” Yet when the horse is thirsty it seeks out waterwith zeal. So, when you have an immense thirst for the Divine, when you will notgive undue importance to anything else—the tests of the world or the tests ofthe body—then He will come. Remember, when your heart-call is intense, when youaccept no excuse, then He will come.You must remove from your mind all doubt that God will answer. Most people don’tget any response because of their disbelief. If you are absolutely determinedthat you are going to attain something, nothing can stop you. It is when yougive up that you write the verdict against yourself. The man of success doesn’tknow the word “impossible.”Faith is the limitless power of God within you. God knows through Hisconsciousness that He created everything; so faith means knowledge andconviction that we are made in the image of God. When we are attuned to Hisconsciousness within us, we can create worlds. Remember, in your will lies thealmighty power of God. When a host of difficulties comes and you refuse to giveup in spite of them; when your mind becomes “set,” then you will find Godresponding to you.God, being cosmic vibration, is the Word. God as the Word is humming through allatoms. There is a music coming out of the universe that deeply meditatingdevotees can hear. Now, at this moment, I am hearing His voice. The CosmicSound9 [part0009.xhtml#id_8DFEOMjaRH6IsULkYGtuFA390] that you hear in meditationis the voice of God. That sound forms itself into language intelligible to you.When I listen to Aum and occasionally ask God to tell me something, that soundof Aum changes into English or Bengali language and gives me preciseinstructions.God also talks to man through his intuition. If you learn how to listen10[part0009.xhtml#id_8DFEOMjaRH6IsULkYGtuFA370] to the Cosmic Vibration it iseasier to hear His voice. But even if you just pray to God through the cosmicether, if your will is strong enough the ether will respond with His voice. Heis ever talking to you, saying:“Call Me, speak unto Me from the depths of your heart, from the core of yourbeing, from the very depths of your soul, persistently, majestically,determinedly, with a firm resolve in your heart that you will go on seeking Me,no matter how many times I do not answer. If you unceasingly whisper in yourheart to Me, ‘O my silent Beloved, speak to me,’ I will come to you, Mydevotee.”If once you can get that response you will never feel separated from Him again.The divine experience will always remain with you. But that “once” is difficultbecause the heart and mind are not convinced; doubt creeps in because of ourprevious materialistic beliefs.God Answers the Heart Whispers of True DevoteesGod will answer every human being, irrespective of caste, creed, or colour.There is a saying in Bengali that if you give a soul call to God as theUniversal Mother, She cannot remain silent.

Though the major part of his life was spentoutside India, still he takes his place among our great saints. His workcontinues to grow and shine ever more brightly, drawing people everywhere on thepath of the pilgrimage of the Spirit.”In these words, the Government of India paid tribute to the founder of YogodaSatsanga Society of India/Self-Realization Fellowship, upon issuing acommemorative stamp in his honour on March 7, 1977, the seventeen anniversary ofhis passing.A world teacher whose presence among us illumined the path for countless souls,Paramahansa Yogananda lived and taught the highest truths of life. Born inGorakhpur, India, in 1893, Paramahansa Yogananda was sent by his guru to theUnited States in 1920 as India’s delegate to an International Congress ofReligious Liberals. Subsequent lectures in Boston, New York, and Philadelphiawere enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continentalspeaking tour.For the next decade Paramahansaji travelled extensively, giving lectures andclasses in which he instructed thousands of men and women in the yoga science ofmeditation and balanced spiritual living.Today, the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Paramahansa Yoganandacontinues under the direction of Sri Sri Mrinalini Mata, one of his closestdisciples and current president of Yogoda Satsanga Society ofIndia/Self-Realization Fellowship. In addition to publishing ParamahansaYogananda’s writings, lectures, and informal talks (including a comprehensiveseries of lessons for home study),1[part0010.xhtml#id_8DFEOMjaRH6IsULkYGtuFA388] his society oversees ashrams,kendras, and meditation centres around the world; monastic training programs;and the Worldwide Prayer Circle, which serves as a channel to help bring healingto those in need and greater peace and harmony among all nations. Seekers inIndia and surrounding territories are served by Yogoda Satsanga Society ofIndia.Quincy Howe, Jr., Ph. D., Professor of Ancient Languages, Scripps College,wrote: “Paramahansa Yogananda brought to the West not only India’s perennialpromise of God-realization, but also a practical method by which spiritualaspirants from all walks of life may progress rapidly toward that goal.Originally appreciated in the West only on the most lofty and abstract level,the spiritual legacy of India is now accessible as practice and experience toall who aspire to know God, not in the beyond, but in the here and now ....Yogananda has placed within the reach of all the most exalted methods ofcontemplation.”The life and teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda are described in hisAutobiography of a Yogi, which has become a classic in its field since itspublication in 1946 and is now used as a text and reference work in manycolleges and universities throughout the world.1 [part0010.xhtml#id_8DFEOMjaRH6IsULkYGtuFA382] These lessons present the art ofspiritual living and the yoga meditation techniques taught by ParamahansaYogananda, including Kriya Yoga, an ancient spiritual science whose devotedpractice leads to direct, personal experience of God.

Binay R. Sen, Ambassador ofIndia.The great world teacher demonstrated the value of yoga (scientific techniquesfor God-realization) not only in life but in death. Weeks after his departurehis unchanged face shone with the divine lustre of incorruptibility.Mr. Harry T. Rowe, Los Angeles Mortuary Director, Forest Lawn Memorial-Park (inwhich the body of the great master is temporarily placed), sent Self-RealizationFellowship a notarised letter from which the following extracts are taken:“The absence of any visual signs of decay in the dead body of ParamahansaYogananda offers the most extraordinary case in our experience....No physicaldisintegration was visible in his body even twenty days after death....Noindication of mould was visible on his skin, and no visible desiccation (dryingup) took place in the bodily tissues. This state of perfect preservation of abody is, so far as we know from mortuary annals, an unparalleled one....At thetime of receiving Yogananda’s body, the Mortuary personnel expected to observe,through the glass lid of the casket, the usual progressive signs of bodilydecay. Our astonishment increased as day followed day without bringing anyvisible change in the body under observation. Yogananda’s body was apparently ina phenomenal state of immutability....“No odour of decay emanated from his body at any time.... The physicalappearance of Yogananda on March 27th, just before the bronze cover of thecasket was put into position, was the same as it had been on March 7th. Helooked on March 27th as fresh and as unravaged by decay as he had looked on thenight of his death. On March 27th there was no reason to say that his body hadsuffered any visible physical disintegration at all. For these reasons we stateagain that the case of Paramahansa Yogananda is unique in our experience.”"},{"pageContent":"Additional Resources onthe Kriya Yoga Teachings ofParamahansa YoganandaYogoda Satsanga Society of India is dedicated to freely assisting seekers.
