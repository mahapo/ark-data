As an eyewitness recountal of the extraordinary lives and powers of modern Hindu saints, the book has importance both timely and timeless. To its illustrious author, whom I have had the pleasu re of knowing both in India and America, may every reader render due appreciation and gratitude. His unusual life-document is certainly one of the most revealing of the depths of the Hindu mind and heart, and of the spiritual wealth of India, ever to be published in the West. It has been my privilege to have met one of the sages whose life- history is herein narrated-Sri Yukteswar Giri. A likeness of the venerable saint appear ed as part of the frontispiece of my Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines . 1-1 It was at Puri, in Orissa, on the Bay of Bengal, that I encountered Sri Yukteswar. He was then the head of a quiet ashrama near the seashore there, and was chie fly occupied in the sp iritual training of a group of youthful disciples. He expressed keen interest in the welfare of the people of the United States and of all the Americas, and of England, too, and questioned me concerning the distant activities, particularly those in California, of his chief disciple, Paramhansa Yogananda, whom he dearly love d, and whom he had sent, in 1920, as his emissary to the West. Sri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence, and worthy of the veneration which his followers spontaneously accorded to him. Every person who knew him, whether of his own community or not, held him in the highest esteem. I vividly recall his tall, straight, ascetic figure, garbed in the saffron-colored garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at th e entrance of the hermitage to give me welcome. His hair was long and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His body was muscularly firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic. He had chosen as his place of earthly abode the holy city of Puri, whither multitud es of pious Hindus, representative of every province of India, come daily on pilgrimage to the famed Temple of Jagannath, \"Lord of the Wo rld.\" It was at Puri that Sri Yukteswar closed his mortal eyes, in 1936, to the scenes of this transito ry state of being and passed on, knowing that his incarnation had been carried to a triump hant completion. I am glad, indeed, to be able to record this testimony to the high character and holiness of Sri Yukteswar. Content to remain afar from the multitude, he gave himself unreservedly and in tranquillity to that ideal life which Paramhansa Yogananda, his disciple, has now described for the ages. W. Y.

PARAMHANSA YOGANANDA October 28, 1945 Encinitas, California CHAPTER: 1 My Parents and Early Life The characteristic features of Indian culture have long been a search for ultimate verities and the concomitant disciple-guru 1-2 relationship. My own path led me to a Christlike sage whose beautiful life was chiseled for the ages. He was one of the great masters who are India's sole remaining wealth. Emerging in every generation, they have bulwarked their land against the fate of Babylon and Egypt. I find my earliest memories covering th e anachronistic features of a previous incarnation. Clear recollections came to me of a distant life, a yogi 1-3 amidst the Himalayan snows. These glimpses of the past, by some dimensionless link, also afforded me a glimpse of the future. The helpless humiliations of infancy are not banished from my mind. I was resentfully conscious of not being able to walk or express myself freely. Prayerful surges arose within me as I realized my bodily impotence. My strong emotional life took silent form as words in many languages. Among the inward confusion of tongues, my ear gradually accustomed itself to the circumambient Bengali"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"syllables of my people. The beguiling scope of an infant's mind! adultly considered limited to toys and toes. Psychological ferment and my unresponsive body brought me to many obstinate crying-spells. I recall the general family bewilderment at my distress. Happier memories, too, crowd in on me: my mother 's caresses, and my first attempts at lisping phrase and toddling step. These ea rly triumphs, usually forgotten quickly, are yet a natural basis of self-confidence. My far-reaching memories are not uniq ue. Many yogis are known to have retained their self-consciousness without interruption by the dramatic transition to and from \"life\" and \"death.\" If man be solely a body, its loss indeed places the final period to identity. But if prophets down the millenniums spake with truth, man is essentially of incorporeal nature. The persistent core of human egoity is only temporarily allied with sense perception. Although odd, clear memories of infancy are not extremely rare. During travels in numerous lands, I have listened to early recollections from the lips of veracious men and women. I was born in the last decade of the nine teenth century, and passed my first eight years at Gorakhpur. This was my birt hplace in the United Provinces of northeastern India. We were eight children: four boys and four girls. I, Mukunda Lal Ghosh 1-4 , was the second son and the fourth child. Father and Mother were Bengalis, of the kshatriya caste. 1-5 Both were blessed with saintly nature. Their mutual love, tr anquil and dignified, never expressed itself frivolously. A perfect parental harmony was the calm center for the revolving tumult of eight young lives. Father, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, was kind , grave, at times stern. Loving him dearly, we children yet observed a cert ain reverential distance. An outstanding mathematician and logician, he was guid ed principally by his intellect. But"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Mother was a queen of hearts, and taught us only through love. After her death, Father displayed more of his inner tender ness. I noticed then that his gaze often metamorphosed into my mother's. In Mother's presence we tasted our earl iest bitter-sweet acquaintance with the scriptures. Tales from the mahabharata and ramayana 1-6 were resourcefully summoned to meet the exigencies of discipline. Instruction and chastisement went hand in hand. A daily gesture of respect to Father was gi ven by Mother's dressing us carefully in the afternoons to welcome him home from the office. His position was similar to that of a vice-president, in the Bengal-Nagpur Railway, one of India's large companies. His work involved traveling, and our family lived in several cities during my childhood. Mother held an open hand toward the n eedy. Father was also kindly disposed, but his respect for law and order extended to the budget. One fortnight Mother spent, in feeding the poor, more than Father's monthly income. \"All I ask, please, is to keep your charities within a reasonable limit.\" Even a gentle rebuke from her husband was grie vous to Mother. She ordered a hackney carriage, not hinting to the children at any disagreement. \"Good-by; I am going away to my mother's home.\" Ancient ultimatum! We broke into astounded lamentations. Our maternal uncle arrived opportunely; he whispered to Father some sage counsel, garnered no doubt from the ages. After Father had made a few conciliatory remarks, Mother happily dismissed the cab. Thus ended the only trouble I ever noticed between my parents. But I recall a characteristic discussion. \"Please give me ten rupees for a hapl ess woman who has just arrived at the house.\" Mother's smile had its own persuasion."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\"Why ten rupees? One is enough.\" Father added a justification: \"When my father and grandparents died suddenly, I had my first taste of poverty. My only breakfast, before walking miles to my sc hool, was a small banana. Later, at the university, I was in such need that I applied to a wealthy judge for aid of one rupee per month. He declined, remarkin g that even a rupee is important.\" \"How bitterly you recall the denial of that rupee!\" Mother's heart had an instant logic. \"Do you want this woman also to remember painfully your refusal of ten rupees which she needs urgently?\" \"You win!\" With the immemorial gesture of vanquished husbands, he opened his wallet. \"Here is a ten-rupee note. Give it to her with my good will.\" Father tended to first say \"No\" to an y new proposal. His attitude toward the strange woman who so readily enlisted Mo ther's sympathy was an example of his customary caution. Aversion to instant acce ptance- typical of the French mind in the West-is really only honoring the princi ple of \"due reflection.\" I always found Father reasonable and evenly balanced in his judgments. If I could bolster up my numerous requests with one or two good arguments, he invariably put the coveted goal within my reach, whether it were a vacation trip or a new motorcycle. Father was a strict disciplinarian to hi s children in their early years, but his attitude toward himself was truly Sparta n. He never visited the theater, for instance, but sought his recreation in va rious spiritual practices and in reading the bhagavad gita . 1-7 Shunning all luxuries, he wo uld cling to one old pair of shoes until they were usele ss. His sons bought automobi les after they came into popular use, but Father was always content with the trolley car for his daily ride to the office. The accumulation of money for the sake of power was alien to his nature. Once, after organizing the Calc utta Urban Bank, he refused to benefit himself by holding any of its shares. He ha d simply wished to perform a civic duty in his spare time."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Several years after Father had retired on a pension, an English accountant arrived to examine the books of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway Company. The amazed inv estigator discovered that Father had never applied for overdue bonuses. \"He did the work of three men!\" the accou ntant told the company. \"He has rupees 125,000 (about $41,250.) owing to him as back compensation.\" The officials presented Father with a check for this am ount. He tho ught so little about it that he overlooked any mention to the family. Much later he was questioned by my youngest brother Bishnu, who noticed the large deposit on a bank statement. \"Why be elated by material profit?\" Fath er replied. \"The one who pursues a goal of evenmindedness is neither jubilant with gain nor depressed by l oss. He kn ows that man a rrives penniless in this world, and departs without a single rupee.\" FATHER Bhagabati Charan Ghosh A Disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Early in their married life, my parents be came disciples of a great master, Lahiri Mahasaya of Benares. This contact stre ngthened Father's naturally ascetical temperament. Mother made a remarkable admission to my eldest sister Roma: \"Your father and myself live together as man and wife only once a year, for the purpose of having children.\" Father first met Lahiri Maha saya through Abinash Babu, 1-8 an employee in the Gorakhpur office of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway. Abinash instructed my young ears with engrossing tales of many Indian saints. He invariably concluded with a tribute to the superior glories of his own guru. \"Did you ever hear of the extraordinary circumstances under which your father became a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya?\" It was on a lazy summer afternoon, as Abinash and I sat together in the compound of my home, that he put this intriguing question. I shook my head with a smile of anticipation. \"Years ago, before you were born, I asked my superior officer-your father-to give me a week's leave from my Gorakhpur duties in order to visit my guru in Benares. Your father ridiculed my plan. \"'Are you going to become a religious fana tic?' he inquired. 'Concentrate on your office work if you want to forge ahead.' \"Sadly walking home along a woodland pa th that day, I met your father in a palanquin. He dismissed his servants an d conveyance, and fell into step beside me. Seeking to console me, he pointed out the advantages of striving for worldly success. But I heard him list lessly. My heart was repeat ing: 'Lahiri Mahasaya! I cannot live without seeing you!' \"Our path took us to the edge of a tran quil field, where the rays of the late afternoon sun were still crowning the tall ri pple of the wild grass. We paused in"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"admiration. There in the field, only a fe w yards from us, the form of my great guru suddenly appeared! 1-9 \"'Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!' His voice was resonant in our astounded ears. He vanished as mysterious ly as he had come. On my knees I was exclaiming, 'Lahiri Mahasaya! Lahiri Maha saya!' Your father was motionless with stupefaction for a few moments. \"'Abinash, not only do I give you leave, but I give myself leave to start for Benares tomorrow. I must know this great Lahiri Mahasaya, who is able to materialize himself at will in order to intercede for you! I will take my wife and ask this master to initiate us in his spiritual path. Will you guide us to him?' \"'Of course.' Joy filled me at the miraculo us answer to my prayer, and the quick, favorable turn of events. \"The next evening your parents and I entrained for Benares. We took a horse cart the following day, and then had to walk through narrow lanes to my guru's secluded home. Entering his little parlor , we bowed before the master, enlocked in his habitual lotus posture. He blinked his piercing eyes and leveled them on your father. \"'Bhagabati, you are too hard on your employee!' His words were the same as those he had used two days before in the Gorakhpur field. He added, 'I am glad that you have allowed Abinash to visit me, and that you and your wife have accompanied him.' \"To their joy, he initiated your pa rents in the spiritual practice of Kriya Yoga . 1-10 Your father and I, as brother disciple s, have been close friends since the memorable day of the vision. Lahiri Mahasaya took a de finite interest in your own birth. Your life shall surely be linked with his own: the master's blessing never fails.\""},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Lahiri Mahasaya left this world shortly a fter I had entered it. His picture, in an ornate frame, always graced our family altar in the various cities to which Father was transferred by his office. Many a mo rning and evening found Mother and me meditating before an improvised shrine , offering flowers dipped in fragrant sandalwood paste. With frankincense and myrrh as well as our united devotions, we honored the divinity which had found full expression in Lahiri Mahasaya. His picture had a surpassing influence over my life. As I grew , the thought of the master grew with me. In meditation I would often see his photographic image emerge from its small frame and, taking a living form, sit before me. When I attempted to touch the feet of his lumi nous body, it would change and again become the picture. As childhood slipped into boyhood, I found Lahiri Mahasaya transformed in my mind from a little image, cribbed in a frame, to a living, enlightening presence. I frequently pr ayed to him in moments of trial or confusion, finding within me his solacing direction. At first I grieved because he was no longer physically living. As I bega n to discover his secret omnipresence, I lamented no more. He had often written to those of his disciples who were over- anxious to see him: \"Why come to view my bones and flesh, when I am ever within range of your kutastha (spiritual sight)?\" I was blessed about the age of eight with a wonderful healing through the photograph of Lahiri Mahasaya. This expe rience gave intensification to my love. While at our family estate in Ichapur, Be ngal, I was stricken with Asiatic cholera. My life was despaired of; the doctors could do nothing. At my bedside, Mother frantically motioned me to look at Lahi ri Mahasaya's picture on the wall above my head. \"Bow to him mentally!\" She knew I was too feeble even to lift my hands in salutation. \"If you really show your devoti on and inwardly kneel before him, your life will be spared!\" I gazed at his photograph and saw there a blinding light, enveloping my body and the entire room. My nausea and other uncontrollable symptoms disappeared; I"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"was well. At once I felt strong enough to bend over and touch Mother's feet in appreciation of her immeasurable faith in her guru. Mother pressed her head repeatedly against the little picture. \"O Omnipresent Master, I thank thee that thy light hath healed my son!\" I realized that she too had witnessed the luminous blaze through which I had instantly recovered from a usually fatal disease. One of my most precious possessions is th at same photograph. Given to Father by Lahiri Mahasaya himself, it carries a holy vibration. The picture had a miraculous origin. I heard the story from Father's brother disciple, Kali Kumar Roy. It appears that the master had an aver sion to being photographed. Over his protest, a group picture was once taken of him and a cluster of devotees, including Kali Kumar Roy. It was an amazed photographer who discovered that the plate which had clear images of all the disciples, revealed nothing more than a blank space in the center where he had reas onably expected to find the outlines of Lahiri Mahasaya. The phenomen on was widely discussed. A certain student and expert photographer, Ganga Dhar Babu, boasted that the fugitive figure would not escape him. The next morning, as the guru sat in lotus posture on a wooden bench with a screen behind him, Ganga Dhar Babu arrived with his equipment. Taking every precaution for success, he greedily exposed twelve plates. On each one he soon found the imprint of the wooden bench and screen, but once again the master's form was missing. With tears and shattered pride, Ganga Dhar Babu sought out his guru. It was many hours before Lahiri Mahasaya brok e his silence with a pregnant comment: \"I am Spirit. Can your camera re flect the omnipresent Invisible?\" \"I see it cannot! But, Holy Sir, I loving ly desire a picture of the bodily temple where alone, to my narrow vision, that Spirit appears fully to dwell.\""},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"\"Come, then, tomorrow morning. I will pose for you.\" Again the photographer focused his came ra. This time the sacred figure, not cloaked with mysterious imperceptibility , was sharp on the plate. The master never posed for another picture; at least, I have seen none. The photograph is reproduced in this book . Lahiri Mahasaya's fair features, of a universal cast, hardly suggest to what ra ce he belonged. His intense joy of God- communion is slightly revealed in a somewhat enigmatic smile. His eyes, half open to denote a nominal direction on the outer world, are half closed also. Completely oblivious to the poor lures of the earth, he was fully awake at all times to the spiritual problems of seekers who approached for his bounty. Shortly after my healing through the pote ncy of the guru's picture, I had an influential spiritual vision. Sitting on my bed one morning, I fell into a deep reverie. \"What is behind the darkness of closed eyes?\" This probing thought came powerfully into my mind. An immense flas h of light at once manifested to my inward gaze. Divine shapes of saints, si tting in meditation posture in mountain caves, formed like miniature cinema pic tures on the large screen of radiance within my forehead. \"Who are you?\" I spoke aloud. \"We are the Himalayan yogis.\" The celestial response is difficult to describe; my heart was thrilled. \"Ah, I long to go to the Himalayas and become like you!\" The vision vanished, but the silvery beams expanded in ever -widening circles to infinity. \"What is this wondrous glow?\" \"I am Iswara. 1-11 I am Light.\" The voice was as murmuring clouds."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"\"I want to be one with Thee!\" Out of the slow dwindling of my divine ec stasy, I salvaged a permanent legacy of inspiration to seek God. \"He is eternal, ever-new Joy!\" This memory persisted long after the day of rapture. Another early recollection is outstanding; and literally so, for I bear the scar to this day. My elder sister Uma and I were seated in the early morning under a neem tree in our Gorakhpur compound. Sh e was helping me with a Bengali primer, what time I could spare my gaze from the near-by parrots eating ripe margosa fruit. Uma complained of a boil on her leg, and fetched a jar of ointment. I smeared a bit of the salve on my forearm. \"Why do you use medicine on a healthy arm?\" \"Well, Sis, I feel I am going to have a boil tomorrow. I am testing your ointment on the spot where the boil will appear.\" \"You little liar!\" \"Sis, don't call me a liar until you see wh at happens in the morning.\" Indignation filled me. Uma was unimpressed, and thrice repeat ed her taunt. An adamant resolution sounded in my voice as I made slow reply. \"By the power of will in me, I say that tomo rrow I shall have a fairly large boil in this exact place on my arm; and your boil shall swell to twice its present size!\" Morning found me with a stalwart boil on the indicated spot; the dimensions of Uma's boil had doubled. With a shriek, my sister rushed to Mother. \"Mukunda has become a necromancer!\" Gravely, Mother instructed me never to use the power of words for doing harm. I have always remembered her counsel, and followed it."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"My boil was surgically treated. A noticeable scar, left by the doctor's incision, is present today. On my right forearm is a constant reminder of the power in man's sheer word. Those simple and apparently harmless phrases to Uma, spoken with deep concentration, had possessed sufficient hidden force to explode like bombs and produce definite, though injurious, effects. I understood, later, that the explosive vibratory power in speech could be wisely directed to free one's life from difficulties, and thus operate without scar or rebuke. 1-12 Our family moved to Lahore in the Punjab. There I acquired a picture of the Divine Mother in the form of the Goddess Kali. 1-13 It sanctified a small informal shrine on the balcony of our home. An un equivocal conviction came over me that fulfillment would crown any of my prayers uttered in that sacred spot. Standing there with Uma one day, I watched two kite s flying over the roofs of the buildings on the opposite side of the very narrow lane. \"Why are you so quiet?\" Uma pushed me playfully. \"I am just thinking how wonderful it is that Divine Mother gives me whatever I ask.\" \"I suppose She would give you those two kites!\" My sister laughed derisively. \"Why not?\" I began silent pr ayers for their possession. Matches are played in India with kites whose strings are covered with glue and ground glass. Each player attempts to sever the string of his opponent. A freed kite sails over the roofs; there is great fun in catching it. Inasmuch as Uma and I were on the balcony, it seemed impossible that any loosed kite could come into our hands; its string would naturally dangle over the roofs. The players across the lane began their ma tch. One string was cut; immediately the kite floated in my direction. It wa s stationary for a moment, through sudden"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"abatement of breeze, which sufficed to firm ly entangle the string with a cactus plant on top of the opposite house. A pe rfect loop was formed for my seizure. I handed the prize to Uma. \"It was just an extraordinary accident, an d not an answer to your prayer. If the other kite comes to you, then I shall be lieve.\" Sister's dark eyes conveyed more amazement than her words. I continued my prayers with a crescendo intensity. A forcible tug by the other player resulted in the abrupt loss of his kite. It headed toward me, dancing in the wind. My helpful assistant, the cactus plan t, again secured the kite string in the necessary loop by which I could grasp it. I presented my second trophy to Uma. \"Indeed, Divine Mother listens to you! Th is is all too uncanny for me!\" Sister bolted away like a frightened fawn. 1-2: Spiritual teacher; from Sanskrit root gu r, to raise, to uplift. 1-3: A practitioner of yoga, \"union,\" ancien t Indian science of meditation on God. 1-4: My name was changed to Yogananda when I entered the ancient monastic Swami Order in 1914. My guru bestowed the religious title of Paramhansa on me in 1935 (see chapters 24 and 42 ). 1-5: Traditionally, the second caste of warriors and rulers. 1-6: These ancient epics are the hoard of India's history, mythology, and philosophy. An \"Everyman's Library\" volume, Ramayana and Mahabharata , is a condensation in English verse by Romesh Dutt (New York: E. P. Dutton). 1-7: This noble Sanskrit poem, which occurs as part of the Mahabharata epic, is the Hindu Bible. The most poetical English translation is Edwin Arnold's The Song Celestial (Philadelphia: David McKay, 75 cents). One of the best translations with detailed commentary is Sri Aurobindo's Message Of The Gita (Jupiter Press, 16 Semudoss St., Madras, India, $3.50). 1-8: Babu (Mister) is placed in Bengali names at the end. 1-9: The phenomenal powers possessed by great masters are explained in chapter 30 , \"The Law of Miracles.\""},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"1-10: A yogic technique whereby the sensory tumult is stilled, permitting man to achieve an ever- increasing identity with cosmic consciousness. (See chapter 26 .) 1-11: A Sanskrit name for God as Ruler of the universe; from the root Is , to rule. There are 108 names for God in the Hindu scriptures, each on e carrying a different shade of philosophical meaning. 1-12: The infinite potencies of soun d derive from the Creative Word, Aum , the cosmic vibratory power behind all atomic energies. Any word spoken with clear realization and deep concentration has a materializing value. Loud or silent repetition of inspiring words has been found effective in Coueism and similar systems of psychotherapy; the secret lies in the stepping-up of the mind's vibratory rate. The poet Tennyson has left us, in his Memoirs , an account of his repetitious device for passing beyond the conscious mind into superconsciousness: \"A kind of waking trance-this for lack of a bett er word-I have frequently had, quite up from boyhood, when I have been all alone,\" Tennyson wrote. \"This has come upon me through repeating my own name to myself silently, till all at once, as it were out of the intensity of the consciousness of individuality, individuality itself seemed to di ssolve and fade away into boundless being, and this not a confused state but the clearest, the surest of the surest, utterly beyond words-where death was an almost laughable impossibility-the loss of pe rsonality (if so it were) seeming no extinction, but the only true life.\" He wrote further: \"It is no nebulous ecstasy, but a state of transcendent wonder, associated with absolute clearness of mind.\" 1-13: Kali is a symbol of God in the aspect of eternal Mother Nature. CHAPTER: 2 My Mother's Death And The Mystic Amulet My mother's greatest desire was the marri age of my elder brother. \"Ah, when I behold the face of Ananta's wife, I shall find heaven on this earth!\" I frequently heard Mother express in these words her strong Indian sentiment for family continuity. I was about eleven years old at the time of Ananta's betrothal. Mother was in Calcutta, joyously supervising the weddi ng preparations. Father and I alone remained at our home in Bareilly in no rthern India, whence Father had been transferred after two years at Lahore."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"I had previously witnessed the splendor of nuptial rites for my two elder sisters, Roma and Uma; but for Ananta, as the el dest son, plans were truly elaborate. Mother was welcoming numerous relative s, daily arriving in Calcutta from distant homes. She lodged them comfortably in a large, newly acquired house at 50 Amherst Street. Everything was in re adiness-the banquet delicacies, the gay throne on which Brother was to be carried to the home of the bride-to-be, the rows of colorful lights, the mammoth cardboard elephants and camels, the English, Scottish and Indian orchestras, the professional entertainers, the priests for the ancient rituals. Father and I, in gala spirits, were pla nning to join the family in time for the ceremony. Shortly before the great day, however, I had an ominous vision. It was in Bareilly on a midnight. As I slept beside Father on the piazza of our bungalow, I was awakened by a peculiar flutter of the mosquito netting over the bed. The flimsy curtains parted and I saw the beloved form of my mother. \"Awaken your father!\" Her voice was only a whisper. \"Take the first available train, at four o'clock this morning. Ru sh to Calcutta if you would see me!\" The wraithlike figure vanished. \"Father, Father! Mother is dying!\" The terror in my tone aroused him instantly. I sobbed out the fatal tidings. \"Never mind that hallucinati on of yours.\" Father gave his characteristic negation to a new situation. \"Your mother is in ex cellent health. If we get any bad news, we shall leave tomorrow.\" \"You shall never forgive yourself for not starting now!\" Anguish caused me to add bitterly, \"Nor shall I ever forgive you!\" The melancholy morning came with expl icit words: \"Mother dangerously ill; marriage postponed; come at once.\""},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Father and I left distractedly. One of my uncles met us en route at a transfer point. A train thundered toward us, looming with telescopic increase. From my inner tumult, an abrupt determination arose to hurl myself on the railroad tracks. Already bereft, I felt, of my mother, I could not endure a world suddenly barren to the bone. I loved Mother as my dearest friend on earth. Her solacing black eyes had been my surest refuge in the trifling tragedies of childhood. \"Does she yet live?\" I stopped for one last question to my uncle. \"Of course she is alive!\" He was not slow to interpret the desperation in my face. But I scarcely believed him. When we reached our Calcutta home, it was only to confront the stunning mystery of death. I collapsed into an almo st lifeless state. Years passed before any reconciliation entered my heart. Storming the very gates of heaven, my cries at last summoned the Divine Mother. Her words brought final healing to my suppurating wounds: \"It is I who have watched over thee, life after life, in the tenderness of many mothers! See in My gaze the two black eyes, the lost beautiful eyes, thou seekest!\" Father and I returned to Bareilly soon after the crematory rites for the well- beloved. Early every morning I made a pathetic memorial- pilgrimage to a large sheoli tree which shaded the smooth, green-g old lawn before our bungalow. In poetical moments, I thought that the white sheoli flowers were strewing themselves with a willing devotion over th e grassy altar. Mingling tears with the dew, I often observed a strange other-worldly light emerging from the dawn. Intense pangs of longing for God assailed me. I felt powerfully drawn to the Himalayas. One of my cousins, fresh from a period of travel in the holy hills, visited us in Bareilly. I listened eagerly to his tales about the high mountain abode of yogis and swamis. 2-1 "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"\"Let us run away to the Himalayas.\" My suggestion one day to Dwarka Prasad, the young son of our landlord in Bareilly , fell on unsympathetic ears. He revealed my plan to my elder brother, who had just arrived to see Father. Instead of laughing lightly over this impractical sc heme of a small boy, Ananta made it a definite point to ridicule me. \"Where is your orange robe? You can't be a swami without that!\" But I was inexplicably thrilled by his wo rds. They brought a clear picture of myself roaming about India as a monk. Perhaps they awakened memories of a past life; in any case, I began to see with what natural ease I would wear the garb of that anciently-founded monastic order. Chatting one morning with Dwarka, I felt a love for God descending with avalanchic force. My companion was only partly attentive to the ensuing eloquence, but I was wholeheartedly listening to myself. I fled that afternoon toward Naini Tal in the Himalayan foothills. Ananta gave determined chase; I was forced to return sadly to Bareilly. The only pilgrimage permitted me was the customary one at dawn to the sheoli tree. My heart wept for the lost Mothers, human and divine. The rent left in the family fabric by Moth er's death was irreparable. Father never remarried during his nearly forty remainin g years. Assuming the difficult role of Father-Mother to his little flock, he grew noticeably more tender, more approachable. With calmness and insight, he solved the various family problems. After office hours he retired like a herm it to the cell of his room, practicing Kriya Yoga in a sweet serenity. Long after Mother's death, I attempted to engage an English nurse to attend to details that would make my parent's life more comfortable. But Father shook his head."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" My Mother A Disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya \"Service to me ended with your mother.\" His eyes wer e remote with a lifelong devotion. \"I will not a ccept minist rations from any othe r woman.\" Fourteen months after Mother's passing, I learned that she had left me a momentous message. Ananta wa s present at her deathbed and had recorded h er words. Although she had asked that the disc losure be made to me in one year, my brother delayed. He was soon to leave Ba reilly for Calcutta, to marry the girl Mother ha d chosen for him. 2-2 One evening he summoned me to his side. \"Mukunda, I have been reluctant to give you strange tidings.\" Ananta's tone he ld a note of resignation. \"My fear was to in flame your desire to leave home. But in any case yo u are bristling with divine ar dor. When I captured you recently on your way to the Himalayas, I came to a defin ite resolve. I must not further postpone the fulfillme nt of my so lemn promise.\" My brother handed me a small box, and delivered Mother's messa ge."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"\"Let these words be my final blessing , my beloved son Mukunda!\" Mother had said. \"The hour is here when I must relate a number of phenomenal events following your birth. I first knew your de stined path when you were but a babe in my arms. I carried you then to the home of my guru in Benares. Almost hidden behind a throng of disciples, I could barely see Lahiri Mahasaya as he sat in deep meditation. \"While I patted you, I was praying that th e great guru take notice and bestow a blessing. As my silent devo tional demand grew in intensity, he opened his eyes and beckoned me to approach. The others made a way for me; I bowed at the sacred feet. My master seated you on his lap, placing his hand on your forehead by way of spiritually baptizing you. \"'Little mother, thy son will be a yogi. As a spiritual engine, he will carry many souls to God's kingdom.' \"My heart leaped with joy to find my secret prayer granted by the omniscient guru. Shortly before your birth, he ha d told me you would follow his path. \"Later, my son, your vision of the Grea t Light was known to me and your sister Roma, as from the next room we observed you motionless on the bed. Your little face was illuminated; your voice rang with iron resolve as you spoke of going to the Himalayas in quest of the Divine. \"In these ways, dear son, I came to know that your road lies far from worldly ambitions. The most singular event in my life brought further confirmation-an event which now impels my deathbed message. \"It was an interview with a sage in the Punjab. While our family was living in Lahore, one morning the servant came precipitantly into my room. \"'Mistress, a strange sadhu 2-3 is here. He insists that he \"see the mother of Mukunda.\"'"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"\"These simple words struck a profound ch ord within me; I went at once to greet the visitor. Bowing at his feet, I sensed that before me was a true man of God. \"'Mother,' he said, 'the great masters wish you to know that your stay on earth will not be long. Your next illnes s shall prove to be your last.' 2-4 There was a silence, during which I felt no alarm but on ly a vibration of great peace. Finally he addressed me again: \"'You are to be the custodian of a certain silver amulet. I will not give it to you today; to demonstrate the truth in my wo rds, the talisman shall materialize in your hands tomorrow as you meditate. On your deathbed, you must instruct your eldest son Ananta to keep the amulet for on e year and then to hand it over to your second son. Mukunda will understand the me aning of the talisman from the great ones. He should receive it about the time he is ready to renounce all worldly hopes and start his vital search for God. When he has retained the amulet for some years, and when it has served its purp ose, it shall vanish. Even if kept in the most secret spot, it shall return whence it came.' \"I proffered alms 2-5 to the saint, and bowed before him in great reverence. Not taking the offering, he departed with a bl essing. The next evening, as I sat with folded hands in meditation, a silver amul et materialized between my palms, even as the sadhu had promised. It made itself known by a cold, smooth touch. I have jealously guarded it for more than two years, and now leave it in Ananta's keeping. Do not grieve for me, as I shall have been ushered by my great guru into the arms of the Infinite. Farewell, my chil d; the Cosmic Mother will protect you.\" A blaze of illumination came over me with possession of the amulet; many dormant memories awakened. The talisman, round and anciently quaint, was covered with Sanskrit characters. I underst ood that it came from teachers of past lives, who were invisibly guiding my steps. A further significance there was, indeed; but one does not reveal fully the heart of an amulet."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"How the talisman finally vanished amidst deeply unhappy circumstances of my life; and how its loss was a herald of my gain of a guru, cannot be told in this chapter. But the small boy, thwarted in his attempts to reach the Himalayas, daily traveled far on the wings of his amulet. 2-1: Sanskrit root meaning of swami is \"he who is one with his Self ( Swa ).\" Applied to a member of the Indian order of monks, the title has the formal respect of \"the reverend.\" 2-2: The Indian custom, whereby parents choose th e life-partner for their child, has resisted the blunt assaults of time. The percentage is high of happy Indian marriages. 2-3: An anchorite; one who pursues a sadhana or path of spiritual discipline. 2-4: When I discovered by these words that Mother had possessed secret knowledge of a short life, I understood for the first time why she had been insistent on hastening the plans for Ananta's marriage. Though she died before the wedding, her natural maternal wish had been to witness the rites. 2-5: A customary gesture of respect to sadhus . CHAPTER: 3 The Saint With Two Bodies \"Father, if I promise to return home with out coercion, may I take a sight-seeing trip to Benares?\" My keen love of travel was seldom hindered by Father. He permitted me, even as a mere boy, to visit many cities and pilg rimage spots. Usually one or more of my friends accompanied me; we would travel comfortably on first-class passes provided by Father. His position as a railro ad official was fully satisfactory to the nomads in the family."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Father promised to give my reques t due consideration. The next day he summoned me and held out a round-trip pass from Bareilly to Benares, a number of rupee notes, and two letters. \"I have a business matter to propose to a Benares friend, Kedar Nath Babu. Unfortunately I have lost his address. B ut I believe you will be able to get this letter to him through our common friend , Swami Pranabananda. The swami, my brother disciple, has attained an exalted spiritual stature. You will benefit by his company; this second note will se rve as your introduction.\" Father's eyes twinkled as he added, \"Mind, no more flights from home!\" I set forth with the zest of my twelve years (though time has never dimmed my delight in new scenes and strange faces). Reaching Benares, I proceeded immediately to the swami's residence. Th e front door was open; I made my way to a long, hall-like room on the second floor. A rather stout man, wearing only a loincloth, was seated in lotus posture on a slightly raised platform. His head and unwrinkled face were clean-shaven; a beatific smile played about his lips. To dispel my thought that I had intruded, he greeted me as an old friend. \" Baba anand (bliss to my dear one).\" His welcome was given heartily in a childlike voice. I knelt and touched his feet. \"Are you Swami Pranabananda?\" He nodded. \"Are you Bhagabati's son?\" Hi s words were out before I had had time to get Father's letter from my pocket. In astonishment, I handed him the note of introduction, which now seemed superfluous. \"Of course I will locate Kedar Nath Babu for you.\" The saint again surprised me by his clairvoyance. He glanced at th e letter, and made a few affectionate references to my parent."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"\"You know, I am enjoying two pensions. One is by the recommendation of your father, for whom I once worked in the railroad office. The other is by the recommendation of my Heavenly Father , for whom I have conscientiously finished my earthly duties in life.\" I found this remark very obscure. \"What ki nd of pension, sir, do you receive from the Heavenly Father? Does He drop money in your lap?\" He laughed. \"I mean a pension of fath omless peace-a reward for many years of deep meditation. I never crave money now. My few material needs are amply provided for. Later you will understand the significance of a second pension.\" Abruptly terminating our conversation, the saint became gravely motionless. A sphinxlike air enveloped him. At first his eyes sparkled , as if observing something of interest, then grew dull. I felt abashed at his pauciloquy; he had not yet told me how I could meet Father's friend. A trifle restlessly, I looked about me in the bare room, empty except for us two. My idle gaze took in his wooden sandals, lying under the platform seat. \"Little sir, 3-1 don't get worried. The man you wish to see will be with you in half an hour.\" The yogi was reading my mind-a feat not too difficult at the moment! Again he fell into inscrutable silence. My watch informed me that thirty minutes had elapsed. The swami aroused himself. \"I think Keda r Nath Babu is nearing the door.\" I heard somebody coming up the stairs. An amazed incomprehension arose suddenly; my thoughts raced in confusion: \"H ow is it possible that Father's friend has been summoned to this place witho ut the help of a messenger? The swami has spoken to no one but myself since my arrival!\" Abruptly I quitted the room and descended the steps. Halfway down I met a thin, fair-skinned man of medium height. He appeared to be in a hurry."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"\"Are you Kedar Nath Babu?\" Excitement colored my voice. \"Yes. Are you not Bhagabati's son who has been waiting here to meet me?\" He smiled in friendly fashion. \"Sir, how do you happen to come here?\" I felt baffled resentment over his inexplicable presence. \"Everything is mysterious today! Less than an hour ago I had just finished my bath in the Ganges when Swami Pranaban anda approached me. I have no idea how he knew I was there at that time. \"'Bhagabati's son is waiting for you in my apartment,' he said. 'Will you come with me?' I gladly agreed. As we proceeded hand in hand, the swami in his wooden sandals was strangely able to outpace me, though I wore these stout walking shoes. \"'How long will it take you to reach my place?' Pranabanandaji suddenly halted to ask me this question. \"'About half an hour.' \"'I have something else to do at present. ' He gave me an enigmatical glance. 'I must leave you behind. You can join me in my house, where Bhagabati's son and I will be awaiting you.' \"Before I could remonstrate, he dashed swiftly past me and disappeared in the crowd. I walked here as fast as possible.\" This explanation only increased my bewilderment. I inquired how long he had known the swami. \"We met a few times last year, but not rece ntly. I was very glad to see him again today at the bathing ghat .\""},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"\"I cannot believe my ears! Am I losing my mind? Did you meet him in a vision, or did you actually see him, touch his hand , and hear the sound of his feet?\" \"I don't know what you're driving at!\" He flushed angrily. \"I am not lying to you. Can't you understand that only through the swami could I have known you were waiting at this place for me?\" \"Why, that man, Swami Pranabananda, ha s not left my sight a moment since I first came about an hour ago.\" I blurted out the whole story. His eyes opened widely. \"Are we living in this material age, or are we dreaming? I never expected to witness such a miracle in my life! I thought this swami was just an ordinary man, and now I find he can materialize an extra body and work through it!\" Together we entered the saint's room. \"Look, those are the very sand als he was wearing at the ghat ,\" Kedar Nath Babu whispered. \"He was clad only in a lo incloth, just as I see him now.\" As the visitor bowed before him, the sain t turned to me with a quizzical smile. \"Why are you stupefied at all this? The su btle unity of the phenomenal world is not hidden from true yogis. I instantly see and converse with my disciples in distant Calcutta. They can similarly tran scend at will every obstacle of gross matter.\" It was probably in an effort to stir spiritual ardor in my young breast that the swami had condescended to tell me of his powers of astral radio and television. 3- 2 But instead of enthusiasm, I experience d only an awe-stricken fear. Inasmuch as I was destined to undertake my divine search through one particular guru-Sri Yukteswar, whom I had not yet met-I felt no inclination to accept Pranabananda as my teacher. I glanced at him doubtfu lly, wondering if it were he or his counterpart before me."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" Swami Pranabananda \"The Saint With Two Bodies\" An Exalted Disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya The master sought to banish my disq uietude by bestowing a soul- awakening gaze, and b y some inspiring words about his guru. \"Lahiri Mahasaya was the greatest yogi I ev er knew. He was Divinity Itself in the form of flesh.\" If a disciple, I reflected, could material ize an extra fleshly form at will, what miracles indeed could be barred t o his master? \"I will tell you how pri celess is a g uru's help.

You must meditate more profoundly.' \"'I am appealing to Thee, O God my Master !

'You may go now and meditate. I have interceded for you with Brahma.' 3-3 \"Immeasurably uplifted, I returned to my home. In meditation that night, the burning Goal of my life was achieved . Now I ceaselessly enjoy the spiritual pension. Never from that day has the Blissful Creator remained hidden from my eyes behind any screen of delusion.\" Pranabananda's face was suffused with di vine light. The peace of another world entered my heart; all fear had fled. The saint made a further confidence. \"Some months later I returned to Lahiri Mahasaya and tried to thank him for his bestowal of the infinite gift. Then I mentioned another matter. \"'Divine Guru, I can no longer work in the office. Please release me. Brahma keeps me continuously intoxicated.' \"'Apply for a pension from your company.' \"'What reason shall I give, so early in my service?' \"'Say what you feel.'"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"\"The next day I made my application.

I know th e divine will of Lahiri Mahasaya worked through the doctor and the railroad offici als, including your father. Automatically they obeyed the great guru's spiritual direction, and freed me for a life of unbroken communion with the Beloved.\" 3-5 After this extraordinary revelation, Swam i Pranabananda retired into one of his long silences. As I was taking leave, touc hing his feet reverent ly, he gave me his blessing: \"Your life belongs to the path of renuncia tion and yoga. I shall see you again, with your father, later on.\" The years brought fulfillment to both these predictions. 3-6 Kedar Nath Babu walked by my side in the gathering darkness. I delivered Father's letter, which my companion read under a street lamp. \"Your father suggests that I take a position in the Calcutta office of his railroad company. How pleasant to look forward to at least one of the pensions that Swami Pranabananda enjoys! But it is im possible; I cannot leave Benares. Alas, two bodies are not yet for me!\" 3-1: Choto Mahasaya is the term by which a number of Indi an saints addressed me. It translates \"little sir.\". 3-2: In its own way, physical science is affirming the validity of laws discovered by yogis through mental science. For example, a de monstration that man has televisional powers was given on Nov. 26, 1934 at the Royal University of Rome. \"Dr. Giuseppe Calligaris, professor of neuro-psychology, pressed certain points of a subj ect's body and the subject respon ded with minute descriptions of other persons and objects on the opposite side of a wall.

To enable his subject to discern things on the other side of a wall, Professor Calligaris pressed on a spot to the right of the thorax for fifteen minutes.

When Emerson's poem Brahma appeared in the Atlantic Monthly in 1857, most the readers were bewildere d. Emerson chuckled. \"Tell them,\" he said, \"to say 'Jehovah' instead of 'Brahma' and they will not feel any perplexity.\" 3-4: In deep meditation, the first experience of Spirit is on the altar of the spine, and then in the brain. The torrential bliss is overwhelming, but the yogi learns to control its outward manifestations. 3-5: After his retirement, Pranab ananda wrote one of the most profound commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita, available in Bengali and Hindi. 3-6: See chapter 27 . CHAPTER: 4 My Interrupted Flight Toward The Himalayas \"Leave your classroom on some trifling pretext, and engage a hackney carriage. Stop in the lane where no one in my house can see you.\" These were my final instructions to Amar Mitter, a high school friend who planned to accompany me to the Himalaya s. We had chosen the following day for our flight. Precautions were necessary, as Ananta exercised a vigilant eye. He was determined to foil the plans of escape which he suspected were uppermost in my mind. The amulet, like a spiritual yeast, was silently at work within me. Amidst the Himalayan snows, I hoped to find th e master whose face often appeared to me in visions. The family was living now in Calcutta, where Father had been permanently transferred. Following the patriarchal Indian custom, Ananta had brought his bride to live in our home, now at 4 Gurp ar Road. There in a small attic room I engaged in daily meditations and prepar ed my mind for the divine search."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The memorable morning arrived with inau spicious rain. Hearing the wheels of Amar's carriage in the road, I hastily tied together a blanket, a pair of sandals, Lahiri Mahasaya's picture, a copy of the Bhagavad Gita, a string of prayer beads, and two loincloths. This bundle I threw from my third-story window. I ran down the steps and passed my uncle, buying fish at the door. \"What is the excitement?\" His gaze ro ved suspiciously over my person. I gave him a noncommittal smile and walked to the lane. Retrieving my bundle, I joined Amar with conspiratorial caution. We drove to Chadni Chowk, a merchandise center. For months we had been saving our tiffin money to buy English clothes. Knowing that my clever brother could easily play the part of a detective, we thought to outwit him by European garb. On the way to the station, we stopped fo r my cousin, Jotin Ghosh, whom I called Jatinda. He was a new convert, longing fo r a guru in the Himalayas. He donned the new suit we had in readiness. Well- camouflaged, we hoped! A deep elation possessed our hearts. \"All we need now are canvas shoes.\" I le d my companions to a shop displaying rubber-soled footwear. \"Articles of leathe r, gotten only through the slaughter of animals, must be absent on this holy trip .\" I halted on the street to remove the leather cover from my Bhagavad Gita , and the leather stra ps from my English- made sola topee (helmet). At the station we bought tickets to Burd wan, where we planned to transfer for Hardwar in the Himalayan foothills. As soon as the train, like ourselves, was in flight, I gave utterance to a few of my glorious anticipations. \"Just imagine!\" I ejaculated. \"We shall be initiated by the masters and experience the trance of cosmic consciousness. Our flesh will be charged with such magnetism that wild animals of the Hima layas will come tamely near us. Tigers will be no more than meek hous e cats awaiting our caresses!\""},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"This remark-picturing a prospect I consi dered entrancing, both metaphorically and literally-brought an enthusiastic sm ile from Amar. But Jatinda averted his gaze, directing it through the window at the scampering landscape. \"Let the money be divided in three portions.\" Jatinda broke a long silence with this suggestion. \"Each of us should buy his own ticket at Burdwan. Thus no one at the station will surmise that we are running away together.\" I unsuspectingly agreed. At dusk our tr ain stopped at Burdwan. Jatinda entered the ticket office; Amar and I sat on the pl atform. We waited fifteen minutes, then made unavailing inquiries. Searching in all directions, we sh outed Jatinda's name with the urgency of fright. But he had faded into the dark unknown surrounding the little station. I was completely unnerved, shocked to a peculiar numbness. That God would countenance this depressing episode! The romantic occasion of my first carefully- planned flight after Him was cruelly marred. \"Amar, we must return home.\" I was weep ing like a child. \"Jatinda's callous departure is an ill omen. This trip is doomed to failure.\" \"Is this your love for the Lord? Can't you stand the little test of a treacherous companion?\" Through Amar's suggestion of a divine test, my heart steadied itself. We refreshed ourselves with famous Burdwan sweetmeats, sitabhog (food for the goddess) and motichur (nuggets of sweet pearl). In a few ho urs, we entrained for Hardwar, via Bareilly. Changing trains at Moghul Se rai, we discussed a vital matter as we waited on the platform. \"Amar, we may soon be closely question ed by railroad officials. I am not underrating my brother's ingenuity! No matter what the outcome, I will not speak untruth.\""},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"\"All I ask of you, Mukunda, is to keep still. Don't laugh or grin while I am talking.\" At this moment, a European station agent accosted me. He waved a telegram whose import I immediately grasped. \"Are you running away from home in anger?\" \"No!\" I was glad his choice of words perm itted me to make emphatic reply. Not anger but \"divinest melancholy\" was resp onsible, I knew, for my unconventional behavior. The official then turned to Amar. The duel of wits that followed hardly permitted me to maintain the counseled stoic gravity. \"Where is the third boy?\" The man injected a full ring of authority into his voice. \"Come on; speak the truth!\" \"Sir, I notice you are wearing eyeglasses. Can't you see that we are only two?\" Amar smiled impudently. \"I am not a magician; I can't conjure up a third companion.\" The official, noticeably disconcerted by this impertinence, sought a new field of attack. \"What is your name?\" \"I am called Thomas. I am the son of an English mother and a converted Christian Indian father.\" \"What is your friend's name?\" \"I call him Thompson.\""},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"By this time my inward mirth had reac hed a zenith; I unceremoniously made for the train, whistling for departure. Ama r followed with the official, who was credulous and obliging enough to put us into a European compartment. It evidently pained him to think of two half - English boys traveling in the section allotted to natives. After his polite exit, I lay back on the seat and laughed uncontrollably. My friend wore an expre ssion of blithe satisfaction at having outwitted a veteran European official. On the platform I had contrived to read the telegram. From my brother, it went thus: \"Three Bengali boys in English cl othes running away from home toward Hardwar via Moghul Serai. Please detain them until my arrival. Ample reward for your services.\" \"Amar, I told you not to leave marked timetables in your home.\" My glance was reproachful. \"Brother must have found one there.\" My friend sheepishly acknowledged the th rust. We halted briefly in Bareilly, where Dwarka Prasad awaited us with a telegram from Ananta. My old friend tried valiantly to detain us; I convinced him that our flight had not been undertaken lightly. As on a previous occa sion, Dwarka refused my invitation to set forth to the Himalayas. While our train stood in a station that night, and I was half asleep, Amar was awakened by another questioning official . He, too, fell a victim to the hybrid charms of \"Thomas\" and \"Thompson.\" The train bore us triumphantly into a dawn arrival at Hardwar. The majestic mountains loomed invitingly in the distance. We dashed through the station and entered the freedom of city crowds. Our first act was to change into na tive costume, as Ananta had somehow penetrated our European disguise. A pr emonition of capture weighed on my mind. Deeming it advisable to leave Hardwar at once, we bought tickets to proceed north to Rishikesh, a soil long hallowed by feet of many masters. I had already"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"boarded the train, while Amar lagged on the platform. He was brought to an abrupt halt by a shout from a policeman. Our unwelcome guardian escorted us to a station bungalow and took charge of our money. He explained courteously that it was his duty to hold us un til my elder brother arrived. Learning that the truants' destination ha d been the Himalayas, the officer related a strange story. \"I see you are crazy about saints! You wi ll never meet a greater man of God than the one I saw only yesterday. My brother officer and I first encountered him five days ago. We were patrolling by the Ganges, on a sharp lookout for a certain murderer. Our instructions were to captur e him, alive or dead. He was known to be masquerading as a sadhu in order to rob pilgrims. A short way before us, we spied a figure which resembled the description of the criminal. He ignored our command to stop; we ran to overpower hi m. Approaching his back, I wielded my ax with tremendous force; the man's right arm was severed almost completely from his body. \"Without outcry or any glance at the gh astly wound, the stranger astonishingly continued his swift pace. As we jumped in front of him, he spoke quietly. \"'I am not the murderer you are seeking.' \"I was deeply mortified to see I had inju red the person of a divine- looking sage. Prostrating myself at his feet, I implored his pardon, and offered my turban-cloth to staunch the heavy spurts of blood. \"'Son, that was just an un derstandable mistake on your part.' The saint regarded me kindly. 'Run along, and don't reproach yourself. The Beloved Mother is taking care of me.' He pushed his dangling ar m into its stump and lo! it adhered; the blood inexplicably ceased to flow. \"'Come to me under yonder tree in three days and you will find me fully healed. Thus you will feel no remorse.'"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"\"Yesterday my brother officer and I went eagerly to the designated spot. The sadhu was there and allowed us to examine his arm. It bore no scar or trace of hurt! \"'I am going via Rishikesh to the Himala yan solitudes.' He blessed us as he departed quickly. I feel that my life has been uplifted through his sanctity.\" The officer concluded with a pious ejac ulation; his experience had obviously moved him beyond his usual depths. With an impressive gesture, he handed me a printed clipping about the miracle. In the usual garbled manner of the sensational type of newspaper (not missing , alas! even in India), the reporter's version was slightly exaggerated: it indicated that the sadhu had been almost decapitated! Amar and I lamented that we had missed the great yogi who could forgive his persecutor in such a Christlike way. In dia, materially poor for the last two centuries, yet has an inexhaustible fund of divine wealth; spiritual \"skyscrapers\" may occasionally be encountered by the wa yside, even by worldly men like this policeman. We thanked the officer for relieving our te dium with his marvelous story. He was probably intimating that he was more fo rtunate than we: he had met an illumined saint without effort; our earnest search had ended, not at the feet of a master, but in a coarse police station! So near the Himalayas and yet, in our capt ivity, so far, I told Amar I felt doubly impelled to seek freedom. \"Let us slip away when opportunity offers. We can go on foot to holy Rishikesh.\" I smiled encouragingly. But my companion had turned pessimist as soon as the stalwart prop of our money had been taken from us."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"\"If we started a trek over such dangerous jungle land, we should finish, not in the city of saints, but in the stomachs of tigers!\" Ananta and Amar's brother arrived after three days. Amar greeted his relative with affectionate relief.

Then you can resume your search here for a master.\" Amar entered the conversation at this point to disclaim any intention of returning to Hardwar with me. He was enjoying th e familial warmth. But I knew I would never abandon the quest for my guru. Our party entrained for Benares. There I had a singular and instant response to my prayers. A clever scheme had been prearranged by Ananta. Before seeing me at Hardwar, he had stopped in Benares to ask a certai n scriptural authority to interview me later. Both the pundit and his son had pr omised to undertake my dissuasion from the path of a sannyasi . 4-1 Ananta took me to their home. The son, a young man of ebullient manner, greeted me in the courtyard. He engaged me in a lengthy philosophic discourse. Professing to have a clairvoyant knowledge of my future, he discountenanced my idea of being a monk. \"You will meet continual misfortune, and be unable to find God, if you insist on deserting your ordinary responsibilities! You cannot work out your past karma 4-2 without worldly experiences.\""},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Krishna's immortal words rose to my lips in reply: \"'Even he with the worst of karma who ceaselessly meditates on Me qu ickly loses the effects of his past bad actions.

With all the fervor of my heart I prayed silently to God: \"Please solve my bewilderment and answer me, right here and now, if Thou dost desire me to lead the life of a renunciate or a worldly man!\" I noticed a sadhu of noble countenance standing just outside the compound of the pundit's house. Evidently he had overheard the spirited conversation between the self-styled clairvoyant and myself, for th e stranger called me to his side. I felt a tremendous power flowing from his calm eyes. \"Son, don't listen to that ignoramus. In re sponse to your prayer, the Lord tells me to assure you that your sole path in th is life is that of the renunciate.\" With astonishment as well as gratitude, I smiled happily at this decisive message. \"Come away from that man!\" The \"ignoramus\" was calling me from the courtyard. My saintly guide raised his hand in blessing and slowly departed. \"That sadhu is just as crazy as you are.\" It was the hoary-headed pundit who made this charming observation. He and his son were gazing at me lugubriously. \"I heard that he too has left his ho me in a vague search for God.\" I turned away.

He smiled mischievously. \"At your school, I found that Amar had left his classroom and had not returned. I went to his home the next morning an d unearthed a marked timetable. Amar's father was just leaving by carriage and was talking to the coachman. \"'My son will not ride with me to his school this morn ing. He has disappeared!' the father moaned. \"'I heard from a brother coachman that your son and two others, dressed in European suits, boarded the train at Howrah Station,' the man stated. 'They made a present of their leather shoes to the cab driver.' \"Thus I had three clues-the timetable, the trio of boys, and the English clothing.\" I was listening to Ananta's disclosure s with mingled mirth and vexation. Our generosity to the coachman had been slightly misplaced! \"Of course I rushed to send telegrams to station officials in all the cities which Amar had underlined in the timetable. He had checked Bareilly, so I wired your friend Dwarka there. After inquiries in our Calcutta neighborhood, I learned that cousin Jatinda had been absent one night but had arrived home the following morning in European garb. I sought hi m out and invited him to dinner. He accepted, quite disarmed by my frie ndly manner. On the way I led him unsuspectingly to a police station. He wa s surrounded by several officers whom I had previously selected for their feroci ous appearance. Under their formidable gaze, Jatinda agreed to account for his mysterious conduct. \"'I started for the Himalayas in a buoyant spiritual mood,' he explained. 'Inspiration filled me at the prospect of meeting the masters. But as soon as Mukunda said, \"During our ecstasies in the Himalayan caves, tigers will be spellbound and sit around us like tame pussies,\" my spirits froze; beads of"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"perspiration formed on my brow. \"What then?\" I thought. \"If the vicious nature of the tigers be not changed through the power of our spiritual trance, shall they treat us with the kindness of house cats?\" In my mind's eye, I already saw myself the compulsory inmate of some tiger's stomach-entering there not at once with the whole body, but by installments of its several parts!'\" My anger at Jatinda's vanishment was evaporated in laughter. The hilarious sequel on the train was worth all the angu ish he had caused me. I must confess to a slight feeling of satisfaction: Jatinda too had not escaped an encounter with the police! \"Ananta, 4-4 you are a born sleuthhound!\" My glance of amusement was not without some exasperation. \"And I shall tell Jatinda I am glad he was prompted by no mood of treachery, as it appeared, but only by the prudent instinct of self- preservation!\" At home in Calcutta, Father touchingly requ ested me to curb my roving feet until, at least, the completion of my high school studies. In my absence, he had lovingly hatched a plot by arranging for a saintly pundit, Swami Kebalananda, 4-5 to come regularly to the house. \"The sage will be your Sanskrit tuto r,\" my parent announced confidently. Father hoped to satisfy my religious ye arnings by instructions from a learned philosopher. But the tables were subtly tur ned: my new teacher, far from offering intellectual aridities, fanned the embers of my God-aspiration. Unknown to Father, Swami Kebalananda was an exalte d disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya. The peerless guru had possessed thousands of di sciples, silently drawn to him by the irresistibility of his divine magnetism. I learned later that Lahiri Mahasaya had often characterized Kebalananda as rishi or illumined sage. Luxuriant curls framed my tutor's handsome face. His dark eyes were guileless, with the transparency of a child's. All the movements of his slight body were"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"marked by a restful deliberation. Ever gentle and loving, he was firmly established in the infinite consciousness. Many of our happy hours together were spent in deep Kriya meditation. Kebalananda was a noted authority on the ancient shastras or sacred books: his erudition had earned him the title of \"Sha stri Mahasaya,\" by which he was usually addressed. But my progress in Sanskrit scholarship was unnoteworthy. I sought every opportunity to forsake prosaic grammar and to talk of yoga and Lahiri Mahasaya. My tutor obliged me one day by telling me something of his own life with the master. \"Rarely fortunate, I was able to remain near Lahiri Mahasaya for ten years. His Benares home was my nightly goal of pilg rimage. The guru was always present in a small front parlor on the first floor. As he sat in lotus posture on a backless wooden seat, his disciples garlanded him in a semicircle. His eyes sparkled and danced with the joy of the Divine. They were ever half closed, peering through the inner telescopic orb into a sphere of eternal bliss. He seldom spoke at length. Occasionally his gaze would focus on a s tudent in need of help; healing words poured then like an avalanche of light. \"An indescribable peace blossomed within me at the master's glance. I was permeated with his fragrance, as though fr om a lotus of infinity. To be with him, even without exchanging a word for da ys, was experience which changed my entire being. If any invisible barrier rose in the path of my concentration, I would meditate at the guru's feet. There the most tenuous states came easily within my grasp. Such perceptions eluded me in th e presence of lesser teachers. The master was a living temple of God whose secret doors were open to all disciples through devotion. \"Lahiri Mahasaya was no bookish interpre ter of the scriptures. Effortlessly he dipped into the 'divine library.' Foam of words and spray of thoughts gushed from the fountain of his omniscience. He had the wondrous clavis which unlocked the profound philosophical science embedded ages ago in the Vedas . 4-6 "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"If asked to explain the different planes of consciousness mentioned in the ancient texts, he would smilingly assent. \"'I will undergo those states, and presently tell you what I perceive.' He was thus diametrically unlike the teachers who com mit scripture to memory and then give forth unrealized abstractions. \"'Please expound the holy stanzas as the meaning occurs to you.' The taciturn guru often gave this instruction to a near -by disciple. 'I will guide your thoughts, that the right interpretation be uttered.' In this way many of Lahiri Mahasaya's perceptions came to be recorded, with voluminous commentaries by various students. \"The master never counseled slavish belief. 'Words are only shells,' he said. 'Win conviction of God's presence through your own joyous contact in meditation.' \"No matter what the disciple's problem, the guru advised Kriya Yoga for its solution. \"'The yogic key will not lose its efficiency when I am no longer present in the body to guide you. This technique cannot be bound, filed, and forgotten, in the manner of theoretical inspirations. Continue ce aselessly on your path to liberation through Kriya , whose power lies in practice.' \"I myself consider Kriya the most effective device of salvation through self-effort ever to be evolved in man's search for the Infinite.\" Kebalananda concluded with this earnest testimony. \"Through its use, the omnipotent God, hidden in all men, became visibly incarnated in the flesh of Lahiri Mahasaya and a number of his disciples.\" A Christlike miracle by Lahiri Mahasaya took place in Kebalananda's presence. My saintly tutor recounted the story one day, his eyes remote from the Sanskrit texts before us."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"\"A blind disciple, Ramu, aroused my active pity. Should he ha ve no light in his eyes, when he faithfully served our master , in whom the Divine was fully blazing?

When the devotee finally left the room, I followed him. \"'Ramu, how long have you been blind?' \"'From my birth, sir! Never have my eyes been blessed wi th a glimpse of the sun.' \"'Our omnipotent guru can help yo u. Please make a supplication.' \"The following day Ramu diffidently appr oached Lahiri Mahasaya. The disciple felt almost ashamed to ask that physic al wealth be added to his spiritual superabundance. \"'Master, the Illuminator of the cosmos is in you. I pray you to bring His light into my eyes, that I perceive the sun's lesser glow.' \"'Ramu, someone has connived to put me in a difficult position.

Ramu's faith was the devotionally ploughed soil in which the guru's power ful seed of permanent healing sprouted.\" Kebalananda was silent for a moment, then paid a further tribute to his guru. \"It was evident in all miracles performe d by Lahiri Mahasaya that he never allowed the ego-principle 4-9 to consider itself a causative force. By perfection of resistless surrender, the master enabled the Prime Healing Power to flow freely through him. \"The numerous bodies which were specta cularly healed through Lahiri Mahasaya eventually had to feed the flames of cremation. But the silent spiritual awakenings he effected, the Christli ke disciples he fashioned, are his imperishable miracles.\" I never became a Sanskrit scholar; Keba lananda taught me a diviner syntax. 4-1: Literally, \"renunciate.\" From Sanskrit verb roots, \"to cast aside.\" 4-2: Effects of past actions, in this or a former life; from Sanskrit kri , \"to do.\" 4-3: Bhagavad Gita , IX, 30-31. Krishna was the greatest pr ophet of India; Arjuna was his foremost disciple. 4-4: I always addressed him as Ananta-da. Da is a respectful suffix which the eldest brother in an Indian family receives from j unior brothers and sisters. 4-5: At the time of our meet ing, Kebalananda had not yet jo ined the Swami Order and was generally called \"Shastri Mahasaya.\" To avoid conf usion with the name of Lahiri Mahasaya and of Master Mahasaya ( chapter 9 ), I am referring to my Sanskrit tutor only by his later monastic name of Swami Kebalananda. His biography has been recently published in Bengali. Born in the Khulna district of Bengal in 1863, Kebalananda gave up hi s body in Benares at the age of sixty-eight. His family name was Ashutosh Chatterji. 4-6: The ancient four Vedas comprise over 100 extant canonical books. Emerson paid the following tribute in his Journal to Vedic thought: \"It is sublime as he at and night and a breathless ocean. It contains every religious sentiment, all the grand ethics which visit in turn each noble poetic mind. . . .

CHAPTER: 5 A \"Perfume Saint\" Displays His Wonders \"To every thing there is a season, and a ti me to every purpose under the heaven.\" I did not have this wisdom of Solomon to comfort me; I gazed searchingly about me, on any excursion from home, for the face of my destined guru. But my path did not cross his own until after the compl etion of my high school studies. Two years elapsed between my flight with Amar toward the Himalayas, and the great day of Sri Yukteswar's arrival into my life. During that interim I met a number of sages-the \"Perfume Saint,\" the \"Tiger Swami,\" Nagendra Nath Bhaduri, Master Mahasaya, and the famo us Bengali scientist, Jagadis Chandra Bose. My encounter with the \"Perfume Saint\" ha d two preambles, one harmonious and the other humorous. \"God is simple. Everything else is compl ex. Do not seek absolute values in the relative world of nature.\" These philosophical finalities gently ente red my ear as I stood silently before a temple image of Kali. Turning, I confronte d a tall man whose garb, or lack of it, revealed him a wandering sadhu ."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"\"You have indeed penetrated the bewi lderment of my thoughts!\" I smiled gratefully. \"The confusion of benign and terrible aspects in nature, as symbolized by Kali, 5-1 has puzzled wiser heads than mine!\" \"Few there be who solve her mystery! G ood and evil is the challenging riddle which life places sphinxlike before ever y intelligence. Attempting no solution, most men pay forfeit with th eir lives, penalty now even as in the days of Thebes. Here and there, a towering lonely figure never cries defeat. From the maya 5-2 of duality he plucks the cleaveless truth of unity.\" \"You speak with conviction, sir.\" \"I have long exercised an honest intros pection, the exquisitely painful approach to wisdom. Self-scrutiny, relentless observ ance of one's thoughts, is a stark and shattering experience. It pulverizes th e stoutest ego. But true self-analysis mathematically operates to produce seers. The way of 'self-expression,' individual acknowledgments, results in egotists, sure of the right to their private interpretations of God and the universe.\" \"Truth humbly retires, no doubt, before such arrogant originality.\" I was enjoying the discussion. \"Man can understand no eternal veri ty until he has freed himself from pretensions. The human mind, bared to a centuried slime, is teeming with repulsive life of countless world-delusions. Struggles of the battlefields pale into insignificance here, when man first conte nds with inward enemies! No mortal foes these, to be overcome by harrowing array of might! Omnipresent, unresting, pursuing man even in sleep, subtly equipped with a miasmic weapon, these soldiers of ignorant lusts seek to slay us all. Thoughtless is the man who buries his ideals, surrendering to the common fa te. Can he seem other than impotent, wooden, ignominious?\" \"Respected Sir, have you no symp athy for the bewildered masses?\""},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The sage was silent for a moment , then answered obliquely. \"To love both the invisible God, Reposi tory of All Virtues, and visible man, apparently possessed of none , is often baffling! But ingenuity is equal to the maze. Inner research soon exposes a un ity in all human minds-the stalwart kinship of selfish motive. In one sense at least, the brotherhood of man stands revealed. An aghast humility follows this leveling discovery. It ripens into compassion for one's fellows, blind to the healing potencies of the soul awaiting exploration.\" \"The saints of every age, sir, have felt li ke yourself for the sorrows of the world.\" \"Only the shallow man loses responsiveness to the woes of others' lives, as he sinks into narrow suffering of his own.\" The SADHU'S austere face was noticeably softened. \"The one who practice s a scalpel self-dissection will know an expansion of universal pity. Release is given him from the deafening demands of his ego. The love of God flowers on such soil. The creature finally turns to his Creator, if for no other reason than to ask in anguish: 'Why, Lord, why?' By ignoble whips of pain, man is driven at last into the Infinite Presence, whose beauty alone should lure him.\" The sage and I were present in Calcutta's Kalighat Temple, whither I had gone to view its famed magnificence. With a sw eeping gesture, my chance companion dismissed the ornate dignity. \"Bricks and mortar sing us no audible tune; the heart opens only to the human chant of being.\" We strolled to the inviting sunshine at the entrance, where throngs of devotees were passing to and fro. \"You are young.\" The sage surveyed me thoughtfully. \"India too is young. The ancient rishis 5-3 laid down ineradicable patterns of spiritual living. Their hoary dictums suffice for this day and land. No t outmoded, not unsophisticated against"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"the guiles of materialism, the discipli nary precepts mold India still. By millenniums-more than embarrassed scholars care to compute!-the skeptic Time has validated Vedic worth. Take it for your heritage.\" As I was reverently bidding farewell to the eloquent sadhu , he revealed a clairvoyant perception: \"After you leave here today, an unusual experience will come your way.\" I quitted the temple precincts and wandered along aimlessly. Turning a corner, I ran into an old acquaintance-one of those long-winded fellows whose conversational powers ignore time and embrace eternity. \"I will let you go in a very short while, if you will tell me all that has happened during the six years of our separation.\" \"What a paradox! I must leave you now.\" But he held me by the hand, forcing out tidbits of information. He was like a ravenous wolf, I thought in amusement; the longer I spoke, the more hungrily he sniffed for news. Inwardly I petitioned the Goddess Kali to devise a graceful means of escape. My companion left me abruptly. I sighed with relief and doubled my pace, dreading any relapse into the garrulous fe ver. Hearing rapid footsteps behind me, I quickened my speed. I dared not look back. But with a bound, the youth rejoined me, jovially clasping my shoulder. \"I forgot to tell you of Gandha Baba (Perfume Saint), who is gracing yonder house.\" He pointed to a dwelling a few yards distant. \"Do meet him; he is interesting. You may have an unusual experience. Good-by,\" and he actually left me."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The similarly worded prediction of the sadhu at Kalighat Temple flashed to my mind. Definitely intrigued, I entere d the house and was ushered into a commodious parlor. A crowd of people were sitting, Orient-wise, here and there on a thick orange-colored carpet. An awed whisper reached my ear: \"Behold Gandha Baba on the leopard skin. He can give the natural perfume of any flower to a scentless one, or revive a wilted blossom, or make a person's skin exude delightful fragrance.\" I looked directly at the saint; his quic k gaze rested on mine. He was plump and bearded, with dark skin and large, gleaming eyes. \"Son, I am glad to see you. Say what yo u want. Would you like some perfume?\" \"What for?\" I thought his remark rather childish. \"To experience the miraculous way of enjoying perfumes.\" \"Harnessing God to make odors?\" \"What of it? God makes perfume anyway.\" \"Yes, but He fashions frail bottles of pe tals for fresh use and discard. Can you materialize flowers?\" \"I materialize perfumes, little friend.\" \"Then scent factories will go out of business.\" \"I will permit them to keep their trade! My own purpose is to demonstrate the power of God.\" \"Sir, is it necessary to prove God? Isn' t He performing miracles in everything, everywhere?\" \"Yes, but we too should manifest some of His infinite creative variety.\""},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"\"How long did it take to master your art?\" \"Twelve years.\" \"For manufacturing scents by astral means! It seems, my honored saint, you have been wasting a dozen years for fragrances which you can obtain with a few rupees from a florist's shop.\" \"Perfumes fade with flowers.\" \"Perfumes fade with death. Why should I desire that which pleases the body only?\" \"Mr. Philosopher, you please my mind. Now, stretch fo rth your right hand.\" He made a gesture of blessing. I was a few feet away from Gandha Baba; no one else was near enough to contact my body. I extended my hand, wh ich the yogi did not touch. \"What perfume do you want?\" \"Rose.\" \"Be it so.\" To my great surprise, the charming frag rance of rose was wafted strongly from the center of my palm. I smilingly took a large white scentless flower from a near- by vase. \"Can this odorless blossom be permeated with jasmine?\" \"Be it so.\" A jasmine fragrance instantly shot from the petals. I thanked the wonder-worker and seated myself by one of his studen ts. He informed me that Gandha Baba, whose proper name was Vishudhananda, had learned many astonishing yoga"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"secrets from a master in Tibet. The Tibe tan yogi, I was assured, had attained the age of over a thousand years. \"His disciple Gandha Baba does not al ways perform his perfume-feats in the simple verbal manner you have just witn essed.\" The student spoke with obvious pride in his master. \"His procedure diffe rs widely, to accord with diversity in temperaments. He is marvelous! Many me mbers of the Calcutta intelligentsia are among his followers.\" I inwardly resolved not to add myself to their number. A guru too literally \"marvelous\" was not to my li king. With polite thanks to Gandha Baba, I departed. Sauntering home, I reflected on the three varied encounters the day had brought forth. My sister Uma met me as I entered our Gurpar Road door. \"You are getting quite stylish, using perfumes!\" Without a word, I motioned her to smell my hand. \"What an attractive rose fragrance! It is unusually strong!\" Thinking it was \"strongly unusual,\" I sile ntly placed the astrally scented blossom under her nostrils. \"Oh, I love jasmine!\" She seized the fl ower. A ludicrous bafflement passed over her face as she repeatedly sniffed the odor of jasmine from a type of flower she well knew to be scentless. Her reaction s disarmed my suspicion that Gandha Baba had induced an auto-suggestive st ate whereby I alone could detect the fragrances. Later I heard from a friend, Alakananda, that the \"Perfume Saint\" had a power which I wish were possessed by the star ving millions of Asia and, today, of Europe as well."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"\"I was present with a hundred other guests at Gandha Baba's home in Burdwan,\" Alakananda told me. \"It was a gala occa sion. Because the yogi was reputed to have the power of extracting objects out of thin air, I laughingly requested him to materialize some out-of-seaso n tangerines. Immediately the luchis 5-4 which were present on all the banana-leaf plates became puffed up. Each of the bread- envelopes proved to contain a peeled ta ngerine. I bit into my own with some trepidation, but found it delicious.\" Years later I understood by inner realiz ation how Gandha Baba accomplished his materializations. The method, alas! is be yond the reach of the world's hungry hordes. The different sensory stimuli to which man reacts-tactual, visual, gustatory, auditory, and olfactory-are produced by vibratory variations in electrons and protons. The vibrations in turn are regulate d by \"lifetrons,\" subtle life forces or finer-than-atomic energies intelligently ch arged with the five distinctive sensory idea- substances. Gandha Baba, tuning himself with the cosmic force by certain yogic practices, was able to guide the lifetrons to rearrange their vibratory structure and objectivize the desired result. His perfume, fr uit and other miracles were actual materializations of mundane vibrations, and not inner sensations hypnotically produced. 5-5 Performances of miracles such as show n by the \"Perfume Saint\" are spectacular but spiritually useless. Having little purpose beyond entertainment, they are digressions from a serious search for God. Hypnotism has been used by physicians in minor operations as a sort of psychical chloroform for persons who might be endangered by an anesthetic.

A true man is he who dwells in righteousness among his fellow men, who buys and sells, yet is never for a single instant forgetful of God!\" On another occasion the great Persian teache r gave his views on the religious life thus: \"To lay aside what you have in your head (selfish desires and ambitions); to freely bestow what you have in your hand; and never to flinch from the blows of adversity!\" Neither the impartial sage at Kalighat Temple nor the Tibetan-trained yogi had satisfied my yearning for a guru. My hear t needed no tutor for its recognitions, and cried its own \"Bravos!\" the more resoundingly because unoften summoned from silence. When I finally met my ma ster, he taught me by sublimity of example alone the measure of a true man. 5-1: Kali represents the eternal principle in nature . She is traditionally pictured as a four-armed woman, standing on the form of the God Shiva or the Infinite, because nature or the phenomenal world is rooted in the Noumenon.

The famous Sohong 6-1 Swami was seated on his bed. The sight of his tremendous body affected us strangely. With bulgin g eyes, we stood speechless. We had never before seen such a chest or such footba ll-like biceps. On an immense neck, the swami's fierce yet calm face was ad orned with flowing locks, beard and moustache. A hint of dovelike and tigerlike qualities shone in his dark eyes. He was unclothed, save for a tiger sk in about his muscular waist. Finding our voices, my friend and I greeted the monk, expressing our admiration for his prowess in the extraordinary feline arena. \"Will you not tell us, please, how it is possi ble to subdue with bare fists the most ferocious of jungle beasts, the royal Bengals?\" \"My sons, it is nothing to me to fight tige rs. I could do it today if necessary.\" He gave a childlike laugh. \"You look upon tige rs as tigers; I know them as pussycats.\" \"Swamiji, I think I could impress my subconsciousness with the thought that tigers are pussycats, but could I make tigers believe it?\" \"Of course strength also is necessary! On e cannot expect victory from a baby who imagines a tiger to be a house cat! Powe rful hands are my sufficient weapon.\" He asked us to follow him to the patio, wh ere he struck the edge of a wall. A brick crashed to the floor; the sky peered boldly through the gaping lost tooth of the wall. I fairly staggered in astonishment; he who can remove mortared bricks from a solid wall with one blow, I thought, must surely be able to displace the teeth of tigers!"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"\"A number of men have physical power such as mine, but still lack in cool confidence. Those who are bodily but not mentally stalwart may find themselves fainting at mere sight of a wild beast boun ding freely in the jungle. The tiger in its natural ferocity and habitat is vastly diffe rent from the opium-fed circus animal! \"Many a man with herculean strength has nonetheless been terrorized into abject helplessness before the onslaught of a ro yal Bengal. Thus the tiger has converted the man, in his own mind, to a state as nerveless as the pussycat's. It is possible for a man, owning a fairly strong body and an immensely strong determination, to turn the tables on the tiger, and force it to a conviction of pussycat defenselessness. How often I have done just that!\" I was quite willing to believe that the ti tan before me was able to perform the tiger-pussycat metamorphosis. He seemed in a didactic mood; Chandi and I listened respectfully. \"Mind is the wielder of muscles. The force of a hammer blow depends on the energy applied; the power expressed by a man's bodily instrument depends on his aggressive will and courage. The body is literally manufactured and sustained by mind. Through pressure of instincts fr om past lives, strengths or weaknesses percolate gradually into human consciousn ess. They express as habits, which in turn ossify into a desirable or an unde sirable body. Outward frailty has mental origin; in a vicious circle, the habit-boun d body thwarts the mind. If the master allows himself to be commanded by a se rvant, the latter becomes autocratic; the mind is similarly enslaved by su bmitting to bodily dictation.\" At our entreaty, the impressive swami con sented to tell us something of his own life. \"My earliest ambition was to fight tige rs. My will was mighty, but my body was feeble.\""},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"An ejaculation of surprise broke from me. It appeared incredible that this man, now \"with Atlantean shoulders, fit to be ar,\" could ever have known weakness. \"It was by indomitable persistency in th oughts of health and strength that I overcame my handicap. I have every reas on to extol the compelling mental vigor which I found to be the real subduer of royal Bengals.\" \"Do you think, revered swami, that I could ever fight tigers?\" This was the first, and the last, time that the bizarre ambition ever visited my mind! \"Yes.\" He was smiling. \"But there are many kinds of tigers; some roam in jungles of human desires. No spiritual benefit accrues by knocking beasts unconscious. Rather be victor over the inner prowlers.\" \"May we hear, sir, how you changed from a tamer of wild tigers to a tamer of wild passions?\" The Tiger Swami fell into silence. Remo teness came into his gaze, summoning visions of bygone years. I discerned his slight mental struggle to decide whether to grant my request. Finally he smiled in acquiescence. \"When my fame reached a zenith, it brough t the intoxication of pride. I decided not only to fight tigers but to display th em in various tricks. My ambition was to force savage beasts to beha ve like domesticated ones. I began to perform my feats publicly, with gratifying success. \"One evening my father entere d my room in pensive mood. \"'Son, I have words of warning. I would save you from coming ills, produced by the grinding wheels of cause and effect.' \"'Are you a fatalist, Father? Should supe rstition be allowed to discolor the powerful waters or my activities?'"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"\"'I am no fatalist, son. But I believe in th e just law of retribution, as taught in the holy scriptures. There is resentment against you in the jungle family; sometime it may act to your cost.' \"'Father, you astonish me! You well know wh at tigers are-beautiful but merciless! Even immediately after an enormous meal of some hapless creature, a tiger is fired with fresh lust at sight of new prey. It may be a joyous gazelle, frisking over the jungle grass. Capturing it and biti ng an opening in the soft throat, the malevolent beast tastes only a little of the mutely crying blood, and goes its wanton way. \"'Tigers are the most contemptible of the jungle breed! Who knows? my blows may inject some slight sanity of cons ideration into their thick heads. I am headmaster in a forest finishing school, to teach them gentle manners! \"'Please, Father, think of me as tiger ta mer and never as tiger killer. How could my good actions bring ill upon me? I beg you not to impose any command that I change my way of life.'\" Chandi and I were all attention, understa nding the past dilemma. In India a child does not lightly disobey his parents' wishes. \"In stoic silence Father listened to my explanation. He followed it with a disclosure which he uttered gravely. \"'Son, you compel me to relate an ominous prediction from the lips of a saint. He approached me yesterday as I sat on the veranda in my daily meditation. \"'\"Dear friend, I come with a message for your belligerent son. Let him cease his savage activities. Otherwise, his next ti ger-encounter shall result in his severe wounds, followed by six months of deat hly sickness. He shall then forsake his former ways and become a monk.\"'"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"\"This tale did not impress me. I consider ed that Father had been the credulous victim of a deluded fanatic.\" The Tiger Swami made this confession with an impatient gesture, as though at some stupidity. Grimly silent for a lo ng time, he seemed oblivious of our presence. When he took up the dangling thread of his narrative, it was suddenly, with subdued voice. \"Not long after Father's warning, I visi ted the capital city of Cooch Behar. The picturesque territory was new to me, and I expected a restful change. As usual everywhere, a curious crowd followed me on the streets. I would catch bits of whispered comment: \"'This is the man who fi ghts wild tigers.' \"'Has he legs, or tree-trunks?' \"'Look at his face! He must be an incarn ation of the king of tigers himself!' \"You know how village urchins function li ke final editions of a newspaper! With what speed do the even-later speech-bulle tins of the women circulate from house to house! Within a few hours, the whole ci ty was in a state of excitement over my presence. \"I was relaxing quietly in the evening, when I heard the hoofbeats of galloping horses. They stopped in front of my dwelling place. In came a number of tall, turbaned policemen. \"I was taken aback. 'All things are possible unto these creatures of human law,' I thought. 'I wonder if they are going to take me to task about matters utterly unknown to me.' But the officers bowed with unwonted courtesy. \"'Honored Sir, we are sent to welcome you on behalf of the Prince of Cooch Behar. He is pleased to invite you to his palace tomorrow morning.'"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"\"I speculated awhile on the prospect. For some obscure reason I felt sharp regret at this interruption in my quiet trip. But the suppliant manner of the policemen moved me; I agreed to go. \"I was bewildered the next day to be obsequiously escorted from my door into a magnificent coach drawn by four horses. A servant held an ornate umbrella to protect me from the scorching sunlight. I enjoyed the pleasant ride through the city and its woodland outskirts. The royal scion himself was at the palace door to welcome me. He proffered his own gold-brocaded seat, smilingly placing himself in a chair of simpler design. \"'All this politeness is certainly goin g to cost me something!' I thought in mounting astonishment. The prince's motive emerged after a few casual remarks. \"'My city is filled with the rumor that yo u can fight wild tigers with nothing more than your naked hands. Is it a fact?' \"'It is quite true.' \"'I can scarcely believe it! You are a Calcutta Bengali, nurtured on the white rice of city folk. Be frank, please; have you no t been fighting only spineless, opium-fed animals?' His voice was loud and sarcasti c, tinged with provincial accent. \"I vouchsafed no reply to his insulting question. \"'I challenge you to fight my ne wly-caught tiger, Raja Begum. 6-2 If you can successfully resist him, bind him with a chain, and leave his cage in a conscious state, you shall have this royal Bengal! Several thousand rupees and many other gifts shall also be bestowed. If you refus e to meet him in combat, I shall blazon your name throughout the state as an impostor!' \"His insolent words struck me like a volle y of bullets. I shot an angry acceptance. Half risen from the chair in his excitement , the prince sank back with a sadistic"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"smile. I was reminded of the Roman empero rs who delighted in setting Christians in bestial arenas. \"'The match will be set for a week henc e. I regret that I cannot give you permission to view the tiger in advance.' \"Whether the prince feared I might seek to hypnotize the beast, or secretly feed him opium, I know not! \"I left the palace, noting with amusemen t that the royal umbrella and panoplied coach were now missing. \"The following week I methodically prepared my mind and body for the coming ordeal. Through my servant I learned of fantastic tales. The saint's direful prediction to my father had somehow go t abroad, enlarging as it ran. Many simple villagers believed that an evil sp irit, cursed by the gods, had reincarnated as a tiger which took various demoniac forms at night, but remained a striped animal during the day. This demon-tige r was supposed to be the one sent to humble me. \"Another imaginative version was that animal prayers to Tiger Heaven had achieved a response in the shape of Raja Begum. He was to be the instrument to punish me-the audacious biped, so insultin g to the entire tiger species! A furless, fangless man daring to challenge a claw-armed, sturdy-limbed tiger! The concentrated venom of all humiliated tige rs-the villagers declared-had gathered momentum sufficient to operate hidden laws and bring about the fall of the proud tiger tamer. \"My servant further apprized me that the prince was in his element as manager of the bout between man and beast. He had su pervised the erection of a storm-proof pavilion, designed to accommodate thousand s. Its center held Raja Begum in an enormous iron cage, surrounded by an o uter safety room. The captive emitted a"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"ceaseless series of blood- curdling roar s. He was fed sparingly, to kindle a wrathful appetite. Perhaps the prince expe cted me to be the meal of reward! \"Crowds from the city and suburbs bought tickets eagerly in response to the beat of drums announcing the unique contest. The day of battle saw hundreds turned away for lack of seats. Many men brok e through the tent openings, or crowded any space below the galleries.\" As the Tiger Swami's story approached a climax, my excitement mounted with it; Chandi also was raptly mute. \"Amidst piercing sound-explosions from Raja Begum, and the hubbub of the somewhat terrified crowd, I quietly made my appearance. Scantily clad around the waist, I was otherwise unprotected by clothing. I opened the bolt on the door of the safety room and calmly locked it behind me. The tiger sensed blood. Leaping with a thunderous crash on his ba rs, he sent forth a fearsome welcome. The audience was hushed with pitiful fe ar; I seemed a meek lamb before the raging beast. \"In a trice I was within the cage; but as I slammed the door, Raja Begum was headlong upon me. My right hand wa s desperately torn. Human blood, the greatest treat a tiger can know, fell in appalling streams. The prophecy of the saint seemed about to be fulfilled. \"I rallied instantly from the shock of the first serious injury I had ever received. Banishing the sight of my gory fingers by thrusting them beneath my waist cloth, I swung my left arm in a bone-cracking blow. The beast reeled back, swirled around the rear of the cage, and sprang forward convulsively. My famous fistic punishment rained on his head. \"But Raja Begum's taste of blood had acted like the maddening fi rst sip of wine to a dipsomaniac long-deprived. Punctuated by deafening roar, the brute's assaults grew in fury. My inadequate defense of only one hand left me vulnerable before"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"claws and fangs. But I dealt out dazing retribution. Mutually ensanguined, we struggled as to the death. The cage was pandemonium, as blood splashed in all directions, and blasts of pain and lethal lust came from the bestial throat. \"'Shoot him!' 'Kill the tiger!' Shrieks aros e from the audience. So fast did man and beast move, that a guard's bullet went am iss. I mustered all my will force, bellowed fiercely, and landed a final concussive blow. The tiger collapsed and lay quietly. \"Like a pussycat!\" I interjected. The swami laughed in hearty appreciation , then continued the engrossing tale. \"Raja Begum was vanquished at last. His royal pride was further humbled: with my lacerated hands, I audaciously forced open his jaws. For a dramatic moment, I held my head within the yawning deathtra p. I looked around for a chain. Pulling one from a pile on the floor, I bound the tiger by his neck to the cage bars. In triumph I moved toward the door. \"But that fiend incarnate, Raja Begum, had stamina worthy of his supposed demoniac origin. With an incredible lunge, he snapped the chain and leaped on my back. My shoulder fast in his jaws, I fell violently. But in a trice I had him pinned beneath me. Under merciless blows, the treacherous animal sank into semiconsciousness. This time I secured him more carefully. Slowly I left the cage. \"I found myself in a new uproar, this time one of delight. The crowd's cheer broke as though from a single gigantic throat . Disastrously mauled, I had yet fulfilled the three conditions of the fight-stunning the tiger, binding him with a chain, and leaving him without requiring assistance for myself. In addition, I had so drastically injured and frightened the aggressive beast that he had been content to overlook the opportune prize of my head in his mouth! \"After my wounds were treated, I was ho nored and garlanded; hundreds of gold pieces showered at my feet. The whole city entered a holiday period. Endless"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"discussions were heard on all sides about my victory over one of the largest and most savage tigers ever seen. Raja Begu m was presented to me, as promised, but I felt no elation. A spiritual change had en tered my heart. It seemed that with my final exit from the cage I had also clos ed the door on my worldly ambitions. \"A woeful period followed. For six months I lay near death from blood poisoning. As soon as I was well enough to leave Cooch Behar, I returned to my native town. \"'I know now that my teacher is the ho ly man who gave the wise warning.' I humbly made this confession to my fath er. 'Oh, if I could only find him!' My longing was sincere, for one day the saint arrived unheralded. \"'Enough of tiger taming.' He spoke with calm assurance. 'Come with me; I will teach you to subdue the beasts of ignorance roaming in jungles of the human mind. You are used to an audience: let it be a galaxy of angels, entertained by your thrilling mastery of yoga!' \"I was initiated into the spiritual path by my saintly guru. He opened my soul- doors, rusty and resistant with long disuse . Hand in hand, we soon set out for my training in the Himalayas.\" Chandi and I bowed at the swami's feet, grat eful for his vivid outline of a life truly cyclonic. I felt amply repaid for the long probationary wait in the cold parlor! 6-1: Sohong was his monastic name. He was popularly known as the \"Tiger Swami.\" 6-2: \"Prince Princess\"-so named to indicate that th is beast possessed the combined ferocity of tiger and tigress. CHAPTER: 7 The Levitating Saint \"I saw a yogi remain in the air, several f eet above the ground, last night at a group meeting.\" My friend, Upendra Mohun Chowdhury, spoke impressively."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"I gave him an enthusiastic smile. \"Perha ps I can guess his name. Was it Bhaduri Mahasaya, of Upper Circular Road?\" Upendra nodded, a little crestfallen not to be a news-bearer. My inquisitiveness about saints was well-known among my friend s; they delighted in setting me on a fresh track. \"The yogi lives so close to my home th at I often visit him.\" My words brought keen interest to Upendra's face, and I made a further confidence. \"I have seen him in remarkable feats. He has expertly mastered the various pranayamas 7-1 of the ancient eightfold yoga outlined by Patanjali. 7-2 Once Bhaduri Mahasaya performed the Bhastrika Pranayama before me with such amazing force that it seemed an actual storm had arisen in the room! Then he extinguished the thundering breath and remained motionless in a high state of superconsciousness. 7-3 The aura of peace after the storm was vivid beyond forgetting.\" \"I heard that the saint never leaves hi s home.\" Upendra's tone was a trifle incredulous. \"Indeed it is true! He has lived indoors for the past twenty years. He slightly relaxes his self-imposed rule at the times of our holy fest ivals, when he goes as far as his front sidewalk! The beggars gather there, because Saint Bhaduri is known for his tender heart.\" \"How does he remain in the air, defying the law of gravitation?\" \"A yogi's body loses its grossness after use of certain pranayamas . Then it will levitate or hop about like a leaping frog. Even saints who do not practice a formal yoga 7-4 have been known to levitate during a state of intense devotion to God.\" \"I would like to know more of this sa ge. Do you attend his evening meetings?\" Upendra's eyes were sparkling with curiosity."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"\"Yes, I go often. I am vastly entertained by the wit in his wisdom. Occasionally my prolonged laughter mars the solemnity of his gatherings. The saint is not displeased, but his disciples look daggers!\" On my way home from school that afternoon, I passed Bhaduri Mahasaya's cloister and decided on a visit. The yogi was inaccessible to the general public. A lone disciple, occupying the ground floor, guarded his master's privacy. The student was something of a martinet; he now inquired formally if I had an \"engagement.\" His guru put in an appear ance just in time to save me from summary ejection. \"Let Mukunda come when he will.\" The sage's eyes twinkled. \"My rule of seclusion is not for my own comfort, but fo r that of others. Worldly people do not like the candor which shatters their delusions. Saints are not only rare but disconcerting. Even in scripture, they are often found embarrassing!\" I followed Bhaduri Mahasaya to his austere quarters on the top floor, from which he seldom stirred. Masters often ignore the panorama of the world's ado, out of focus till centered in the ages. The contemporaries of a sage are not alone those of the narrow present. \"Maharishi, 7-5 you are the first yogi I have kn own who always stays indoors.\" \"God plants his saints some times in unexpected soil, le st we think we may reduce Him to a rule!\" The sage locked his vibrant body in th e lotus posture. In his seventies, he displayed no unpleasing signs of age or sedentary life. Stalwart and straight, he was ideal in every respect. His face was that of a rishi , as described in the ancient texts. Noble-headed, abundantly bearded, he always sat firmly upright, his quiet eyes fixed on Omnipresence. The saint and I entered the meditative state. After an hour, his gentle voice roused me."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"\"You go often into the silence, but have you developed anubhava ?\" 7-6 He was reminding me to love God more than me ditation. \"Do not mistake the technique for the Goal.\" He offered me some mangoes. With th at good-humored wit that I found so delightful in his grave nature, he remarked , \"People in general are more fond of Jala Yoga (union with food) than of Dhyana Yoga (union with God).\" His yogic pun affected me uproariously. \"What a laugh you have!\" An affectionate gleam came into his gaze. His own face was always serious, yet touche d with an ecstatic smile. His large, lotus eyes held a hidden divine laughter. \"Those letters come from far-off America.\" The sage indicated several thick envelopes on a table. \"I correspond with a few societies there whose members are interested in yoga. They are discover ing India anew, with a better sense of direction than Columbus! I am glad to he lp them. The knowledge of yoga is free to all who will receive, like the ungarnishable daylight. \"What rishis perceived as essential for human salvation need not be diluted for the West. Alike in soul thou gh diverse in outer experience, neither West nor East will flourish if some form of disc iplinary yoga be not practiced.\" The saint held me with his tranquil eyes . I did not realize that his speech was a veiled prophetic guidance. It is only now, as I write these words, that I understand the full meaning in the casual intimations he often gave me that someday I would carry India' s teachings to America."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" BHA DURI MAHAS AYA \"The Levitating Saint\" \"Sir,\" I inquired, \"why do you not wr ite a book on yoga for the benefit of the world?\" \"I am training disciples,\" He replied. \"They and their students will be living volumes, proof agains t the natural disi ntegrat ions of time and the unnatural interpretaations of the critics.\" \"Maharishi , I wish you would writ e a book on yoga for the benefit of the world. \" \"I am training disciples. They and their students will be living volumes, proof against the natural disintegrations of ti me and the unnatural interpretations of the critics.\" Bhaduri's wit put me into another gale of laughter. I remained alone with the yogi until his disciples arrived in the evening. Bhaduri Mahasaya entered on e of his inimitable discourses. Like a peacef ul flood, he swept awa y the mental debris of his li steners, floating them Godward. His striking parables were expressed in a flawless Bengali."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"This evening Bhaduri expounded various ph ilosophical points connected with the life of Mirabai, a medieval Rajputani princess who abandoned her court life to seek the company of sadhus. One great- sannyasi refused to receive her because she was a woman; her reply brou ght him humbly to her feet. \"Tell the master,\" she had said, \"that I did not know there was any Male in the universe save God; are we all not female s before Him?\" (A scriptural conception of the Lord as the only Positive Creative Principle, His creation being naught but a passive maya .) Mirabai composed many ecstatic songs which are still treasured in India; I translate one of them here: \"If by bathing daily God could be realized Sooner would I be a whale in the deep; If by eating roots and fruits He could be known Gladly would I choose the form of a goat; If the counting of rosaries uncovered Him I would say my prayers on mammoth beads; If bowing before stone images unveiled Him A flinty mountain I would humbly worship; If by drinking milk the Lord could be imbibed Many calves and children would know Him; If abandoning one's wife would summon God Would not thousands be eunuchs? Mirabai knows that to find the Divine One The only indispensable is Love.\" Several students put rupees in Bhaduri's sli ppers which lay by his side as he sat in yoga posture. This respectful offering, customary in India, indicates that the disciple places his material goods at the guru's feet. Grateful friends are only the Lord in disguise, looking after His own. \"Master, you are wonderful!\" A student, ta king his leave, gazed ardently at the patriarchal sage. \"You have renounced ri ches and comforts to seek God and teach"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"us wisdom!\" It was well-known that Bhad uri Mahasaya had forsaken great family wealth in his early childhood, when sing le-mindedly he entered the yogic path. \"You are reversing the case!\" The saint's fa ce held a mild rebuke. \"I have left a few paltry rupees, a few petty pleasures, fo r a cosmic empire of endless bliss. How then have I denied myself anything? I know the joy of sharing th e treasure. Is that a sacrifice? The shortsighted worldly folk are verily the real renunciates! They relinquish an unparalleled divine possession for a poor handful of earthly toys!\" I chuckled over this paradoxical view of renunciation-one which puts the cap of Croesus on any saintly beggar, whilst tr ansforming all proud millionaires into unconscious martyrs. \"The divine order arranges our future more wisely than any insurance company.\" The master's concluding words were the real ized creed of his faith. \"The world is full of uneasy believers in an outward secu rity. Their bitter thoughts are like scars on their foreheads. The One who gave us air and milk from our first breath knows how to provide day by day for His devotees.\" I continued my after-school pilgrimages to the saint's door. With silent zeal he aided me to attain anubhava . One day he moved to Ra m Mohan Roy Road, away from the neighborhood of my Gurpar Ro ad home. His loving disciples had built him a new hermitage, know n as \"Nagendra Math.\" 7-7 Although it throws me ahead of my story by a number of years, I will recount here the last words given to me by Bhaduri Mahasaya. Shortly before I embarked for the West, I sought him out and humbly knelt for his farewell blessing: \"Son, go to America. Take the dignity of hoary India for your shield. Victory is written on your brow; the noble dist ant people will well receive you.\" 7-1: Methods of controlling life-force through regulation of breath. 7-2: The foremost ancient exponent of yoga."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"7-3: French professors were the first in the West to be willing to scientifically investigate the possibilities of the superconscious mind. Professor Ju les-Bois, member of the L'Ecole de Psychologie of the Sorbonne, lectured in Amer ica in 1928; he told his audience s that French scientists have accorded recognition to the superconsciousness, \"which is the exact opposite of Freud's subconscious mind and is the faculty which makes man really man and not just a super-animal.\" M. Jules-Bois explained that the awakening of the higher consciousness \"was not to be confused with Coueism or hypnotism. The existence of a superconscious mind has long been recognized philosophically, being in reality the Oversoul spoken of by Emerson, but only recently has it been recognized scientifically.\" The French scientist po inted out that from the superconsciousness come inspiration, genius, moral values. \"Belief in this is not mysticism though it recognized and valued the qualities which mystics preached.\" 7-4: St. Theresa of Avila and other Christian saints were often observed in a state of levitation. 7-5: \"Great sage.\" 7-6: Actual perception of God. 7-7: The saint's full name was Nagendranath Bhaduri. Math means hermitage or ashram . CHAPTER: 8 India's Great Scientist, J.C. Bose \"Jagadis Chandra Bose's wireless inve ntions antedated those of Marconi.\" Overhearing this provocative remark, I walked closer to a sidewalk group of professors engaged in scientific discussi on. If my motive in joining them was racial pride, I regret it. I cannot deny my keen interest in evidence that India can play a leading part in physics, and not metaphysics alone. \"What do you mean, sir?\" The professor obligingly explained. \"Bos e was the first one to invent a wireless coherer and an instrument for indicating the refraction of electric waves. But the Indian scientist did not exploit his inve ntions commercially. He soon turned his attention from the inorganic to the organic world. His revolutionary discoveries"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"as a plant physiologist are outpacing even his radical achievements as a physicist.\" I politely thanked my mentor. He added, \"The great scientist is one of my brother professors at Presidency College.\" I paid a visit the next day to the sage at his home, which was close to mine on Gurpar Road. I had long admired him fr om a respectful distance. The grave and retiring botanist greeted me graciously . He was a handsome, robust man in his fifties, with thick hair, broad forehead, and the abstracted eyes of a dreamer. The precision in his tones revealed th e lifelong scientific habit. \"I have recently returned from an expediti on to scientific societies of the West. Their members exhibited intense interest in delicate instruments of my invention which demonstrate the indivisible unity of all life. 8-1 The Bose crescograph has the enormity of ten million magnifications. The microscope enlarges only a few thousand times; yet it brought vital impetus to biological science. The crescograph opens incalculable vistas.\" \"You have done much, sir, to hasten the embrace of East and West in the impersonal arms of science.\" \"I was educated at Cambridge. How admirable is the Western method of submitting all theory to scrupulous ex perimental verification! That empirical procedure has gone hand in hand with the gift for introspection which is my Eastern heritage. Together they have enable d me to sunder the silences of natural realms long uncommunicative. The te lltale charts of my crescograph 8-2 are evidence for the most skeptical that plan ts have a sensitive nervous system and a varied emotional life.

Come someday to my laboratory and see the unequivocable testimony of the crescograph.\" Gratefully I accepted the invitation, and t ook my departure. I heard later that the botanist had left Presidency College, an d was planning a research center in Calcutta. When the Bose Institute was opened, I attended the dedicatory services. Enthusiastic hundreds strolled over the pr emises. I was charmed with the artistry and spiritual symbolism of the new home of science. Its front gate, I noted, was a centuried relic from a distant shrine. Behind the lotus 8-3 fountain, a sculptured female figure with a torch conveyed the Indian respect for woman as the immortal light-bearer. The garden held a small temple consecrated to the Noumenon beyond phenomena.

To my amazemen t, I found boundary lines vanishing, and points of contact emerging, between the realms of the living and the non- living. Inorganic matter was perceived as anything but inert; it was athrill under the action of multitudinous forces. \"A universal reaction seemed to bring metal, plant and animal under a common law. They all exhibited essentially the same phenomena of fatigue and depression, with possibilities of recovery and of exaltation, as well as the permanent irresponsiveness associated wi th death. Filled with awe at this stupendous generalization, it was with great hope that I announced my results before the Royal Society- results de monstrated by experiments. But the physiologists present advised me to confine myself to physical investigations, in which my success had been assured, rather than encroach on their preserves. I had unwittingly strayed into the domain of an unfamiliar caste system and so offended its etiquette. \"An unconscious theological bias was al so present, which confounds ignorance with faith. It is often forgotten that He who surrounded us with this ever-evolving mystery of creation has also implante d in us the desire to question and understand. Through many years of miscom prehension, I came to know that the life of a devotee of science is inevitably filled with unending struggle. It is for him to cast his life as an ardent offering-r egarding gain and loss, success and failure, as one. \"In time the leading scientific societies of the world accepted my theories and results, and recognized the importance of the Indian contribution to science. 8-4 Can anything small or circumscribed ever satisfy the mind of India? By a"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"continuous living tradition, and a vital power of rejuvenescence, this land has readjusted itself through unnumbered transformations. Indians have always arisen who, discarding the immediate and absorbing prize of the hour, have sought for the realization of the highest ideals in life-not through passive renunciation, but through active struggle. The weakling who has refused the conflict, acquiring nothing, has had nothing to renounce. He alone who has striven and won can enrich the world by bestowing the fruits of his victorious experience. \"The work already carried out in the Bose laboratory on the response of matter, and the unexpected revelations in plant life, have opened out very extended regions of inquiry in physics, in physiolo gy, in medicine, in agriculture, and even in psychology. Problems hitherto regard ed as insoluble have now been brought within the sphere of experimental investigation. \"But high success is not to be obtained without rigid exactitude. Hence the long battery of super-sensitive instruments an d apparatus of my design, which stand before you today in their cases in the entr ance hall. They tell you of the protracted efforts to get behind the deceptive seeming into the reality that remains unseen, of the continuous toil and persistenc e and resourcefulness called forth to overcome human limitations. All creative sc ientists know that the true laboratory is the mind, where behind illusions they uncover the laws of truth. \"The lectures given here wi ll not be mere repetitions of second-hand knowledge. They will announce new discoveries, demo nstrated for the first time in these halls. Through regular publication of th e work of the Institute, these Indian contributions will reach the whole world. They will become public property. No patents will ever be taken. The spirit of our national culture demands that we should forever be free from the desecration of utilizing knowledge only for personal gain. \"It is my further wish that the facilities of this Institute be available, so far as possible, to workers from all countries. In this I am attempting to carry on the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"traditions of my country. So far back as twenty-five centuries, India welcomed to its ancient universities, at Nalanda and Taxila, scholars from all parts of the world. \"Although science is neither of the East nor of the West but rather international in its universality, yet India is specia lly fitted to make great contributions. 8-5 The burning Indian imagination, which can extort new order out of a mass of apparently contradictory facts, is held in check by the habit of concentration. This restraint confers the power to hold the mind to the pursuit of truth with an infinite patience.\" Tears stood in my eyes at the scientist's concluding words. Is \"patience\" not indeed a synonym of India, confounding Time and the historians alike? I visited the research center again, soon after the day of opening. The great botanist, mindful of his promise, t ook me to his quiet laboratory. \"I will attach the crescograph to this fern; the magnification is tremendous. If a snail's crawl were enlarged in the same proportion, the creature would appear to be traveling like an express train!\" My gaze was fixed eagerly on the screen which reflected the magnified fern- shadow. Minute life-movements were no w clearly perceptible; the plant was growing very slowly before my fascinated eyes. The scientist touched the tip of the fern with a small metal bar. The developing pantomime came to an abrupt halt, resuming the eloquent rhythms as soon as the rod was withdrawn. \"You saw how any slight outside interfer ence is detrimental to the sensitive tissues,\" Bose remarked. \"Watch; I will now administer chloroform, and then give an antidote.\" The effect of the chloroform discontinued all growth; the antidote was revivifying. The evolutionary gestures on the screen he ld me more raptly than a \"movie\" plot. My companion (here in the role of villain) thrust a sharp instrument through a"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"part of the fern; pain was indicated by spasmodic flutters. When he passed a razor partially through the stem, the shadow was violently agitated, then stilled itself with the final punctuation of death. \"By first chloroforming a huge tree, I achieved a successful transplantation. Usually, such monarchs of the forest die very quickly after being moved.\" Jagadis smiled happily as he recounted the life- saving maneuver. \"Graphs of my delicate apparatus have proved that trees po ssess a circulatory system; their sap movements correspond to the blood pressure of animal bodies. The ascent of sap is not explicable on the mechanical grounds ordinarily advanced, such as capillary attraction. The phenomenon has been solved through the crescograph as the activity of living cells. Peristalti c waves issue from a cylindrical tube which extends down a tree and serves as an actua l heart! The more deeply we perceive, the more striking becomes the evidence that a uniform plan links every form in manifold nature.\" The great scientist pointed to another Bose instrument. \"I will show you experiments on a piece of tin. The life-force in metals responds adversely or beneficially to stimuli. Ink markings will register the various reactions.\" Deeply engrossed, I watched the graph wh ich recorded the characteristic waves of atomic structure. When the professor applied chloroform to the tin, the vibratory writings stopped. They recommenced as the metal slowly regained its normal state. My companion dispensed a poisonous chemical. Simultaneous with the quivering end of the tin, the needle dr amatically wrote on the chart a death- notice. \"Bose instruments have demonstrated that metals, such as the steel used in scissors and machinery, are subject to fati gue, and regain efficiency by periodic rest. The life-pulse in metals is seriously harmed or even extinguished through the application of electric currents or heavy pressure.\""},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"I looked around the room at the numero us inventions, eloquent testimony of a tireless ingenuity. \"Sir, it is lamentable that mass agricultural development is not speeded by fuller use of your marvelous mechanisms. Would it not be easily possible to employ some of them in quick laboratory experime nts to indicate the influence of various types of fertilizers on plant growth?\" \"You are right. Countless uses of Bo se instruments will be made by future generations. The scientist seldom knows contemporaneous reward; it is enough to possess the joy of creative service.\" With expressions of unreserved gratitud e to the indefatigable sage, I took my leave. \"Can the astonishing fertility of hi s genius ever be exhausted?\" I thought. No diminution came with the years. Inventing an intricate instrument, the \"Resonant Cardiograph,\" Bose then pursued extensive researches on innumerable Indian plants. An enormous unsuspected pharmacopoeia of useful drugs was revealed. The cardiograph is const ructed with an unerring accuracy by which a one-hundredth part of a second is indicated on a graph. Resonant records measure infinitesimal pulsations in plant, animal and human structure. The great botanist predicted that use of hi s cardiograph will lead to vivisection on plants instead of animals. \"Side by side recordings of the effects of a medicine given simultaneously to a plant and an animal have shown astounding unanimity in result,\" he pointed out. \"Everything in man has been foreshadow ed in the plant. Experimentation on vegetation will contribute to le ssening of human suffering.\" Years later Bose's pioneer plant findings were substantiated by other scientists. Work done in 1938 at Columbia University was reported by The New York Times as follows:"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"It has been determined within the past few years that when the nerves transmit messages between the brain and other parts of the body, tiny electrical impulses are being generated. These impulses have been measured by delicate galvanometers and magnified millions of times by modern amplifying apparatus. Until now no satisfactory method had b een found to study the passages of the impulses along the nerve fibers in livi ng animals or man because of the great speed with which thes e impulses travel. Drs. K. S. Cole and H. J. Curtis reported having discovered that the long single cells of the fresh-water plant nitella, us ed frequently in goldfish bowls, are virtually identical with those of single ne rve fibers. Furthermore, they found that nitella fibers, on being excited, propagate electrical waves that are similar in every way, except velocity, to those of the nerve fibers in animals and man. The electrical nerve impulses in the plant were found to be much slower than those in animals. This discovery was therefore seiz ed upon by the Columbia workers as a means for taking slow motion pictures of the passage of the electrical impulses in nerves. The nitella plant thus may become a sort of Rosetta stone for deciphering the closely guarded secrets close to the very borderland of mind and matter. The poet Rabindranath Tagore was a stalwart friend of India's idealistic scientist. To him, the sweet Bengali singer addressed the following lines: 8-6 O Hermit, call thou in the authentic words Of that old hymn called sama ; \"Rise! Awake!\" Call to the man who boasts his shastric lore From vain pedantic wranglings profitless, Call to that foolish braggart to come forth Out on the face of nature, this broad earth, Send forth this call unto thy scholar band; Together round thy sacrifice of fire Let them all gather.

We believe, consequently, that no department of study, particularly in the humanities, in any major university can be fully equipped without a properly trained specialist in the Indic phases of its discipline. We believe, too, that every college which aims to prepare its graduates for intelligent work in the world which is to be theirs to live in, must have on its staff a scholar competent in the civilization of India.\"-Ex tracts from an article by Professor W.

This issue (#28) contains over 100 pages of a \"Basic Bibliography for Indic Studies.\" 8-5: The atomic structure of matter was well-know n to the ancient Hindus. One of the six systems of Indian philosophy is Vaisesika , from the Sanskrit root visesas , \"atomic individuality.\" One of the foremost Vaisesika expounders was Aulukya, also called Ka nada, \"the atom- eater,\" born about 2800 years ago. In an article in East-West , April, 1934, a summary of Vaisesika scientific knowledge was given as follows: \"Though the modern 'atomic theory' is gene rally considered a new advance of science, it was brilliantly expounded long ago by Ka nada, 'the atom-eater.' The Sanskrit anus can be properly translated as 'atom' in the latter's literal Greek sense of 'uncut' or indivisible. Other scientific expositions of Vaisesika treatises of the B.C. era include (1) the movement of needles toward magnets, (2) the circulatio n of water in plants, (3) akash or ether, inert and structureless, as a basis for transmitting subtle forces, (4) the solar fire as the cause of all other forms of heat, (5)"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"heat as the cause of molecular change, (6) the la w of gravitation as caus ed by the quality that inheres in earth- atoms to give them their attracti ve power or downward pull, (7) the kinetic nature of all energy; causation as always rooted in an ex penditure of energy or a redistribution of motion, (8) universal dissolution through the disintegration of atoms, (9) the radiation of heat and light rays, infinitely small particles, darting forth in al l directions with inconcei vable speed (the modern 'cosmic rays' theory), (10) the relativity of time and space. \" Vaisesika assigned the origin of the world to atoms, eternal in their nature, i.e., their ultimate peculiarities. These atoms were regarded as posse ssing an incessant vibratory motion. . . . The recent discovery that an atom is a miniature solar system would be no news to the old Vaisesika philosophers, who also reduced time to its furthest mathematical concept by describing the smallest unit of time ( kala ) as the period taken by an atom to traverse its own unit of space.\" 8-6: Translated from the Bengali of Rabi ndranath Tagore, by Manmohan Ghosh, in Viswa-Bharati. CHAPTER: 9 The Blissful Devotee And His Cosmic Romance > \"Little sir, please be seated. I am talking to my Divine Mother.\" Silently I had entered the room in great awe. The angelic appearance of Master Mahasaya fairly dazzled me. With silky white beard and large lustrous eyes, he seemed an incarnation of purity. His upra ised chin and folded hands apprized me that my first visit had disturbed hi m in the midst of his devotions. His simple words of greeting produced th e most violent effect my nature had so far experienced. The bitter separation of my mother's death I had thought the measure of all anguish. Now an agony at separation from my Divine Mother was an indescribable torture of the spirit. I fell moaning to the floor. \"Little sir, quiet yourself!\" The sa int was sympathetically distressed. Abandoned in some oceanic desolation, I cl utched his feet as the sole raft of my rescue."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"\"Holy sir, thy intercession! Ask Divine Moth er if I find any favor in Her sight!\" This promise is one not easily bestowed; the master was constrained to silence. Beyond reach of doubt, I was convinced that Master Mahasaya was in intimate converse with the Universal Mother. It wa s deep humiliation to realize that my eyes were blind to Her who even at this moment was perceptible to the faultless gaze of the saint. Shamelessly gripping hi s feet, deaf to his gentle remonstrances, I besought him again and again for his intervening grace. \"I will make your plea to the Beloved. \" The master's capitulation came with a slow, compassionate smile. What power in those few words, that my being should know release from its stormy exile? \"Sir, remember your pledge! I shall return soon for Her message!\" Joyful anticipation rang in my voice that only a moment ago had been sobbing in sorrow. Descending the long stairway, I was over whelmed by memories. This house at 50 Amherst Street, now the residence of Mast er Mahasaya, had once been my family home, scene of my mother's death. Here my human heart had broken for the vanished mother; and here today my spirit had been as though crucified by absence of the Divine Mother. Hallowed wall s, silent witness of my grievous hurts and final healing! My steps were eager as I returned to my Gurpar Road home. Seeking the seclusion of my small attic, I remained in meditation until ten o'clock. The darkness of the warm Indian night was suddenly lit with a wondrous vision. Haloed in splendor, the Divine Mother stood before me. Her face, tenderly smiling, was beauty itself."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"\"Always have I loved thee! Ever shall I love thee!\" The celestial tones still ringing in the air, She disappeared. The sun on the following morning had hardly risen to an angle of decorum when I paid my second visit to Master Mahasaya. Climbing the staircase in the house of poignant memories, I reached his fourth- floor room. The knob of the closed door was wrapped around with a cloth; a hint, I felt, that the saint desired privacy. As I stood irresolutely on the landing, the door was opened by the master's welcoming hand. I knelt at his holy feet. In a play ful mood, I wore a solemn mask over my face, hiding the divine elation. \"Sir, I have come-very early, I confess!-f or your message. Did the Beloved Mother say anything about me?\" \"Mischievous little sir!\" Not another remark would he make. Apparently my assumed gravity was unimpressive. \"Why so mysterious, so evasive? Do saints never speak plainly?\" Perhaps I was a little provoked. \"Must you test me?\" His calm eyes were full of understanding. \"Could I add a single word this morning to the assuranc e you received last night at ten o'clock from the Beautiful Mother Herself?\" Master Mahasaya possessed control over the flood-gates of my soul: again I plunged prostrate at his feet. But this time my tears welled from a bliss, and not a pain, past bearing. \"Think you that your devotion did not to uch the Infinite Mercy? The Motherhood of God, that you have worshiped in fo rms both human and divine, could never fail to answer your forsaken cry.\""},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Who was this simple saint, whose least re quest to the Universal Spirit met with sweet acquiescence? His role in the worl d was humble, as befitted the greatest man of humility I ever knew. In this Amherst Street house, Master Mahasaya 9-1 conducted a small high school for boys. No words of chastisement passed his lips; no rule and ferule maintained his disc ipline. Higher mathematics indeed were taught in these modest classrooms, and a chemistry of love absent from the textbooks. He spread his wisdom by spir itual contagion rather than impermeable precept. Consumed by an unsophistica ted passion for the Divine Mother, the saint no more demanded the outward forms of respect than a child. \"I am not your guru; he shall come a li ttle later,\" he told me. \"Through his guidance, your experiences of the Divine in terms of love and devotion shall be translated into his terms of fathomless wisdom.\" Every late afternoon, I betook myself to Amherst Street. I sought Master Mahasaya's divine cup, so full that its drops daily over flowed on my being. Never before had I bowed in utter reverence; no w I felt it an immeasurable privilege even to tread the same ground wh ich Master Mahasaya sanctified. \"Sir, please wear this champak garland I have fashioned especially for you.\" I arrived one evening, holding my chain of flowers. But shyly he drew away, repeatedly refusing the honor. Perceiving my hurt, he finally smiled consent. \"Since we are both devotees of the Mother, you may put the garland on this bodily temple, as offering to Her who dwel ls within.\" His vast nature lacked space in which any egotistical consideration could gain foothold."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" TWO BROTHERS OF THERE SE NEUMANN I stand with them in Konnersreuth, Bavaria. MASTER MAHASAYA Ever engrossed in his blissful cos mic romance."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"\"Let us go tomorrow to the Dakshineswar Temple, forever hallowed by my guru.\" Master Mahasaya was a disciple of a Christlike master, Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa. The four-mile journey on the following morning was taken by boat on the Ganges. We entered the nine-domed Temple of Kali, where the figures of the Divine Mother and Shiva rest on a burn ished silver lotus, its thousand petals meticulously chiseled. Master Mahasa ya beamed in enchantment. He was engaged in his inexhaustible romance with the Beloved. As he chanted Her name, my enraptured heart seemed sha ttered into a thousand pieces. We strolled later through the sacred precincts, halting in a tamarisk grove. The manna characteristically exuded by this tree was symbolic of the heavenly food Master Mahasaya was bestowing. His divi ne invocations continued. I sat rigidly motionless on the grass amid the pink fe athery tamarisk flowers. Temporarily absent from the body, I soared in a supernal visit. This was the first of many pilgrimages to Dakshineswar with the holy teacher. From him I learned the sweetness of God in the aspect of Mother, or Divine Mercy. The childlike saint found little appeal in the Father aspect, or Divine Justice. Stern, exacting, mathematical ju dgment was alien to his gentle nature. \"He can serve as an earthly prototype for the very angels of heaven!\" I thought fondly, watching him one day at his prayers. Without a breath of censure or criticism, he surveyed the world with eyes long familiar with the Primal Purity. His body, mind, speech, and actions were effortlessly harmonized with his soul's simplicity. \"My Master told me so.\" Shrinking from personal assertion, the saint ended any sage counsel with this invariable trib ute. So deep was his identity with Sri Ramakrishna that Master Mahasaya no longer considered his thoughts as his own."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Hand in hand, the saint and I walked on e evening on the block of his school. My joy was dimmed by the arrival of a conceited acquaintance who burdened us with a lengthy discourse. \"I see this man doesn't please you.\" The saint's whisper to me was unheard by the egotist, spellbound by his own monologu e. \"I have spoken to Divine Mother about it; She realizes our sad predicament. As soon as we get to yonder red house, She has promised to remind hi m of more urgent business.\" My eyes were glued to the site of salv ation. Reaching its red gate, the man unaccountably turned and departed, neithe r finishing his sentence nor saying good-by. The assaulted air was comforted with peace. Another day found me walking alone near the Howrah railway station. I stood for a moment by a temple, silently criticizing a small group of men with drum and cymbals who were violently reciting a chant. \"How undevotionally they use the Lord's di vine name in mechanical repetition,\" I reflected. My gaze was astonished by th e rapid approach of Master Mahasaya. \"Sir, how come you here?\" The saint, ignoring my question, answered my thought. \"Isn't it true, little sir, that the Beloved's name sounds sweet from all lips, ignorant or wise?\" He passed his arm around me affectionately; I found myself carried on his magic carpet to the Merciful Presence. \"Would you like to see some bioscopes ?\" This question one afternoon from Master Mahasaya was mystifying; the term was then used in India to signify motion pictures. I agreed, glad to be in his company in any circumstances. A brisk walk brought us to the garden fron ting Calcutta University. My companion indicated a bench near the goldighi or pond. \"Let us sit here for a fe w minutes. My Master always asked me to meditate whenever I saw an expanse of water. Here its placidity reminds us of the vast"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"calmness of God. As all things can be refl ected in water, so the whole universe is mirrored in the lake of the Cosmic Mind. So my gurudeva often said.\" Soon we entered a university hall wher e a lecture was in progress. It proved abysmally dull, though varied occasionally by lantern slide illustrations, equally uninteresting. \"So this is the kind of bioscope the mast er wanted me to see!\" My thought was impatient, yet I would not hurt the saint by revealing boredom in my face. But he leaned toward me confidentially. \"I see, little sir, that you don't like this bioscope. I have mentioned it to Divine Mother; She is in full sympathy with us both. She tells me that the electric lights will now go out, and won't be relit until we have a chance to leave the room.\" As his whisper ended, th e hall was plunged into darkness. The professor's strident voice was stilled in astonishment , then remarked, \"The electrical system of this hall appears to be defective.\" By this time, Master Mahasaya and I were safely across the threshold. Glancing back from the corridor, I saw that the scene of our martyrdom had again become illuminated. \"Little sir, you were disappointed in that bioscope, 9-2 but I think you will like a different one.\" The saint and I were standing on the sidewalk in front of the university building. He gently slapped my chest over the heart. A transforming silence ensued. Just as the modern \"talkies\" become inaudible motion pictures when the sound apparatus goes out of order, so the Divine Hand, by some strange miracle, stifled the eart hly bustle. The pedestrians as well as the passing trolley cars, automobiles, bull ock carts, and iron-wheeled hackney carriages were all in noiseless transit. As though possessing an omnipresent eye, I beheld the scenes which were behind me, an d to each side, as easily as those in front. The whole spectacle of activity in that small section of Calcutta passed"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"before me without a sound. Like a glow of fire dimly seen beneath a thin coat of ashes, a mellow luminescence pe rmeated the panoramic view. My own body seemed nothing more than on e of the many shadows, though it was motionless, while the others flitted mutely to and fro. Several boys, friends of mine, approached and passed on; though they had looked directly at me, it was without recognition. The unique pantomime brought me an inexpressible ecstasy. I drank deep from some blissful fount. Suddenly my chest received another soft blow from Master Mahasaya. The pandemonium of the worl d burst upon my unwilling ears. I staggered, as though harshly awak ened from a gossamer dream. The transcendental wine removed beyond my reach. \"Little sir, I see you found the second bioscope to your liking.\" The saint was smiling; I started to drop in gratitude on the ground before him. \"You can't do that to me now; you know God is in your temple also! I won' t let Divine Mother touch my feet through your hands!\" If anyone observed the unpretentious mast er and myself as we walked away from the crowded pavement, the onlooker surely suspected us of intoxication. I felt that the falling shades of evening were sympathetically drunk with God. When darkness recovered from its nightly swoon , I faced the new morning bereft of my ecstatic mood. But ever enshrined in me mory is the seraphic son of Divine Mother-Master Mahasaya! Trying with poor words to do justice to his benignity, I wonder if Master Mahasaya, and others among the deep-vis ioned saints whose paths crossed mine, knew that years later, in a Western land , I would be writing about their lives as divine devotees. Their foreknowledge wo uld not surprise me nor, I hope, my readers, who have come thus far with me. 9-1: These are respectful titles by which he was customarily addressed. His name was Mahendra Nath Gupta; he signed his literary works simply \"M.\""},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"9-2: The Oxford English Dictionary gives, as rare, this definition of bioscope : A view of life; that which gives such a view. Master Mahasaya's choice of a word was, then, peculiarly justified. CHAPTER: 10 I Meet My Master, Sri Yukteswar \"Faith in God can produce any miracle except one-passing an examination without study.\" Distastefully I closed the book I had picked up in an idle moment. \"The writer's exception shows his complete lack of faith,\" I thought. \"Poor chap, he has great respect for the midnight oil!\" My promise to Father had been that I wo uld complete my high school studies. I cannot pretend to diligence. The passing months found me less frequently in the classroom than in secluded spots along the Calcutta bathing ghats . The adjoining crematory grounds, especially gruesome at night, are considered highly attractive by the yogi. He who would find the Deathl ess Essence must not be dismayed by a few unadorned skulls. Human inadequacy becomes clear in the gloomy abode of miscellaneous bones. My midnig ht vigils were thus of a different nature from the scholar's. The week of final examinations at the Hindu High School was fast approaching. This interrogatory period, like the sepu lchral haunts, inspires a well-known terror. My mind was neverthe less at peace. Braving the ghouls, I was exhuming a knowledge not found in lecture halls. But it lacked the art of Swami Pranabananda, who easily appeared in two places at one time. My educational dilemma was plainly a matter for the Infinite Ingenuity. This was my reasoning, though to many it seems illogic. The devotee's irrationality springs from a thousand inexplicable demonstrations of God's instancy in trouble."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"\"Hello, Mukunda! I catch hardly a glim pse of you these days!\" A classmate accosted me one afternoon on Gurpar Road. \"Hello, Nantu! My invisibility at sch ool has actually placed me there in a decidedly awkward position.\" I unburdened myself under his friendly gaze. Nantu, who was a brilliant student, la ughed heartily; my predicament was not without a comic aspect. \"You are utterly unprepared for the finals! I suppose it is up to me to help you!\" The simple words conveyed divine promise to my ears; with alacrity I visited my friend's home. He kindly outlined th e solutions to various problems he considered likely to be se t by the instructors. \"These questions are the bait which will catch many trusting boys in the examination trap. Remember my answers, and you will escape without injury.\" The night was far gone when I departed. Bursting with unseasoned erudition, I devoutly prayed it would remain for the ne xt few critical days. Nantu had coached me in my various subjects but, under press of time, had forgotten my course in Sanskrit. Fervently I reminded God of the oversight. I set out on a short walk the next mornin g, assimilating my new knowledge to the rhythm of swinging footsteps. As I took a short cut through the weeds of a corner lot, my eye fell on a few loose printed sh eets. A triumphant pounce proved them to be Sanskrit verse. I sought out a pund it for aid in my stumbling interpretation. His rich voice filled the air with the ed geless, honeyed beauty of the ancient tongue. 10-1 \"These exceptional stanzas ca nnot possibly be of aid in your Sanskrit test.\" The scholar dismissed them skeptically."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"But familiarity with that particular poem enabled me on the following day to pass the Sanskrit examination. Through the di scerning help Nantu had given, I also attained the minimum grade for su ccess in all my other subjects. Father was pleased that I had kept my word and concluded my secondary school course. My gratitude sped to the Lord, wh ose sole guidance I perceived in my visit to Nantu and my walk by the unha bitual route of the debris-filled lot. Playfully He had given a dual expression to His timely design for my rescue. I came across the discarded book whose author had denied God precedence in the examination halls. I could not restrain a chuckle at my own silent comment: \"It would only add to this fellow's confusio n, if I were to tell him that divine meditation among the cadavers is a sh ort cut to a high school diploma!\" In my new dignity, I was now openly pl anning to leave home. Together with a young friend, Jitendra Mazumdar, 10-2 I decided to join a Mahamandal hermitage in Benares, and receive its spiritual discipline. A desolation fell over me one morning at thought of separation from my family. Since Mother's death, my affection ha d grown especially tender for my two younger brothers, Sananda and Bishnu. I rushed to my retreat, the little attic which had witnessed so many scenes in my turbulent sadhana . 10-3 After a two- hour flood of tears, I felt singularly tran sformed, as by some alchemical cleanser. All attachment 10-4 disappeared; my resolution to seek God as the Friend of friends set like granite within me. I quickly completed my travel preparations. \"I make one last plea.\" Father was di stressed as I stood before him for final blessing. \"Do not forsake me and your grieving brothers and sisters.\" \"Revered Father, how can I tell my love fo r you! But even greater is my love for the Heavenly Father, who has given me the gift of a perfect father on earth. Let me go, that I someday return with a more divine understanding.\""},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"With reluctant parental consent, I set out to join Jitendra, already in Benares at the hermitage. On my arrival the young head swami, Dyananda, greeted me cordially. Tall and thin, of thoughtful mien , he impressed me favorably. His fair face had a Buddhalike composure. I was pleased that my new home possessed an attic, where I managed to spend the dawn and morning hours. The ashram members, knowing little of meditation practices, thought I should employ my wh ole time in organizational duties. They gave me praise for my aftern oon work in their office. \"Don't try to catch God so soon!\" Th is ridicule from a fellow resident accompanied one of my early departures toward the attic. I went to Dyananda, busy in his small sanctum overlooking the Ganges. \"Swamiji, 10-5 I don't understand what is required of me here. I am seeking direct perception of God. Without Him, I cannot be satisfied with affiliation or creed or performance of good works.\" The orange-robed ecclesiastic gave me an affectionate pat. Staging a mock rebuke, he admonished a few near-by disc iples. \"Don't bother Mukunda. He will learn our ways.\" I politely concealed my doubt. The studen ts left the room, not overly bent with their chastisement. Dyananda had further words for me. \"Mukunda, I see your father is regularly sending you money. Please return it to him; you require none here. A second injunction for your discipline concerns food. Even when you feel hunger, don't mention it.\" Whether famishment gleamed in my eye, I knew not. That I was hungry, I knew only too well. The invariable hour for th e first hermitage meal was twelve noon. I had been accustomed in my own home to a large breakfast at nine o'clock."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The three-hour gap became daily more interminable. Gone were the Calcutta years when I could rebuke the cook for a te n-minute delay. Now I tried to control my appetite; one day I undertook a twenty-four hour fast.

As ge sture of welcome to the swami, who had been absent for two weeks, many delicaci es were in readiness. An appetizing aroma filled the air. Nothing else offering , what else could be swallowed except pride over yesterday's achievement of a fast? \"Lord hasten the train!\" The Heavenly Prov ider, I thought, was hardly included in the interdiction with which Dyananda had silenced me. Divine Attention was elsewhere, however; the plodding clock covered the hours. Darkness was descending as our leader entered the door. My greeting was one of unfeigned joy. \"Dyanandaji will bathe and meditate be fore we can serve food.\" Jitendra approached me again as a bird of ill omen. I was in near-collapse. My young stomach, new to deprivation, protested with gnawing vigor. Pictures I had seen of fami ne victims passed wrai thlike before me. \"The next Benares death from starvation is due at once in this hermitage,\" I thought. Impending doom averted at nine o'clock. Ambrosial summons! In memory that meal is vivid as one of life's perfect hours. Intense absorption yet permitted me to observe that Dyananda ate absent- mindedly. He was apparently above my gross pleasures. \"Swamiji, weren't you hungry?\" Happily surfeited, I was alone with the leader in his study."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"\"O yes! I have spent the last four days wi thout food or drink. I never eat on trains, filled with the heterogenous vibrations of worldly people. Strictly I observe the shastric 10-6 rules for monks of my particular order. \"Certain problems of our organizational work lie on my mind. Tonight at home I neglected my dinner. What's the hurry? To morrow I'll make it a point to have a proper meal.\" He laughed merrily. Shame spread within me like a suffocati on. But the past day of my torture was not easily forgotten; I ventured a further remark. \"Swamiji, I am puzzled. Following your instruction, suppose I never asked for food, and nobody gives me any. I should starve to death.\" \"Die then!\" This alarming counsel split th e air. \"Die if you must Mukunda! Never admit that you live by the power of food and not by the power of God! He who has created every form of nourishment, He who has bestowed appe tite, will certainly see that His devotee is sustained! Do not imagine that rice maintains you, or that money or men support you! Could they aid if the Lord withdraws your life- breath? They are His indirect instruments me rely. Is it by any skill of yours that food digests in your stomach? Use the sword of your discrimination, Mukunda! Cut through the chains of agency and perceive the Single Cause!\" I found his incisive words entering some deep marrow. Gone was an age- old delusion by which bodily imperatives outw it the soul. There and then I tasted the Spirit's all-sufficiency. In how many strang e cities, in my later life of ceaseless travel, did occasion arise to prove the serv iceability of this lesson in a Benares hermitage! The sole treasure which had accompani ed me from Calcutta was the SADHU'S silver amulet bequeathed to me by Moth er. Guarding it for years, I now had it carefully hidden in my ashram room. To renew my joy in the talismanic testimony, one morning I opened the locked box. The sealed covering untouched,"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"lo! the amulet was gone. Mournfully I tore open its envelope and made unmistakably sure. It had vanished, in accordance with the SADHU'S prediction, into the ether whence he had summoned it. My relationship with Dyananda's followers grew steadily worse. The household was alienated, hurt by my determined aloofness. My strict adherence to meditation on the very Ideal for which I had left home and all worldly ambitions called forth shallow criticism on all sides. Torn by spiritual anguish, I entered the attic one dawn, resolved to pray until answer was vouchsafed. \"Merciful Mother of the Universe, teach me Thyself through visions, or through a guru sent by Thee!\" The passing hours found my sobbing pl eas without response. Suddenly I felt lifted as though bodily to a sphere uncircumscribed. \"Thy Master cometh today!\" A divine wo manly voice came from everywhere and nowhere. This supernal experience was pierced by a shout from a definite locale. A young priest nicknamed Habu was calling me from the downstairs kitchen. \"Mukunda, enough of meditation! You are needed for an errand.\" Another day I might have replied impatien tly; now I wiped my tear- swollen face and meekly obeyed the summons. Togeth er Habu and I set out for a distant market place in the Bengali section of Be nares. The ungentle Indian sun was not yet at zenith as we made our purchase s in the bazaars. We pushed our way through the colorful medley of housewives, guides, priests, simply-clad widows, dignified Brahmins, and the ubiquitous holy bulls. Passing an inconspicuous lane, I turned my head and surveyed the narrow length."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"A Christlike man in the ocher robes of a swami stood motionless at the end of the road. Instantly and anciently familiar he se emed; my gaze fed hungrily for a trice. Then doubt assailed me. \"You are confusing this wandering monk wi th someone known to you,\" I thought. \"Dreamer, walk on.\" After ten minutes, I felt heavy numbness in my feet. As though turned to stone, they were unable to carry me farther. Laboriously I turned around; my feet regained normalcy. I faced the opposite direction; again the curious weight oppressed me. \"The saint is magnetically drawing me to him!\" With this thought, I heaped my parcels into the arms of Habu. He had b een observing my erratic footwork with amazement, and now burst into laughter. \"What ails you? Are you crazy?\" My tumultuous emotion prevented any retort; I sped silently away. Retracing my steps as though wing-sho d, I reached the narrow lane. My quick glance revealed the quiet figure, steadily gazing in my direction. A few eager steps and I was at his feet. \"Gurudeva!\" 10-7 The divine face was none other th an he of my thousand visions. These halcyon eyes, in leonine head with pointed beard and flowing locks, had oft peered through gloom of my nocturnal reveries, holding a promise I had not fully understood. \"O my own, you have come to me!\" My guru uttered the words again and again in Bengali, his voice tremulous with joy. \"H ow many years I have waited for you!\" We entered a oneness of silence; word s seemed the rankest superfluities. Eloquence flowed in soundless chant from heart of master to disciple. With an"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"antenna of irrefragable insight I sensed that my guru knew God, and would lead me to Him. The obscuration of this life disappeared in a fragile dawn of prenatal memories. Dramatic time! Past, present, and future are its cycling scenes. This was not the first sun to find me at these holy feet! My hand in his, my guru led me to hi s temporary residence in the Rana Mahal section of the city. His athletic figure mo ved with firm tread. Tall, erect, about fifty-five at this time, he was active and vigorous as a young man. His dark eyes were large, beautiful with pl umbless wisdom. Slightly curl y hair softened a face of striking power. Strength ming led subtly with gentleness. As we made our way to the stone balcon y of a house overlooking the Ganges, he said affectionately: \"I will give you my hermit ages and all I possess.\" \"Sir, I come for wisdom and God-contact. Those are your treasure- troves I am after!\" The swift Indian twilight had dropped its half-curtain before my master spoke again. His eyes held unfathomable tenderness. \"I give you my unconditional love.\" Precious words! A quarter-century elapsed before I had another auricular proof of his love. His lips were strange to ar dor; silence became his oceanic heart. \"Will you give me the same unconditional love?\" He gazed at me with childlike trust. \"I will love you eternally, Gurudeva!\" \"Ordinary love is selfish, darkly rooted in desires and satisfactions. Divine love is without condition, without boundary, wi thout change. The flux of the human heart is gone forever at the transfixing touch of pure love.\" He added humbly, \"If"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"ever you find me falling from a state of God-realization, please promise to put my head on your lap and help to bring me back to the Cosmic Beloved we both worship.\" He rose then in the gathering darkness an d guided me to an inner room. As we ate mangoes and almond sweetmeats, he unobtrusively wove into his conversation an intimate knowledge of my nature. I was awe-struck at the grandeur of his wisdom, exquisitely blended with an innate humility. \"Do not grieve for your amulet. It has se rved its purpose.\" Like a divine mirror, my guru apparently had caught a reflection of my whole life. \"The living reality of your presence, Master, is joy beyond any symbol.\" \"It is time for a change, inasmuch as you are unhappily situated in the hermitage.\" I had made no references to my life; they now seemed superfluous! By his natural, unemphatic manner, I underst ood that he wished no astonished ejaculations at his clairvoyance. \"You should go back to Calcutta. Why exclude relatives from your love of humanity?\" His suggestion dismayed me. My family wa s predicting my return, though I had been unresponsive to many pleas by le tter. \"Let the young bird fly in the metaphysical skies,\" Ananta had remark ed. \"His wings will tire in the heavy atmosphere. We shall yet see him swoop toward home, fold his pinions, and humbly rest in our family nest.\" This di scouraging simile fres h in my mind, I was determined to do no \"swooping\" in the direction of Calcutta. \"Sir, I am not returning home.

I am visiting my mother here for only a few days.\" I wondered at God's intricate play with His devotees. Serampore is but twelve miles from Calcutta, yet in those regions I had never caught a glimpse of my guru. We had had to travel for our meeting to the ancient city of Kasi (Benares), hallowed by memories of Lahiri Maha saya. Here too the feet of Buddha, Shankaracharya and other Yogi- Christs had blessed the soil. \"You will come to me in four weeks.\" For the first time, Sri Yukteswar's voice was stern. \"Now I have told my eternal a ffection, and have sh own my happiness at finding you-that is why you disregard my request. The next time we meet, you will have to reawaken my interest: I won' t accept you as a disciple easily. There must be complete surrender by obedience to my strict training.\" I remained obstinately silent. My guru easily penetrated my difficulty. \"Do you think your relatives will laugh at you?\" \"I will not return.\" \"You will return in thirty days.\" \"Never.\" Bowing reverently at his f eet, I departed without lightening the controversial tension. As I made my wa y in the midnight darkness, I wondered why the miraculous meeting had ended on an inharmonious note. The dual scales of maya , that balance every joy with a gr ief! My young heart was not yet malleable to the transforming fingers of my guru. The next morning I noticed increased hostility in the attitude of the hermitage members. My days became spiked with invariable rudeness. In three weeks, Dyananda left the ashram to attend a conference in Bombay; pandemonium broke over my hapless head."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"\"Mukunda is a parasite, accepting hermit age hospitality without making proper return.\" Overhearing this remark, I regrette d for the first time that I had obeyed the request to send back my money to Fa ther.

How foolishly you are throwing away your life!\" An elder- brother sermon was assaulting my ears. Jitendra and I, fresh from the train (a figure of speech merely; we were covered with dust), had just arrived at the home of Ananta, recently transferred from Calcutta to the ancient city of Agra. Brother was a supervising accountant for the Bengal-Nagpur Railway. \"You well know, Ananta, I seek my inhe ritance from the Heavenly Father.\" \"Money first; God can come later! Who knows? Life may be too long.\" \"God first; money is His slave! Who can tell? Life may be too short.\" My retort was summoned by the exigen cies of the moment, and held no presentiment. Yet the leaves of time unfo lded to early finality for Ananta; a few years later 11-1 he entered the land where bank notes avail neither first nor last. \"Wisdom from the hermitage, I suppose ! But I see you have left Benares.\" Ananta's eyes gleamed with satisfaction; he yet hoped to secure my pinions in the family nest. \"My sojourn in Benares was not in vain! I found there everything my heart had been longing for! You may be sure it was not your pundit or his son!\" Ananta joined me in reminiscent laughter ; he had had to admit that the Benares \"clairvoyant\" he selected was a shortsighted one."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"\"What are your plans, my wandering brother?\" \"Jitendra persuaded me to Agra. We shal l view the beauties of the Taj Mahal 11-2 here,\" I explained. \"Then we are goin g to my newly-found guru, who has a hermitage in Serampore.\" Ananta hospitably arranged for our comfort. Several times during the evening I noticed his eyes fixed on me reflectively. \"I know that look!\" I thought. \"A plot is brewing!\" The denouement took place during our early breakfast. \"So you feel quite independent of Father's wealth.\" Ananta's gaze was innocent as he resumed the barbs of yesterday's conversation. \"I am conscious of my dependence on God.\" \"Words are cheap! Life has shielded you thus far! What a plight if you were forced to look to the Invisible Hand for your food and shelter! You would soon be begging on the streets!\" \"Never! I would not put faith in passers-b y rather than God! He can devise for His devotee a thousand resources besides the begging-bowl!\" \"More rhetoric! Suppose I suggest that your vaunted philosophy be put to a test in this tangible world?\" \"I would agree! Do you confine God to a speculative world?\" \"We shall see; today you shall have opportun ity either to enlarge or to confirm my own views!\" Ananta paused for a dramatic moment; then spoke slowly and seriously."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"\"I propose that I send you and your fello w disciple Jitendra this morning to the near-by city of Brindaban. You must not take a single rupee; you must not beg, either for food or money; you must not reveal your predicament to anyone; you must not go without your meals; and you must not be stranded in Brindaban. If you return to my bungalow here before twelve o'clock tonight, without having broken any rule of the test, I shall be the most astonished man in Agra!\" \"I accept the challenge.\" No hesitation wa s in my words or in my heart. Grateful memories flashed of the Instant Benefi cence: my healing of deadly cholera through appeal to Lahiri Ma hasaya's picture; the playfu l gift of the two kites on the Lahore roof with Uma; the opportune amulet amidst my discouragement; the decisive message through the unknown Benares sadhu outside the compound of the pundit's home; the vision of Divine Mother and Her majestic words of love; Her swift heed through Master Mahasaya to my trifling embarrassments; the last-minute guidance which materialized my high school diploma; and the ultimate boon, my living Master from th e mist of lifelong dreams.

I'll escor t you to the train at once.\" Ananta turned to the openmouthed Jitendra. \"You must go along as a witness and, very likely, a fellow victim!\" A half hour later Jitendra and I were in possession of one-way tickets for our impromptu trip. We submitted, in a secluded corner of the station, to a search of our persons. Ananta was quickly satisfied that we were carrying no hidden hoard; our simple dhotis 11-3 concealed nothing more than was necessary. As faith invaded the serious realms of finance, my friend spoke protestingly. \"Ananta, give me one or two rupees as a safeguard. Then I can telegraph you in case of misfortune.\""},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"\"Jitendra!\" My ejaculation was sharply re proachful. \"I will not proceed with the test if you take any money as final security.\" \"There is something reassuring about the cl ink of coins.\" Jitendra said no more as I regarded him sternly. \"Mukunda, I am not heartless.\" A hint of humility had crept into Ananta's voice. It may be that his conscience was smiting him; perhaps for sending two insolvent boys to a strange city; perhaps for his ow n religious skepticism. \"If by any chance or grace you pass successfully through th e Brindaban ordeal, I shall ask you to initiate me as your disciple.\" This promise had a certain irregularity , in keeping with the unconventional occasion. The eldest brother in an Indian family seldom bows before his juniors; he receives respect and obedience second only to a father. But no time remained for my comment; our train was at point of departure. Jitendra maintained a lugubrious silence as our train covered the miles. Finally he bestirred himself; leaning over, he pi nched me painfully at an awkward spot. \"I see no sign that God is going to supply our next meal!\" \"Be quiet, doubting Thomas; the Lord is working with us.\" \"Can you also arrange that He hurry? Already I am famished merely at the prospect before us. I left Benares to view the Taj's mausoleum, not to enter my own!\" \"Cheer up, Jitendra! Are we not to have ou r first glimpse of the sacred wonders of Brindaban? 11-4 I am in deep joy at thought of treading the ground hallowed by feet of Lord Krishna.\" The door of our compartment opened; two men seated themselves. The next train stop would be the last."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"\"Young lads, do you have friends in Br indaban?\" The stranger opposite me was taking a surprising interest. \"None of your business!\" Rudely I averted my gaze. \"You are probably flying away from your families under the enchantment of the Stealer of Hearts. 11-5 I am of devotional temperam ent myself. I will make it my positive duty to see that you receive food, and shelter from this overpowering heat.\" \"No, sir, let us alone. You are very kind; but you are mistaken in judging us to be truants from home.\" No further conversation ensued; the trai n came to a halt. As Jitendra and I descended to the platform, our chance companions linked arms with us and summoned a horse cab. We alit before a stately hermitage, set amidst the evergreen trees of well-kept grounds. Our benefactors were evidently known here; a smiling lad led us without comment to a parlor. We were soon join ed by an elderly woman of dignified bearing. \"Gauri Ma, the princes could not come.\" One of the men addressed the ashram hostess. \"At the last moment their plans went awry; they send deep regrets.

I was expecting two royal patrons of this hermitage. What a shame if my cooking had found none to appreciate it!\" These appetizing words had disastrous effect on Jitendra: he burst into tears. The \"prospect\" he had feared in Brindaban was turning out as royal entertainment ; his sudden mental adjustment pr oved too much for hi m. Our hostess looked at him with c uriosity, but without r emark; pe rhaps she was familiar with adolescent quirks. Lunch was announced; Gauri Ma led the way to a dining patio, spicy with savo ry odors. She vanished into an adjoining kitchen."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"I had been premeditating this moment. Selecting the appropriate spot on Jitendra's anatomy, I administered a pinc h as resounding as the one he had given me on the train. \"Doubting Thomas, the Lord works-in a hurry, too!\" The hostess reentered with a punkha . She steadily fanned us in the Oriental fashion as we squatted on ornate blanke t-seats. Ashram disciples passed to and fro with some thirty courses. Rather th an \"meal,\" the description can only be \"sumptuous repast.\" Since arriving on this planet, Jitendra and I had never before tasted such delicacies. \"Dishes fit for princes indeed, Honored Mother! What your royal patrons could have found more urgent than attending this banquet, I cannot imagine! You have given us a memory for a lifetime!\" Silenced as we were by Ananta's requ irement, we could not explain to the gracious lady that our than ks held a double significance. Our sincerity at least was patent. We departed with her blessing and an attractive invitation to revisit the hermitage. The heat outdoors was merciless. My friend and I made for the shelter of a lordly cadamba tree at the ashram gate. Sharp wo rds followed; once again Jitendra was beset with misgivings. \"A fine mess you have got me into! Ou r luncheon was only accidental good fortune! How can we see the sights of this city, without a single pice between us? And how on earth are you going to take me back to Ananta's?\" \"You forget God quickly, now that your stomach is filled.\" My words, not bitter, were accusatory. How short is human me mory for divine favors! No man lives who has not seen certain of his prayers granted. \"I am not likely to forget my folly in venturing out with a madcap like you!\""},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"\"Be quiet, Jitendra! The same Lord wh o fed us will show us Brindaban, and return us to Agra.\" A slight young man of pleasing countenance approached at rapid pace. Halting under our tree, he bowed before me. \"Dear friend, you and your companion must be strangers here. Permit me to be your host and guide.\" It is scarcely possible for an Indian to pale, but Jitendra's face was suddenly sickly. I politely declined the offer. \"You are surely not banishing me?\" The stranger's alarm would have been comic in any other circumstances. \"Why not?\" \"You are my guru.\" His eyes sought mine trustfully. \"During my midday devotions, the blessed Lord Krishna appe ared in a vision. He showed me two forsaken figures under this very tree. On e face was yours, my master! Often have I seen it in meditation! What joy if you accept my humble services!\" \"I too am glad you have found me. Neither God nor man has forsaken us!\" Though I was motionless, smiling at th e eager face before me, an inward obeisance cast me at the Divine Feet. \"Dear friends, will you not ho nor my home for a visit?\" \"You are kind; but the plan is unfeasible. Already we are guests of my brother in Agra.\" \"At least give me memories of touring Brindaban with you.\""},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"I gladly consented. The young man, who said his name was Pratap Chatterji, hailed a horse carriage. We visited Madanamohana Temple and other Krishna shrines. Night descended while we were at our temple devotions. \"Excuse me while I get sandesh .\" 11-6 Pratap entered a shop near the railroad station. Jitendra and I sauntered along the wide street, crowded now in the comparative coolness. Our friend was abse nt for some time, but finally returned with gifts of many sweetmeats. \"Please allow me to gain this religious meri t.\" Pratap smiled pleadingly as he held out a bundle of rupee notes and two tickets, just purchased, to Agra. The reverence of my acceptance was for th e Invisible Hand. Scoffed at by Ananta, had Its bounty not far exceeded necessity? We sought out a secluded spot near the station. \"Pratap, I will instruct you in the Kriya of Lahiri Mahasaya, the greatest yogi of modern times. His technique will be your guru.\" The initiation was concluded in a half hour. \" Kriya is your chintamani ,\" 11-7 I told the new student. \"The technique, which as you see is simple, embodies the art of quickening man's spiritual evolution. Hindu scriptures teach that the incarnating ego requires a million years to obtain liberation from maya . This natural period is greatly shortened through Kriya Yoga . Just as Jagadis Chandra Bose has demonstrated that plant growth can be accelerated far beyond its normal rate, so man's psychological development can be al so speeded by an inner science. Be faithful in your practice; you will approach the Guru of all gurus.\" \"I am transported to find this yogic key, long sought!\" Pratap spoke thoughtfully. \"Its unshackling effect on my sensory bo nds will free me for higher spheres. The vision today of Lord Krishna could only mean my highest good.\""},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"We sat awhile in silent understanding, th en walked slowly to the station. Joy was within me as I boarded the train, but this was Jitendra's day for tears. My affectionate farewell to Pratap had been punctuated by stifled sobs from both my companions. The journey once more found Ji tendra in a welter of grief. Not for himself this time, but against himself. \"How shallow my trust! My heart has been stone! Never in future shall I doubt God's protection!\" Midnight was approaching. The two \"Cin derellas,\" sent fort h penniless, entered Ananta's bedroom. His face, as he had promised, was a study in astonishment. Silently I showered the table with rupees. \"Jitendra, the truth!\" Ananta's tone was jocular. \"Has not this youngster been staging a holdup?\" But as the tale was unfolded, my brother turned sober, then solemn. \"The law of demand and supply reaches in to subtler realms than I had supposed.\" Ananta spoke with a spiritual enthusiasm never before noticeable. \"I understand for the first time your indifference to th e vaults and vulgar accumulations of the world.\" Late as it was, my brother insisted that he receive diksha 11-8 into Kriya Yoga . The \"guru\" Mukunda had to shoulder the re sponsibility of two unsought disciples in one day. Breakfast the following morning was eaten in a harmony absent the day before. I smiled at Jitendra. \"You shall not be cheated of the Taj. Let us view it before starting for Serampore.\" Bidding farewell to Ananta, my friend and I were soon before the glory of Agra, the Taj Mahal. White marble dazzling in the sun, it stands a vision of pure"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"symmetry. The perfect setting is dark cypr ess, glossy lawn, and tranquil lagoon.

Jitendra and I were shortly traveling south by train toward Bengal. \"Mukunda, I have not seen my family in months. I have changed my mind; perhaps later I shall visit yo ur master in Serampore.\" My friend, who may mildly be described as vacillating in temperament, left me in Calcutta. By local train I soon reached Se rampore, twelve miles to the north. A throb of wonderment stole over me as I realized that twenty-eight days had elapsed since the Benares meeting with my guru. \"You will come to me in four weeks!\" Here I was, heart pounding, standing within his courtyard on quiet Rai Ghat Lane. I entered for the first time the hermitage where I was to spend the best part of the next ten years with India's Jyanavatar , \"incarnation of wisdom.\" 11-1: See chapter 25 . 11-2: The world-famous mausoleum.. 11-3: A dhoti -cloth is knotted around the waist and covers the legs.. 11-4: Brindaban, in the Muttra di strict of United Provinces, is the Hindu Jerusalem.

I glanced about me; my gaze fell with astonishment on a wall picture, garlanded with a spray of jasmine. \"Lahiri Mahasaya!\" \"Yes, my divine guru.\" Sri Yukteswar's to ne was reverently vibrant. \"Greater he was, as man and yogi, than any other teac her whose life came within the range of my investigations.\" Silently I bowed before the familiar pic ture. Soul-homage sped to the peerless master who, blessing my infancy, ha d guided my steps to this hour. Led by my guru, I strolled over the house and its grounds. Large, ancient and well-built, the hermitage was surrounded by a massive- pillared courtyard. Outer walls were moss-covered; pigeons fl uttered over the flat gray roof, unceremoniously sharing the ashram quarte rs. A rear garden was pleasant with"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"jackfruit, mango, and plantain trees. Balustraded balconies of upper rooms in the two-storied building faced the courtyard from three sides. A spacious ground- floor hall, with high ceiling supported by colonnades, was used, Master said, chiefly during the annual festivities of Durgapuja . 12-1 A narrow stairway led to Sri Yukteswar's sitting room, whose small balcony overlooked the street. The ashram was plainly furnished; everythi ng was simple, clean, and utilitarian. Several Western styled chairs, benches, and tables were in evidence. Master invited me to stay overnight. A supper of vegetable curry was served by two young disciples who were receiving hermitage training. \"Guruji, please tell me something of your life.\" I was squatting on a straw mat near his tiger skin. The friendly stars were very close, it seemed, beyond the balcony. \"My family name was Priya Nath Karar. I was born 12-2 here in Serampore, where Father was a wealthy businessman. He le ft me this ancestral mansion, now my hermitage. My formal schooling was little; I found it slow and shallow. In early manhood, I undertook the responsibiliti es of a householder, and have one daughter, now married. My middle life was blessed with the guidance of Lahiri Mahasaya. After my wife died, I joined the Swami Order and received the new name of Sri Yukteswar Giri. 12-3 Such are my simple annals.\" Master smiled at my eager face. Like all biographical sketches, his words had given the outward facts without revealing the inner man. \"Guruji, I would like to hear so me stories of your childhood.\" \"I will tell you a few-each one with a mo ral!\" Sri Yukteswar's eyes twinkled with his warning. \"My mother once tried to frighten me with an appalling story of a ghost in a dark chamber. I went there immediately, and expressed my disappointment at having missed the ghost. Mother never told me another horror-tale. Moral: Look fear in the face and it will cease to trouble you."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"\"Another early memory is my wish for an ugly dog belonging to a neighbor. I kept my household in turmoil for weeks to get that dog. My ears were deaf to offers of pets with more prepossessing appearance. Moral: Attachme nt is blinding; it lends an imaginary halo of attractiveness to the object of desire. \"A third story concerns the plasticity of the youthful mind. I heard my mother remark occasionally: 'A man who accepts a job under anyone is a slave.' That impression became so indelibly fixed th at even after my marriage I refused all positions. I met expenses by investing my family endowment in land. Moral: Good and positive suggestions should instruct the sensitive ears of children. Their early ideas long remain sharply etched.\" Master fell into tranquil silence. Arou nd midnight he led me to a narrow cot. Sleep was sound and sweet the firs t night under my guru's roof. Sri Yukteswar chose the following morning to grant me his Kriya Yoga initiation. The technique I had already received fr om two disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya- Father and my tutor, Swami Kebalanand a-but in Master's presence I felt transforming power. At his touch, a great light broke upon my being, like glory of countless suns blazing together. A flood of ineffable bliss, overwhelming my heart to an innermost core, continued during the following day. It was late that afternoon before I could bring my self to leave the hermitage. \"You will return in thirty days.\" As I re ached my Calcutta home, the fulfillment of Master's prediction entered with me. No ne of my relatives made the pointed remarks I had feared about the reappearance of the \"soaring bird.\" I climbed to my little attic and bestowed affectionate glances, as though on a living presence. \"You have witnessed my meditations, and the tears and storms of my sadhana . Now I have reached the harbor of my divine teacher.\" \"Son, I am happy for us both.\" Father and I sat together in the evening calm. \"You have found your guru, as in miraculous fashion I once found my own. The holy"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"hand of Lahiri Mahasaya is guarding our lives. Your master has proved no inaccessible Himalayan saint, but one near-by. My prayers have been answered: you have not in your search for God been permanently removed from my sight.\" Father was also pleased that my formal studies would be resumed; he made suitable arrangements. I was enrolled the following day at the Scottish Church College in Calcutta. Happy months sped by. My readers ha ve doubtless made the perspicacious surmise that I was little seen in the co llege classrooms. The Serampore hermitage held a lure too irresistible. Master a ccepted my ubiquitous presence without comment. To my relief, he seldom referred to the halls of learning. Though it was plain to all that I was never cut out for a scholar, I managed to attain minimum passing grades from time to time. Daily life at the ashram flowed smoothly, infrequently varied. My guru awoke before dawn. Lying down, or sometimes sitting on the bed, he entered a state of samadhi . 12-4 It was simplicity itself to di scover when Master had awakened: abrupt halt of stupendous snores. 12-5 A sigh or two; perhaps a bodily movement. Then a soundless state of breathlessness: he was in deep yogic joy. Breakfast did not follow; first came a long walk by the Ganges. Those morning strolls with my guru-how real and vivid still! In the easy resurrection of memory, I often find myself by his side: the early sun is warming the river. His voice rings out, rich with the authenticity of wisdom. A bath; then the midday meal. Its preparation, according to Master's daily directions, had been the careful task of young disciples. My guru was a vegetarian. Before embracing monkhood, however, he had eaten eggs and fish. His advice to students was to follow any simple diet wh ich proved suited to one's constitution."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Master ate little; often rice, color ed with turmeric or juice of beets or spinach and lightly sprinkled with buffalo ghee or melted butter. Another day he might have lentil- dhal or chann a 12 -6 curry with vegetables. For dessert, mangoes or oranges with rice pudding, or jackfruit juice. Visitors appeared in the afternoons. A st eady stream poured from the world i nto the hermitage tranquillity. Everyone found in Master a n equal courtesy and kindness. To a man who has realized himsel f as a soul, not the body or the ego, the rest of humanity a ssumes a st riking simil arity of aspect. The impartiality of saints is rooted in wisdom. Masters have escaped maya ; it s alternating faces of intellect and idiocy no longer cast an influential glance. Sri Yukteswar showed no special considera tion t o those who happened to be powerful or accomplished; neither did he slight others for their poverty or illiteracy. He would listen respectfully to words of truth from a child, and openly ignore a conceited pundit. MY MASTER, SRI YUKTESWAR Disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Eight o'clock was the supper hour, and sometimes found lingering guests. My guru would not excuse himself to eat al one; none left his ashram hungry or dissatisfied. Sri Yukteswar was never at a loss, never dismayed by unexpected visitors; scanty food would emerge a banq uet under his resourceful direction. Yet he was economical; his modest funds we nt far. \"Be comfortable within your purse,\" he often said. \"Extravagance wi ll buy you discomfort.\" Whether in the details of hermitage entertainment, or his building and repair work, or other practical concerns, Master manifested the originality of a creative spirit. Quiet evening hours often brought one of my guru's discourses, treasures against time. His every utterance was measured an d chiseled by wisdom. A sublime self- assurance marked his mode of expression: it was unique. He spoke as none other in my experience ever spoke. His thoughts were weighed in a delicate balance of discrimination before he permitted them an outward garb. The essence of truth, all-pervasive with even a physiological aspect, came from him like a fragrant exudation of the soul. I was conscious always that I was in the presence of a living manifestation of God. The weight of his divinity automatically bowed my head before him. If late guests detected that Sri Yukteswar was becoming engrossed with the Infinite, he quickly engaged them in conve rsation. He was incapable of striking a pose, or of flaunting his inner withdrawal . Always one with the Lord, he needed no separate time for communion. A self-realized master has already left behind the stepping stone of meditation. \"The fl ower falls when the fruit appears.\" But saints often cling to spiritual forms for the encouragement of disciples. As midnight approached, my guru might fa ll into a doze with the naturalness of a child. There was no fuss about bedding. He often lay down, without even a pillow, on a narrow davenport which was the back ground for his customary tiger-skin seat. A night-long philosophical discussion wa s not rare; any disciple could summon it by intensity of interest. I felt no tiredne ss then, no desire for sleep; Master's living"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"words were sufficient. \"Oh, it is dawn! Let us walk by the Ganges.\" So ended many of my periods of nocturnal edification. My early months with Sri Yukteswar culminated in a useful lesson-\"How to Outwit a Mosquito.\" At home my family al ways used protective curtains at night. I was dismayed to discover that in the Serampore hermitage this prudent custom was honored in the breach. Yet the insect s were in full residency; I was bitten from head to foot. My guru took pity on me. \"Buy yourself a curtain, and also one fo r me.\" He laughed and added, \"If you buy only one, for yourself, all mosquitoes will concentrate on me!\" I was more than thankful to comply. Ever y night that I spent in Serampore, my guru would ask me to arrange the bedtime curtains. The mosquitoes one evening were especially virulent. But Master failed to issue his usual instructions. I listened nervously to the anticipatory hum of the insects. Getting into bed, I threw a propitiatory prayer in their general direction. A half hour later, I coughed pretentiously to a ttract my guru's attention. I thought I would go mad with the bites and especia lly the singing drone as the mosquitoes celebrated bloodthirsty rites. No responsive stir from Master; I a pproached him cautiously. He was not breathing. This was my first observation of him in the yogic trance; it filled me with fright. \"His heart must have failed!\" I placed a mirror under his nose; no breath-vapor appeared. To make doubly certain, for minutes I closed his mouth and nostrils with my fingers. His body was cold and mo tionless. In a daze, I turned toward the door to summon help. \"So! A budding experimentalist! My poor nose!\" Master's voice was shaky with laughter. \"Why don't you go to bed? Is the whole world going to change for you? Change yourself: be rid of the mosquito consciousness.\""},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Meekly I returned to my bed. Not one insect ventured near. I realized that my guru had previously agreed to the curtains only to please me; he had no fear of mosquitoes. His yogic power was such that he either could will them not to bite, or could escape to an inner invulnerability. \"He was giving me a demonstration,\" I th ought. \"That is the yogic state I must strive to attain.\" A yogi must be able to pass into, and continue in, the superconsciousness, regardless of multitud inous distractions never absent from this earth. Whether in the buzz of insect s or the pervasive glare of daylight, the testimony of the senses must be barred. Sound and sight come then indeed, but to worlds fairer than the banished Eden. 12-7 The instructive mosquitoes served for another early lesson at the ashram. It was the gentle hour of dusk. My guru was matc hlessly interpreting the ancient texts. At his feet, I was in perfect peace. A ru de mosquito entered the idyl and competed for my attention. As it dug a poisonous hypodermic needle into my thigh, I automatically raised an avenging hand. Reprieve from impending execution! An opportune memory came to me of one of Patanjali's yoga aphorisms-that on ahimsa (harmlessness). \"Why didn't you finish the job?\" \"Master! Do you advocate taking life?\" \"No; but the deathblow already had been struck in your mind.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"Patanjali's meaning was the removal of desire to kill.\" Sri Yukteswar had found my mental processes an open book. \"This world is inconveniently arranged for a literal practice of ahimsa . Man may be compelled to exterminate harmful creatures. He is not under similar compulsion to feel anger or animosity. All forms of life have equal right to the air of maya . The saint who uncovers the secret of creation will be in harmony wi th its countless bewildering expressions."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"All men may approach that understand ing who curb the inner passion for destruction.\" \"Guruji, should one offer himself a sacr ifice rather than kill a wild beast?\" \"No; man's body is precious. It has th e highest evolutionary value because of unique brain and spinal centers. These enable the advanced devotee to fully grasp and express the loftiest aspects of divinity . No lower form is so equipped. It is true that one incurs the debt of a minor sin if he is forced to kill an animal or any living thing. But the Vedas teach that wanton loss of a human body is a serious transgression against the karmic law.\" I sighed in relief; scriptural reinforcemen t of one's natural instincts is not always forthcoming. It so happened that I never sa w Master at close quarters with a leopard or a tiger. But a deadly cobra once confronted him, on ly to be conquered by my guru's love. This variety of snake is much feared in India, where it causes more than five thousand deaths annually. The dangerous encounter took place at Puri, where Sri Yukteswar had a second hermitage, charmi ngly situated near the Bay of Bengal. Prafulla, a young disciple of later years, was with Master on this occasion. \"We were seated outdoors near the ashram,\" Prafulla told me. \"A cobra appeared near-by, a four-foot length of sheer terro r. Its hood was angrily expanded as it raced toward us. My guru gave a welcomin g chuckle, as though to a child. I was beside myself with consternation to see Master engage in a rhythmical clapping of hands. 12-8 He was entertaining the dread visitor! I remained absolutely quiet, inwardly ejaculating what fervent prayers I could muster. The serpent, very close to my guru, was now motionless, seemingl y magnetized by his caressing attitude. The frightful hood gradually contracted; the snake slithered between Master's feet and disappeared into the bushes."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"\"Why my guru would move his hands, an d why the cobra would not strike them, were inexplicable to me then,\" Prafulla concluded. \"I have since come to realize that my divine master is beyond fear of hurt from any living creature.\" One afternoon during my early months at the ashram, found Sr i Yukteswar's eyes fixed on me piercingly. \"You are too thin, Mukunda.\" His remark struck a sensitive point. That my sunken eyes and emaciated appearance were far from my liking was test ified to by rows of tonics in my room at Calcutta. Nothing availed; chronic dy spepsia had pursued me since childhood. My despair reached an occasional zenith wh en I asked myself if it were worth- while to carry on this life with a body so unsound. \"Medicines have limitations; the creative life-force has none. Believe that: you shall be well and strong.\" Sri Yukteswar's words aroused a convictio n of personally-applicable truth which no other healer-and I had tried many!- had been able to summon within me. Day by day, behold! I waxed. Two week s after Master's hidden blessing, I had accumulated the invigorating weight whic h eluded me in the past. My persistent stomach ailments vanished with a life long permanency. On later occasions I witnessed my guru's instantaneous divine healings of persons suffering from ominous disease-tuberculosis, diabetes, epil epsy, or paralysis. Not one could have been more grateful for his cure th an I was at sudden freedom from my cadaverous aspect. \"Years ago, I too was anxious to put on weight,\" Sri Yukteswar told me. \"During convalescence after a severe illness, I visited Lahiri Mahasaya in Benares. \"'Sir, I have been very sick and lost many pounds.'"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"\"'I see, Yukteswar, 12-9 you made yourself unwell, and now you think you are thin.' \"This reply was far from the one I had expected; my guru, however, added encouragingly: \"'Let me see; I am sure you ought to feel better tomorrow.' \"Taking his words as a gesture of secret healing toward my receptive mind, I was not surprised the next morning at a wel come accession of strength. I sought out my master and exclaimed exultingly, 'Sir, I feel much better today.' \"'Indeed! Today you invigorate yourself.' \"'No, master!' I protested. 'It was you wh o helped me; this is the first time in weeks that I have had any energy.' \"'O yes! Your malady has been quite seriou s. Your body is frail yet; who can say how it will be tomorrow?' \"The thought of possible return of my weakness brought me a shudder of cold fear. The following morning I could hardly drag myself to Lahiri Mahasaya's home. \"'Sir, I am ailing again.' \"My guru's glance was quizzical. 'So! Once more you indispose yourself.' \"'Gurudeva, I realize now that day by da y you have been ridiculing me.' My patience was exhausted. 'I don't understand why you disbelieve my truthful reports.' \"'Really, it has been your thoughts that have made you feel alternately weak and strong.' My master looked at me affectio nately. 'You have seen how your health has exactly followed your expectations. Thou ght is a force, even as electricity or"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"gravitation. The human mind is a spark of the almighty consciousness of God. I could show you that whatever your power ful mind believes very intensely would instantly come to pass.' \"Knowing that Lahiri Maha saya never spoke idly, I addressed him with great awe and gratitude: 'Master, if I think I am well and have regained my former weight, shall that happen?' \"'It is so, even at this moment.' My guru spoke gravely, his gaze concentrated on my eyes. \"Lo! I felt an increase not alone of st rength but of weight. Lahiri Mahasaya retreated into silence. After a few hours at his feet, I returned to my mother's home, where I stayed during my visits to Benares. \"'My son! What is the matter? Are you swelling with dropsy?' Mother could hardly believe her eyes. My body was now of the same robust dimensions it had possessed before my illness. \"I weighed myself and found that in on e day I had gained fifty pounds; they remained with me permanently. Friend s and acquaintances who had seen my thin figure were aghast with wonderment . A number of them changed their mode of life and became disciples of Lahiri Ma hasaya as a result of this miracle. \"My guru, awake in God, knew this world to be nothing but an objectivized dream of the Creator. Because he was complete ly aware of his unity with the Divine Dreamer, Lahiri Mahasaya could materi alize or dematerialize or make any change he wished in the cosmic vision. 12-10 \"All creation is governed by law,\" Sr i Yukteswar concluded. \"The ones which manifest in the outer universe, discoverab le by scientists, are called natural laws. But there are subtler laws ruling the realms of consciousness which can be known only through the inner science of yoga. The hidden spiritual planes also have their natural and lawful principles of operat ion. It is not the physical scientist but"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"the fully self-realized master who comprehends the true nature of matter. Thus Christ was able to restore the servant's ea r after it had been severed by one of the disciples.\" 12-11 Sri Yukteswar was a peerless interpreter of the scriptures. Many of my happiest memories are centered in his discourses. But his jeweled thoughts were not cast into ashes of heedlessness or stupidity. One restless movement of my body, or my slight lapse into absent- mindedness, suffice d to put an abrupt period to Master's exposition. \"You are not here.\" Master interrup ted himself one afternoon with this disclosure. As usual, he was keeping tr ack of my attention with a devastating immediacy. \"Guruji!\" My tone was a protest. \"I have no t stirred; my eyelids have not moved; I can repeat each word you have uttered!\" \"Nevertheless you were not fully with me. Your objection forces me to remark that in your mental background you were creating three institutions. One was a sylvan retreat on a plain, another on a hilltop, a third by the ocean.\" Those vaguely formulated thoughts had indeed been present almost subconsciously. I glanced at him apologetically. \"What can I do with such a master, wh o penetrates my random musings?\""},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" Main building at the Mount Washington Estates in Los Angeles, establis hed in 1925 as American headquarters for the Se lf- Realization Fellowship. Self-Realiz ation Churc h of All Re ligions, Hollywood, California. \"You have given me that right. The su btle tr uths I am e xpounding cannot be grasped without your c omplete concentrati on. Unless n ecessary I do not invade the seclusi on of others' minds. Man has th e natural privilege of ro aming secretly among his thoughts. T he unbidden Lord does not enter there; neither do I venture intrusion.\" \"You are ever welcome, Master!\" \"Your architectural dreams will materializ e later. Now is the time for study!\""},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Thus incidentally my guru revealed in his simple way the coming of three great events in my life. Since early youth I had had enigmatic glimpses of three buildings, each in a different setting. In the exact sequence Sri Yukteswar had indicated, these visions took ultimate form. First came my founding of a boys' yoga school on a Ranchi plain, then my American headquarters on a Los Angeles hilltop, finally a hermitage in southern California by the vast Pacific. Master never arrogantly asserted: \"I prop hesy that such and such an event shall occur!\" He would rather hint: \"Don't yo u think it may happen?\" But his simple speech hid vatic power. There was no reca nting; never did his slightly veiled words prove false. Sri Yukteswar was reserved and matter-of-fact in demeanor. There was naught of the vague or daft visionary about him. His f eet were firm on the earth, his head in the haven of heaven. Practical people ar oused his admiration. \"Saintliness is not dumbness! Divine perceptions are not incapa citating!\" he would say. \"The active expression of virtue gives rise to the keenest intelligence.\" In Master's life I fully discovered the cleavage between spiritual realism and the obscure mysticism that spuriously passes as a counterpart. My guru was reluctant to discuss the superphysical realms. His only \"marvelous\" aura was one of perfect simplicity. In conversation he avoided startling references; in action he was freely expressive. Others talked of miracles but could manifest nothing; Sri Yukteswar seldom mentioned the subtle laws but secretly operated them at will. \"A man of realization does not perform any miracle until he receives an inward sanction,\" Master explained. \"God does not wish the secrets of His creation revealed promiscuously. 12-12 Also, every individual in the world has inalienable right to his free will. A sa int will not encroach upon that independence.\" The silence habitual to Sri Yukteswar was caused by his deep perceptions of the Infinite. No time remained for the inte rminable \"revelations\" that occupy the days of teachers without self- realizat ion. \"In shallow men the fish of little"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"thoughts cause much commotion. In ocean ic minds the whales of inspiration make hardly a ruffle.\" This observation fr om the Hindu scriptures is not without discerning humor. Because of my guru's unspectacular gu ise, only a few of his contemporaries recognized him as a superman. The popula r adage: \"He is a fool that cannot conceal his wisdom,\" could never be applied to Sri Yukteswar. Though born a mortal like all others, Master had achiev ed identity with the Ruler of time and space. In his life I perceived a godlike unity. He had not found any insuperable obstacle to mergence of human with Divi ne. No such barrier exists, I came to understand, save in man's spiritual unadventurousness. I always thrilled at the touch of Sri Yukteswar's holy feet. Yogis teach that a disciple is spiritually magnetized by re verent contact with a master; a subtle current is generated. The devotee's undesirable habit-mechanisms in the brain are often cauterized; the groove of his worl dly tendencies beneficially disturbed. Momentarily at least he may find the secret veils of maya lifting, and glimpse the reality of bliss. My whole body responded with a liberating glow whenever I knelt in the Indian fashion before my guru. \"Even when Lahiri Mahasaya was silent,\" Master told me, \"or when he conversed on other than strictly religious topics , I discovered that nonetheless he had transmitted to me ineffable knowledge.\" Sri Yukteswar affected me similarly. If I entered the hermitage in a worried or indifferent frame of mind, my attitude imperceptibly changed. A healing calm descended at mere sight of my guru. Ever y day with him was a new experience in joy, peace, and wisdom. Never did I find him deluded or intoxicated with greed or emotion or anger or any human attachment. \"The darkness of maya is silently approaching. Let us hie homeward within.\" With these words at dusk Master constantl y reminded his discip les of their need"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"for Kriya Yoga . A new student occasionally expressed doubts regarding his own worthiness to engage in yoga practice. \"Forget the past,\" Sri Yukteswar would con sole him. \"The vanished lives of all men are dark with many shames. Human conduct is ever unreliable until anchored in the Divine. Everything in future will improve if you are making a spiritual effort now.\" Master always had young chelas 12-13 in his hermitage. Their spiritual and intellectual education was his lifelong inte rest: even shortly before he passed on, he accepted for training two six-year-o ld boys and one youth of sixteen. He directed their minds and lives with that careful discipline in which the word \"disciple\" is etymologically rooted. The ashram residents loved and revered their guru; a slight clap of his hands sufficed to bring them eagerly to his side. When his mood was silent and withdrawn, no one ventured to speak; when his laugh rang jovially, children looked upon him as their own. Master seldom asked others to render him a personal service, nor would he accept help from a student unless the willingness were sincere. My guru quietly washed his clothes if the disciples overl ooked that privileged task. Sri Yukteswar wore the traditional ocher-colored swami robe; his laceless shoes, in accordance with yogi custom, were of tiger or deer skin. Master spoke fluent English, French, Hindi, and Bengali; his Sanskrit was fair. He patiently instructed his young disciples by certain short cuts which he had ingeniously devised for the study of English and Sanskrit. Master was cautious of his body, while withholding solicitous attachment. The Infinite, he pointed out, properly ma nifests through physical and mental soundness. He discountenanced any extremes. A disciple once started a long fast. My guru only laughed: \"Why not throw the dog a bone?\""},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Sri Yukteswar's health was exce llent; I never saw him unwell. 12-14 He permitted students to consult doctors if it seemed advisable. His purpose was to give respect to the worldly custom: \"Physicians must carry on their work of healing through God's laws as applied to matter.\" But he extolled the superiority of mental therapy, and often repeated: \"Wisdom is the greatest cleanser.\" \"The body is a treacherous friend. Give it its due; no more,\" he said. \"Pain and pleasure are transitory; endure all dualities with calmness, while trying at the same time to remove their hold. Imaginat ion is the door through which disease as well as healing enters. Disbelieve in the re ality of sickness even when you are ill; an unrecognized visitor will flee!\" Master numbered many doctors among hi s disciples. \"Those who have ferreted out the physical laws can easily investigat e the science of the soul,\" he told them. \"A subtle spiritual mechanism is hidde n just behind the bodily structure.\" 12-15 Sri Yukteswar counseled his students to be living liaisons of Western and Eastern virtues. Himself an executive Occidental in outer habits, inwardly he was the spiritual Oriental. He praised the progressi ve, resourceful and hygienic habits of the West, and the religious ideals which give a centuried halo to the East. Discipline had not been unknown to me: at home Father was strict, Ananta often severe. But Sri Yukteswar's training cannot be described as other than drastic. A perfectionist, my guru was hypercritical of his disciples, whether in matters of moment or in the subtle nuances of behavior. \"Good manners without sincerity are like a beautiful dead lady,\" he remarked on suitable occasion. \"Straightforwardness without civility is like a surgeon's knife, effective but unpleasant. Candor with courtesy is helpful and admirable.\" Master was apparently satisfied with my spiritual progress, for he seldom referred to it; in other matters my ears were no strangers to reproof. My chief"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"offenses were absentmindedness, interm ittent indulgence in sad moods, non- observance of certain rules of etique tte, and occasional unmethodical ways. \"Observe how the activities of your father Bhagabati are well- organized and balanced in every way,\" my guru poin ted out. The two disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya had met, soon after I began my pilgrimages to Serampore. Father and Sri Yukteswar admiringly evaluated the othe r's worth. Both had built an inner life of spiritual granite, insoluble against the ages. From transient teachers of my earlier li fe I had imbibed a few erroneous lessons. A chela , I was told, need not concern himsel f strenuously over worldly duties; when I had neglected or carelessly perf ormed my tasks, I was not chastised. Human nature finds such instruction very easy of assimilation. Under Master's unsparing rod, however, I soon recovered from the agreeable delusions of irresponsibility. \"Those who are too good for this world are adorning some other,\" Sri Yukteswar remarked. \"So long as you breathe the free air of earth, you are under obligation to render grateful service. He alone wh o has fully mastered the breathless state 12- 16 is freed from cosmic imperatives. I will not fail to let you know when you have attained the final perfection.\" My guru could never be bribed, even by lo ve. He showed no leniency to anyone who, like myself, willingly offered to be his disciple. Whether Master and I were surrounded by his students or by stranger s, or were alone together, he always spoke plainly and upbraided sharply. No trifling lapse into shallowness or inconsistency escaped his rebuke. This fl attening treatment was hard to endure, but my resolve was to allow Sri Yukteswar to iron out each of my psychological kinks. As he labored at this titanic tr ansformation, I shook many times under the weight of his disciplinary hammer."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"\"If you don't like my words, you are at liberty to leave at any time,\" Master assured me. \"I want nothing from you but your own improvement. Stay only if you feel benefited.\" For every humbling blow he dealt my vani ty, for every tooth in my metaphorical jaw he knocked loose with stunning aim, I am grateful beyond any facility of expression. The hard core of human egotis m is hardly to be dislodged except rudely. With its departure, the Divine find s at last an unobstructed channel. In vain It seeks to percolate through flinty hearts of selfishness. Sri Yukteswar's wisdom was so penetratin g that, heedless of remarks, he often replied to one's unspoken observation. \"What a person imagines he hears, and what the speaker has really implied, may be poles apart,\" he said. \"Try to feel the thoughts behind the confusion of men's verbiage.\" But divine insight is painful to worldly ears; Master was not popular with superficial students. The wise, always few in number, deeply revered him. I daresay Sri Yukteswar would have been the most sought- after guru in India had his words not been so candid and so censorious. \"I am hard on those who come for my trai ning,\" he admitted to me. \"That is my way; take it or leave it. I will never com promise. But you will be much kinder to your disciples; that is your way. I try to purify only in the fires of severity, searing beyond the average toleration. The gentle approach of love is also transfiguring. The inflexible and the yielding methods are equally effective if applied with wisdom. You will go to foreign lands, wh ere blunt assaults on the ego are not appreciated. A teacher could not spread India's message in the West without an ample fund of accommodative patience and forbearance.\" I refuse to state the amount of truth I later came to find in Master's words! Though Sri Yukteswar's undissembling speech prevented a large following during his years on earth, neverthe less his living spirit manifests today over the world,"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"through sincere students of his Kriya Yoga and other teachings. He has further dominion in men's souls than ever Alexander dreamed of in the soil. Father arrived one day to pay his respec ts to Sri Yukteswar. My parent expected, very likely, to hear some words in my praise. He was shocked to be given a long account of my imperfections. It was Master's practice to recount simple, negligible shortcomings with an air of po rtentous gravity. Father rushed to see me. \"From your guru's remarks I thought to find you a complete wreck!\" My parent was between tears and laughter. The only cause of Sri Yukteswar's disple asure at the time was that I had been trying, against his gentle hint, to convert a certain man to the spiritual path. With indignant speed I sought out my guru . He received me with downcast eyes, as though conscious of guilt. It was the only time I ever saw the divine lion meek before me. The unique moment was savored to the full. \"Sir, why did you judge me so mercilessly before my astounded father? Was that just?\" \"I will not do it again.\" Mast er's tone was apologetic. Instantly I was disarmed. How readily th e great man admitted his fault! Though he never again upset Father's peace of mind, Master relentlessly continued to dissect me whenever and wherever he chose. New disciples often joined Sri Yukteswar in exhaustive criticism of others. Wise like the guru! Models of flawless discri mination! But he who takes the offensive must not be defenseless. The same carping students fled precipitantly as soon as Master publicly unloosed in their direction a few shafts from his analytical quiver. \"Tender inner weaknesses, revolting at mild touches of censure, are like diseased parts of the body, recoiling before ev en delicate handling.\" This was Sri Yukteswar's amused comment on the flighty ones."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"There are disciples who seek a guru made in their own image. Such students often complained that they did not understand Sri Yukteswar. \"Neither do you comprehend God!\" I retorted on one occasion. \"When a saint is clear to you, you will be one.\" Among th e trillion mysteries, breathing every second the inexplicable air, who may venture to ask that the fathomless nature of a master be instantly grasped? Students came, and generally went. Those who craved a path of oily sympathy and comfortable recognitions did not find it at the hermitage. Master offered shelter and shepherding for the aeons, b ut many disciples miserly demanded ego- balm as well. They departed, preferring life's countless humi liations before any humility. Master's blazing rays, the open penetrating sunshine of his wisdom, were too powerful for their spiritual si ckness. They sought some lesser teacher who, shading them with flattery, perm itted the fitful sleep of ignorance. During my early months with Master, I had experienced a sensitive fear of his reprimands. These were reserved, I soon saw, for disciples who had asked for his verbal vivisection. If any writhing stud ent made a protest, Sri Yukteswar would become unoffendedly silent. His words were never wrathful, but impersonal with wisdom. Master's insight was not for the unprepared ears of casual visitors; he seldom remarked on their defects, even if consp icuous. But toward students who sought his counsel, Sri Yukteswar felt a serious responsibility. Brave indeed is the guru who undertakes to transform the crude or e of ego-permeated humanity! A saint's courage roots in his compassion for th e stumbling eyeless of this world. When I had abandoned underlying resentment, I found a marked decrease in my chastisement. In a very subtle way, Mast er melted into comparative clemency. In time I demolished every wall of ration alization and subconscious reservation behind which the human personality generally shields itself. 12-17 The reward was an effortless harmony with my guru. I discovered him then to be trusting,"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"considerate, and silently loving. Undemo nstrative, however, he bestowed no word of affection. My own temperament is principally devotion al. It was disconcerting at first to find that my guru, saturated with jnana but seemingly dry of bhakti , 12-18 expressed himself only in terms of cold spiritual mathematics. But as I tuned myself to his nature, I discovered no diminution but rather increase in my devotional approach to God. A self-reali zed master is fully able to guide his various disciples along natural li nes of their essential bias. My relationship with Sri Yukteswar, somewhat inarticulate, nonetheless possessed all eloquence. Often I found hi s silent signature on my thoughts, rendering speech inutile. Quietly sitting be side him, I felt his bounty pouring peacefully over my being. Sri Yukteswar's impartial justice was no tably demonstrated during the summer vacation of my first college year. I welcomed the opportunity to spend uninterrupted months at Serampore with my guru. \"You may be in charge of the hermitage.\" Master was pleased over my enthusiastic arrival. \"Your duties will be the reception of guests, and supervision of the work of the other disciples.\" Kumar, a young villager from east Bengal, was accepted a fortnight later for hermitage training. Remarkably intelli gent, he quickly won Sri Yukteswar's affection. For some unfathomable reason, Master was very lenient to the new resident. \"Mukunda, let Kumar assume your duties . Employ your own time in sweeping and cooking.\" Master issued these instructions after the new boy had been with us for a month. Exalted to leadership, Kumar exercised a petty household tyranny. In silent mutiny, the other disciples continued to seek me out for daily counsel."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"\"Mukunda is impossible! You made me su pervisor, yet the others go to him and obey him.\" Three weeks later Kumar was complaining to our guru. I overheard him from an adjoining room. \"That's why I assigned him to the kitchen and you to the parlor.\" Sri Yukteswar's withering tones were new to Kumar. \"In th is way you have come to realize that a worthy leader has the desire to serv e, and not to dominate. You wanted Mukunda's position, but could not maintain it by merit. Return now to your earlier work as cook's assistant.\" After this humbling incident, Master resumed toward Kumar a former attitude of unwonted indulgence. Who can solve the mystery of attraction? In Kumar our guru discovered a charming fount which did not spurt for the fellow disciples. Though the new boy was obviously Sri Yuk teswar's favorite, I felt no dismay. Personal idiosyncrasies, possessed even by masters, lend a rich complexity to the pattern of life. My nature is seldom commandeered by a detail; I was seeking from Sri Yukteswar a more inaccessibl e benefit than an outward praise. Kumar spoke venomously to me one day without reason; I was deeply hurt. \"Your head is swelling to the bursting po int!\" I added a warning whose truth I felt intuitively: \"Unless you mend your ways, someday you will be asked to leave this ashram.\" Laughing sarcastically, Kumar repeated my remark to our guru, who had just entered the room. Fully expecting to be scolded, I retired meekly to a corner. \"Maybe Mukunda is right.\" Master's reply to the boy came with unusual coldness. I escaped without castigation. A year later, Kumar set out for a visit to his childhood home. He ignored the quiet disapproval of Sri Yukteswar, who never a uthoritatively controlled his disciples' movements. On the boy's return to Sera mpore in a few months, a change was unpleasantly apparent. Gone was the stat ely Kumar with serenely glowing face."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Only an undistinguished peasant stood be fore us, one who had lately acquired a number of evil habits. Master summoned me and brokenheartedly discussed the fact that the boy was now unsuited to the monastic hermitage life. \"Mukunda, I will leave it to you to instruct Kumar to leave the ashram tomorrow; I can't do it!\" Tears stood in Sri Yukte swar's eyes, but he controlled himself quickly. \"The boy would never have fallen to these depths had he listened to me and not gone away to mix with undesi rable companions. He has rejected my protection; the callous world must be his guru still.\" Kumar's departure brought me no elation; sadly I wondered how one with power to win a master's love could ever respond to cheaper allures. Enjoyment of wine and sex are rooted in the natural man, and require no delicacies of perception for their appreciation. Sense wiles are comparable to the evergreen oleander, fragrant with its multicolored flowers: every part of the plant is poisonous. The land of healing lies within, radiant wi th that happiness blindly sought in a thousand misdirections. 12-19 \"Keen intelligence is two-edged,\" Master once remarked in reference to Kumar's brilliant mind. \"It may be used constructively or destructively like a knife, either to cut the boil of ignorance, or to deca pitate one's self. Intelligence is rightly guided only after the mind has acknowledged the inescapability of spiritual law.\" My guru mixed freely with men and women di sciples, treating all as his children. Perceiving their soul equality, he sh owed no distinction or partiality. \"In sleep, you do not know whether you are a man or a woman,\" he said. \"Just as a man, impersonating a woman, does not become one, so the soul, impersonating both man and woman, has no sex. The soul is the pure, changeless image of God.\""},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Sri Yukteswar never avoided or blamed women as objects of seduction. Men, he said, were also a temptation to women. I once inquired of my guru why a great ancient saint had called wome n \"the door to hell.\" \"A girl must have proved very troublesome to his peace of mind in his early life,\" my guru answered causticly. \"Otherwise he would have denounced, not woman, but some imperfection in his own self-control.\" If a visitor dared to relate a suggestive story in the hermitage, Master would maintain an unresponsive silence. \"Do no t allow yourself to be thrashed by the provoking whip of a beautiful face,\" he to ld the disciples. \"How can sense slaves enjoy the world? Its subtle flavors escape them while they grovel in primal mud. All nice discriminations are lost to the man of elemental lusts.\" Students seeking to escape from the dualistic maya delusion received from Sri Yukteswar patient and understanding counsel. \"Just as the purpose of eating is to satisf y hunger, not greed, so the sex instinct is designed for the propagation of the specie s according to natural law, never for the kindling of insatiable longings,\" he sa id. \"Destroy wrong desires now; otherwise they will follow you after the astral body is torn from its physical casing. Even when the flesh is weak, the mind should be constantly resistant. If temptation assails you with cruel force, overcome it by impersonal anal ysis and indomitable will. Every natural passion can be mastered. \"Conserve your powers. Be like the ca pacious ocean, absorbing within all the tributary rivers of the senses. Small year nings are openings in the reservoir of your inner peace, permitting healing waters to be wasted in the desert soil of materialism. The forceful activating im pulse of wrong desire is the greatest enemy to the happiness of man. Roam in th e world as a lion of self-control; see that the frogs of weakness don't kick you around.\""},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The devotee is finally freed from all in stinctive compulsions. He transforms his need for human affection into aspiration for God alone, a love solitary because omnipresent. Sri Yukteswar's mother lived in the Rana Mahal district of Benares where I had first visited my guru. Gracious and kind ly, she was yet a woman of very decided opinions. I stood on her balcony one day and watched mother and son talking together. In his quiet, sensible way, Master was trying to convince her about something. He was apparently unsuccess ful, for she shook her head with great vigor. \"Nay, nay, my son, go away now! Your wise words are not for me! I am not your disciple!\" Sri Yukteswar backed away without further argument, like a scolded child. I was touched at his great respect for his mother even in her unreasonable moods. She saw him only as her little boy, not as a sage. There was a charm about the trifling incident; it supplied a sidelight on my guru's unusual nature, inwardly humble and outwardly unbendable. The monastic regulations do not allow a swami to retain connection with worldly ties after their formal severance. He ca nnot perform the ceremonial family rites which are obligatory on the householder. Yet Shankara, the ancient founder of the Swami Order, disregarded the injunc tions. At the death of his beloved mother, he cremated her body with heaven ly fire which he caused to spurt from his upraised hand. Sri Yukteswar also ignored the restrictions, in a fashion less spectacular. When his mother passed on, he arranged the crem atory services by the holy Ganges in Benares, and fed many Brahmins in conformance with age-old custom. The shastric prohibitions were intended to help swamis overcome narrow identifications. Shankara and Sri Yuktesw ar had wholly merged their beings in"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"the Impersonal Spirit; they needed no rescue by rule. Sometimes, too, a master purposely ignores a canon in order to uphold its principle as superior to and independent of form. Thus Jesus plucked ea rs of corn on the day of rest. To the inevitable critics he said: \"The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.\" 12-20 Outside of the scriptures, seldom was a b ook honored by Sri Yukteswar's perusal. Yet he was invariably acquainted with th e latest scientific discoveries and other advancements of knowledge. A brilli ant conversationalist, he enjoyed an exchange of views on countless topics wi th his guests. My guru's ready wit and rollicking laugh enlivened every discu ssion. Often grave, Master was never gloomy. \"To seek the Lord, one need not disfigure his face,\" he would remark. \"Remember that finding God will me an the funeral of all sorrows.\" Among the philosophers, professors, lawy ers and scientists who came to the hermitage, a number arrived for their first visit with the expectation of meeting an orthodox religionist. A supercilious smile or a glance of amused tolerance occasionally betrayed that the newcomer s anticipated nothing more than a few pious platitudes. Yet their reluctant departure would bring an expressed conviction that Sri Yukteswar had shown precise insight into their specialized fields. My guru ordinarily was gentle and affabl e to guests; his welcome was given with charming cordiality. Yet inveterate egot ists sometimes suffered an invigorating shock. They confronted in Master either a frigid indifference or a formidable opposition: ice or iron! A noted chemist once crossed swords with Sri Yukteswar. The visitor would not admit the existence of God, inasmuch as science has devised no means of detecting Him. \"So you have inexplicably failed to isolat e the Supreme Power in your test tubes!\" Master's gaze was stern. \"I recommend an unheard-of experiment. Examine your"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"thoughts unremittingly for twenty-four hours. Then wonder no longer at God's absence.\" A celebrated pundit received a similar jo lt. With ostentatious zeal, the scholar shook the ashram rafters with scriptural lore. Resounding passages poured from the Mahabharata , the Upanishads , 12-21 the Bhasyas 12-22 of Shankara. \"I am waiting to hear you.\" Sri Yukteswa r's tone was inquiring, as though utter silence had reigned. The pundit was puzzled. \"Quotations there have been, in superabu ndance.\" Master's words convulsed me with mirth, as I squatted in my corner, at a respectful distance from the visitor. \"But what original commentary can you supply, from the uniqueness of your particular life? What holy text have you absorbed and made your own? In what ways have these timeless tr uths renovated your nature? Are you content to be a hollow victrola, mechanically repe ating the words of other men?\" \"I give up!\" The scholar's chagrin was com ical. \"I have no inner realization.\" For the first time, perhaps, he underst ood that discerning placement of the comma does not atone for a spiritual coma. \"These bloodless pedants smell unduly of the lamp,\" my guru remarked after the departure of the chastened one. \"They prefer philosophy to be a gentle intellectual setting-up exercise. Their elev ated thoughts are carefully unrelated either to the crudity of outward action or to any scourging inner discipline!\" Master stressed on other occasions the futility of mere book learning. \"Do not confuse understanding with a larger vocabulary,\" he remarked. \"Sacred writings are beneficial in stimulating desire for inward realization, if one stanza at a time is slowly assimilated. Continua l intellectual study results in vanity and the false satisfaction of an undigested knowledge.\""},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Sri Yukteswar related one of his own expe riences in scriptural edification. The scene was a forest hermitage in eastern Bengal, where he observed the procedure of a renowned teacher, Dabru Ballav. Hi s method, at once simple and difficult, was common in ancient India. Dabru Ballav had gathered his disciples around him in the sylvan solitudes. The holy Bhagavad Gita was open before them. Steadfastly they looked at one passage for half an hour, then closed th eir eyes. Another half hour slipped away. The master gave a brief comment. Motionless, they meditated again for an hour. Finally the guru spoke. \"Have you understood?\" \"Yes, sir.\" One in the group ventured this assertion. \"No; not fully. Seek the spiritual vitality that has given these words the power to rejuvenate India century after century.\" An other hour disappeared in silence. The master dismissed the students, and turned to Sri Yukteswar. \"Do you know the Bhagavad Gita ?\" \"No, sir, not really; though my eyes an d mind have run through its pages many times.\" \"Thousands have replied to me differently !\" The great sage smiled at Master in blessing. \"If one busies himself with an outer display of scriptural wealth, what time is left for silent inward divi ng after the priceless pearls?\" Sri Yukteswar directed the study of hi s own disciples by the same intensive method of one-pointedness. \"Wisdom is not assimilated with the eyes, but with the atoms,\" he said. \"When your conviction of a truth is not merely in your brain but in your being, you may diffidently vouch for its meaning.\" He discouraged any tendency a student might have to construe book-knowledge as a necessary step to spiritual realization."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"\"The rishis wrote in one sentence profundities that commentating scholars busy themselves over for generations,\" he remarked. \"Endless literary controversy is for sluggard minds. What more liberating thought than 'God is'-nay, 'God'?\" But man does not easily return to simpli city. It is seldom \"God\" for him, but rather learned pomposities. His ego is plea sed, that he can grasp such erudition. Men who were pridefully conscious of hi gh worldly position were likely, in Master's presence, to add humility to th eir other possessions. A local magistrate once arrived for an interview at the seas ide hermitage in Puri. The man, who held a reputation for ruthlessness, had it well within his power to oust us from the ashram. I cautioned my guru about the despotic possibilities. But he seated himself with an uncompromising air, and di d not rise to greet the visitor. Slightly nervous, I squatted near the door. The ma n had to content himself with a wooden box; my guru did not request me to fetc h a chair. There was no fulfillment of the magistrate's obvious expectation that his importance would be ceremoniously acknowledged. A metaphysical discussion ensued. The guest blundered through misinterpretations of the scriptures. As his accuracy sank, his ire rose. \"Do you know that I stood first in the M. A. examination?\" Reason had forsaken him, but he could still shout. \"Mr. Magistrate, you forget that this is not your courtroom,\" Master replied evenly. \"From your childish remarks I would have surmised that your college career was unremarkable. A university degr ee, in any case, is not remotely related to Vedic realization. Saints are not produced in batches every semester like accountants.\" After a stunned silence, the visitor laughed heartily."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"\"This is my first encounter with a heavenly magistrate,\" he said. Later he made a formal request, couched in the legal terms which were evidently part and parcel of his being, to be accepted as a \"probationary\" disciple. My guru personally attended to the detail s connected with the management of his property. Unscrupulous persons on various occasions attempted to secure possession of Master's ancestral land . With determination and even by instigating lawsuits, Sri Yukteswar o utwitted every opponent. He underwent these painful experiences from a desire never to be a begging guru, or a burden on his disciples. His financial independence was one reason why my alarmingly outspoken Master was innocent of the cunnings of diplomac y. Unlike those teachers who have to flatter their supporters, my guru was imperv ious to the influences, open or subtle, of others' wealth. Never did I hear him ask or even hint for money for any purpose. His hermitage training was give n free and freely to all disciples. An insolent court deputy arrived one day at the Serampore ashram to serve Sri Yukteswar with a legal summons. A disciple named Kanai and myself were also present. The officer's attitude toward Master was offensive. \"It will do you good to leave the shad ows of your hermitage and breathe the honest air of a courtroom.\" The dep uty grinned contemptuously. I could not contain myself. \"Another word of your impudence and you will be on the floor!\" I advanced threateningly. \"You wretch!\" Kanai's shout was simult aneous with my own. \"Dare you bring your blasphemies into this sacred ashram?\" But Master stood protectingly in front of his abuser. \"Don't get excited over nothing. This man is only doing his rightful duty.\""},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The officer, dazed at his varying receptio n, respectfully offered a word of apology and sped away. Amazing it was to find that a master wi th such a fiery will could be so calm within. He fitted the Vedic definition of a man of God: \"Softer than the flower, where kindness is concerned; stronger than the thunder, where principles are at stake.\" There are always those in this world who, in Browning's words, \"endure no light, being themselves obscure.\" An outsider occasionally berated Sri Yukteswar for an imaginary grievance. My imperturbable guru listened politely, analyzing himself to see if any shred of truth lay within the denunciation. These scenes would bring to my mind one of Master's inimitable observations: \"Some people try to be tall by cutting off the heads of others!\" The unfailing composure of a saint is impressive beyond any sermon. \"He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.\" 12-23 I often reflected that my majestic Master could easily have been an emperor or world-shaking warrior had his mind been centered on fame or worldly achievement. He had chosen instead to storm those inner citadels of wrath and egotism whose fall is the height of a man. 12-1: \"Worship of Durga.\" This is the chief festiv al of the Bengali year and lasts for nine days around the end of September. Immediately following is the ten-day festival of Dashahara (\"the One who removes ten sins\"-three of body, three of mind, four of speech). Both pujas are sacred to Durga, literally \"the Inaccessible ,\" an aspect of Divine Mother, Shakti, the female creative force personified. 12-2: Sri Yukteswar was born on May 10, 1855. 12-3: Yukteswar means \"united to God.\" Giri is a classificatory distinction of one of the ten ancient Swami branches. Sri means \"holy\"; it is not a name but a title of respect."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"12-4: Literally, \"to direct together.\" Samadhi is a superconscious state of ecstasy in which the yogi perceives the identity of soul and Spirit. 12-5: Snoring, according to physiologists, is an indication of utter rela xation (to the oblivious practitioner, solely). 12-6: Dhal is a thick soup made from split peas or other pulses. Channa is a cheese of fresh curdled milk, cut into squares and curried with potatoes. 12-7: The omnipresent powers of a yogi, whereby he sees, hears, tastes, smells, and feels his oneness in creation without the use of sensory organs, have been described as follows in the Taittiriya Aranyaka : \"The blind man pierced the pearl; the fingerless put a thread into it; the neckless wore it; and the tongueless praised it.\" 12-8: The cobra swiftly strikes at any moving object within its range. Complete immobility is usually one's sole hope of safety. 12-9: Lahiri Mahasaya actually sa id \"Priya\" (first or given name), not \"Yukteswar\" (monastic name, not received by my guru during Lahiri Mahasaya's lifetime). (See page 109 .) \"Yukteswar\" is substituted here, and in a few other places in this book, in order to avoid the confusion, to reader, of two names. 12-10: \"Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\"- Mark 11:24.

Led by French scientists of the Sorbonne, Western thinkers are beginning to investigate the possibility of divine perception in man. \"For the past twenty years, students of psycholo gy, influenced by Freud, gave all their time to searching the subconscious realms,\" Rabbi Israel H. Levinthal po inted out in 1929. \"I t is true that the subconscious reveals much of the mystery that can explain human actions, but not all of our actions. It can explain the abnormal, but not deeds that are above the normal. The latest psychology, sponsored by the French schools, has discovered a new region in man, which it terms the superconscious. In contrast to the subconscious which represents the submerged currents of our nature, it reveals the heights to which our nature can reach. Man represents a triple, not a double, personality; our conscious and su bconscious being is crowned by a superconsciousness. Many years ago the English psychologist, F. W. H. Myers, suggested that 'hidden in the deep of our being is a rubbish heap as well as a treasure house.' In contrast to the psychology that centers all its researches on the subconscious in man's nature, this new psychology of the superconscious focuses its attention upon the treasure-house, the region that alone can explain the great, unselfish, heroic deeds of men.\" 12-18: Jnana , wisdom, and bhakti , devotion: two of the main paths to God. 12-19: \"Man in his waking state puts forth innume rable efforts for experiencing sensual pleasures; when the entire group of sensory organs is fatigued, he forgets even the pleasure on hand and goes to sleep in order to enjoy rest in the soul, hi s own nature,\" Shankara, the great Vedantist, has written. \"Ultra-sensual bliss is thus extremely easy of attainment and is far superior to sense delights which always end in disgust.\" 12-20: Mark 2:27. 12-21: The Upanishads or Vedanta (literally, \"end of the Vedas\"), occur in certain parts of the Vedas as essential summaries. The Upanishads furnish the doctrinal basis of the Hindu religion. They received the following tribute from Schopenhauer: \"How entirely does the Upanishad breathe throughout the holy spirit of the Vedas !

I hope in unbroken solitude to achieve continuous divine communion.\" I actually once addressed these ungrateful words to my Master. Seized by one of the unpredictable delusions which occasionally assail the devotee, I felt a growing impatience with hermitage duties and college studies. A feebly extenuating circumstance is that my proposal was made when I had been only six months with Sri Yukteswar. Not yet had I fully surveyed his towering stature. \"Many hillmen live in the Hi malayas, yet possess no God-perception.\" My guru's answer came slowly and simply. \"Wis dom is better sought from a man of realization than from an inert mountain.\" Ignoring Master's plain hint that he, and not a hill, was my teacher, I repeated my plea. Sri Yukteswar vouchsafed no reply. I took his silence for consent, a precarious interpretation readily accepted at one's convenience. In my Calcutta home that evening, I busied myself with travel preparations. Tying a few articles inside a blanket, I reme mbered a similar bundle, surreptitiously dropped from my attic window a few years ea rlier. I wondered if this were to be another ill-starred flight toward the Himala yas. The first time my spiritual elation had been high; tonight conscience smote heavily at thought of leaving my guru."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The following morning I sought out Behari Pundit, my Sanskrit professor at Scottish Church College. \"Sir, you have told me of your friendship with a great disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya. Please give me his address.\" \"You mean Ram Gopal Muzumdar. I call hi m the 'sleepless saint.' He is always awake in an ecstatic consciousness. His home is at Ranbajpur, near Tarakeswar.\" I thanked the pundit, and entrained immediately for Tarakeswar. I hoped to silence my misgivings by wringing a sancti on from the \"sleepless saint\" to engage myself in lonely Himalayan meditation. Behari's friend, I heard, had received illumination after many years of Kriya Yoga practice in isolated caves. At Tarakeswar I approached a famous sh rine. Hindus regard it with the same veneration that Catholics give to the Lourdes sanctuary in France. Innumerable healing miracles have occurred at Tarakeswar, including one for a member of my family. \"I sat in the temple there for a week,\" my eldest aunt once told me. \"Observing a complete fast, I prayed for the recovery of your Uncle Sarada from a chronic malady. On the seventh day I found a herb materialized in my hand! I made a brew from the leaves, and gave it to your uncle. His disease vanished at once, and has never reappeared.\" I entered the sacred Tarakeswar shrine ; the altar contains nothing but a round stone. Its circumference, beginningless and endless, makes it aptly significant of the Infinite. Cosmic abstractions are not alien even to the humblest Indian peasant; he has been accused by Westerners , in fact, of living on abstractions! My own mood at the moment was so austere that I felt disinclined to bow before the stone symbol. God should be sought, I reflected, only within the soul."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"I left the temple without genuflection and walked briskly toward the outlying village of Ranbajpur. My appeal to a passe r-by for guidance caused him to sink into long cogitation. \"When you come to a crossroad, turn right and keep going,\" he finally pronounced oracularly. Obeying the directions, I wended my way alongside the banks of a canal. Darkness fell; the outskirts of the jungle village were alive with winking fireflies and the howls of near-by jackals. The moonlight was too faint to supply any reassurance; I stumbled on for two hours. Welcome clang of a cowbell! My repeated shouts eventually brought a peasant to my side. \"I am looking for Ram Gopal Babu.\" \"No such person lives in our village.\" The man's tone was surly. \"You are probably a lying detective.\" Hoping to allay suspicion in his politica lly troubled mind, I touchingly explained my predicament. He took me to his ho me and offered a hospitable welcome. \"Ranbajpur is far from here,\" he remark ed. \"At the crossroad, you should have turned left, not right.\" My earlier informant, I thought sadly, was a distinct menace to travelers. After a relishable meal of coarse rice, lentil- dhal , and curry of potatoes with raw bananas, I retired to a small hut adjoinin g the courtyard. In the distance, villagers were singing to the loud accompaniment of mridangas 13-1 and cymbals. Sleep was inconsiderable that night; I prayed deep ly to be directed to the secret yogi, Ram Gopal."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"As the first streaks of dawn penetrated th e fissures of my dark room, I set out for Ranbajpur. Crossing rough paddy fields, I trudged over sickled stumps of the prickly plant and mounds of dried clay. An occasionally-met peasant would inform me, invariably, that my destination was \"only a krosha (two miles).\" In six hours the sun traveled victoriously from horizon to meridian, but I began to feel that I would ever be dist ant from Ranbajpur by one krosha . At midafternoon my world was still an endl ess paddy field. Heat pouring from the avoidless sky was bringing me to near-co llapse. As a man approached at leisurely pace, I hardly dared utter my usual question, lest it summon the monotonous: \"Just a krosha .\" The stranger halted beside me. Short and slight, he was physically unimpressive save for an extraordinary pair of piercing dark eyes. \"I was planning to leave Ranbajpur, b ut your purpose was good, so I awaited you.\" He shook his finger in my astounde d face. \"Aren't you clever to think that, unannounced, you could pounce on me? Th at professor Behari had no right to give you my address.\" Considering that introduction of myself would be mere verbosity in the presence of this master, I stood speechless, some what hurt at my reception. His next remark was abruptly put. \"Tell me; where do you think God is?\" \"Why, He is within me and everywhere.\" I doubtless looked as bewildered as I felt. \"All-pervading, eh?\" The saint chuckled. \"T hen why, young sir, did you fail to bow before the Infinite in the stone symbol at the Tarakeswar temple yesterday? 13-2 Your pride caused you the punishment of being misdirected by the passer-by who was not bothered by fine distinctions of left and right. Today, too, you have had a fairly uncomfortable time of it!\""},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"I agreed wholeheartedly, wonder-struck th at an omniscient eye hid within the unremarkable body before me. Healing strength emanated from the yogi; I was instantly refreshed in the scorching field. \"The devotee inclines to think his path to God is the only way,\" he said. \"Yoga, through which divinity is found within, is doubtless the highest road: so Lahiri Mahasaya has told us. But discovering the Lord within, we soon perceive Him without. Holy shrines at Tarakeswar and elsewhere are rightly venerated as nuclear centers of spiritual power.\" The saint's censorious attitude vanished ; his eyes became compassionately soft. He patted my shoulder. \"Young yogi, I see you are running away fr om your master. He has everything you need; you must return to him. Mountain s cannot be your guru.\" Ram Gopal was repeating the same thought which Sri Yukteswar had expressed at our last meeting. \"Masters are under no cosmic compulsi on to limit their residence.\" My companion glanced at me quizzically. \"The Himalayas in India and Tibet have no monopoly on saints. What one does not trouble to find within will not be discovered by transporting the body hith er and yon. As soon as the devotee is willing to go even to the ends of the earth for spiritual enlightenment, his guru appears near-by.\" I silently agreed, recalling my prayer in the Benares hermitage, followed by the meeting with Sri Yukteswar in a crowded lane. \"Are you able to have a little room wher e you can close the door and be alone?\" \"Yes.\" I reflected that this saint descende d from the general to the particular with disconcerting speed."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"\"That is your cave.\" The yogi bestowed on me a gaze of illumi nation which I have never forgotten. \"That is your sacred mo untain. That is where you will find the kingdom of God.\" His simple words instanta neously banished my life long obsession for the Himalayas. In a burning paddy field I awoke from the monticolous dreams of eternal snows. \"Young sir, your divine thirst is laudab le. I feel great love for you.\" Ram Gopal took my hand and led me to a quaint hamlet. The adobe houses were covered with coconut leaves and adorned with rustic entrances. The saint seated me on the umbrageous bamboo platform of his small cottage. After giving me sweetened lime juice and a piece of rock candy, he entered his patio and assumed the lotus posture. In ab out four hours I opened my meditative eyes and saw that the moonlit figure of the yogi was still motionless. As I was sternly reminding my stomach that man do es not live by bread alone, Ram Gopal approached me. \"I see you are famished; food will be ready soon.\" A fire was kindled under a clay oven on the patio; rice and dhal were quickly served on large banana leaves. My host courteously refused my aid in all cooking chores. \"The guest is God,\" a Hindu proverb, has commanded devout observance from time immemorial. In my later world travels, I was charmed to see that a similar respect for visitors is manifested in rural sections of many countries. The city dweller finds the keen edge of ho spitality blunted by superabundance of strange faces. The marts of men seemed remotely dim as I squatted by the yogi in the isolation of the tiny jungle village. The cottage r oom was mysterious with a mellow light. Ram Gopal arranged some torn blankets on the floor for my bed, and seated"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"himself on a straw mat. Overwhelmed by his spiritual magnetism, I ventured a request. \"Sir, why don't you grant me a samadhi ?\" \"Dear one, I would be glad to convey the divine contact, but it is not my place to do so.\" The saint looked at me with half-closed eyes. \"Your master will bestow that experience shortly. Your body is no t tuned just yet. As a small lamp cannot withstand excessive electrical voltage, so your nerves are unready for the cosmic current. If I gave you the infinite ecstas y right now, you would burn as if every cell were on fire. \"You are asking illumination from me,\" the yogi continued musingly, \"while I am wondering-inconsiderable as I am, and with the little meditation I have done-if I have succeeded in pleasing God, and what worth I may find in His eyes at the final reckoning.\" \"Sir, have you not been singleheartedly seeking God for a long time?\" \"I have not done much. Behari must ha ve told you something of my life. For twenty years I occupied a secret grotto, me ditating eighteen hours a day. Then I moved to a more inaccessible cave and remained there for twenty-five years, entering the yoga union for twenty hours daily. I did not need sleep, for I was ever with God. My body was more re sted in the complete calmness of the superconsciousness than it could be by the partial peace of the ordinary subconscious state. \"The muscles relax during sleep, but the he art, lungs, and circulatory system are constantly at work; they get no rest. In superconsciousness, the internal organs remain in a state of suspended animatio n, electrified by the cosmic energy. By such means I have found it unnecessary to sleep for years. The time will come when you too will dispense with sleep.\""},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"\"My goodness, you have medi tated for so long and yet are unsure of the Lord's favor!\" I gazed at him in astonishment. \"Then what about us poor mortals?\" \"Well, don't you see, my dear boy, that Go d is Eternity Itself? To assume that one can fully know Him by forty-five years of meditation is rather a preposterous expectation. Babaji assures us, however, that even a little meditation saves one from the dire fear of death and after-deat h states. Do not fix your spiritual ideal on a small mountain, but hitch it to the st ar of unqualified divine attainment. If you work hard, you will get there.\" Enthralled by the prospect, I asked him for further enlightening words. He related a wondrous story of his first meet ing with Lahiri Mahasaya's guru, Babaji. 13-3 Around midnight Ram Gopal fell into silence, and I lay down on my blankets. Closing my eyes, I saw flashes of lightn ing; the vast space within me was a chamber of molten light. I opened my eyes and observed the same dazzling radiance. The room became a part of th at infinite vault which I beheld with interior vision. \"Why don't you go to sleep?\" \"Sir, how can I sleep in the presence of lightning, blazing whether my eyes are shut or open?\" \"You are blessed to have this experience ; the spiritual radiations are not easily seen.\" The saint added a few words of affection. At dawn Ram Gopal gave me rock candie s and said I must depart. I felt such reluctance to bid him farewell that tears coursed down my cheeks. \"I will not let you go empty-handed.\" The yogi spoke tenderly. \"I will do something for you.\" He smiled and looked at me steadfastly. I stood rooted to the ground, peace rushing like a mighty flood through the gates of my eyes. I was instantaneously"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"healed of a pain in my back, which had troubled me intermittently for years. Renewed, bathed in a sea of luminous jo y, I wept no more. After touching the saint's feet, I sauntered into the jungle, making my way through its tropical tangle until I reached Tarakeswar. There I made a second pilgrimage to the famous shrine, and prostrated myself fully before the altar. The round stone en larged before my inner vision until it became the cosmical spheres, ring within ring, zone after zone, all dowered with divinity. I entrained happily an hour later for Calcutta. My travels ended, not in the lofty mountains, but in the Himalayan presence of my Master. 13-1: Hand-played drums, used only for devotional music. 13-2: One is reminded here of Dostoevski's observation: \"A man who bows down to nothing can never bear the burden of himself.\" 13-3: See chapter 35 . CHAPTER: 14 An Experience In Cosmic Consciousness \"I am here, Guruji.\" My shamefacedness spoke more eloquently for me. \"Let us go to the kitchen and find something to eat.\" Sri Yukteswar's manner was as natural as if hours and not days had separated us. \"Master, I must have disappointed you by my abrupt departure from my duties here; I thought you might be angry with me.\" \"No, of course not! Wrath springs only fr om thwarted desires. I do not expect anything from others, so th eir actions cannot be in oppo sition to wishes of mine."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"I would not use you for my own ends; I am happy only in your own true happiness.\" \"Sir, one hears of divine love in a vague way, but for the first time I am having a concrete example in your angelic self! In th e world, even a father does not easily forgive his son if he leaves his parent's business without warning. But you show not the slightest vexation, though you must have been put to great inconvenience by the many unfinished tasks I left behind.\" We looked into each other's eyes, wher e tears were shining. A blissful wave engulfed me; I was conscious that the Lord, in the form of my guru, was expanding the small ardors of my heart into the incompressible reaches of cosmic love. A few mornings later I made my way to Ma ster's empty sitting room. I planned to meditate, but my laudable purpose was un shared by disobedient thoughts. They scattered like birds before the hunter. \"Mukunda!\" Sri Yukteswar's voice soun ded from a distant inner balcony. I felt as rebellious as my thoughts. \"M aster always urges me to meditate,\" I muttered to myself. \"He should not distur b me when he knows why I came to his room.\" He summoned me again; I remained obstin ately silent. The third time his tone held rebuke. \"Sir, I am meditating,\" I shouted protestingly. \"I know how you are meditating,\" my guru called out, \"with your mind distributed like leaves in a storm! Come here to me.\" Snubbed and exposed, I made my way sadly to his side."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"\"Poor boy, the mountains couldn't give what you wanted.\" Master spoke caressively, comfortingly. His calm gaze was unfathomable. \"Your heart's desire shall be fulfilled.\" Sri Yukteswar seldom indulged in riddles; I was bewildered. He struck gently on my chest above the heart. My body became immovably rooted; breath was drawn out of my lungs as if by some huge magnet. Soul and mind instantly lost their physical bondage, and streamed out like a fluid piercing ligh t from my every pore. The flesh was as though dead, yet in my intense awarene ss I knew that never before had I been fully alive. My sense of identity was no longer narrowly confined to a body, but embraced the circumambient atoms. People on distant streets seemed to be moving gently over my own remote peri phery. The roots of plants and trees appeared through a dim transparency of th e soil; I discerned the inward flow of their sap. The whole vicinity lay bare before me . My ordinary frontal vision was now changed to a vast spherical sight, simu ltaneously all-perceptive. Through the back of my head I saw men strolling far down Rai Ghat Road, and noticed also a white cow who was leisurely approaching. When she reached the space in front of the open ashram gate, I observed her with my two physical eyes. As she passed by, behind the brick wall, I saw her clearly still. All objects within my panoramic gaze tr embled and vibrated like quick motion pictures. My body, Master's, the pillared courtyard, the furniture and floor, the trees and sunshine, occasionally became viol ently agitated, until all melted into a luminescent sea; even as sugar crystals, thrown into a glass of water, dissolve after being shaken. The unifying light alte rnated with materializations of form, the metamorphoses revealing the law of cause and effect in creation. An oceanic joy broke upon calm endless sh ores of my soul. The Spirit of God, I realized, is exhaustless Bliss; His body is countless tissues of light. A swelling"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"glory within me began to envelop towns, continents, the earth, solar and stellar systems, tenuous nebulae, and floating universes. The entire cosmos, gently luminous, like a city seen afar at night, glimmered within the infinitude of my being. The sharply etched global outlines faded somewhat at the farthest edges; there I could see a mellow radiance, ever-undiminished. It was indescribably subtle; the planetary pictures were formed of a grosser light. The divine dispersion of rays poured from an Eternal Source, blazing into galaxies, transfigured with ineffable au ras. Again and again I saw the creative beams condense into constellations, then resolve into sheets of transparent flame. By rhythmic reversion, sextillion worlds passed into diaphanous luster; fire became firmament. I cognized the center of the empyrean as a point of intuitive perception in my heart. Irradiating splendor issued from my nucleus to every part of the universal structure. Blissful amrita , the nectar of immortality, pulsed through me with a quicksilverlike fluidity. The creative voice of God I heard resounding as Aum , 14-1 the vibration of the Cosmic Motor. Suddenly the breath returned to my lungs. With a disappointment almost unbearable, I realized that my infinite immensity was lost. Once more I was limited to the humiliating cage of a body , not easily accommodative to the Spirit. Like a prodigal child, I had run away from my macrocosmic home and imprisoned myself in a narrow microcosm. My guru was standing motionle ss before me; I started to drop at his holy feet in gratitude for the experience in co smic consciousness which I had long passionately sought. He held me upright, and spoke calmly, unpretentiously. \"You must not get overdrunk with ecstasy. Much work yet remains for you in the world. Come; let us sweep the balcony floor ; then we shall walk by the Ganges.\""},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"I fetched a broom; Master, I knew, was teachi ng me the secret of balanced living. The soul must stretch over the cosmogoni c abysses, while the body performs its daily duties. When we set out later for a stroll, I was still entranced in unspeakable rapture. I saw our bodies as two astral pictures, moving over a road by the river whose essence was sheer light. \"It is the Spirit of God that actively sust ains every form and force in the universe; yet He is transcendental and aloof in the blissful uncreated void beyond the worlds of vibratory phenomena,\" 14-2 Master explained. \"Saints who realize their divinity even while in the flesh know a similar twofold existence. Conscientiously engaging in earthly work, they yet remain immersed in an inward beatitude. The Lord has created all men from the limitl ess joy of His being. Though they are painfully cramped by the body, God nevert heless expects that souls made in His image shall ultimately rise above all sens e identifications and reunite with Him.\" The cosmic vision left many permanent lessons. By daily stilling my thoughts, I could win release from the delusive convi ction that my body was a mass of flesh and bones, traversing the hard soil of matter. The breath and the restless mind, I saw, were like storms which lashed the ocean of light into waves of material forms-earth, sky, human beings, animals, birds, trees. No perception of the Infinite as One Light could be had except by calming those storms. As often as I silenced the two natural tumults, I beheld the multitudinous waves of creation melt into one lucent sea, even as the waves of the ocean, their tempests subsiding, serenely dissolve into unity. A master bestows the divine experien ce of cosmic consciousness when his disciple, by meditation, has strengthened his mind to a degree where the vast vistas would not overwhelm him. The ex perience can never be given through one's mere intellectual willingness or open- mindedness. Only adequate enlargement by yoga practice and devotional bhakti can prepare the mind to absorb the liberating shock of omnipresen ce. It comes with a natural inevitability to the sincere devotee. His intense craving begins to pull at God with an"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"irresistible force. The Lord, as the Co smic Vision, is drawn by the seeker's magnetic ardor into his range of consciousness. I wrote, in my later years, the followin g poem, \"Samadhi,\" endeavoring to convey the glory of its cosmic state: Vanished the veils of light and shade, Lifted every vapor of sorrow, Sailed away all dawns of fleeting joy, Gone the dim sensory mirage. Love, hate, health, disease, life, death, Perished these false shadows on the screen of duality. Waves of laughter, scyllas of sarcasm, melancholic whirlpools, Melting in the vast sea of bliss. The storm of maya stilled By magic wand of intuition deep. The universe, forgotten dream, subconsciously lurks, Ready to invade my newly-wakened memory divine. I live without the cosmic shadow, But it is not, bereft of me; As the sea exists without the waves, But they breathe not without the sea. Dreams, wakings, states of deep turia sleep, Present, past, future, no more for me, But ever-present, all-flowing I, I, everywhere. Planets, stars, stardust, earth, Volcanic bursts of doomsday cataclysms, Creation's molding furnace, Glaciers of silent x-rays, burning electron floods, Thoughts of all men, past, present, to come, Every blade of grass, myself, mankind, Each particle of universal dust, Anger, greed, good, bad, salvation, lust, I swallowed, transmuted all Into a vast ocean of blood of my own one Being!

The sparrow, each grain of sand, fall not without My sight. All space floats like an iceberg in My mental sea. Colossal Container, I, of all things made. By deeper, longer, thirsty, guru-given meditation Comes this celestial samadhi . Mobile murmurs of atoms are heard, The dark earth, mountains, vales, lo! molten liquid! Flowing seas change into vapors of nebulae! Aum blows upon vapors, opening wondrously their veils, Oceans stand revealed, shining electrons, Till, at last sound of the cosmic drum, Vanish the grosser lights into eternal rays Of all-pervading bliss. From joy I came, for joy I live, in sacred joy I melt. Ocean of mind, I drink all creation's waves. Four veils of solid, liquid, vapor, light, Lift aright. Myself, in everything, enters the Great Myself. Gone forever, fitful, flickering shadows of mortal memory. Spotless is my mental sky, below, ahead, and high above. Eternity and I, one united ray.

I see, however, that you are imagining that the possession of miraculous powers is knowledge of God. One might have the whole universe, and fi nd the Lord elusive still! Spiritual advancement is not measured by one's outward powers, but only by the depth of his bliss in meditation. \" Ever-new Joy Is God . He is inexhaustible; as you continue your meditations during the years, He will beguile you with an infinite ingenuity. Devotees like yourself who have found the way to God never dream of exchanging Him for any other happiness; He is seductive beyond thought of competition. \"How quickly we weary of earthly pleasures! Desire for material things is endless; man is never satisfied completely, and pursues one goal after another. The 'something else' he seeks is the Lord, who alone can grant lasting joy. \"Outward longings drive us from the Ed en within; they offer false pleasures which only impersonate soul-happiness. The lost paradise is quickly regained through divine meditation. As God is unan ticipatory Ever-Newne ss, we never tire of Him.

These Biblical words refer to the threefold na ture of God as Father, Son, Holy Ghost ( Sat , Tat , Aum in the Hindu scriptures). God the Father is the Absolute, Unmanifested, existing beyond vibratory creation. God the Son is the Christ Consciousness (Brahma or Kutastha Chaitanya ) existing within vibratory creation; this Christ Consciousness is the \"only begotten\" or sole reflection of the Uncreated Infinite. Its outward manifestation or \"witness\" is Aum or Holy Ghost, the divine, creative, invisible power which structures all creation through vibration. Aum the blissful Comforter is heard in meditation and reveals to the devotee the ultimate Truth. CHAPTER: 15 The Cauliflower Robbery"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"\"Master, a gift for you! These six huge caul iflowers were planted with my hands; I have watched over their growth with th e tender care of a mother nursing her child.\" I presented the basket of vege tables with a ceremonial flourish. \"Thank you!\" Sri Yukteswar's smile was warm with appreciation. \"Please keep them in your room; I shall need them tomorrow for a special dinner.\" I had just arrived in Puri 15-1 to spend my college summer vacation with my guru at his seaside hermitage. Built by Master and his disciples, the cheerful little two- storied retreat fronts on the Bay of Bengal. I awoke early the following morning, refr eshed by the salty sea breezes and the charm of my surroundings. Sri Yukteswar's melodious voice was calling; I took a look at my cherished cauliflowers and stowed them neatly under my bed. \"Come, let us go to the beach.\" Master led the way; several young disciples and myself followed in a scattered group. Our guru surveyed us in mild criticism. \"When our Western brothers walk, they usua lly take pride in unison. Now, please march in two rows; keep rhythmic step with one another.\" Sri Yukteswar watched as we obeyed; he began to sing: \"Boys go to and fro, in a pretty little row.\" I could not but admire the ease with which Master was able to match th e brisk pace of his young students. \"Halt!\" My guru's eyes sought mine. \"Did you remember to lock the back door of the hermitage?\""},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" MY GURU' S SEA SIDE HERMIT AGE AT PURI A steady stream of visi tors poured from t he w orld into the hermitage tranquillity.

A supercilious smile or a glance of amused tole rance occasionally betreayed that the newcomers antici pated nothing more than a few pious platitudes. Yet their reluctant departure w ould bring an expressed conviction that Sri Yukteswar had shown precis e insight into their specialized fields of knowledge. My guru always had young resident disciples in his hermitage. He directed their minds and lives with that careful discipli ne in which the word \"disciple\" is etymologic ally rooted. \"I think so, sir.\" Sri Yukteswar was silent for a few minute s, a half-supp ressed smil e on his lip s. \"No, you fo rgot,\" he sa id finally. \"Divine contemplation must not b e made an excuse for material carelessn ess.

A certain man will arrive there pres ently; he will be the means of your chastisement.\" I concealed my vexation at these incomprehensible remarks. A peasant soon appeared on the road; he was dancing grotesquely and flinging his arms about with meaningless gestures. Almost paralyze d with curiosity, I glued my eyes on the hilarious spectacle. As the man reached a point in the road where he would vanish from our view, Sri Yuktesw ar said, \"Now, he will return.\" The peasant at once changed his direction and made for the rear of the ashram. Crossing a sandy tract, he entered the bu ilding by the back door. I had left it unlocked, even as my guru had said. The man emerged shortly, holding one of my prized cauliflowers. He now strode along re spectably, invested with the dignity of possession. The unfolding farce, in which my role appe ared to be that of bewildered victim, was not so disconcerting that I failed in indignant pursuit. I was halfway to the road when Master recalled me. He was shak ing from head to foot with laughter. \"That poor crazy man has been longing fo r a cauliflower,\" he explained between outbursts of mirth. \"I thought it would be a good idea if he got one of yours, so ill- guarded!\" I dashed to my room, where I found that the thief, evidently one with a vegetable fixation, had left untouched my gold rings, watch, and money, all lying openly on the blanket. He had crawled instead under the bed where, completely hidden from casual sight, one of my cauliflowe rs had aroused his singlehearted desire."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"I asked Sri Yukteswar that evening to expl ain the incident which had, I thought, a few baffling features. My guru shook his head slowly. \"You wi ll understand it someday. Science will soon discover a few of these hidden laws.\" When the wonders of radio burst some years later on an astounded world, I remembered Master's prediction. Age-old concepts of time and space were annihilated; no peasant's home so na rrow that London or Calcutta could not enter! The dullest intelligence enlarged before indisputable proof of one aspect of man's omnipresence. The \"plot\" of the cauliflower comedy can be best understood by a radio analogy. Sri Yukteswar was a perfect human radio. Th oughts are no more than very gentle vibrations moving in the ether. Just as a sensitized radio picks up a desired musical number out of thousands of other programs from every direction, so my guru had been able to catch the thought of the half-witted man who hankered for a cauliflower, out of the countless though ts of broadcasting human wills in the world. 15-2 By his powerful will, Master was also a human broadcasting station, and had successfully directed the peasant to reverse his steps and go to a certain room for a single cauliflower. Intuition 15-3 is soul guidance, appearing natura lly in man during those instants when his mind is calm. Nearly everyone has had the experience of an inexplicably correct \"hunch,\" or has transferred his thoughts effectively to another person. The human mind, free from the static of restlessness, can perform through its antenna of intuition all the functions of complicated radio mechanisms-sending and receiving thoughts, and tuning out unde sirable ones. As the power of a radio depends on the amount of electrical curre nt it can utilize, so the human radio is energized according to the power of will possessed by each individual."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"All thoughts vibrate eternally in the cosmo s. By deep concentration, a master is able to detect the thoughts of any mind, living or dead. Thoughts are universally and not individually rooted; a truth canno t be created, but only perceived. The erroneous thoughts of man result from imperfections in his discernment. The goal of yoga science is to calm the mind , that without distortion it may mirror the divine vision in the universe. Radio and television have brought the in stantaneous sound and sight of remote persons to the firesides of millions: the first faint scientific intimations that man is an all-pervading spirit. Not a body confined to a point in space, but the vast soul, which the ego in most barbaric modes conspires in vain to cramp. \"Very strange, very wonderful, seemingl y very improbable phenomena may yet appear which, when once established, wi ll not astonish us more than we are now astonished at all that science has taught us during the last century,\" Charles Robert Richet, Nobel Prizeman in physio logy, has declared. \"It is assumed that the phenomena which we now accept without surprise, do not excite our astonishment because they are understood. B ut this is not the case. If they do not surprise us it is not because they are un derstood, it is because they are familiar; for if that which is not understood ought to surprise us, we should be surprised at everything-the fall of a stone thrown into the air, the acorn which becomes an oak, mercury which expands when it is heated, iron attracted by a magnet, phosphorus which burns when it is rubbed. . . . The science of today is a light matter; the revolutions and evolutions which it will experience in a hundred thousand years will far exceed the most daring anticipations. The truths-those surprising, amazing, unforeseen truths-which our descendants will discover, are even now all around us, staring us in the eyes, so to speak, and yet we do not see them. But it is not enough to say that we do not see them; we do not wish to see them; for as soon as an unexpected and unfamiliar fact appears, we try to fit it into the framework of the commonplaces of acquired knowledge, and we are indignant that anyone should dare to experiment further.\""},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"A humorous occurrence took place a few days after I had been so implausibly robbed of a cauliflower.

Master perceived my expectation. With exaggerated gravity he questioned all ashram residents. A young disciple confessed that he had used the lamp to go to the well in the back yard. Sri Yukteswar gave the solemn counsel : \"Seek the lamp near the well.\" I rushed there; no lamp! Crestfallen, I re turned to my guru. He was now laughing heartily, without compunction for my disillusionment. \"Too bad I couldn't direct you to the vanished lamp; I am not a fortune teller!\" With twinkling eyes, he added, \"I am not even a satisfactory Sherlock Holmes!\" I realized that Master would never displa y his powers when challenged, or for a triviality. Delightful weeks sped by. Sri Yukteswar was planning a religious procession. He asked me to lead the disciples over the town and beach of Puri. The festive day dawned as one of the hottest of the summer. \"Guruji, how can I take the barefooted students over the fiery sands?\" I spoke despairingly. \"I will tell you a secret,\" Master responde d. \"The Lord will send an umbrella of clouds; you all shall walk in comfort.\" I happily organized the procession; our group started from the ashram with a Sat-Sanga banner. 15-4 Designed by Sri Yukteswar, it bore the symbol of the single 15-5 eye, the telescopic gaze of intuition."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"No sooner had we left the hermitage than the part of the sky which was overhead became filled with clouds as though by magic. To the accompaniment of astonished ejaculations from all sides, a very light shower fell, cooling the city streets and the burning seashore. The soothing drops descended during the two hours of the parade. The exact instant at which our group returned to the ashram, the clouds and rain passe d away tracelessly. \"You see how God feels for us,\" Master re plied after I had expressed my gratitude. \"The Lord responds to all and works for all. Just as He sent rain at my plea, so He fulfills any sincere desire of the devot ee. Seldom do men realize how often God heeds their prayers. He is not partial to a few, but listens to everyone who approaches Him trustingly. His children sh ould ever have implicit faith in the loving-kindness of their Omnipresent Father.\" 15-6 Sri Yukteswar sponsored four yearly fest ivals, at the equinoxes and solstices, when his students gathered from far an d near. The winter solstice celebration was held in Serampore; the first one I attended left me with a permanent blessing. The festivities started in the morning with a barefoot procession along the streets. The voices of a hundred students rang out with sweet religious songs; a few musicians played the flute and khol kartal (drums and cymbals). Enthusiastic townspeople strewed the path with flower s, glad to be summoned from prosaic tasks by our resounding praise of the Lord's blessed name. The long tour ended in the courtyard of the hermitage. There we encircled our guru, while students on upper balconies showered us with marigold blossoms. Many guests went upstairs to receive a pudding of channa and oranges. I made my way to a group of brother disciples who were serving today as cooks. Food for such large gatherings had to be cooked outdoors in huge cauldrons. The improvised wood-burning brick stoves were smoky and tear-provoking, but we laughed merrily at our work. Religious festivals in India are never considered"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"troublesome; each one does his part, su pplying money, rice, vegetables, or his personal services. Master was soon in our midst, supervisin g the details of the feast. Busy every moment, he kept pace with the most energetic young student. A sankirtan (group chanting), accompanied by the harmonium and hand- played Indian drums, was in progress on th e second floor. Sri Yukteswar listened appreciatively; his musical se nse was acutely perfect. \"They are off key!\" Master left the cooks an d joined the artists. The melody was heard again, this time correctly rendered. In India, music as well as painting an d the drama is considered a divine art. Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva-the Eternal Tr inity-were the first musicians. The Divine Dancer Shiva is scripturally repres ented as having worked out the infinite modes of rhythm in His cosmic dance of universal creation, preservation, and dissolution, while Brahma accentuated the time-beat with the clanging cymbals, and Vishnu sounded the holy mridanga or drum. Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu, is always shown in Hindu art with a flute, on which he plays the enrapturing song that recalls to their true home the human souls wandering in maya -delusion. Saraswati, goddess of wisd om, is symbolized as performing on the vina , mother of all stringed instruments. The Sama Veda of India contains the world's earliest writings on musical science. The foundation stone of Hindu music is the ragas or fixed melodic scales. The six basic ragas branch out into 126 derivative raginis (wives) and putras (sons). Each raga has a minimum of five notes: a leading note ( vadi or king), a secondary note ( samavadi or prime minister), helping notes ( anuvadi , attendants), and a dissonant note ( vivadi , the enemy). Each one of the six basic ragas has a natural correspondence with a certain hour of the day, season of the year, and a presiding deity who bestows a particular"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"potency. Thus, (1) the Hindole Raga is heard only at dawn in the spring, to evoke the mood of universal love; (2) Deepaka Raga is played during the evening in summer, to arouse compassion; (3) Megha Raga is a melody for midday in the rainy season, to summon courage; (4) Bhairava Raga is played in the mornings of August, September, October, to achieve tranquillity; (5) Sri Raga is reserved for autumn twilights, to attain pure love; (6) Malkounsa Raga is heard at midnights in winter, for valor. The ancient rishis discovered these laws of sound alliance between nature and man. Because nature is an objectification of Aum , the Primal Sound or Vibratory Word, man can obtain control over all natural manifestations through the use of certain mantras or chants. 15-7 Historical documents tell of the remarkable powers possessed by Miyan Tan Sen, sixteenth century court musician for Akbar the Great. Commanded by the Emperor to sing a night raga while the sun was overhead, Tan Sen intoned a mantra which instantly caused the whole palace precincts to become enveloped in darkness. Indian music divides the octave into 22 srutis or demi-semitones. These microtonal intervals permit fine shades of musical expression unattainable by the Western chromatic scale of 12 semitones. Each one of the seven basic notes of the octave is associated in Hindu mythology wi th a color, and the natural cry of a bird or beast- Do with green, and the peacock; Re with red, and the skylark; Mi with golden, and the goat; Fa with yellowish white, and the heron; Sol with black, and the nightingale; La with yellow, and the horse; Si with a combination of all colors, and the elephant. Three scales-major, harmonic minor, melodic minor-are the only ones which Occidental music employs, but Indian music outlines 72 thatas or scales. The musician has a creative scope for endless improvisation around the fixed traditional melody or raga ; he concentrates on the sentiment or definitive mood of the structural theme and then embroiders it to the limits of his own originality. The Hindu musician does not read set note s; he clothes anew at each playing the"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"bare skeleton of the raga , often confining himself to a single melodic sequence, stressing by repetition all its subtle mi crotonal and rhythmic variations. Bach, among Western composers, had an unders tanding of the charm and power of repetitious sound slightly different iated in a hundred complex ways. Ancient Sanskrit literature describes 120 talas or time-measures. The traditional founder of Hindu music, Bharata, is said to have isolated 32 kinds of tala in the song of a lark. The origin of tala or rhythm is rooted in human movements-the double time of walking, and the triple time of respiration in sleep, when inhalation is twice the length of exha lation. India has always recognized the human voice as the most perfect instrument of sound. Hindu music therefore largely confines itself to the voice range of three octaves. For the same reason, melody (relation of successive notes) is stressed, rather than harmony (relation of simultaneous notes). The deeper aim of the early rishi-musici ans was to blend the singer with the Cosmic Song which can be heard through awakening of man's occult spinal centers. Indian music is a subjective, spir itual, and individualistic art, aiming not at symphonic brilliance but at personal harmony with the Oversoul. The Sanskrit word for musician is bhagavathar , \"he who sings the praises of God.\" The sankirtans or musical gatherings are an effective form of yoga or spiritual discipline, necessitating deep concentra tion, intense absorption in the seed thought and sound. Because man himself is an expression of the Creative Word, sound has the most potent and immediat e effect on him, offering a way to remembrance of his divine origin. The sankirtan issuing from Sri Yukteswar's secon d-story sitting room on the day of the festival was inspiring to the cooks amidst the steaming pots. My brother disciples and I joyously sang the refr ains, beating time with our hands. By sunset we had served our hundreds of visitors with khichuri (rice and lentils), vegetable curry, and rice pudding. We la id cotton blankets over the courtyard; soon the assemblage was squatting under th e starry vault, quietly attentive to the"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"wisdom pouring from Sri Yukteswar's li ps. His public speeches emphasized the value of Kriya Yoga , and a life of self-respect, ca lmness, determination, simple diet, and regular exercise. A group of very young disciples then ch anted a few sacred hymns; the meeting concluded with sankirtan . From ten o'clock until midnight, the ashram residents washed pots and pans, and cleared the courtyard. My guru called me to his side. \"I am pleased over your cheerful labors today and during the past week of preparations. I want you with me; yo u may sleep in my bed tonight.\" This was a privilege I had never thought wo uld fall to my lot. We sat awhile in a state of intense divine tranquillity. Hardly ten minutes after we had gotten into bed, Master rose and began to dress. \"What is the matter, sir?\" I felt a tinge of unreality in the unexpected joy of sleeping beside my guru. \"I think that a few students who missed their proper train connections will be here soon. Let us have some food ready.\" \"Guruji, no one would come at one o'clock in the morning!\" \"Stay in bed; you have been working very hard. But I am going to cook.\" At Sri Yukteswar's resolute tone, I jumped up and followed him to the small daily-used kitchen adjacent to the second-floor inner balcony. Rice and dhal were soon boiling. My guru smiled affectionately. \"Tonight you have conquered fatigue and fear of hard work; you shall never be bothered by them in the future.\" As he uttered these words of lifelong blessing, footsteps sounded in the courtyard. I ran downstairs and admitted a group of students."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"\"Dear brother, how reluctant we are to disturb Master at this hour!\" One man addressed me apologetically. \"We made a mistake about train schedules, but felt we could not return home without a glimpse of our guru.\" \"He has been expecting you and is even now preparing your food.\" Sri Yukteswar's welcoming voice rang out; I led the astonished visitors to the kitchen. Master turned to me with twinkling eyes. \"Now that you have finished comparing no tes, no doubt you are satisfied that our guests really did miss their train!\" I followed him to his bedroom a half hour la ter, realizing fully that I was about to sleep beside a godlike guru. 15-1: Puri, about 310 miles south of Calcutta, is a fa mous pilgrimage city for devotees of Krishna; his worship is celebrated there with two immense annual festivals, Snanayatra and Rathayatra . 15-2: The 1939 discovery of a radio microscope re vealed a new world of hitherto unknown rays. \"Man himself as well as all kinds of supposedly inert matter constantly emits the rays that this instrument 'sees,'\" reported the Associated Press . \"Those who believe in telepathy, second sight, and clairvoyance, have in this announcement the first scientific proof of the existence of invisible rays which really travel from one person to anothe r. The radio device actually is a radio frequency spectroscope. It does the same thing for cool, no nglowing matter that the spectroscope does when it discloses the kinds of atoms that make the star s. . . . The existence of such rays coming from man and all living things has been suspected by scientists for many years. Today is the first experimental proof of their existence. The discovery shows that every atom and every molecule in nature is a continuous radio broadcasting station. . . . Thus even after death the substance that was a man continues to send out its delicate rays. Th e wave lengths of these rays range from shorter than anything now used in broadcasting to the lo ngest kind of radio wave s. The jumble of these rays is almost inconceivable. There are millions of them. A single very large molecule may give off 1,000,000 different wave length s at the same time. The longer wave lengths of this sort travel with the ease and speed of radio waves. . . . There is one amazing difference between the new radio rays and familiar rays like light. This is the prolonged time, amounting to thousands of years, which these radio waves will keep on emitting from undisturbed matter.\" 15-3: One hesitates to use \"intuiti on\"; Hitler has almost ruined th e word along with more ambitious devastations.

During deep meditation, the single or spiritual eye becomes visible within the central part of the forehead. This omniscient eye is variously referred to in scriptures as the third eye, the star of the East, the inner eye, the dove descending from heaven, the eye of Shiva, the eye of intuition, etc. 15-6: \"He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? . . . he that teacheth man knowledge, shall he not know?\"- Psalm 94:9-10. 15-7: Folklore of all peoples contains references to incantations with power over nature. The American Indians are well-known to have developed sound rituals for rain and wind. Tan Sen, the great Hindu musician, was able to quench fire by the power of his song. Charles Kellogg, the California naturalist, gave a demons tration of the effect of tonal vi bration on fire in 1926 before a group of New York firemen. \"Passing a bow, like an enlarged violin bow, sw iftly across an aluminum tuning fork, he produced a screech like intense radio static. Instantly the yellow gas flame, two feet high, leaping inside a hollow glass tube, subsided to a height of six inches and became a sputtering blue flare. Another attempt with the bow, and another screech of vibration, extinguished it.\" CHAPTER: 16 Outwitting The Stars \"Mukunda, why don't you get an astrological armlet?\" \"Should I, Master? I don't believe in astrology.\" \"It is never a question of belief ; the only scientific attitude one can take on any subject is whether it is true . The law of gravitation worked as efficiently before Newton as after him. The cosmos would be fairly chaotic if its laws could not operate without the sanction of human belief. \"Charlatans have brought the stellar scie nce to its present state of disrepute.

One should not dism iss the wisdom with the 'wise.' \"All parts of creation are linked together and interchange their influences. The balanced rhythm of the universe is root ed in reciprocity,\" my guru continued. \"Man, in his human aspect, has to combat two sets of forces-first, the tumults within his being, caused by the admixture of earth, water, fire, air, and ethereal elements; second, the outer disintegrating powers of nature. So long as man struggles with his mortality, he is affect ed by the myriad mutations of heaven and earth. \"Astrology is the study of man's response to planetary stimuli. The stars have no conscious benevolence or animosity; they merely send forth positive and negative radiations. Of themselves, these do not he lp or harm humanity, but offer a lawful channel for the outward operation of cause-effect equilibriums which each man has set into motion in the past. \"A child is born on that day and at th at hour when the celestial rays are in mathematical harmony with his individual karma. His horoscope is a challenging portrait, revealing his unalterable past and its probable future results. But the natal chart can be rightly interpreted only by men of intuitive wisdom: these are few. \"The message boldly blazoned across the heavens at the moment of birth is not meant to emphasize fate-the result of pa st good and evil-but to arouse man's will to escape from his universal thralldom. What he has done, he can undo. None other than himself was the instigator of the causes of whatever effects are now prevalent in his life.

Can he do anything about it? \"This problem received attention from ou r rishis; they found helpful not only a combination of metals, but also of plants and-most effective of all-faultless jewels of not less than two carats.

Many devotees visited Master that day, just for a darshan . 16-2 Ill and neglected, I sat in a corner. It was not until after the evening meal that all guests had departed. My guru summoned me to the octagonal balcony of the house. \"You must have come about your liver disorder.\" Sri Yukteswar's gaze was averted; he walked to and fro, occasiona lly intercepting the moonlight. \"Let me see; you have been ailing for twenty-four days, haven't you?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Please do the stomach exercise I have taught you.\" \"If you knew the extent of my suffer ing, Master, you would not ask me to exercise.\" Nevertheless I made a feeble attempt to obey him. \"You say you have pain; I say you have none. How can such contradictions exist?\" My guru looked at me inquiringly. I was dazed and then overcome with joyful relief. No longer could I feel the continuous torment that had kept me nearly sleepless for weeks; at Sri Yukteswar's words the agony vanished as though it had never been. I started to kneel at his feet in gratitude, but he quickly prevented me. \"Don't be childish. Get up and enjoy the beauty of the moon over the Ganges.\" But Master's eyes were twinkling happily as I stood in silence beside him.

On later occasions, when I brought my friends to Sri Yukteswar for healing, he invariably recommended jewels or the bangle, extolling their use as an act of astrological wisdom. I had been prejudiced against astrology from my childhood, partly because I observed that many people are sequaciously attached to it, and partly because of a prediction made by our family astrologer: \"You will marry three times, being twice a widower.\" I brooded over the matter, feeling like a goat awaiting sacrifice before the temple of triple matrimony. \"You may as well be resigned to your fate,\" my brother Ananta had remarked. \"Your written horoscope has correctly st ated that you would fly from home toward the Himalayas during your early years, but would be forcibly returned. The forecast of your marriages is also bound to be true.\" A clear intuition came to me one night th at the prophecy was wholly false. I set fire to the horoscope scroll, placing the ashes in a paper bag on which I wrote: \"Seeds of past karma cannot germinate if they are roasted in the divine fires of wisdom.\" I put the bag in a conspicuous spot; Ananta immediately read my defiant comment. \"You cannot destroy truth as easily as you have burnt this paper scroll.\" My brother laughed scornfully. It is a fact that on three occasions before I reached manhood, my family tried to arrange my betrothal. Each time I refused to fall in with the plans, 16-3 knowing that my love for God was more overwhel ming than any astrological persuasion from the past. \"The deeper the self-realization of a man, the more he influences the whole universe by his subtle spiritual vibrations , and the less he hims elf is affected by"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"the phenomenal flux.\" These words of Master's often returned inspiringly to my mind. Occasionally I told astrologers to select my worst periods, according to planetary indications, and I would still accomplish what ever task I set myself. It is true that my success at such times has been accompa nied by extraordinary difficulties. But my conviction has always been justified: faith in the divine protection, and the right use of man's God-given will, are forc es formidable beyond any the \"inverted bowl\" can muster. The starry inscription at one's birth, I ca me to understand, is not that man is a puppet of his past. Its message is rather a prod to pride; the very heavens seek to arouse man's determination to be free fr om every limitation. God created each man as a soul, dowered with individual ity, hence essential to the universal structure, whether in the temporary role of pillar or parasite. His freedom is final and immediate, if he so wills; it depe nds not on outer but inner victories. Sri Yukteswar discovered the mathematical application of a 24,000-year equinoctial cycle to our present age. 16-4 The cycle is divided into an Ascending Arc and a Descending Arc, each of 12,000 years. Within each Arc fall four Yugas or Ages, called Kali , Dwapara , Treta , and Satya , corresponding to the Greek ideas of Iron, Bronze, Silver, and Golden Ages. My guru determined by various calculations that the last Kali Yuga or Iron Age, of the Ascending Arc, started about A.D. 500. The Iron Age, 1200 years in duration, is a span of materialism; it ended about A.D. 1700. That year ushered in Dwapara Yuga , a 2400-year period of electrical and atomic-energy developments, the age of telegraph, radio, airplanes, and other space- annihilators. The 3600-year period of Treta Yuga will start in A.D. 4100; its age will be marked by common knowledge of telepa thic communications and other time- annihilators.

A descending arc of 12,000 years, starting with a descending Golden Age of 4800 years, then begins 16-5 for the world; man gradually sinks into ignorance. These cycles are the eternal rounds of maya , the contrasts and relativities of the phenomenal universe. 16-6 Man, one by one, escapes from creation's prison of duality as he awakens to consciousness of his inseverable divine unity with the Creator. Master enlarged my understanding not only of astrology but of the world's scriptures. Placing the holy texts on the sp otless table of his mind, he was able to dissect them with the scalpel of intuitive reasoning, and to separate errors and interpolations of scholars from the truths as originally expressed by the prophets. \"Fix one's vision on the end of the nose.\" This inaccurate interpretation of a Bhagavad Gita stanza, 16-7 widely accepted by Eastern pundits and Western translators, used to arouse Master's droll criticism. \"The path of a yogi is singular enough as it is,\" he remarked. \"Why counsel him that he must also make himself cross-eyed? The true meaning of nasikagram is 'origin of the nose, not 'end of the nose.' The nose begins at the point between the two eyebrows, the seat of spiritual vision.\" 16-8 Because of one Sankhya 16-9 aphorism, \" Iswar-ashidha ,\"-\"A Lord of Creation cannot be deduced\" or \"God is not proved,\" 16-10 -many scholars call the whol e philosophy atheistical. \"The verse is not nihilistic,\" Sri Yukteswar explained. \"It merely signifies that to the unenlightened man, dependent on his se nses for all final judgments, proof of God must remain unknown and therefore non-existent. True Sankhya followers, with unshakable insight born of meditati on, understand that the Lord is both existent and knowable.\""},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Master expounded the Christian Bible with a beautiful clarity.

The spinal cord is like an upturned tree, with man's hair as its roots, and afferent and efferent nerves as branches. The tree of the nervous system bears many enjoyable fruits, or sensations of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. In these, man may rightfully indulge; but he was forbidden the experience of sex, the 'appl e' at the center of the bodily garden. 16-14 \"The 'serpent' represents the coiled-up spinal energy which stimulates the sex nerves.

To these, for advantageous upward evolution, He transferred the soul s or divine essence of two animals. 16-17 In Adam or man, reason predominated; in Eve or woman, feeling was ascendant. Thus was expressed the duality or polarity which underlies the phenomenal worlds. Reason and feeling remain in a heaven of cooperative joy so long as the human mind is not tricked by the serpen tine energy of animal propensities. \"The human body was therefore not solely a result of evolution from beasts, but was produced by an act of special creation by God.

The scientific knowledge of the rishis was very great; in the Kaushitaki Brahmana we find precise astronomical passage s which show that in 3100 B.C. the Hindus were far advanced in astronomy, which ha d a practical value in determining the auspicious times for astrological cere monies. In an article in East-West , February, 1934, the following summary is given of the Jyotish or body of Vedic astronomical treatises: \"It contains the scientific lore which kept India at the forefront of all anci ent nations and made her the mecca of seekers after knowledge. The very ancient Brahmagupta , one of the Jyotish works, is an astronomical treatise dealing with such matters as the heliocentric motion of the planetary bodies in our solar system, the obliquity of the ecliptic, the earth's spherical form, the reflected light of the moon, the earth's daily axial revolution, the presence of fixed stars in the Milky Way, the law of gravitation, and other scientific facts which did not dawn in the Western world until the time of Copernicus and Newton.\" It is now well-known that the so-called \"Arabi c numerals,\" without wh ose symbols advanced mathematics is difficult, came to Europe in the 9t h century, via the Arabs, from India, where that system of notation had been anciently formulated. Further light on India's vast scientific heritage will be found in Dr. P. C. Ray's History Of Hindu Chemistry , and in Dr. B. N. Seal's Positive Sciences Of The Ancient Hindus . 16-2: The blessing whic h flows from the mere sight of a saint. 16-3: One of the girls whom my family selected as a possible bride for me, afterwards married my cousin, Prabhas Chandra Ghose. 16-4: A series of thirteen articles on the historical verification of Sri Yukteswar's Yuga theory appeared in the magazine East-West (Los Angeles) from Septembe r, 1932, to September, 1933. 16-5: In the year A.D. 12,500. 16-6: The Hindu scriptures place the present world-age as occurring within the Kali Yuga of a much longer universal cycle than the simple 24, 000-year equinoctial cycle with which Sri Yukteswar was concerned. The universal cycle of the scriptures is 4,300,560,000 ye ars in extent, an d measures out a Day of Creation or the length of life assigned to our planetary system in its present form.

The Hindu scriptures declare that an earth such as ours is dissolved for one of two reasons: the inhabitants as a whole become either completely good or completely ev il. The world-mind thus generates a power which releases the captive atoms held together as an earth. Dire pronouncements are occasionally published regarding an imminent \"end of the world.\" The latest prediction of doom was given by Rev. Chas . G. Long of Pasadena, who publicly set the \"Day of Judgment\" for Sept. 21, 1945. United Press reporters asked my opinio n; I explained that world cycles follow an orderly progression according to a di vine plan. No earthly dissolution is in sight; two billion years of ascending and descending equinoctia l cycles are yet in store for our planet in its present form.

The divine man first made by God had his consciousness centered in the omnipotent single eye in the forehead (eastward). The all-creative powers of his will, focused at that spot, were lost to man when he began to \"till the ground\" of his physical nature. CHAPTER: 17 Sasi And The Three Sapphires \"Because you and my son think so highly of Swami Sri Yukteswar, I will take a look at him.\" The tone of voice used by Dr. Narayan Chunder Roy implied that he was humoring the whim of half-wits. I concealed my indignation, in the best traditions of the proselyter. My companion, a veterinary surgeon, was a confirmed agnostic. His young son Santosh had implored me to take an intere st in his father. So far my invaluable aid had been a bit on the invisible side. Dr. Roy accompanied me the following day to the Serampore hermitage. After Master had granted him a brief interview, marked for the most part by stoic silence on both sides, the visitor brusquely departed. \"Why bring a dead man to the ashram?\" Sri Yukteswar looked at me inquiringly as soon as the door had closed on the Calcutta skeptic."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"\"Sir! The doctor is very much alive!\" \"But in a short time he will be dead.\" I was shocked. \"Sir, this will be a terrible blow to his son. Sa ntosh yet hopes for time to change his father's materialistic views. I beseech you, Master, to help the man.\" \"Very well; for your sake.\" My guru's face was impassive. \"The proud horse doctor is far gone in diabetes, although he does not know it. In fifteen days he will take to his bed. The physicians will give him up for lost; his natural time to leave this earth is six weeks from today. Due to your intercession, however, on that date he will recover. But there is one condition. You must get him to wear an astrological bangle; he will doubtless object as viol ently as one of his horses before an operation!\" Master chuckled. After a silence, during which I wondered how Santosh and I could best employ the arts of cajolery on the recalcitra nt doctor, Sri Yukteswar made further disclosures. \"As soon as the man gets well, advise hi m not to eat meat. He will not heed this counsel, however, and in six months, just as he is feeling at his best, he will drop dead. Even that six-month extension of li fe is granted him only because of your plea.\" The following day I suggested to Santosh that he order an armlet at the jeweler's. It was ready in a week, but Dr. Roy refused to put it on. \"I am in the best of health. You will ne ver impress me with these astrological superstitions.\" The doctor glanced at me belligerently. I recalled with amusement that Master had justifiably compared the man to a balky horse. Another seven days passe d; the doctor, suddenly ill, meekly consented to wear the bangle. Two weeks later the physician in attendance told"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"me that his patient's case was hopeless. He supplied harrowing details of the ravages inflicted by diabetes. I shook my head. \"My guru has said that, after a sickness lasting one month, Dr. Roy will be well.\" The physician stared at me incredulously. But he sought me out a fortnight later, with an apologetic air. \"Dr. Roy has made a complete recovery!\" he exclaimed. \"It is the most amazing case in my experience. Ne ver before have I seen a dying man show such an inexplicable comeback. Your guru must indeed be a healing prophet!\" After one interview with Dr. Roy, during which I repeated Sri Yukteswar's advice about a meatless diet, I did not see the man again for six months. He stopped for a chat one evening as I sat on the piazza of my family home on Gurpar Road. \"Tell your teacher that by eating meat frequently, I have wholly regained my strength. His unscientific ideas on diet ha ve not influenced me.\" It was true that Dr. Roy looked a picture of health. But the next day Santosh came running to me from his home on the next block. \"This morning Father dropped dead!\" This case was one of my strangest ex periences with Master. He healed the rebellious veterinary surgeon in spite of his disbelief, and extended the man's natural term on earth by six months, just because of my earnest supplication. Sri Yukteswar was boundless in his kindness when confronted by the urgent prayer of a devotee. It was my proudest privilege to bring college friends to meet my guru. Many of them would lay aside-at least in the ashr am!-their fashionable academic cloak of religious skepticism."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"One of my friends, Sasi, spent a number of happy week ends in Serampore. Master became immensely fond of the boy, and lamented that his private life was wild and disorderly. \"Sasi, unless you reform, one year hence you will be dangerously ill.\" Sri Yukteswar gazed at my friend with affe ctionate exasperation. \"Mukunda is the witness: don't say later th at I didn't warn you.\" Sasi laughed. \"Master, I will leave it to you to interest a sweet charity of cosmos in my own sad case! My spirit is willing but my will is weak. You are my only savior on earth; I believe in nothing else.\" \"At least you should wear a two-carat blue sapphire. It will help you.\" \"I can't afford one. Anyhow, dear guruji, if trouble comes, I fully believe you will protect me.\" \"In a year you will bring three sapphires, \" Sri Yukteswar replied cryptically. \"They will be of no use then.\" Variations on this conversation took place regularly. \"I can't reform!\" Sasi would say in comical despair. \"And my trust in yo u, Master, is more precious to me than any stone!\" A year later I was visiting my guru at the Calcutta home of his disciple, Naren Babu. About ten o'clock in the morning, as Sri Yukteswar and I were sitting quietly in the second-floor parlor, I heard the front door open. Master straightened stiffly. \"It is that Sasi,\" he remarked gravely. \"The year is now up; both his lungs are gone. He has ignored my counsel; te ll him I don't want to see him.\" Half stunned by Sri Yukteswar's sternness, I raced down the stairway. Sasi was ascending."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"\"O Mukunda! I do hope Master is here; I had a hunch he might be.\" \"Yes, but he doesn't wish to be disturbed.\" Sasi burst into tears and brushed past me. He threw himself at Sri Yukteswar's feet, placing there three beautiful sapphires. \"Omniscient guru, the doctors say I have ga lloping tuberculosis! They give me no longer than three more months! I humbly implore your aid; I know you can heal me!\" \"Isn't it a bit late now to be worrying over your life? Depart with your jewels; their time of usefulness is past.\" Master then sat sphinxlike in an unrelenting silence, punctuated by the boy' s sobs for mercy. An intuitive conviction came to me that Sri Yukteswar was merely testing the depth of Sasi's faith in the divine healin g power. I was not surprised a tense hour later when Master turned a sympathetic gaze on my prostrate friend. \"Get up, Sasi; what a commotion you make in other people's houses! Return your sapphires to the jeweler's; they are an unnecessary expense now. But get an astrological bangle and wear it. Fear no t; in a few weeks you shall be well.\" Sasi's smile illumined his tear-marre d face like sudden sun over a sodden landscape. \"Beloved guru, shall I take th e medicines prescribed by the doctors?\" Sri Yukteswar's glance was longanimous. \"J ust as you wish-drink them or discard them; it does not matter. It is more po ssible for the sun and moon to interchange their positions than for you to die of tuberculosis.\" He added abruptly, \"Go now, before I change my mind!\" With an agitated bow, my friend hastily departed. I visited him several times during the next few weeks, and was agha st to find his condition increasingly worse."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"\"Sasi cannot last through the night.\" Th ese words from his physician, and the spectacle of my friend, now reduced almost to a skeleton, sent me posthaste to Serampore. My guru listened coldly to my tearful report. \"Why do you come here to bother me? You have already heard me assure Sasi of his recovery.\" I bowed before him in great awe, and retreated to the door. Sri Yukteswar said no parting word, but sank into silence, his unwinking eyes half-open, their vision fled to another world. I returned at once to Sasi's home in Calcutta. With astonishment I found my friend sitting up, drinking milk. \"O Mukunda! What a miracle! Four hour s ago I felt Master's presence in the room; my terrible symptoms immediately disappeared. I feel that through his grace I am entirely well.\" In a few weeks Sasi was stouter and in better health than ever before. 17-1 But his singular reaction to his healing had an ungrateful tinge: he seldom visited Sri Yukteswar again! My friend told me one day that he so deeply regretted his previous mode of life that he was ashamed to face Master. I could only conclude that Sasi's illn ess had had the contrasting effect of stiffening his will and impairing his manners. The first two years of my course at Sco ttish Church College were drawing to a close. My classroom attendance had been very spasmodic; what little studying I did was only to keep peace with my fa mily. My two private tutors came regularly to my house; I was regularly absent: I can discern at least this one regularity in my scholastic career! In India two successful years of college bring an Intermediate Arts diploma; the student may then look forward to anot her two years and his A.B. degree."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"The Intermediate Arts final examinations loomed ominously ahead. I fled to Puri, where my guru was spending a few weeks. Vaguely hoping that he would sanction my nonappearance at the finals, I related my embarrassing unpreparedness. But Master smiled consolingly. \"You have wholeheartedly pursued your spiritual duties, and could not help neglecting your college work. Apply yourself diligently to your books for the next week: you shall get through your ordeal without failure.\" I returned to Calcutta, firmly suppressing all reasonable doubts that occasionally arose with unnerving ridicule. Surveying the mountain of books on my table, I felt like a traveler lost in a wilderness. A long period of meditation brought me a labor-saving inspiration. Opening each book at random, I studied only those pages which lay thus exposed. Pursuing this course during eighteen hours a day for a week, I considered myself entitled to advise all succeeding generations on the art of cramming. The following days in the examination halls were a justification of my seemingly haphazard procedure. I passed all the te sts, though by a hairbreadth. The congratulations of my friends and fa mily were ludicrously mixed with ejaculations betraying their astonishment. On his return from Puri, Sri Yukteswar gave me a pleasant surprise. \"Your Calcutta studies are now over. I will see th at you pursue your last two years of university work right here in Serampore.\" I was puzzled. \"Sir, there is no Bachelor of Arts course in this town.\" Serampore College, the sole institution of higher le arning, offered only a two-year course in Intermediate Arts. Master smiled mischievously. \"I am too old to go about collecting donations to establish an A.B. college for you. I gu ess I shall have to arrange the matter through someone else.\""},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Two months later Professor Howells, president of Serampore College, publicly announced that he had succeeded in raising sufficient funds to offer a four-year course. Serampore College became a branch affiliation of the University of Calcutta. I was one of the first students to enroll in Serampore as an A.B. candidate. \"Guruji, how kind you are to me! I have been longing to leave Calcutta and be near you every day in Serampore. Prof essor Howells does not dream how much he owes to your silent help!\" Sri Yukteswar gazed at me with mock seve rity. \"Now you won't have to spend so many hours on trains; what a lot of free time for your studie s! Perhaps you will become less of a last-minute crammer and more of a scholar.\" But somehow his tone lacked conviction. 17-1: In 1936 I heard from a friend that Sasi was still in excellent health. CHAPTER: 18 A Mohammedan Wonder-Worker \"Years ago, right in this very ro om you now occupy, a Mohammedan wonder- worker performed four miracles before me!\" Sri Yukteswar made this surprising stat ement during his first visit to my new quarters. Immediately after entering Serampore College, I had taken a room in a near-by boardinghouse, called Panthi . It was an old- fashioned brick mansion, fronting the Ganges. \"Master, what a coincidence! Are these ne wly decorated walls really ancient with memories?\" I looked around my simply fur nished room with awakened interest."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"\"It is a long story.\" My guru smiled reminiscently. \"The name of the fakir 18-1 was Afzal Khan. He had acquired his extraordinary powers through a chance encounter with a Hindu yogi. \"'Son, I am thirsty; fetch me some water.' A dust-covered sannyasi made this request of Afzal one day during his early boyhood in a small village of eastern Bengal. \"'Master, I am a Mohammedan. How could yo u, a Hindu, accept a drink from my hands?' \"'Your truthfulness pleases me, my child. I do not observe the ostracizing rules of ungodly sectarianism. Go; bring me water quickly.' \"Afzal's reverent obedience was rewarded by a loving glance from the yogi. \"'You possess good karma from former live s,' he observed solemnly. 'I am going to teach you a certain yoga method which will give you command over one of the invisible realms. The great powers that will be yours should be exercised for worthy ends; never employ them selfishly! I perceive, alas! that you have brought over from the past some seeds of destru ctive tendencies. Do not allow them to sprout by watering them with fresh evil actions. The complexity of your previous karma is such that you must use this life to reconcile your yogic accomplishments with the highest humanitarian goals.' \"After instructing the amazed boy in a complicated technique, the master vanished. \"Afzal faithfully followed his yoga exercise for twenty years. His miraculous feats began to attract widespread attention. It seems that he was always accompanied by a disembodied spirit whom he called 'Haz rat.' This invisible entity was able to fulfill the FAKIR'S slightest wish."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"\"Ignoring his master's warning, Afzal began to misuse his powers. Whatever object he touched and then replaced woul d soon disappear without a trace. This disconcerting eventuality usually made th e Mohammedan an objectionable guest! \"He visited large jewelry stores in Calcutta from time to time, representing himself as a possible purchaser. Any jewe l he handled would vanish shortly after he had left the shop. \"Afzal was often surrounded by several hu ndred students, attracted by the hope of learning his secrets. The fakir occasionally invited them to travel with him. At the railway station he would manage to touch a roll of tickets. These he would return to the clerk, remarking: 'I have changed my mind, and won't buy them now.' But when he boarded the train wi th his retinue, Afzal would be in possession of the required tickets. 18-2 \"These exploits created an indignant upro ar; Bengali jewelers and ticket-sellers were succumbing to nervous breakdowns! Th e police who sought to arrest Afzal found themselves helpless; the fakir could remove incriminating evidence merely by saying: 'Hazrat, take this away.'\" Sri Yukteswar rose from his seat and wa lked to the balcony of my room which overlooked the Ganges. I followed him, eager to hear more of the baffling Mohammedan Raffles. \"This Panthi house formerly belonged to a friend of mine. He became acquainted with Afzal and asked him here. My friend also invited about twenty neighbors, including myself. I was only a youth then , and felt a lively curiosity about the notorious fakir .\" Master laughed. \"I took the precaution of not wearing anything valuable! Afzal looked me over inquisitively, then remarked: \"'You have powerful hands. Go downstai rs to the garden; get a smooth stone and write your name on it with chalk; then throw the stone as far as possible into the Ganges.'"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"\"I obeyed. As soon as the stone ha d vanished under distant waves, the Mohammedan addressed me again: \"'Fill a pot with Ganges water ne ar the front of this house.' \"After I had returned with a vessel of water, the fakir cried, 'Hazrat, put the stone in the pot!' \"The stone appeared at once. I pulled it from the vessel and found my signature as legible as when I had written it. \"Babu, 18-3 one of my friends in the room, was wearing a heavy antique gold watch and chain. The fakir examined them with ominous admiration. Soon they were missing! \"'Afzal, please return my prized heirloom!' Babu was nearly in tears. \"The Mohammedan was stoically silent for awhile, then said, 'You have five hundred rupees in an iron safe. Bring them to me, and I will tell you where to locate your timepiece.' \"The distraught Babu left immediately for his home. He came back shortly and handed Afzal the required sum. \"'Go to the little bridge near your house,' the fakir instructed Babu. 'Call on Hazrat to give you the watch and chain.' \"Babu rushed away. On his return, he was wearing a smile of relief and no jewelry whatever. \"'When I commanded Hazrat as direct ed,' he announced, 'my watch came tumbling down from the air into my right hand!

'I want an elaborate meal for my five hundred rupees ! Everything should be served on gold plates!' \"As soon as each man had ex pressed his preferences, the fakir addressed himself to the inexhaustible Hazrat. A great rattle ensued; gold platters filled with intricately-prepared curries, hot luchis , and many out-of-season fruits, landed from nowhere at our feet. All the food wa s delicious. After feasting for an hour, we started to leave the room. A tremendous noise, as though dishes were being piled up, caused us to turn around. Lo! th ere was no sign of the glittering plates or the remnants of the meal.\" \"Guruji,\" I interrupted, \"if Afzal could easi ly secure such things as gold dishes, why did he covet the property of others?\" \"The fakir was not highly developed spiritually ,\" Sri Yukteswar explained. \"His mastery of a certain yoga technique gave him access to an astral plane where any desire is immediately materialized.

Afzal was merely an ordinary man with an extraordinary power of penetratin g a subtle realm not usually entered by mortals until death.\" \"I understand now, Guruji. The after- world appears to have some charming features.\" Master agreed. \"I never saw Afzal after th at day, but a few years later Babu came to my home to show me a newspape r account of the Mohammedan's public confession. From it I learned the facts I have just told you about Afzal's early initiation from a Hindu guru.\" The gist of the latter part of the published document, as recalled by Sri Yukteswar, was as follows: \"I, Afzal Khan, am writing these words as an act of penance and as a warning to those wh o seek the possession of miraculous powers. For years I have been misusing the wondrous abilities imparted to me through the grace of God and my master. I became drunk with egotism, feeling that I was beyond the ordinary laws of morality. My day of reckoning finally arrived. \"Recently I met an old man on a road outside Calcutta. He limped along painfully, carrying a shining object which looked like gold. I addressed him with greed in my heart. \"'I am Afzal Khan, the great fakir . What have you there?'"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"\"'This ball of gold is my sole material wealth; it can be of no interest to a fakir .

He straightened himself; his body instantly became strong and youthful. \"'So!' My guru's glance was fiery. 'I see with my own eyes that you use your powers, not to help suffering humanity, but to prey on it like a common thief! I withdraw your occult gifts; Hazrat is now fr eed from you. No longer shall you be a terror in Bengal!' \"I called on Hazrat in anguished tones; for the first time, he did not appear to my inner sight. But some dark veil sudde nly lifted within me; I saw clearly the blasphemy of my life. \"'My guru, I thank you for coming to banish my long delusion.' I was sobbing at his feet. 'I promise to forsake my worldly ambitions. I will reti re to the mountains for lonely meditation on God, hopi ng to atone for my evil past.' \"My master regarded me with silent compa ssion.

CHAPTER: 19 My Master, In Calcutta, Appears In Serampore \"I am often beset by atheistic doubts. Yet a torturing surmise sometimes haunts me: may not untapped soul possibilities exis t? Is man not missing his real destiny if he fails to explore them?\" These remarks of Dijen Babu, my roommate at the Panthi boardinghouse, were called forth by my invitation that he meet my guru. \"Sri Yukteswarji will initiate you into Kriya Yoga ,\" I replied. \"It calms the dualistic turmoil by a divine inner certainty.\" That evening Dijen accompanied me to th e hermitage. In Master's presence my friend received such spiritual peace that he was soon a constant visitor. The trivial preoccupations of daily life are not enough for man; wisdom too is a native hunger. In Sri Yukteswar's words Dijen found an incentive to those attempts-first painful, then effortlessly liberating-to loca te a realer self within his bosom than the humiliating ego of a temporary birth, seldom ample enough for the Spirit."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"As Dijen and I were both pursuing the A.B. course at Serampore College, we got into the habit of walking together to the ashram as soon as classes were over. We would often see Sri Yukteswar standing on his second-floor balcony, welcoming our approach with a smile. One afternoon Kanai, a young hermitage resident, met Dijen and me at the door with disappointing news. \"Master is not here; he was summoned to Calcutta by an urgent note.\" The following day I received a post card from my guru. \"I shall leave Calcutta Wednesday morning,\" he had written. \"You and Dijen meet the nine o'clock train at Serampore station.\" About eight-thirty on Wednesday morn ing, a telepathic message from Sri Yukteswar flashed insistently to my mind : \"I am delayed; don't meet the nine o'clock train.\" I conveyed the latest instructions to Dijen, who was already dressed for departure. \"You and your intuition!\" My friend's voic e was edged in scorn. \"I prefer to trust Master's written word.\" I shrugged my shoulders and seated myself with quiet finality. Muttering angrily, Dijen made for the door and closed it noisily behind him. As the room was rather dark, I moved nearer to the window overlooking the street. The scant sunlight suddenly increase d to an intense brilliancy in which the iron-barred window completely vanished . Against this dazzling background appeared the clearly materialized figure of Sri Yukteswar! Bewildered to the point of shock, I rose fr om my chair and knelt before him. With my customary gesture of respectful greeting at my guru's feet, I touched his"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"shoes. These were a pair familiar to me , of orange-dyed canvas, soled with rope. His ocher swami cloth brushed against me; I distinctly felt not only the texture of his robe, but also the gritty surface of the shoes, and the pressure of his toes within them. Too much astounded to utter a word, I stood up and gazed at him questioningly. \"I was pleased that you got my telepath ic message.\" Master's voice was calm, entirely normal. \"I have now finished my business in Calcutta, and shall arrive in Serampore by the ten o'clock train.\" As I still stared mutely, Sri Yukteswar went on, \"This is not an apparition, but my flesh and blood form. I have been di vinely commanded to give you this experience, rare to achieve on earth. M eet me at the station; you and Dijen will see me coming toward you, dressed as I am now. I shall be preceded by a fellow passenger-a little boy carrying a silver jug.\" My guru placed both hands on my head , with a murmured blessing. As he concluded with the words, \" Taba Asi ,\" 19-1 I heard a peculiar rumbling sound. 19-2 His body began to melt gradually within th e piercing light. First his feet and legs vanished, then his torso and head, like a scroll being rolled up. To the very last, I could feel his fingers resting lightly on my hair. The effulgence faded; nothing remained before me but the barred window and a pale stream of sunlight. I remained in a half-stupor of confusion, questioning whether I had not been the victim of a hallucination. A crestfallen Dijen soon entered the room. \"Master was not on the nine o'clock train, nor even the nine-thirty.\" My friend made his announcement with a slightly apologetic air. \"Come then; I know he will arrive at ten o'clock.\" I took Dijen's hand and rushed him forcibly along with me, heedless of his protests. In about ten minutes we entered the station, where the train was already puffing to a halt."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"\"The whole train is filled with the light of Master's aura! He is there!\" I exclaimed joyfully. \"You dream so?\" Dijen laughed mockingly. \"Let us wait here.\" I told my friend de tails of the way in which our guru would approach us. As I finished my descriptio n, Sri Yukteswar came into view, wearing the same clothes I had seen a short time ea rlier. He walked slowly in the wake of a small lad bearing a silver jug. For a moment a wave of cold fear passed through me, at the unprecedented strangeness of my experience. I felt th e materialistic, twentieth-century world slipping from me; was I back in the an cient days when Jesus appeared before Peter on the sea? As Sri Yukteswar, a modern Yogi-Christ, reached the spot where Dijen and I were speechlessly rooted, Master smiled at my friend and remarked: \"I sent you a message too, but you were unable to grasp it.\" Dijen was silent, but glared at me suspic iously. After we had escorted our guru to his hermitage, my friend and I proceeded toward Serampore College. Dijen halted in the street, indignation streaming from his every pore. \"So! Master sent me a message! Yet you con cealed it! I demand an explanation!\" \"Can I help it if your mental mirror os cillates with such re stlessness that you cannot register our guru's instructions?\" I retorted. The anger vanished from Dijen's face. \"I see what you mean,\" he said ruefully. \"But please explain how you could know about the child with the jug.\" By the time I had finished the story of Master's phenomenal appearance at the boardinghouse that morning, my friend and I had reached Serampore College."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"\"The account I have just heard of our guru 's powers,\" Dijen said, \"makes me feel that any university in the worl d is only a kindergarten.\" Chapter 19 Footnotes 19-1: The Bengali \"Good-by\"; literally, it is a hopeful paradox: \"Then I come.\" 19-2: The characteristic sound of dematerialization of bodily atoms. CHAPTER: 20 We Do Not Visit Kashmir \"Father, I want to invite Master and four friends to accompany me to the Himalayan foothills during my summer va cation. May I have six train passes to Kashmir and enough money to cover our travel expenses?\" As I had expected, Father laughed heartily . \"This is the third time you have given me the same cock-and-bull story. Didn't you make a similar request last summer, and the year before that? At the last mo ment, Sri Yukteswarji refuses to go.\" \"It is true, Father; I don't know why my guru will not give me his definite word about Kashmir. 20-1 But if I tell him that I have already secured the passes from you, somehow I think that this time he will consent to make the journey.\" Father was unconvinced at the moment, b ut the following day, after some good- humored gibes, he handed me six pa sses and a roll of ten- rupee bills. \"I hardly think your theoretical trip n eeds such practical props,\" he remarked, \"but here they are.\" That afternoon I exhibited my booty to Sr i Yukteswar. Though he smiled at my enthusiasm, his words were noncommittal: \"I would like to go; we shall see.\" He made no comment when I asked his li ttle hermitage disciple, Kanai, to accompany us. I also invited three other friends- Rajendra Nath Mitra, Jotin"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Auddy, and one other boy. Our date of departure was set for the following Monday. On Saturday and Sunday I stayed in Ca lcutta, where marriage rites for a cousin were being celebrated at my family home. I arrived in Serampore with my luggage early Monday morning. Rajend ra met me at the hermitage door. \"Master is out, walking. He has refused to go.\" I was equally grieved and obdurate. \"I will not give Father a third chance to ridicule my chimerical plans for Kashmir. Come; the rest of us will go anyhow.\" Rajendra agreed; I left the ashram to find a servant. Kanai, I knew, would not take the trip without Master, and someone was needed to look after the luggage. I bethought myself of Behari, previously a servant in my family home, who was now employed by a Serampore schoolmaster . As I walked along briskly, I met my guru in front of the Christian church near Serampore Courthouse. \"Where are you going?\" Sri Yukte swar's face was unsmiling. \"Sir, I hear that you and Kanai will not take the trip we have been planning. I am seeking Behari. You will recall that last year he was so anxi ous to see Kashmir that he even offered to serve without pay.\" \"I remember. Nevertheless, I don't think Behari will be willing to go.\" I was exasperated. \"He is just eage rly waiting for this opportunity!\" My guru silently resumed his walk; I s oon reached the schoolmaster's house. Behari, in the courtyard, greeted me with a friendly warmth that abruptly vanished as soon as I mentioned Kashmi r. With a murmured word of apology, the servant left me and entered his employ er's house. I waited half an hour, nervously assuring myself that Behari's delay was being caused by preparations for his trip. Finally I knocked at the front door."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"\"Behari left by the back stairs about thirty minutes ago,\" a man informed me. A slight smile hovered about his lips. I departed sadly, wondering whether my invitation had been too coercive or whether Master's unseen influence were at work. Passing the Christian church, again I saw my guru walking slowly to ward me. Without waiting to hear my report, he exclaimed: \"So Behari would not go! Now, what are your plans?\" I felt like a recalcitrant child who is determined to defy his masterful father. \"Sir, I am going to ask my uncle to lend me his servant, Lal Dhari.\" \"See your uncle if you want to,\" Sri Yukteswar replied with a chuckle. \"But I hardly think you will enjoy the visit.\" Apprehensive but rebellious, I left my guru and entered Serampore Courthouse. My paternal uncle, Sarada Ghosh, a government attorney, welcomed me affectionately. \"I am leaving today with some friends for Kashmir,\" I told him. \"For years I have been looking forward to this Himalayan trip.\" \"I am happy for you, Mukunda. Is there anything I can do to make your journey more comfortable?\" These kind words gave me a lift of encouragement. \"Dear uncle,\" I said, \"could you possibly spare me your servant, Lal Dhari?\" My simple request had the effect of an ea rthquake. Uncle jumped so violently that his chair overturned, the papers on the desk flew in every direction, and his pipe, a long, coconut-stemmed hubble-bubble, fell to the floor with a great clatter."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"\"You selfish young man,\" he shouted, quivering with wrath, \"what a preposterous idea! Who will look after me, if you take my servant on one of your pleasure jaunts?\" I concealed my surprise, reflecting that my amiable uncle's sudden change of front was only one more enigma in a day fully devoted to incomprehensibility. My retreat from the courthouse office was more alacritous than dignified. I returned to the hermitage, where my friends were expectantly gathered. Conviction was growing on me that some sufficient if exceedingly recondite motive was behind Master's attitude. Remors e seized me that I had been trying to thwart my guru's will. \"Mukunda, wouldn't you like to stay aw hile longer with me?\" Sri Yukteswar inquired. \"Rajendra and the others can go ahead now, and wait for you at Calcutta. There will be plenty of time to catch the last evening train leaving Calcutta for Kashmir.\" \"Sir, I don't care to go without you,\" I said mournfully. My friends paid not the slightest atte ntion to my remark. They summoned a hackney carriage and departed with all th e luggage. Kanai and I sat quietly at our guru's feet. After a half hour of complete silence, Master rose and walked toward the second-floor dining patio. \"Kanai, please serve Mukunda's food. His train leaves soon.\" Getting up from my blanket seat, I sta ggered suddenly with nausea and a ghastly churning sensation in my stomach. The stab bing pain was so intense that I felt I had been abruptly hurled into some viol ent hell. Groping blindly toward my guru, I collapsed before him, atta cked by all symptoms of th e dread Asiatic cholera. Sri Yukteswar and Kanai carried me to the sitting room."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Racked with agony, I cried, \"Master, I surrender my life to you;\" for I believed it was indeed fast ebbing from the shores of my body. Sri Yukteswar put my head on his lap, stroking my forehead with angelic tenderness. \"You see now what would have happened if you were at the station with your friends,\" he said. \"I had to look after you in this strange way, because you chose to doubt my judgment about taking the trip at this particular time.\" I understood at last. Inasmuch as great masters seldom see fit to display their powers openly, a casual observer of the day's events would have imagined that their sequence was quite natural. My guru's intervention had been too subtle to be suspected. He had worked his will th rough Behari and my Uncle Sarada and Rajendra and the others in such an inconspicuous manner that probably everyone but myself thought the situa tions had been logically normal. As Sri Yukteswar never failed to observe his social obligations, he instructed Kanai to go for a specialist, and to notify my uncle. \"Master,\" I protested, \"only you can heal me. I am too far gone for any doctor.\" \"Child, you are protected by the Divine Mercy. Don't worry about the doctor; he will not find you in this state. You are already healed.\" With my guru's words, the excruciating s uffering left me. I sat up feebly. A doctor soon arrived and examined me carefully. \"You appear to have passed through th e worst,\" he said. \"I will take some specimens with me for laboratory tests.\" The following morning the physician arrive d hurriedly. I was sitting up, in good spirits."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"\"Well, well, here you are, smiling and chatting as though you had had no close call with death.\" He patted my hand gently. \"I hardly expected to find you alive, after I had discovered from the specimens that your disease was Asiatic cholera. You are fortunate, young man, to have a guru with divine healing powers! I am convinced of it!\" I agreed wholeheartedly. As the doctor was preparing to leave, Rajendra and Auddy appeared at the door. The resentment in their faces changed into sympathy as they glanced at the phys ician and then at my somewhat wan countenance. \"We were angry when you didn't turn up as agreed at the Calcutta train. You have been sick?\" \"Yes.\" I could not help laughing as my friends placed the luggage in the same corner it had occupied yesterday. I quoted: \"There was a ship that went to Spain; when it arrived, it came back again!\" Master entered the room. I permitted myself a convalescent's liberty, and captured his hand lovingly. \"Guruji,\" I said, \"from my twelfth year on, I have made many unsuccessful attempts to reach the Himalayas. I am finally convinced that without your blessings the Goddess Parvati 20-2 will not receive me!\" 20-1: Although Master fail ed to make any explanation, his relu ctance to visit Kashmir during those two summers may have been a foreknowledge that th e time was not ripe for his illness there (see chapter 22 ). 20-2: Literally, \"of the mountains.\" Parvati, mytholog ically represented as a daughter of Himavat or the sacred mountains, is a name given to the shakti or \"consort\" of Shiva. CHAPTER: 21 We Visit Kashmir"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"\"You are strong enough now to travel . I will accompany you to Kashmir,\" Sri Yukteswar informed me two days after my miraculous recovery from Asiatic cholera. That evening our party of six entrained fo r the north. Our first leisurely stop was at Simla, a queenly city resting on the th rone of Himalayan hills. We strolled over the steep streets, admiring the magnificent views. \"English strawberries for sale,\" cried an old woman, squatting in a picturesque open market place. Master was curious about the strange little red fruits. He bought a basketful and offered it to Kanai and myself, who were near-by. I tasted one berry but spat it hastily on the ground. \"Sir, what a sour fruit! I could never like strawberries!\" My guru laughed. \"Oh, you will like th em-in America. At a dinner there, your hostess will serve them with sugar and cream. After she has mashed the berries with a fork, you will taste them and say: 'What delicious strawberries!' Then you will remember this day in Simla.\" Sri Yukteswar's forecast vanished from my mind, but reappeared there many years later, shortly after my arrival in America. I was a dinner guest at the home of Mrs. Alice T. Hasey (Sister Yogmata) in West Somerville, Massachusetts. When a dessert of strawberries was put on the ta ble, my hostess picked up her fork and mashed my berries, adding cream and sugar. \"The fruit is rather tart; I think you will like it fixed this way,\" she remarked. I took a mouthful. \"What delicious strawberries!\" I exclaimed. At once my guru's prediction in Simla emerged from th e fathomless cave of memory. It was staggering to realize that long ag o Sri Yukteswar's God-tuned mind had sensitively detected the program of karm ic events wandering in the ether of futurity."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Our party soon left Simla and entrained for Rawalpindi. There we hired a large landau, drawn by two horses, in which we started a seven-day trip to Srinagar, capital city of Kashmir. The second day of our northbound journey brought into view the true Himalayan vastness. As the iron wheels of our carriage creaked along the hot, stony roads, we were enraptured with changing vistas of mountainous grandeur. \"Sir,\" Auddy said to Master, \"I am greatly enjoying these glorious scenes in your holy company.\" I felt a throb of pleasure at Auddy's apprec iation, for I was acting as host on this trip. Sri Yukteswar caught my thought; he turned to me and whispered: \"Don't flatter yourself; Auddy is not nearly as entranced with the scenery as he is with the prospect of leaving us lo ng enough to have a cigaret.\" I was shocked. \"Sir,\" I said in an undert one, \"please do not break our harmony by these unpleasant words. I can hardly believe that Auddy is hankering for a smoke.\" 21-1 I looked apprehensively at my usually irrepressible guru. \"Very well; I won't say anything to Auddy .\" Master chuckled. \"But you will soon see, when the landau halts, that Auddy is quick to seize his opportunity.\" The carriage arrived at a small caravans erai. As our horses were led to be watered, Auddy inquired, \"Sir, do you mind if I ride awhile with the driver? I would like to get a little outside air.\" Sri Yukteswar gave permission, but remarked to me, \"He wants fresh smoke and not fresh air.\" The landau resumed its noisy progress over the dusty roads. Master's eyes were twinkling; he instructed me, \"Crane up your neck through the carriage door and see what Auddy is doing with the air.\""},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"I obeyed, and was astounded to observe Auddy in the act of exhaling rings of cigaret smoke. My glance toward Sri Yukteswar was apologetic. \"You are right, as always, sir. Auddy is enjoying a puff along with a panorama.\" I surmised that my friend had received a gift from the cab driver; I knew Auddy had not carried any cigarets from Calcutta. We continued on the labyrinthine way, adorned by views of rivers, valleys, precipitous crags, and multitudinous mountain tiers. Every night we stopped at rustic inns, and prepared our own food. Sri Yukteswar took special care of my diet, insisting that I have lime juice at all meals. I was still weak, but daily improving, though the rattling carriage was strictly designed for discomfort. Joyous anticipations filled our hearts as we neared central Kashmir, paradise land of lotus lakes, floating gardens, gaily canopied houseboats, the many- bridged Jhelum River, and flower-strew n pastures, all ringed round by the Himalayan majesty. Our approach to Srinagar was through an avenue of tall, welcoming trees. We engaged rooms at a double-storied inn overlooking the noble hills. No running wate r was available; we drew our supply from a near-by well. The summer weather was ideal, with warm days and slightly cold nights. We made a pilgrimage to the ancient Sr inagar temple of Swami Shankara. As I gazed upon the mountain-peak hermitage, standing bold against the sky, I fell into an ecstatic trance. A vision appeared of a hilltop mansion in a distant land. The lofty Shankara ashram before me was transformed into the structure where, years later, I established the Self-Rea lization Fellowship headquarters in America. When I first visited Los Angeles, and saw the large building on the crest of Mount Washington, I recognized it at once from my long-past visions in Kashmir and elsewhere. A few days at Srinagar; then on to Gu lmarg (\"mountain paths of flowers\"), elevated by six thousand feet. There I had my first ride on a large horse. Rajendra mounted a small trotter, whose heart was fired with ambition for speed. We"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"ventured onto the very steep Khilanmarg ; the path led through a dense forest, abounding in tree-mushrooms, where the mist-shrouded trails were often precarious. But Rajendra's little animal never permitted my oversized steed a moment's rest, even at the most peri lous turns. On, on, untiringly came Rajendra's horse, oblivious to all but the joy of competition. Our strenuous race was rewarded by a breath-taking view. For the first time in this life, I gazed in all directions at sublime snow-capped Himalayas, lying tier upon tier like silhouettes of huge pola r bears. My eyes feasted exultingly on endless reaches of icy mountain s against sunny blue skies. I rolled merrily with my young compan ions, all wearing overcoats, on the sparkling white slopes. On our downward trip we saw afar a vast carpet of yellow flowers, wholly transfiguring the bleak hills. Our next excursions were to the famous royal \"pleasure gardens\" of the Emperor Jehangir, at Shalimar and Ni shat Bagh. The ancient palace at Nishat Bagh is built directly over a natural waterfall. Rushin g down from the mountains, the torrent has been regulated through ingenious contr ivances to flow over colorful terraces and to gush into fountains amidst the dazzling flower-beds. The stream also enters several of the palace rooms, ultima tely dropping fairy like into the lake below. The immense gardens are riotous with color- roses of a dozen hues, snapdragons, lavender, pansies, poppies. An emerald enclosing outline is given by symmetrical rows of chinars , 21-2 cypresses, cherry trees; beyond them tower the white austerities of the Himalayas. Kashmir grapes are considered a rare de licacy in Calcutta. Rajendra, who had been promising himself a veritable feast on reaching Kashmir, was disappointed to find there no large vineyards. Now and then I chaffed him jocosely over his baseless anticipation. \"Oh, I have become so much gorged with grapes I can't walk!\" I would say. \"The invisible grapes are brewing within me!\" Later I heard that sweet grapes grow"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"abundantly in Kabul, west of Kashmir. We consoled ourselves with ice cream made of rabri , a heavily condensed milk, and flav ored with whole pistachio nuts. We took several trips in the shikaras or houseboats, shaded by red- embroidered canopies, coursing along the intricate channels of Dal Lake, a network of canals like a watery spider web. Here the numerous floating gardens, crudely improvised with logs and earth, strike on e with amazement, so incongruous is the first sight of vegetables and melons growing in the midst of vast waters. Occasionally one sees a peasant, disdaining to be \"rooted to the soil,\" towing his square plot of \"land\" to a new location in the many-fingered lake. In this storied vale one finds an epitome of all the earth's beauties. The Lady of Kashmir is mountain-crowned, lake-garland ed, and flower- shod. In later years, after I had toured many distant lands, I understood why Kashmir is often called the world's most scenic spot. It possesses some of the charms of the Swiss Alps, and of Loch Lomond in Scotland, and of the exquisite English lakes. An American traveler in Kashmir finds much to remind him of the rugged grandeur of Alaska and of Pikes Peak near Denver. As entries in a scenic beauty contest, I offer for first prize either the gorgeous view of Xochimilco in Mexico, where mountains, skies, and poplars reflect themselves in myriad lanes of water amidst the playful fish, or the jewel-like lakes of Kashmir, guarded like beautiful ma idens by the stern surveillance of the Himalayas. These two places stand out in my memory as the loveliest spots on earth. Yet I was awed also when I first beheld the wonders of Yellowstone National Park and of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado , and of Alaska. Yellowstone Park is perhaps the only region where one can see innumerable geysers shooting high into the air, performing year after year with clockwork regularity. Its opal and sapphire pools and hot sulphurous springs, its bears and wild creatures, remind one that here Nature left a specimen of he r earliest creation. Motoring along the roads of Wyoming to the \"Devil's Paint Pot\" of hot bubbling mud, with gurgling"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"springs, vaporous fountains, and spo uting geysers in all directions, I was disposed to say that Yellowstone dese rves a special prize for uniqueness. The ancient majestic redwoods of Yosemi te, stretching their huge columns far into the unfathomable sky, are green natural cathedrals designed with skill divine. Though there are wonderful falls in the Orient, none match the torrential beauty of Niagara near the Canadian border. The Mammoth Caves of Kentucky and the Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, with colorful iciclelike formations, are stunning fairylands. Their long needles of stalactite spires, hanging from cave ceilings and mirrored in underground wate rs, present a glimps e of other worlds as fancied by man. Most of the Hindus of Kashmir, world- famed for their beauty, are as white as Europeans and have similar features and bone structure; many have blue eyes and blonde hair. Dressed in Western clothes, they look like Americans. The cold Himalayas protect the Kashmiris from the sultry sun and preserve their light complexions. As one travels to the souther n and tropical latitudes of India, he finds progressively that the people become darker and darker. After spending happy weeks in Kashmir, I was forced to return to Bengal for the fall term of Serampore College. Sri Yuktesw ar remained in Srinagar, with Kanai and Auddy. Before I departed, Master hinted that his body would be subject to suffering in Kashmir. \"Sir, you look a picture of health,\" I protested. \"There is a chance that I may even leave this earth.\" \"Guruji!\" I fell at his feet with an impl oring gesture. \"Please promise that you won't leave your body now. I am utterly unprepared to carry on without you.\" Sri Yukteswar was silent, but smiled at me so compassionately that I felt reassured. Reluctantly I left him."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"\"Master dangerously ill.\" This telegram from Auddy reached me shortly after my return to Serampore. \"Sir,\" I wired my guru frantically, \"I asked for your promise not to leave me. Please keep your body; otherwise, I also shall die.\" \"Be it as you wish.\" This was Sri Yukteswar's reply from Kashmir. A letter from Auddy arrived in a few days, informing me that Master had recovered. On his return to Serampore duri ng the next fortnight, I was grieved to find my guru's body reduced to half its usual weight. Fortunately for his disciples, Sri Yukteswar burned many of their sins in the fire of his severe fever in Kashmir. The metaphysical method of physical transfer of disease is known to highly advanced yogi s. A strong man can assist a weaker one by helping to carry his heavy load; a spiritual superman is able to minimize his disciples' physical or mental burdens by sharing the karma of their past actions. Just as a rich man loses some money wh en he pays off a large debt for his prodigal son, who is thus saved from di re consequences of his own folly, so a master willingly sacrifices a portion of hi s bodily wealth to lighten the misery of disciples. 21-3 By a secret method, the yogi unites his mind and astral vehicle with those of a suffering individual; the disease is conveyed, wholly or in part, to the saint's body. Having harvested God on the physical field, a master no longer cares what happens to that material form. Though he may allow it to register a certain disease in order to relieve others, his mind is never affected; he considers himself fortunate in being able to render such aid. The devotee who has achieved final salvatio n in the Lord finds that his body has completely fulfilled its purpose; he can then use it in any way he deems fit. His work in the world is to alleviate the sorrows of mankind, whether through spiritual means or by intellectual counsel or through will power or by the physical"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"transfer of disease. Escaping to the supe rconsciousness whenever he so desires, a master can remain oblivious of physical suffering; sometimes he chooses to bear bodily pain stoically, as an example to disciples. By putting on the ailments of others, a yogi can satisfy, for them, the ka rmic law of cause and effect. This law is mechanically or mathematically operativ e; its workings can be scientifically manipulated by men of divine wisdom. The spiritual law does not require a ma ster to become ill whenever he heals another person. Healings ordinarily take place through the saint's knowledge of various methods of instantaneous cure in wh ich no hurt to the spiritual healer is involved. On rare occasions, however, a ma ster who wishes to greatly quicken his disciples' evolution may then voluntar ily work out on his own body a large measure of their undesirable karma. Jesus signified himself as a ransom for th e sins of many. With his divine powers, 21-4 his body could never have been subjecte d to death by crucifixion if he had not willingly cooperated with the subtle cosmi c law of cause and effect. He thus took on himself the consequences of others' karma, especially that of his disciples. In this manner they were highly purified and made fit to receive the omnipresent consciousness which later descended on them. Only a self-realized master can transfer his life force, or convey into his own body the diseases of others. An ordinary man ca nnot employ this yogic method of cure, nor is it desirable that he should do so; for an unsound physical instrument is a hindrance to God- meditation. The Hindu sc riptures teach that the first duty of man is to keep his body in good condi tion; otherwise his mind is unable to remain fixed in devotional concentration. A very strong mind, however, can transcend all physical difficulties and attain to God-realization. Many saints have ignore d illness and succeeded in their divine quest. St. Francis of Assisi, severely a fflicted with ailments, healed others and even raised the dead."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"I knew an Indian saint, half of whose body was once festering with sores. His diabetic condition was so acute that under ordinary conditions he could not sit still at one time for more than fifteen minutes. But his spir itual aspiration was undeterrable. \"Lord,\" he prayed, \"wilt Th ou come into my broken temple?\" With ceaseless command of will, the saint grad ually became able to sit daily in the lotus posture for eighteen continuous hours, engrossed in the ecstatic trance. \"And,\" he told me, \"at the end of three years, I found the Infinite Light blazing within my shattered form. Rejoicing in th e joyful splendour, I forgot the body. Later I saw that it had become wh ole through the Divine Mercy.\" A historical healing incident concerns King Baber (1483-1530), founder of the Mogul empire in India. His son, Prince Humayun, was mortally ill. The father prayed with anguished determination that he receive the sickness, and that his son be spared. After all physicians had given up hope, Humayun recovered. Baber immediately fell sick and died of the sa me disease which had stricken his son. Humayun succeeded Baber as Emperor of Hindustan. Many people imagine that every spiritual master has, or should have, the health and strength of a Sandow. The assumption is unfounded. A sickly body does not indicate that a guru is not in touch with divine powers, any more than lifelong health necessarily indicates an inner illu mination. The condition of the physical body, in other words, cannot rightfully be made a test of a master. His distinguishing qualifications must be so ught in his own domain, the spiritual. Numerous bewildered seekers in the West erroneously think that an eloquent speaker or writer on metaphysics must be a master. The rishis, however, have pointed out that the acid test of a master is a man's ability to enter at will the breathless state, and to maintain the unbroken samadhi of nirbikalpa . 21-5 Only by these achievements can a human be ing prove that he has \"mastered\" maya or the dualistic Cosmic Delusion. He alone can say from the depths of realization: \" Ekam sat ,\"-\"Only One exists.\""},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"\"The Vedas declare that the ignorant man who rests content with making the slightest distinction between the individual soul and the Supreme Self is exposed to danger,\" Shankara the great monist ha s written. \"Where there is duality by virtue of ignorance, one sees all things as distinct from the Self.

Sri Yukteswar would not have suffered in Kashmir unless he ha d received permission from the Spirit within him to help his disc iples in that strange way. Few saints were ever more sensitively equipped with wisdom to ca rry out divine commands than my God- tuned Master. When I ventured a few words of sympathy over his emaciated figure, my guru said gaily: \"It has its good points; I am able now to get into some small ganjis (undershirts) that I haven't worn in years!\" Listening to Master's jovial laugh, I remembered the words of St. Francis de Sales: \"A saint that is sad is a sad saint!\" 21-1: It is a mark of disrespect, in India, to smoke in the presence of one's elders and superiors. 21-2: The Oriental plane tree.. 21-3: Many Christian saints, including Therese Neumann (see chapter 39 ), are familiar with the metaphysical transf er of disease. 21-4: Christ said, just before he was led away to be crucified: \"Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?

I feel that in the vibrations of that holy plac e, Divine Mother will touch his heart. But don't disclose our object in wanting him to go.\" Sister agreed hopefully. Very early the ne xt morning I was pleased to find that Roma and her husband were in readiness for the trip. As our hackney carriage rattled along Upper Circular Road toward Dakshineswar, my brother-in-law, Satish Chandra Bose, amused himself by deriding spiritual gurus of the past, present, and future. I noticed that Roma was quietly weeping."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" Self-Realiz ation Churc h of All Re ligions, San Dieg o, California I stand with my two sisters, Ro ma (at left) and Nalini"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" My sister U ma, as a young girl \"Sister, cheer up!\" I whispered. \"Don't give your husba nd the satisfaction of believing that we take his mockery seriously. \" \"Mukunda, how can you admire worthles s h umbugs?\" Satish was saying. \"A SADHU'S very appearance is repulsive. He is either as thin as a ske leton, or as unholily fat as an elephant!\" I shouted with laughter. My good-natured reaction was annoying to Satish; he retired into sullen silence. As our cab entered the Dakshineswar g rounds, he grinned sarcastically. \"This excursion, I suppose, is a scheme to reform me?\" As I turned away without reply, he caught my arm. \"Yo ung Mr. Monk,\" he sa id, \"don't forget to make proper arrangements with the te mple autho rities to provide for our noon meal.\" \"I am going to meditate now. Do not wo rry a bout your lunch,\" I re plied sharply. \"Divine Mother will look after it.\""},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"\"I don't trust Divine Mother to do a single thing for me. But I do hold you responsible for my food.\" Satish 's tones were threatening. I proceeded alone to the colonnaded hall which fronts the large temple of Kali, or Mother Nature. Selecting a shady spot near one of the pillars, I arranged my body in the lotus posture. Although it was only about seven o'clock, the morning sun would soon be oppressive. The world receded as I became devo tionally entranced. My mind was concentrated on Goddess Kali, whose im age at Dakshineswar had been the special object of adoration by the great master, Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa. In answer to his anguished demands, the stone image of this very temple had often taken a living form and conversed with him. \"Silent Mother with stony heart,\" I prayed , \"Thou becamest filled with life at the request of Thy beloved devotee Ramakrishn a; why dost Thou not also heed the wails of this yearning son of Thine?\" My aspiring zeal increased boundlessly, accompanied by a divine peace. Yet, when five hours had passed, and the Goddess whom I was inwardly visualizing had made no response, I felt slightly dish eartened. Sometimes it is a test by God to delay the fulfillment of prayers. But He eventually appears to the persistent devotee in whatever form he holds dear . A devout Christian sees Jesus; a Hindu beholds Krishna, or the Goddess Kali, or an expanding Light if his worship takes an impersonal turn. Reluctantly I opened my eyes, and saw th at the temple doors were being locked by a priest, in conformance with a noon -hour custom. I rose from my secluded seat under the open, roofed hall, and stepped into the courtyard. Its stone floor was scorching under the midday sun; my bare feet were painfully burned."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"\"Divine Mother,\" I silently remonstrated, \"Thou didst not come to me in vision, and now Thou art hidden in the temple behind closed doors. I wanted to offer a special prayer to Thee today on behalf of my brother-in-law.\" My inward petition was in stantly acknowledged. Firs t, a delightful cold wave descended over my back and under my f eet, banishing all discomfort. Then, to my amazement, the temple became grea tly magnified. Its large door slowly opened, revealing the stone figure of Go ddess Kali. Gradually it changed into a living form, smilingly nodding in greeting, thrilling me with joy indescribable. As if by a mystic syringe, the breath was wi thdrawn from my lungs; my body became very still, though not inert. An ecstatic enlargement of consciousness followed. I could see clearly for several miles over the Ganges River to my left, and beyond the temple into the entire Dakshineswar precincts. The walls of all buildings glimmered transparently; through them I observed people walkin g to and fro over distant acres. Though I was breathless and my body in a strangely quiet state, yet I was able to move my hands and feet freely. For several minutes I experimented in closing and opening my eyes; in either state I saw distinctly the whole Dakshineswar panorama. Spiritual sight, x-raylike, penetrates in to all matter; the divine eye is center everywhere, circumference nowhere. I real ized anew, standing there in the sunny courtyard, that when man ceases to be a prodigal child of God, engrossed in a physical world indeed dream, baseless as a bubble, he reinherits his eternal realms. If \"escapism\" be a need of man, cramped in his narrow personality, can any escape compare with the majesty of omnipresence? In my sacred experience at Dakshinesw ar, the only extraordinarily- enlarged objects were the temple and the form of the Goddess. Everything else appeared in its normal dimensions, although each was enclosed in a halo of mellow light- white, blue, and pastel rainbow hues. My body seemed to be of ethereal"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"substance, ready to levitate. Fully conscio us of my material surroundings, I was looking about me and taking a few steps without disturbing the continuity of the blissful vision. Behind the temple walls I suddenly glimps ed my brother-in-law as he sat under the thorny branches of a sacred bel tree. I could effortlessly discern the course of his thoughts. Somewhat uplifted under th e holy influence of Dakshineswar, his mind yet held unkind reflections about me . I turned directly to the gracious form of the Goddess. \"Divine Mother,\" I prayed, \"wilt Thou not spiritually change my sister's husband?\" The beautiful figure, hitherto silent, sp oke at last: \"Thy wish is granted!\" I looked happily at Satish. As though instinctively aware that some spiritual power was at work, he rose resentfully from his seat on the ground. I saw him running behind the temple; he a pproached me, shaking his fist. The all-embracing vision disappeared. No longer could I see the glorious Goddess; the towering temple was redu ced to its ordinary size, minus its transparency. Again my body sweltered unde r the fierce rays of the sun. I jumped to the shelter of the pillared hall, where Sa tish pursued me angrily. I looked at my watch. It was one o'clock; the divine vision had lasted an hour. \"You little fool,\" my brother-in-law blur ted out, \"you have been sitting there cross-legged and cross-eyed for six hours. I have gone back and forth watching you. Where is my food? Now the temple is closed; you failed to notify the authorities; we are left without lunch!\" The exaltation I had felt at the Goddess' presence was still vibrant within my heart. I was emboldened to exclaim, \"Divine Mother will feed us!\""},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Satish was beside himself with rage. \"Once and for all,\" he shouted, \"I would like to see your Divine Mother giving us f ood here without prior arrangements!\" His words were hardly uttered when a te mple priest crossed the courtyard and joined us. \"Son,\" he addressed me, \"I have been observing your face serenely glowing during hours of meditation. I saw the arriva l of your party this morning, and felt a desire to put aside ample food for your lunch. It is against the temple rules to feed those who do not make a request be forehand, but I have made an exception for you.\" I thanked him, and gazed straight into Satish's eyes. He flushed with emotion, lowering his gaze in silent repentance . When we were served a lavish meal, including out-of-season mangoes, I noticed that my brother-in-law's appetite was meager. He was bewildered, diving deep in to the ocean of thought. On the return journey to Calcutta, Satish, with softened expression, occasionally glanced at me pleadingly. But he did not speak a single word after the moment the priest had appeared to invite us to lunch, as though in direct answer to Satish's challenge. The following afternoon I visited my sister at her home. She greeted me affectionately. \"Dear brother,\" she cried, \"what a miracle! Last evening my husband wept openly before me. \"'Beloved devi ,' 22-1 he said, 'I am happy beyond expression that this reforming scheme of your brother's has wrought a tr ansformation. I am going to undo every wrong I have done you. From tonight we will use our large bedroom only as a place of worship; your small meditation room shall be changed into our sleeping quarters. I am sincerely sorry that I have ridiculed your brother. For the shameful way I have been acting, I will punish my self by not talking to Mukunda until I"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"have progressed in the spiritual path. Deep ly I will seek the Divine Mother from now on; someday I must surely find Her!'\" Years later, I visited my brother-in-law in Delhi. I was overjoyed to perceive that he had developed highly in self-realization, and had been blessed by the vision of Divine Mother. During my stay with him, I noticed that Satish secretly spent the greater part of every night in divine me ditation, though he was suffering from a serious ailment, and was engaged during the day at his office. The thought came to me that my brother- in-law's life span would not be a long one. Roma must have read my mind. \"Dear brother,\" she said, \"I am well, and my husband is sick. Nevertheless, I want you to know that, as a devoted Hindu wife, I am going to be the first one to die. 22- 2 It won't be long now before I pass on.\" Taken aback at her ominous words, I yet realized their sting of truth. I was in America when my sister died, about a year after her prediction. My youngest brother Bishnu later gave me the details. \"Roma and Satish were in Calcutta at th e time of her death,\" Bishnu told me. \"That morning she dressed herself in her bridal finery. \"'Why this special costum e?' Satish inquired. \"'This is my last day of service to you on earth,' Roma replied. A short time later she had a heart attack. As her son wa s rushing out for aid, she said: \"'Son, do not leave me. It is no use; I sh all be gone before a doctor could arrive.' Ten minutes later, holding the feet of her husband in reverence, Roma consciously left her body, happily and without suffering. \"Satish became very reclusive after his wife's death,\" Bishnu continued. \"One day he and I were looking at a large smiling photograph of Roma."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"\"'Why do you smile?' Satish suddenly exclai med, as though his wife were present. 'You think you were clever in arranging to go before me. I shall prove that you cannot long remain away from me; soon I shall join you.' \"Although at this time Satish had fully recovered from his sickness, and was enjoying excellent health, he died witho ut apparent cause shortly after his strange remark before the photograph.\" Thus prophetically passed my dearly beloved eldest sister Roma, and her husband Satish-he who changed at Dakshi neswar from an ordinary worldly man to a silent saint. 22-1: Goddess. 22-2: The Hindu wife believes it is a sign of spiritual advancement if she dies before her husband, as a proof of her loyal service to him, or \"dying in harness.\" CHAPTER: 23 I Receive My University Degree \"You ignore your textbook assignme nts in philosophy. No doubt you are depending on an unlaborious 'intuition' to get you through the examinations. But unless you apply yourself in a more scholarly manner, I shall see to it that you don't pass this course.\" Professor D. C. Ghoshal of Serampore Co llege was addressing me sternly. If I failed to pass his final wri tten classroom test, I would be ineligible to take the conclusive examinations. Th ese are formulated by the faculty of Calcutta University, which numbers Serampore Colle ge among its affiliated branches. A student in Indian universities who is unsucc essful in one subject in the A.B. finals must be examined anew in all his subjects the following year."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"My instructors at Serampore College us ually treated me with kindness, not untinged by an amused tolerance. \"Mukun da is a bit over-drunk with religion.\" Thus summing me up, they tactfully sp ared me the embarrassment of answering classroom questions; they trusted the final written tests to eliminate me from the list of A.B. candidates. The judgment pa ssed by my fellow stud ents was expressed in their nickname for me-\"Mad Monk.\" I took an ingenious step to nullify Profe ssor Ghoshal's threat to me of failure in philosophy. When the results of the fi nal tests were about to be publicly announced, I asked a classmate to accom pany me to the professor's study. \"Come along; I want a witness,\" I told my companion. \"I shall be very much disappointed if I have not succeeded in outwitting the instructor.\" Professor Ghoshal shook his head after I had inquired what rating he had given my paper. \"You are not among those who have passe d,\" he said in triumph. He hunted through a large pile on his desk. \"Your pape r isn't here at all; you have failed, in any case, through non-appearance at the examination.\" I chuckled. \"Sir, I was there. May I look through the stack myself?\" The professor, nonplused, gave his permi ssion; I quickly found my paper, where I had carefully omitted any identificati on mark except my roll call number. Unwarned by the \"red flag\" of my name, th e instructor had given a high rating to my answers even though they were un embellished by textbook quotations. 23-1 Seeing through my trick, he now thundered, \"Sheer brazen luck!\" He added hopefully, \"You are sure to fail in the A.B. finals.\" For the tests in my other subjects, I receiv ed some coaching, particularly from my dear friend and cousin, Prabhas Chandra Ghose, 23-2 son of my Uncle Sarada. I"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"staggered painfully but successfully-wit h the lowest possible passing marks- through all my final tests. Now, after four years of co llege, I was eligible to sit for the A.B. examinations. Nevertheless, I hardly expect ed to avail myself of the privilege. The Serampore College finals were child's play compared to the stiff ones which would be set by Calcutta University for the A.B. degree. My almost daily visits to Sri Yukteswar had left me little time to enter the college halls. There it was my presence rather than my absence that brought forth ejaculations of amazement from my classmates! My customary routine was to set out on my bicycle about nine-thirty in the morning. In one hand I would carry an offering for my guru-a few flowers from the garden of my Panthi boardinghouse. Greeting me affably, Master would invite me to lunch. I invariably accepted with alacrity, glad to banish the thought of college for the day. After hours with Sr i Yukteswar, listening to his incomparable flow of wisdom, or helping with ashram duties, I would reluctantly depart around midnight for the Panthi . Occasionally I stayed all ni ght with my guru, so happily engrossed in his conversation that I scar cely noticed when darkness changed into dawn. One night about eleven o'clock, as I was putting on my shoes 23-3 in preparation for the ride to the boardinghouse, Master questioned me gravely. \"When do your A.B. examinations start?\" \"Five days hence, sir.\" \"I hope you are in readiness for them.\" Transfixed with alarm, I held one shoe in the air. \"Sir,\" I protested, \"you know how my days have been passed with you ra ther than with the professors. How can I enact a farce by appearing for those difficult finals?\""},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Sri Yukteswar's eyes were turned piercing ly on mine. \"You must appear.\" His tone was coldly peremptory. \"We should no t give cause for your father and other relatives to criticize your preference for ashram life. Just promise me that you will be present for the examinations; an swer them the best way you can.\" Uncontrollable tears were coursing down my face. I felt that Master's command was unreasonable, and that his interest was, to say the least, belated. \"I will appear if you wish it,\" I said am idst sobs. \"But no time remains for proper preparation.\" Under my breath I muttered, \"I will fill up the sheets with your teachings in answer to the questions!\" When I entered the hermitage the following day at my usual hour, I presented my bouquet with a certain mournful solemnity. Sri Yukteswar laughed at my woebegone air. \"Mukunda, has the Lord ever failed you, at an examination or elsewhere?\" \"No, sir,\" I responded warmly. Grateful memories came in a revivifying flood. \"Not laziness but burning zeal for God has prevented you from seeking college honors,\" my guru said kindly. After a si lence, he quoted, \"'Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; an d all these things shall be added unto you.'\" 23-4 For the thousandth time, I felt my burdens lifted in Master's presence. When we had finished our early lunch, he suggested that I return to the Panthi . \"Does your friend, Romesh Chandra Dutt, still live in your boardinghouse?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Get in touch with him; the Lord wi ll inspire him to help you with the examinations.\""},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"\"Very well, sir; but Romesh is unusually busy. He is the honor man in our class, and carries a heavier cours e than the others.\" Master waved aside my objections. \"Romes h will find time for you. Now go.\" I bicycled back to the Panthi . The first person I met in the boardinghouse compound was the scholarly Romesh. As th ough his days were quite free, he obligingly agreed to my diffident request. \"Of course; I am at your service.\" He spent several hours of that afternoon and of succeeding days in coaching me in my various subjects. \"I believe many questions in English literature will be centered in the route of Childe Harold,\" he told me. \"We must get an atlas at once.\" I hastened to the home of my Uncle Sarada and borrowed an atlas. Romesh marked the European map at the places visited by Byron's romantic traveler. A few classmates had gathered around to listen to the tutoring. \"Romesh is advising you wrongly,\" one of them commented to me at the end of a session. \"Usually only fifty per cent of the questions are about the books; the other half will involve the authors' lives.\" When I sat for the examination in Englis h literature the following day, my first glance at the questions caused tears of gr atitude to pour forth, wetting my paper. The classroom monitor came to my desk and made a sympathetic inquiry. \"My guru foretold that Romesh would he lp me,\" I explained. \"Look; the very questions dictated to me by Romesh are here on the examination sheet! Fortunately for me, there are very few questions this year on English authors, whose lives are wrapped in deep myst ery so far as I am concerned!\" My boardinghouse was in an uproar when I returned. The boys who had been ridiculing Romesh's method of coaching lo oked at me in awe, almost deafening"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"me with congratulations. During the w eek of the examinations, I spent many hours with Romesh, who formulated question s that he thought were likely to be set by the professors. Day by day, Rome sh's questions appeared in almost the same form on the examination sheets. The news was widely circulated in th e college that something resembling a miracle was occurring, and that success seemed probable for the absent-minded \"Mad Monk.\" I made no attempt to hide th e facts of the case. The local professors were powerless to alter the questions, which had been arranged by Calcutta University. Thinking over the examination in English literature, I realized one morning that I had made a serious error. One section of the questions had been divided into two parts of A or B, and C or D. Instead of answering one question from each part, I had carelessly answered both questions in Group I, and had failed to consider anything in Group II. The best mark I could score in that paper would be 33, three less than the passing mark of 36. I rushed to Master and poured out my troubles. \"Sir, I have made an unpardonable blunde r. I don't deserve the divine blessings through Romesh; I am quite unworthy.\" \"Cheer up, Mukunda.\" Sri Yukteswar's tones were light and unconcerned. He pointed to the blue vault of the heavens. \"It is more possible for the sun and moon to interchange their positions in spac e than it is for you to fail in getting your degree!\" I left the hermitage in a more tranquil mood, though it seemed mathematically inconceivable that I could pass. I looked once or twice apprehensively into the sky; the Lord of Day appeared to be secu rely anchored in his customary orbit!"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"As I reached the Panthi , I overheard a classmate's remark: \"I have just learned that this year, for the first time, the re quired passing mark in English literature has been lowered.\" I entered the boy's room with such speed th at he looked up in alarm. I questioned him eagerly. \"Long-haired monk,\" he said laughingly, \"w hy this sudden interest in scholastic matters? Why cry in the eleventh hour? But it is true that the passing mark has just been lowered to 33 points.\" A few joyous leaps took me into my own room, where I sank to my knees and praised the mathematical perfections of my Divine Father. Every day I thrilled with the consciousness of a spiritual presence that I clearly felt to be guiding me through Romesh . A significant incident occurred in connection with the examination in Bengali. Romesh, who had touched little on that subject, called me back one mornin g as I was leaving the boardinghouse on my way to the examination hall. \"There is Romesh shouting for you,\" a cl assmate said to me impatiently. \"Don't return; we shall be late at the hall.\" Ignoring the advice, I ran back to the house. \"The Bengali examination is usually easi ly passed by our Beng ali boys,\" Romesh told me. \"But I have just had a hunch that this year the professors have planned to massacre the students by asking qu estions from our ancient literature.\" My friend then briefly outlined two stories from the life of Vidyasagar, a renowned philanthropist. I thanked Romesh and quickly bicycled to the college hall. The examination sheet in Bengali proved to contain two parts. The first instruction was: \"Write two instances of the charities of Vidyasagar.\" As I transferred to the paper the lore"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"that I had so recently acquired, I whispe red a few words of thanksgiving that I had heeded Romesh's last-minute summons. Had I been ignorant of Vidyasagar's benefactions to mankind (including ultimately myself), I could not have passed the Bengali examination. Failing in one subject, I would have been forced to stand examination anew in all subjects the following year. Such a prospect was understandably abhorrent. The second instruction on the sheet read: \"Write an essay in Bengali on the life of the man who has most inspired you.\" Gentle reader, I need not inform you what man I chose for my theme. As I covered page after page with praise of my guru, I smiled to realize that my muttered predicti on was coming true: \"I will fill up the sheets with your teachings!\" I had not felt inclined to question Romesh about my course in philosophy. Trusting my long training under Sri Yukte swar, I safely disregarded the textbook explanations. The highest mark given to any of my papers was the one in philosophy. My score in all other subjects was just barely within the passing mark. It is a pleasure to record that my un selfish friend Romesh received his own degree cum laude . Father was wreathed in smiles at my graduation. \"I hardly thought you would pass, Mukunda,\" he confessed. \"You spend so much time with your guru.\" Master had indeed correctly detected the un spoken criticism of my father. For years I had been uncertain that I woul d ever see the day when an A.B. would follow my name. I seldom use the title witho ut reflecting that it was a divine gift, conferred on me for reasons somewhat ob scure. Occasionally I hear college men remark that very little of their cramme d knowledge remained with them after graduation. That admission consoles me a bit for my undoubted academic deficiencies."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"On the day I received my degree from Ca lcutta University, I knelt at my guru's feet and thanked him for all the blessing s flowing from his life into mine. \"Get up, Mukunda,\" he said indulgently. \"The Lord simply found it more convenient to make you a graduate than to rearrange the sun and moon!\" 23-1: I must do Professor Ghoshal the justice of ad mitting that the strained relationship between us was not due to any fault of his, but solely to my absences from classes and inattention in them. Professor Ghoshal was, and is, a remarkable orator with vast philosophical knowledge. In later years we came to a cordial understanding.. 23-2: Although my cousin and I have the same family name of Ghosh, Prabhas has accustomed himself to transliterating his name in English as Ghose; therefore I follow his own spelling here. 23-3: A disciple always removes his shoes in an Indian hermitage. 23-4: Matthew 6:33. CHAPTER: 24 I Become A Monk Of The Swami Order \"Master, my father has been anxious for me to accept an executive position with the Bengal-Nagpur Railway. But I have de finitely refused it.\" I added hopefully, \"Sir, will you not make me a monk of th e Swami Order?\" I looked pleadingly at my guru. During preceding years, in order to test the depth of my determination, he had refused this same request. Toda y, however, he smiled graciously. \"Very well; tomorrow I will initiate you into swamiship.\" He went on quietly, \"I am happy that you have persisted in your desire to be a monk. Lahiri Mahasaya often said: 'If you don't invite God to be your summer Guest, He won't come in the winter of your life.'\" \"Dear master, I could never falter in my goal to belong to the Swami Order like your revered self.\" I smiled at him with measureless affection."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"\"He that is unmarried careth for the thin gs that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: but he that is married ca reth for the things of the world, how he may please his wife.\" 24-1 I had analyzed the lives of many of my friends who, after undergoing certain spiritual discipline, ha d then married. Launched on the sea of worldly responsibilities, they had forgotte n their resolutions to meditate deeply. To allot God a secondary place in life was, to me, inconceivable. Though He is the sole Owner of the cosmos, silently showerin g us with gifts from life to life, one thing yet remains which He does not own, and which each human heart is empowered to withhold or bestow-man's love. The Creator, in taking infinite pains to shroud with mystery His presence in every atom of creation, could have had but one motive-a sensitive desire th at men seek Him only through free will. With what velvet glove of every humility has He not covered the iron hand of omnipotence! The following day was one of the most memorable in my life. It was a sunny Thursday, I remember, in July, 1914, a few weeks after my graduation from college. On the inner balcony of his Se rampore hermitage, Master dipped a new piece of white silk into a dye of ocher, the traditional color of the Swami Order. After the cloth had dried, my guru draped it around me as a renunciate's robe. \"Someday you will go to the West, where si lk is preferred,\" he said. \"As a symbol, I have chosen for you this silk material instead of the customary cotton.\" In India, where monks embrace the ideal of poverty, a silk-clad swami is an unusual sight. Many yogis, however, we ar garments of silk, which preserves certain subtle bodily currents better than cotton. \"I am averse to ceremonies,\" Sri Yukteswar remarked. \"I will make you a swami in the bidwat (non-ceremonious) manner.\" The bibidisa or elaborate initiation into swamiship includes a fire ceremony, during which symbolical funeral rites ar e performed. The physical body of the"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"disciple is represented as dead, cremated in the flame of wisdom. The newly- made swami is then given a chant, such as: \"This atma is Brahma\" 24-2 or \"Thou art That\" or \"I am He.\" Sri Yukteswar, however, with his love of simplicity, dispensed with all formal rites and mere ly asked me to select a new name. \"I will give you the privilege of choosin g it yourself,\" he said, smiling. \"Yogananda,\" I replied, after a moment 's thought. The name literally means \"Bliss ( ananda ) through divine union ( yoga ).\" \"Be it so. Forsaking your family name of Mukunda Lal Ghosh, henceforth you shall be called Yogananda of the Giri branch of the Swami Order.\" As I knelt before Sri Yukteswar, and for the first time heard him pronounce my new name, my heart overflowed with grat itude. How lovingly and tirelessly had he labored, that the boy Mukunda be someday transformed into the monk Yogananda! I joyfully sang a few verses from the long Sanskrit chant of Lord Shankara: \"Mind, nor intellect, nor ego, feeling; Sky nor earth nor metals am I. I am He, I am He, Blessed Spirit, I am He! No birth, no death, no caste have I; Father, mother, have I none. I am He, I am He, Blessed Spirit, I am He! Beyond the flights of fancy, formless am I, Permeating the limbs of all life; Bondage I do not fear; I am free, ever free, I am He, I am He, Blessed Spirit, I am He!\" Every swami belongs to the ancient monastic order which was organized in its present form by Shankara. 24-3 Because it is a formal order, with an unbroken line of saintly representatives serving as acti ve leaders, no man can give himself the title of swami. He rightfully receives it only from another swami; all monks thus trace their spiritual lineage to one co mmon guru, Lord Shankara. By vows of"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"poverty, chastity, and obedience to the sp iritual teacher, many Catholic Christian monastic orders resemble the Order of Swamis. In addition to his new name, usually ending in ananda , the swami takes a title which indicates his formal connection with one of the ten subdivisions of the Swami Order. These dasanamis or ten agnomens include the Giri (mountain), to which Sri Yukteswar, and hence myself, belong. Among the other branches are the Sagar (sea), Bharati (land), Aranya (forest), Puri (tract), Tirtha (place of pilgrimage), and Saraswati (wisdom of nature). The new name received by a swami th us has a twofold significance, and represents the attainment of supreme bliss ( ananda ) through some divine quality or state-love, wisdom, devotion, service, yoga-and through a harmony with nature, as expressed in her infinite vastness of oceans, mountains, skies. The ideal of selfless service to all mankin d, and of renunciation of personal ties and ambitions, leads the majority of swam is to engage actively in humanitarian and educational work in India, or occasi onally in foreign lands. Ignoring all prejudices of caste, creed, class, color, sex, or race, a swami follows the precepts of human brotherhood. His goal is absolute unity with Spirit. Imbuing his waking and sleeping consciousness with the thought, \"I am He,\" he roams contentedly, in the world but not of it. Thus only may he justify his title of swami-one who seeks to achieve union with the Swa or Self. It is needless to add that not all formally titled swamis are equally successful in reaching their high goal. Sri Yukteswar was both a swami and a yogi . A swami, formally a monk by virtue of his connection with the ancient orde r, is not always a yogi. Anyone who practices a scientific technique of God-conta ct is a yogi; he may be either married or unmarried, either a worldly man or on e of formal religious ties. A swami may conceivably follow only the path of dry re asoning, of cold renunciation; but a yogi engages himself in a definite, step-by-step procedure by which the body and mind are disciplined, and the soul liberated. Taking nothing for granted on emotional grounds, or by faith, a yogi practices a th oroughly tested series of exercises which"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"were first mapped out by the ear ly rishis. Yoga has pro duced, in every age of India, men who became truly free, truly Yogi-Christs. Like any other science , yoga is applicable to people of every clime and time.

In Hindu art He is alway s shown with"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"the new moon in His hair, and weari ng a garland of hooded snakes, ancient emblem of evil overcome and perfect wisdom. The \"single\" eye of omniscience is open on His forehead. The ancient rishi Patanjali defines \"yoga\" as \"control of the fluctuations of the mind-stuff.\" 24-4 His very short and masterly expositions, the Yoga Sutras , form one of the six systems of Hindu philosophy. 24-5 In contradistinction to Western philosophies, all six Hindu systems embo dy not only theoretical but practical teachings. In addition to every conceivab le ontological inquiry, the six systems formulate six definite disciplines aimed at the permanent removal of suffering and the attainment of timeless bliss. The common thread linking all six systems is the declaration that no true freedom for man is possible without knowle dge of the ultimate Reality. The later Upanishads uphold the Yoga Sutras , among the six systems, as containing the most efficacious methods for achieving di rect perception of truth. Through the practical techniques of yoga, man leaves behind forever the barren realms of speculation and cognizes in experience the veritable Essence. The Yoga system as outlined by Patanjali is known as the Eightfold Path. The first steps, (1) yama and (2) niyama , require observance of ten negative and positive moralities-avoidance of injury to others, of untruthfulness, of stealing, of incontinence, of gift-receiving (which brin gs obligations); and purity of body and mind, contentment, self- discipline, study, and devotion to God. The next steps are (3) asana (right posture); the spinal column must be held straight, and the body firm in a comfortable position for meditation; (4) pranayama (control of prana , subtle life currents); and (5) pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses from external objects). The last steps are forms of yoga proper: (6) dharana (concentration); holding the mind to one thought; (7) dhyana (meditation), and (8) samadhi (superconscious perception). This is the Eightfold Path of Yoga 24-6 which leads one to the final"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"goal of Kaivalya (Absoluteness), a term which mi ght be more comprehensibly put as \"realization of the Truth beyond all intellectual apprehension.\" \"Which is greater,\" one may ask, \"a swami or a yogi?\" If and when final oneness with God is achieved, the distinctions of the various paths disappear. The Bhagavad Gita , however, points out that the me thods of yoga are all-embracive. Its techniques are not meant only for ce rtain types and temperaments, such as those few who incline toward the monast ic life; yoga requires no formal allegiance. Because the yogic science sati sfies a universal need, it has a natural universal applicability. A true yogi may remain dutifully in the wo rld; there he is like butter on water, and not like the easily-diluted milk of unchurned and undisciplined humanity. To fulfill one's earthly responsibilities is indeed the higher path, provided the yogi, maintaining a mental uninvolvement with eg otistical desires, plays his part as a willing instrument of God. There are a number of great souls, living in American or European or other non- Hindu bodies today who, though th ey may never have heard the words yogi and swami , are yet true exemplars of those terms. Through their disinterested service to mankind, or through their mastery over passions and thoughts, or through their single hearted love of Go d, or through their great powers of concentration, they are, in a sense, yogis; they have set themselves the goal of yoga-self-control. These men could rise to even greater heights if they were taught the definite science of yoga, which makes possible a more conscious direction of one's mind and life. Yoga has been superficially misunderstood by certain Western writers, but its critics have never been its practitioners. Among many thoughtful tributes to yoga may be mentioned one by Dr. C. G. Ju ng, the famous Swiss psychologist. \"When a religious method recommends itself as 'scientific,' it can be certain of its public in the West. Yoga fulfills this expectation,\" Dr. Jung writes. 24-7 \"Quite"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"apart from the charm of the new, and the fascination of the half-understood, there is good cause for Yoga to have many adherents. It offers the possibility of controllable experience, and thus satisfie s the scientific need of 'facts,' and besides this, by reason of its breadth an d depth, its venerable age, its doctrine and method, which include every phase of life, it promises undreamed-of possibilities. \"Every religious or philosophical practice means a psychological discipline, that is, a method of mental hygiene. The manifold, purely bodily procedures of Yoga 24-8 also mean a physiological hygiene which is superior to ordinary gymnastics and breathing exercises, inasmuch as it is not merely mechanistic and scientific, but also philosophical; in its training of the parts of the body, it unites them with the whole of the spirit, as is qu ite clear, for instance, in the Pranayama exercises where Prana is both the breath and the univ ersal dynamics of the cosmos. \"When the thing which the individual is do ing is also a cosmic event, the effect experienced in the body (the innervation) , unites with the emotion of the spirit (the universal idea), and out of this there develops a lively unity which no technique, however scientific, can produc e. Yoga practice is unthinkable, and would also be ineffectual, without the concepts on which Yoga is based. It combines the bodily and the spiritual with each other in an extraordinarily complete way. \"In the East, where these ideas and practices have developed, and where for several thousand years an unbroken trad ition has created the necessary spiritual foundations, Yoga is, as I can readily believe, the perfect and appropriate method of fusing body and mind together so that th ey form a unity which is scarcely to be questioned. This unity creates a psycho logical disposition which makes possible intuitions that transcend consciousness.\" The Western day is indeed nearing when th e inner science of self- control will be found as necessary as the outer conquest of nature.

CHAPTER: 25 Brother Ananta And Sister Nalini \"Ananta cannot live; the sands of his ka rma for this life have run out.\" These inexorable words reached my inner consciousness as I sat one morning in deep meditation. Shortly after I had entered the Swami Order, I paid a visit to my birthplace, Gorakhpur, as a guest of my elder brother Ananta. A sudden illness confined him to his bed; I nursed him lovingly. The solemn inward pronouncement filled me with grief. I felt that I could not bear to remain longer in Gorakhpur, on ly to see my brother removed before my helpless gaze. Amidst uncomprehending crit icism from my relatives, I left India on the first available boat. It cruised al ong Burma and the China Sea to Japan. I disembarked at Kobe, where I spent only a few days. My heart was too heavy for sightseeing. On the return trip to India, the boat touched at Shanghai. There Dr. Misra, the ship's physician, guided me to severa l curio shops, where I selected various presents for Sri Yukteswar and my family and friends. For Ananta I purchased a large carved bamboo piece. No sooner ha d the Chinese salesman handed me the bamboo souvenir than I dropped it on the fl oor, crying out, \"I have bought this for my dear dead brother!\""},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"A clear realization had swept over me that his soul was just being freed in the Infinite. The souvenir was sharply and symbolically cracked by its fall; amidst sobs, I wrote on the bamboo surface: \"For my beloved Ananta, now gone.\" My companion, the doctor, was observing these proceedings with a sardonic smile. \"Save your tears,\" he remarked. \"Why shed them until you are sure he is dead?\" When our boat reached Calcutta, Dr. Mi sra again accompanied me. My youngest brother Bishnu was waiting to greet me at the dock. \"I know Ananta has departed this life,\" I said to Bishnu, before he had had time to speak. \"Please tell me, and the doctor here, when Ananta died.\" Bishnu named the date, which was the very day that I had bought the souvenirs in Shanghai. \"Look here!\" Dr. Misra ejaculated. \"Don't let any word of this get around! The professors will be adding a year's study of mental tele pathy to the medical course, which is already long enough!\" Father embraced me warmly as I entered our Gurpar Road home. \"You have come,\" he said tenderly. Two large tear s dropped from his eyes. Ordinarily undemonstrative, he had never before shown me these signs of affection. Outwardly the grave father, inwardly he possessed the melting heart of a mother. In all his dealings with the family, his dual parental role was distinctly manifest. Soon after Ananta's passing, my younger sister Nalini was brought back from death's door by a divine healing. Before relating the story, I will refer to a few phases of her earlier life. The childhood relationship between Nali ni and myself had not been of the happiest nature. I was very thin; she was thinner still. Through an unconscious"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"motive or \"complex\" which psychiatrists wi ll have no difficulty in identifying, I often used to tease my sister about her cadaverous appearance. Her retorts were equally permeated with the callous fr ankness of extreme youth. Sometimes Mother intervened, ending the childish qu arrels, temporarily, by a gentle box on my ear, as the elder ear. Time passed; Nalini was betrothed to a young Calcutta physician, Panchanon Bose. He received a generous dowry from Father, presumably (as I remarked to Sister) to compensate the bridegroom-to-be for his fate in allying himself with a human bean-pole. Elaborate marriage rites were celebrated in due time. On the wedding night, I joined the large and jovial group of relatives in the living room of our Calcutta home. The bridegroom was leaning on an immense gold-brocaded pillow, with Nalini at his side. A gorgeous purple silk sari 25-1 could not, alas, wholly hide her angularity. I sheltered myself behind the pillow of my new brother-in-law and grinned at him in friendly fashion. He ha d never seen Nalini until the day of the nuptial ceremony, when he finally le arned what he was getting in the matrimonial lottery. Feeling my sympathy, Dr. Bose pointed un obtrusively to Nalini, and whispered in my ear, \"Say, what's this?\" \"Why, Doctor,\" I replied, \"it is a skeleton for your observation!\" Convulsed with mirth, my brother-in-law and I were hard put to it to maintain the proper decorum before our assembled relatives. As the years went on, Dr. Bose endeared himself to our family, who called on him whenever illness arose. He and I became fast friends, often joking together, usually with Nalini as our target. \"It is a medical curiosity,\" my brother-in -law remarked to me one day. \"I have tried everything on your lean sister-cod liver oil, butter, malt, honey, fish, meat,"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"eggs, tonics. Still she fails to bulge even one-hundredth of an inch.\" We both chuckled. A few days later I visited the Bose ho me. My errand there took only a few minutes; I was leaving, unnoticed, I thou ght, by Nalini. As I reached the front door, I heard her voice, cordial but commanding. \"Brother, come here. You are not going to give me the slip this time. I want to talk to you.\" I mounted the stairs to her room. To my surprise, she was in tears. \"Dear brother,\" she said, \"let us bury the old hatchet. I see that your feet are now firmly set on the spiritual path. I want to become like you in every way.\" She added hopefully, \"You are now robust in appearance; can you help me? My husband does not come near me, and I love him so dearly! But still more I want to progress in God- realization, even if I must remain thin 25-2 and unattractive.\" My heart was deeply touched at her plea. Our new friendship steadily progressed; one day she asked to become my disciple. \"Train me in any way you like. I put my trust in God instead of tonics.\" She gathered together an armful of medicines and poured them down the roof drain. As a test of her faith, I asked her to omit from her diet all fish, meat, and eggs. After several months, during which Nalini had strictly followed the various rules I had outlined, and had adhered to her ve getarian diet in spite of numerous difficulties, I paid her a visit. \"Sis, you have been conscientiously obse rving the spiritual injunctions; your reward is near.\" I smiled mischievously. \"How plump do you want to be-as fat as our aunt who hasn't seen her feet in years?\" \"No! But I long to be as stout as you are.\""},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"I replied solemnly. \"By the grace of God, as I have spoken truth always, I speak truly now. 25-3 Through the divine blessings, your body shall verily change from today; in one month it shall have the same weight as mine.\" These words from my heart found fulfillmen t. In thirty days, Nalini's weight equalled mine. The new roundness gave he r beauty; her husband fell deeply in love. Their marriage, begun so inauspicio usly, turned out to be ideally happy. On my return from Japan, I learned that during my absence Nalini had been stricken with typhoid fever. I rushed to her home, and was aghast to find her reduced to a mere skeleton. She was in a coma. \"Before her mind became confused by illness,\" my brother-in-law told me, \"she often said: 'If brother Mukunda were here, I would not be faring thus.'\" He added despairingly, \"The other doctors and myse lf see no hope. Blood dysentery has set in, after her long bout with typhoid.\" I began to move heaven and earth with my prayers. Engaging an Anglo- Indian nurse, who gave me full cooperation, I applied to my sister various yoga techniques of healing. The blood dysentery disappeared. But Dr. Bose shook his head mournfully. \"She simply has no more blood left to shed.\" \"She will recover,\" I replied stoutly. \"I n seven days her feve r will be gone.\" A week later I was thrilled to see Nalini open her eyes and gaze at me with loving recognition. From that day her recovery was swift. Although she regained her usual weight, she bore one sad scar of her nearly fatal illness: her legs were paralyzed. Indian and English specialists pronounced her a hopeless cripple. The incessant war for her life which I ha d waged by prayer had exhausted me. I went to Serampore to ask Sri Yuktesw ar's help. His eyes expressed deep sympathy as I told him of Nalini's plight."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"\"Your sister's legs will be normal at th e end of one month.\" He added, \"Let her wear, next to her skin, a band with an unperforated two-carat pearl, held on by a clasp.\" I prostrated myself at his feet with joyful relief. \"Sir, you are a master; your word of her recovery is enough But if you insist I shall immediately get her a pearl.\" My guru nodded. \"Yes, do that.\" He went on to correctly describe the physical and mental characteristics of Nali ni, whom he had never seen. \"Sir,\" I inquired, \"is this an astrological analysis? You do not know her birth day or hour.\" Sri Yukteswar smiled. \"There is a deeper astrology, not dependent on the testimony of calendars and clocks. Each ma n is a part of the Creator, or Cosmic Man; he has a heavenly body as well as one of earth. The human eye sees the physical form, but the inward eye pene trates more profoundly, even to the universal pattern of which each man is an integral and individual part.\" I returned to Calcutta and purchased a pearl for Nalini. A month later, her paralyzed legs were completely healed. Sister asked me to convey her heartfelt gr atitude to my guru. He listened to her message in silence. But as I was taking my leave, he made a pregnant comment. \"Your sister has been told by many doctors that she can never bear children. Assure her that in a few years she will give birth to two daughters.\" Some years later, to Nalini's joy, she bore a girl, followed in a few years by another daughter. \"Your master has blessed our home, our en tire family,\" my sister said. \"The presence of such a man is a sanctification on the whole of India. Dear brother,"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"please tell Sri Yukteswarji that, through yo u, I humbly count myself as one of his Kriya Yoga disciples.\" 25-1: The gracefully draped dress of Indian women. 25-2: Because most persons in India are thin, reason able plumpness is considered very desirable. 25-3: The Hindu scriptures declare that those who habitually speak the truth will develop the power of materializing their words. What commands they utter from the heart will come true in life. CHAPTER: 26 The Science Of Kriya Yoga The science of Kriya Yoga , mentioned so often in th ese pages, became widely known in modern India through the instrumentality of Lahiri Mahasaya, my guru's guru. The Sanskrit root of Kriya is kri , to do, to act and react; the same root is found in the word karma , the natural principle of cause and effect. Kriya Yoga is thus \"union (yoga) with the Infini te through a certain action or rite.\" A yogi who faithfully follows its technique is gradually freed from karma or the universal chain of causation. Because of certain ancient yogic injuncti ons, I cannot give a full explanation of Kriya Yoga in the pages of a book intended for the general public. The actual technique must be learned from a Kriyaban or Kriya Yogi ; here a broad reference must suffice. Kriya Yoga is a simple, psychophysiological method by which the human blood is decarbonized and recharged with oxygen . The atoms of this extra oxygen are transmuted into life current to rejuve nate the brain and spinal centers. 26-1 By stopping the accumulation of venous blood, the yogi is able to lessen or prevent the decay of tissues; the advanced yogi transmutes his cells into pure energy. Elijah, Jesus, Kabir and other prophets were past masters in the use of Kriya or a similar technique, by which they caused their bodies to dematerialize at will."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Kriya is an ancient science. Lahiri Mahasa ya received it from his guru, Babaji, who rediscovered and clarified the technique after it had been lost in the Dark Ages. \"The Kriya Yoga which I am giving to the world through you in this nineteenth century,\" Babaji told Lahiri Mahasaya, \"is a revival of the same science which Krishna gave, millenniums ago, to Ar juna, and which was later known to Patanjali, and to Christ, St. John, St. Paul, and other disciples.\" Kriya Yoga is referred to by Krishna, India's greatest prophet, in a stanza of the Bhagavad Gita : \"Offering inhaling breath into the outgoing breath, and offering the outgoing breath into the inhaling breath, the yogi neutralizes both these breaths; he thus releases the life force from the heart and brings it under his control.\" 26-2 The interpretation is: \"The yogi arrests decay in the body by an addition of life force, and arrests th e mutations of growth in the body by apan (eliminating current). Thus neutralizing de cay and growth, by quieting the heart, the yogi learns life control.\" Krishna also relates 26-3 that it was he, in a former incarnation, who communicated the indestructible yoga to an ancient illuminato, Vivasvat, who gave it to Manu, the great legislator. 26-4 He, in turn, instructed Ikshwaku, the father of India's solar warrior dynasty. Passing thus from one to another, the royal yoga was guarded by the rishis un til the coming of the materialistic ages. 26- 5 Then, due to priestly secrecy and ma n's indifference, the sacred knowledge gradually became inaccessible. Kriya Yoga is mentioned twice by the ancient sage Patanjali, foremost exponent of yoga, who wrote: \" Kriya Yoga consists of body discipline, mental control, and meditating on Aum .\" 26-6 Patanjali speaks of God as the actual Cosmic Sound of Aum heard in meditation. 26-7 Aum is the Creative Word, 26-8 the sound of the Vibratory Motor. Even the yoga-beginner soon inwardly hears the wondrous sound of Aum . Receiving this blissful spiritual encouragement, the devotee becomes assured that he is in ac tual touch with divine realms."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Patanjali refers a second time to the life-control or Kriya technique thus: \"Liberation can be accomplished by that pranayama which is attained by disjoining the course of inspiration and expiration.\" 26-9 St. Paul knew Kriya Yoga , or a technique very similar to it, by which he could switch life currents to and from the senses. He was therefore able to say: \"Verily, I protest by our rejoicing which I have in Christ, i die daily .\" 26-10 By daily withdrawing his bodily life force, he unit ed it by yoga union with the rejoicing (eternal bliss) of the Christ consciousness. In that felicitous state, he was consciously aware of being dead to the delusive sensory world of maya . In the initial states of God-contact ( sabikalpa samadhi ) the devotee's consciousness merges with the Cosmic Spirit ; his life force is withdrawn from the body, which appears \"dead,\" or motionless an d rigid. The yogi is fully aware of his bodily condition of suspended animation. As he progresses to higher spiritual states ( nirbikalpa samadhi ), however, he communes with God without bodily fixation, and in his ordinary waking consc iousness, even in the midst of exacting worldly duties. 26-11 \" Kriya Yoga is an instrument through which human evolution can be quickened,\" Sri Yukteswar explained to his students. \"The ancient yogis discovered that the secret of cosmic con sciousness is intimately linked with breath mastery. This is India's unique and deathless contribution to the world's treasury of knowledge. The life force, wh ich is ordinarily absorbed in maintaining the heart-pump, must be freed for higher activities by a method of calming and stilling the ceaseless demands of the breath.\" The Kriya Yogi mentally directs his life en ergy to revolve, upward and downward, around the six spinal centers (medullary, cervical, dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal plexuses) which correspond to the twelve astral signs of the zodiac, the symbolic Cosmic Man. One-ha lf minute of revolution of energy around the sensitive spinal cord of man effects subtle progress in his evolution; that half-minute of Kriya equals one year of natural spiritual unfoldment."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"The astral system of a human being, with six (twelve by polarity) inner constellations revolving around the sun of the omniscient spiritual eye, is interrelated with the physical sun and the twelve zodiacal signs. All men are thus affected by an inner and an outer universe. The ancient rishis discovered that man's earthly and heavenly environment, in twelve-year cycles, push him forward on his natural path. The scriptures aver that man requires a million years of normal, diseaseless evolution to perfect his human brain sufficiently to express cosmic consciousness. One thousand Kriya practiced in eight hours gives the yogi, in one day, the equivalent of one thousand years of na tural evolution: 365,000 years of evolution in one year. In three years, a Kriya Yogi can thus accomplish by intelligent self- effort the same result which nature br ings to pass in a million years. The Kriya short cut, of course, can be taken only by deeply developed yogis. With the guidance of a guru, such yogis have carefully prepared their bodies and brains to receive the power created by intensive practice. The Kriya beginner employs his yogic exercise only fourteen to twenty- eight times, twice daily. A number of yogis achieve emancipation in six or twelve or twenty-four or forty-eight years. A yogi who dies before achieving full realization carries with him the good karma of his past Kriya effort; in his new life he is harmoniously propelled towa rd his Infinite Goal. The body of the average man is like a fifty-watt lamp, which cannot accommodate the billion watts of power roused by an excessive practice of Kriya . Through gradual and regular increase of the simple and \"foolproof\" methods of Kriya , man's body becomes astrally transformed day by day, and is finally fitted to express the infinite potentials of cosmi c energy-the first materially active expression of Spirit. Kriya Yoga has nothing in common with the unscientific breathing exercises taught by a number of misguided zealots. Their attempts to forcibly hold breath in the lungs is not only unnatural but decidedly unpleasant. Kriya , on the other"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"hand, is accompanied from the very beginni ng by an accession of peace, and by soothing sensations of regenera tive effect in the spine. The ancient yogic technique converts the breath into mind. By spiritual advancement, one is able to cognize the br eath as an act of mind-a dream-breath. Many illustrations could be given of the mathematic al relationship between man's respiratory rate and the variations in his states of consciousness. A person whose attention is wholly engrossed, as in following some closely knit intellectual argument, or in attempting some delicate or difficult physical feat, automatically breathes very slowly. Fixity of attentio n depends on slow breathing; quick or uneven breaths are an inevitable accom paniment of harmful emotional states: fear, lust, anger. The restless monkey breathes at the rate of 32 times a minute, in contrast to man's average of 18 times. The elephant, tortoise, snake and other animals noted for their longevity have a re spiratory rate which is less than man's. The tortoise, for instance, who may attain the age of 300 years, 26-12 breathes only 4 times per minute. The rejuvenating effects of sleep are due to man's temporary unawareness of body and breathing. The sleeping man becomes a yogi; each night he unconsciously performs the yogic rite of releasing himself from bodily identification, and of merging the life force with healing currents in the main brain region and the six sub-dynamos of his spinal centers. The sleeper thus dips unknowingly into the reservoir of cosmi c energy which sustains all life. The voluntary yogi performs a simp le, natural process consciously, not unconsciously like the slow-paced sleeper. The Kriya Yogi uses his technique to saturate and feed all his physical cells wi th undecaying light and keep them in a magnetized state. He scientifically ma kes breath unnecessary , without producing the states of subconscious sleep or unconsciousness. By Kriya , the outgoing life force is not wa sted and abused in the senses, but constrained to reunite with subtler spinal energies. By such reinforcement of life,"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"the yogi's body and brain cells are electr ified with the spiritual elixir. Thus he removes himself from studied observance of natural laws, which can only take him-by circuitous means as given by proper food, sunlight, and harmonious thoughts-to a million-year Goal. It needs tw elve years of normal healthful living to effect even slight perceptible change in brain structure, and a million solar returns are exacted to sufficiently refine the cerebral tenement for manifestation of cosmic consciousness. Untying the cord of breath whic h binds the soul to the body, Kriya serves to prolong life and enlarge the consciousness to infinity. The yoga method overcomes the tug of war between the mi nd and the matter- bound senses, and frees the devotee to reinherit his eterna l kingdom. He knows his real nature is bound neither by physical encasement nor by breath, symbol of the mortal enslavement to air, to nature's elemental compulsions. Introspection, or \"sitting in the silence,\" is an unscientific way of trying to force apart the mind and senses, tied together by the life force. The contemplative mind, attempting its return to divinity, is constantly dragged back toward the senses by the life currents. Kriya , controlling the mind directly through the life force, is the easiest, most effective, and most scientific avenue of approach to the Infinite. In contrast to the slow, uncertain \"bullock cart\" theological path to God, Kriya may justly be called the \"airplane\" route. The yogic science is based on an empirical consideration of all forms of concentration and meditation exercises. Yo ga enables the devotee to switch off or on, at will, life current from the five sense telephones of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. Attaining this power of sense-di sconnection, the yogi finds it simple to unite his mind at will with divine realms or with the world of matter. No longer is he unwillingly brought back by the life force to the mundane sphere of rowdy sensations and restless thoughts. Ma ster of his body and mind, the Kriya Yogi ultimately achieves victory over the \"last enemy,\" death."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men: And Death once dead, there's no more dying then. 26-13 The life of an advanced Kriya Yogi is influenced, not by effects of past actions, but solely by directions from the soul. The devotee thus avoids the slow, evolutionary monitors of egoistic acti ons, good and bad, of common life, cumbrous and snail-like to the eagle hearts. The superior method of soul living frees the yogi who, shorn of his ego-prison, tastes the deep air of omnipresence. Th e thralldom of natural living is, in contrast, set in a pace humiliating. Confor ming his life to the evolutionary order, a man can command no concessionary haste from nature but, living without error against the laws of his physical and me ntal endowment, still requires about a million years of incarnating masquera des to know final emancipation. The telescopic methods of yogis, dise ngaging themselves from physical and mental identifications in favor of soul-i ndividuality, thus commend themselves to those who eye with revolt a thousand thousand years. This numerical periphery is enlarged for the ordinary man, who live s in harmony not even with nature, let alone his soul, but pursues instead unnatural complexities, thus offending in his body and thoughts the sweet sanities of nature. For him, two times a million years can scarce suffice for liberation. Gross man seldom or never realizes that his body is a kingdom, governed by Emperor Soul on the throne of the cranium, with subsidiary regents in the six spinal centers or spheres of consciousness. This theocracy extends over a throng of obedient subjects: twenty-seven thousa nd billion cells-endowed with a sure if automatic intelligence by which they pe rform all duties of bodily growths, transformations, and dissolutions-and fifty million substratal thoughts, emotions, and variations of alternating phases in man's consciousness in an average life of sixty years.

Identifying himself with a shallow ego, ma n takes for granted that it is he who thinks, wills, feels, digests meals, an d keeps himself alive, never admitting through reflection (only a little would suffi ce!) that in his ordinary life he is naught but a puppet of past actions (kar ma) and of nature or environment. Each man's intellectual reactions, feelings, moods, and habits are circumscribed by effects of past causes, whether of this or a prior life. Lofty above such influences, however, is his regal soul. Spurning the transitory truths and freedoms, the Kriya Yogi passes beyond all disillusionment into his unfettered Being. All scriptures declare man to be not a corruptib le body, but a living soul; by Kriya he is given a method to prove the scriptural truth. \"Outward ritual cannot destroy ignorance, because they are not mutually contradictory,\" wrote Shankara in his famous Century Of Verses . \"Realized knowledge alone destroys ignorance. . . . Knowledge cannot spring up by any other means than inquiry. 'Who am I? How was this universe born? Who is its maker? What is its material cause?' This is the kind of inquiry referred to.\" The intellect has no answer for these question s; hence the rishis evolved yoga as the technique of spiritual inquiry. Kriya Yoga is the real \"fire rite\" often extolled in the Bhagavad Gita . The purifying fires of yoga bring eternal illumination, and thus differ much from outward and little-effective religious fire ceremonies, where perception of truth is oft burnt, to solemn chanted accompaniment, along with the incense! The advanced yogi, withholding all hi s mind, will, and feeling from false identification with bodily desires, unitin g his mind with superconscious forces in the spinal shrines, thus lives in this wo rld as God hath planned, not impelled by impulses from the past nor by new witl essnesses of fresh human motivations. Such a yogi receives fulfillment of his Su preme Desire, safe in the final haven of inexhaustibly blissful Spirit."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"The yogi offers his labyrinthine human longings to a monotheistic bonfire dedicated to the unparalleled God.

CHAPTER: 27 Founding A Yoga School At Ranchi \"Why are you averse to organizational work?\" Master's question startled me a bit. It is true that my private conviction at the time was that organization s were \"hornets' nests.\" \"It is a thankless task, sir,\" I answered. \"No matter what the leader does or does not, he is criticized.\" \"Do you want the whole divine channa (milk curd) for yourself alone?\" My guru's retort was accompanied by a stern glance . \"Could you or anyone else achieve God-contact through yoga if a line of generous- hearted masters had not been"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"willing to convey their knowledge to othe rs?\" He added, \"God is the Honey, organizations are the hives; both are necessary. Any form is useless, of course, without the spirit, but why should you no t start busy hives full of the spiritual nectar?\" His counsel moved me deeply. Although I made no outward reply, an adamant resolution arose in my breast: I would shar e with my fellows, so far as lay in my power, the unshackling truths I had learne d at my guru's feet. \"Lord,\" I prayed, \"may Thy Love shine forever on the sanctuary of my devotion, and may I be able to awaken that Love in other hearts.\" On a previous occasion, before I had join ed the monastic order, Sri Yukteswar had made a most unexpected remark. \"How you will miss the compa nionship of a wife in your old age!\" he had said. \"Do you not agree that the family man, en gaged in useful work to maintain his wife and children, thus plays a rewarding role in God's eyes?\" \"Sir,\" I had protested in alarm, \"you know th at my desire in this life is to espouse only the Cosmic Beloved.\" Master had laughed so merrily that I understood his observation was made merely as a test of my faith. \"Remember,\" he had said slowly, \"that he who discards his worldly duties can justify himself only by assuming some kind of responsibility toward a much larger family.\" The ideal of an all-sided education for youth had always been close to my heart. I saw clearly the arid results of ordina ry instruction, aimed only at the development of body and intellect. Mora l and spiritual values, without whose appreciation no man can approach happi ness, were yet lacking in the formal curriculum. I determined to found a school where young boys could develop to"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"the full stature of manhood. My first step in that direction was made with seven children at Dihika, a small country site in Bengal. A year later, in 1918, through the genero sity of Sir Manindra Chandra Nundy, the Maharaja of Kasimbazar, I was able to tr ansfer my fast- growing group to Ranchi. This town in Bihar, about two hundred mi les from Calcutta, is blessed with one of the most healthful climates in India. The Kasimbazar Palace at Ranchi was transformed into the headquarters for the new school, which I called Brahmacharya Vidyalaya 27-1 in accordance with the educational ideals of the rishis. Their forest ashrams had been the ancient seats of learning, secular and divine, for the youth of India. At Ranchi I organized an educational pr ogram for both grammar and high school grades. It included agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic subjects. The students were also taught yoga concentration and meditation, and a unique system of physical development, \"Yogoda, \" whose principles I had discovered in 1916. Realizing that man's body is like an elec tric battery, I reasoned that it could be recharged with energy through the direct agency of the human will. As no action, slight or large, is possible without willing , man can avail himself of his prime mover, will, to renew his bodily tissu es without burdensome apparatus or mechanical exercises. I therefore taught the Ranchi students my simple \"Yogoda\" techniques by which the life force, cent red in man's medulla oblongata, can be consciously and instantly recharged from the unlimited supply of cosmic energy. The boys responded wonderfully to this tr aining, developing extraordinary ability to shift the life energy from one part of the body to another part, and to sit in perfect poise in difficult body postures. 27-2 They performed feats of strength and endurance which many powerful adults could not equal. My youngest brother, Bishnu Charan Ghosh, joined the Ranchi school; he later became a leading physical culturist in Bengal. He and one of his students traveled to Europe and"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"America, giving exhibitions of strength and skill which amazed the university savants, in cluding those at Colu mbia University in New York. At the end of the first year at Ranchi , applications for admission reached two thousand. But the school, which at that time was solely residential, could accommod ate only about one hundred. Instruction for day students was soon added. In the Vidyalaya I had to play father-mother to the little children, and to cope with many organizational di fficulties. I often remembered Christ's words: \"Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, a nd children, and lands, with perse cutions; and in the wo rld to come eternal life.\" 27- 3 Sri Yukteswar had interpreted these words: \"The devotee who forgoes the life-experiences of marriage and family, and exchanges the problems of a small househo ld and limited activities for the lar ger responsibilities of service to society in general, is undertaking a task which is often accompanied by persecution from a misunderstanding world, but also by a divine inner contentment.\" Yogoda Math , beautiful hermitage of Self -Realization Fellowship at Dakshines war on the Ganges.

One day my father arrived in Ranchi to be stow a patern al blessing, long withh eld because I had hurt him by refusi ng his offe r of a position with the Bengal-Nagpur Railway. \"Son,\" he said, \"I am now reconciled to your choice in life. It gives me joy to see you amidst these happy, eager youngsters; you belong here rather than with the lifeless figures of railroad timetabl es.\" He wav ed toward a group of a dozen little ones who were tagging at my hee ls. \"I had only eight ch ildren,\" he observed with twinkling eyes, \"but I can feel for you!\" With a large fruit orchard and twenty-f ive fertile acres at our disposal, the students, teachers, and myself enjoyed many happy hours of outdoor labor in these ideal surroundings. We had many pets, including a young deer who was fairly idoliz ed by the children. I too love d the fawn so much that I allowed it to sleep in my room. At the light of dawn, th e little creature would toddle over to my bed for a morning caress. One day I fed the pet earlier than usual, as I had to attend to some business in the town of Ra nchi. Altho ugh I cautioned th e boys not to feed the fawn until my return, one of them was disobedient, and gave the baby deer a larg e quantity of"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"milk. When I came back in the evening, sad news greeted me: \"The little fawn is nearly dead, through over feeding.\" In tears, I placed the apparently lifeless pet on my lap. I prayed piteously to God to spare its life. Hours later, the small creature opened its eyes, stood up, and walked feebly. The whole school shouted for joy. But a deep lesson came to me that night, one I can never forget. I stayed up with the fawn until two o'clock, when I fell asl eep. The deer appeared in a dream, and spoke to me: \"You are holding me back. Please let me go; let me go!\" \"All right,\" I answered in the dream. I awoke immediately, and cried out, \"Boys, the deer is dy ing!\" The children rushed to my side. I ran to the corner of the room where I had placed the pet. It made a last effort to rise, stumbled toward me, then dropped at my feet, dead. According to the mass karma which guides and regulates the destinies of animals, the deer's life was over, and it was ready to progress to a higher form. But by my deep attachment, which I later realized wa s selfish, and by my fervent prayers, I had been able to hold it in the limitation s of the animal form from which the soul was struggling for release. The soul of the deer made its plea in a dream because, without my loving permission, it either would not or could not go. As soon as I agreed, it departed. All sorrow left me; I realized anew that Go d wants His children to love everything as a part of Him, and not to feel delusive ly that death ends all.

But the man of un attachment, he who loves others as"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"expressions of the Lord, understands that at death the dear ones have only returned for a breathing-space of joy in Him. The Ranchi school grew from small and simple beginnings to an institution now well-known in India. Many departments of the school are supported by voluntary contributions from those who rejoice in perp etuating the educational ideals of the rishis. Under the general name of Yogoda Sat-Sanga , 27-4 flourishing branch schools have been established at Mi dnapore, Lakshmanpur, and Puri. The Ranchi headquarters maintains a Me dical Department where medicines and the services of doctors are supplied freely to the poor of the locality. The number treated has averaged more than 18,000 persons a year. The Vidyalaya has made its mark, too, in Indian competitive spor ts, and in the scholastic field, where many Ranchi alumni have distinguished themselves in later university life. The school, now in its twenty-eighth year and the center of many activities, 27-5 has been honored by visits of eminent men from the East and the West. One of the earliest great figures to inspect the Vidyalaya in its first year was Swami Pranabananda, the Benares \"saint with tw o bodies.\" As the great master viewed the picturesque outdoor classes, held unde r the trees, and saw in the evening that young boys were sitting motionless fo r hours in yoga meditation, he was profoundly moved. \"Joy comes to my heart,\" he said, \"to s ee that Lahiri Mahasaya's ideals for the proper training of youth are being carri ed on in this institution. My guru's blessings be on it.\" A young lad sitting by my side ventured to ask the great yogi a question. \"Sir,\" he said, \"shall I be a monk ? Is my life only for God?\" Though Swami Pranabananda smiled gently , his eyes were piercing the future."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"\"Child,\" he replied, \"when you grow up, there is a beautiful bride waiting for you.\" The boy did eventually marry, after having planned for years to enter the Swami Order. Sometime after Swami Pranabananda had visited Ranchi, I accompanied my father to the Calcutta house where the yogi was temporarily staying. Pranabananda's prediction, made to me so many years before, came rushing to my mind: \"I shall see you, with your father, later on.\" As Father entered the swami's room, the great yogi rose from his seat and embraced my parent wi th loving respect. \"Bhagabati,\" he said, \"what are you doin g about yourself? Don't you see your son racing to the Infinite?\" I blushed to hear his praise before my father. The swami went on, \"You recall how often ou r blessed guru used to say: ' Banat, banat, ban jai .' 26-6 So keep up Kriya Yoga ceaselessly, and reach the divine portals quickly.\" The body of Pranabananda, which had appeared so well and strong during my amazing first visit to him in Benares, now showed definite aging, though his posture was still admirably erect. \"Swamiji,\" I inquired, looking straight into his eyes, \"please tell me the truth: Aren't you feeling the advance of age? As the body is weakening, are your perceptions of God suffering any diminution?\" He smiled angelically. \"The Beloved is more than ever with me now.\" His complete conviction overwhelmed my mind and soul. He went on, \"I am still enjoying the two pensions-one from Bhagabati here, and one from above.\" Pointing his finger heavenward, the saint fell into an ecstasy, his face lit with a divine glow-an ample answer to my question. Noticing that Pranabananda's room contain ed many plants and packages of seed, I asked their purpose."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"\"I have left Benares permanently,\" he said, \"and am now on my way to the Himalayas. There I shall open an ashr am for my disciples. These seeds will produce spinach and a few other vegeta bles. My dear ones will live simply, spending their time in blissful God- union. Nothing else is necessary.\" Father asked his brother disciple when he would return to Calcutta. \"Never again,\" the saint replied. \"This ye ar is the one in which Lahiri Mahasaya told me I would leave my beloved Benares forever and go to the Himalayas, there to throw off my mortal frame.\" My eyes filled with tears at his words, but the swami smiled tranquilly. He reminded me of a little heavenly child, si tting securely on the lap of the Divine Mother. The burden of the years has no i ll effect on a great yogi's full possession of supreme spiritual powers. He is able to renew his body at will; yet sometimes he does not care to retard the aging proce ss, but allows his karma to work itself out on the physical plane, using his old body as a time-saving device to exclude the necessity of working out karma in a new incarnation. Months later I met an old friend, Sana ndan, who was one of Pranabananda's close disciples. \"My adorable guru is gone,\" he told me, amidst sobs. \"He established a hermitage near Rishikesh, and gave us loving trai ning. When we were pretty well settled, and making rapid spiritual progress in his company, he proposed one day to feed a huge crowd from Rishikesh. I inquired why he wanted such a large number. \"'This is my last festival ceremony,' he said. I did not understand the full implications of his words. \"Pranabanandaji helped with the cooking of great amounts of food. We fed about 2000 guests. After the feast, he sat on a high platform and gave an inspired sermon on the Infinite. At the end, before the gaze of thousands, he turned to me, as I sat beside him on the dais, and spoke with unusual force."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"\"'Sanandan, be prepared; I am going to kick the frame. 27-7 ' \"After a stunned silence, I cried loudly, 'M aster, don't do it! Please, please, don't do it!' The crowd was tongue-tied, watching us curiously. My guru smiled at me, but his solemn gaze was already fixed on Eternity. \"'Be not selfish,' he said, 'nor grieve fo r me. I have been long cheerfully serving you all; now rejoice and wish me Godspeed . I go to meet my Cosmic Beloved.' In a whisper, Pranabanandaji added, 'I shal l be reborn shortly. After enjoying a short period of the Infinite Bliss, I shall return to earth and join Babaji. 27-8 You shall soon know when and where my soul has been en cased in a new body.' \"He cried again, 'Sanandan, here I kick the frame by the second Kriya Yoga .' 27-9 \"He looked at the sea of faces before us , and gave a blessing. Directing his gaze inwardly to the spiritual eye, he became immobile. While the bewildered crowd thought he was meditating in an ecstatic state, he had already left the tabernacle of flesh and plunged his soul into the cosmic vastness. The di sciples touched his body, seated in the lotus posture, but it was no longer the warm flesh. Only a stiffened frame remained; the tenant had fled to the immortal shore.\" I inquired where Pranabananda was to be reborn. \"That's a sacred trust I cannot divulge to anyone,\" Sanandan replied. \"Perhaps you may find out some other way.\" Years later I discovered from Swami Keshabananda 27-10 that Pranabananda, a few years after his birth in a new body , had gone to Badrinarayan in the Himalayas, and there joined the group of saints around the great Babaji. 27-1: Vidyalaya , school.

We enjoyed a picnic lunch after we reached our destination. I sat under a tree, surrounded by a group of students. Finding me in an inspirational mood, they plied me with questions. \"Please tell me, sir,\" one youth inquired, \"i f I shall always stay with you in the path of renunciation.\" \"Ah, no,\" I replied, \"you will be forcibly taken away to your home, and later you will marry.\" Incredulous, he made a vehement protest. \"Only if I am dead can I be carried home.\" But in a few months, his parents a rrived to take him away, in spite of his tearful resistance; some years later, he did marry. After answering many questions, I was a ddressed by a lad named Kashi. He was about twelve years old, a brilliant student, and beloved by all. \"Sir,\" he said, \"what will be my fate?\" \"You shall soon be dead.\" The reply came fr om my lips with an irresistible force. This unexpected disclosure shocked and gr ieved me as well as everyone present. Silently rebuking myself as an enfant terrible , I refused to answer further questions. On our return to the school, Kashi came to my room. \"If I die, will you find me when I am re born, and bring me again to the spiritual path?\" He sobbed."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"I felt constrained to refuse this difficult occult responsibility. But for weeks afterward, Kashi pressed me doggedly. Seeing him unnerved to the breaking point, I finally consoled him. \"Yes,\" I promised. \"If the Heavenly Father lends His aid, I will try to find you.\" During the summer vacation, I started on a short trip. Regretting that I could not take Kashi with me, I called him to my room before leaving, and carefully instructed him to remain, against all persuasion, in the spiritual vibrations of the school. Somehow I felt that if he did no t go home, he might avoid the impending calamity. No sooner had I left than Kashi's father arrived in Ranchi. For fifteen days he tried to break the will of his son, explaining that if Kashi would go to Calcutta for only four days to see his mother, he could then return. Kashi persistently refused. The father finally said he would take the boy away with the help of the police. The threat disturbed Kashi, who was unwilling to be the cause of any unfavorable publicity to the school. He saw no choice but to go. I returned to Ranchi a few days late r. When I heard how Kashi had been removed, I entrained at once for Calcutta. There I engaged a horse cab. Very strangely, as the vehicle passed beyond the Howrah bridge over the Ganges, I beheld Kashi's father and other relatives in mourning clothes. Shouting to my driver to stop, I rushed out and glared at the unfortunate father. \"Mr. Murderer,\" I cried somewhat unre asonably, \"you have killed my boy!\" The father had already realized the wrong he had done in forcibly bringing Kashi to Calcutta. During the few days the boy had been there, he had eaten contaminated food, contracted cholera, and passed on. My love for Kashi, and the pledge to find him after death, night and day haunted me.

Walking with a few friends one morning in the crowded Bowbazar section of Calcutta, I lifted my hands in the usual manner. For the first time, there was response. I thrilled to detect electrical impulses trickling down my fingers and palms. These currents translated themselves into one overpowering thought from a deep recess of my consciousness: \"I am Kashi; I am Kashi; come to me!\" The thought became almost audible as I concentrated on my heart radio. In the characteristic, slightly hoarse whisper of Kashi, 28-2 I heard his summons again and again. I seized the arm of on e of my companions, Prokash Das, 28-3 and smiled at him joyfully. \"It looks as though I have located Kashi!\" I began to turn round and round, to the undisguised amusement of my friends and the passing throng. The electrical im pulses tingled through my fingers only when I faced toward a near-by path, aptly named \"Serpentine Lane.\" The astral currents disappeared when I turned in other directions. \"Ah,\" I exclaimed, \"Kashi's soul must be living in the womb of some mother whose home is in this lane.\" My companions and I approached closer to Serpentine Lane; the vibrations in my upraised hands grew stronger, more pronou nced. As if by a magnet, I was pulled toward the right side of the road. Reaching the entrance of a certain house, I was astounded to find myself transfixed. I knocked at the door in a state of intense excitement, holding my very breath. I fe lt that the successful end had come for my long, arduous, and certainly unusual quest!

His disposition will be notably spiritual.\" I felt certain that the coming child would bear these resemblances to Kashi. Later I visited the child, whose parents had given him his old name of Kashi. Even in infancy he was strikingly simi lar in appearance to my dear Ranchi student. The child showed me an instanta neous affection; the attraction of the past awoke with redoubled intensity. Years later the teen-age boy wrote me, du ring my stay in Ame rica. He explained his deep longing to follow the path of a renunciate. I directed him to a Himalayan master who, to this day, guides the reborn Kashi. 28-1: The will, projected from the point between the eyebrows, is known by yogis as the broadcasting apparatus of thought. When the feeling is calmly concentrated on the heart, it acts as a mental radio, and can receive th e messages of others from far or near. In telepathy the fine vibrations of thoughts in one person's mind are tr ansmitted through the subtle vibrations of astral ether and then through the grosser earthly ether, creating electrical waves which, in turn, translate themselves into thought waves in the mind of the other person. 28-2: Every soul in its pure state is omniscient.

With or without provocation, the boy poured forth a tuneful stream. He had previously attended the famous Tagore school of \"Santiniketan\" (Haven of Peace) at Bolpur. \"The songs of Rabindranath have been on my lips sinc e early youth,\" I told my companion. \"All Bengal, even the unlettered pe asants, delights in his lofty verse.\" Bhola and I sang together a few refrai ns from Tagore, who has set to music thousands of Indian poems, some original and others of hoary antiquity. \"I met Rabindranath soon after he had re ceived the Nobel Prize for literature,\" I remarked after our vocalizing. \"I was dr awn to visit him because I admired his undiplomatic courage in disposing of his literary critics.\" I chuckled. Bhola curiously inquired the story. \"The scholars severely flayed Tagore for introducing a new style into Bengali poetry,\" I began. \"He mixed colloquial and classical expressions, ignoring all the prescribed limitations dear to the pu ndits' hearts. His songs embody deep philosophic truth in emotionally appeal ing terms, with little regard for the accepted literary forms. \"One influential critic slightingly referre d to Rabindranath as a 'pigeon-poet who sold his cooings in print for a rupee.' B ut Tagore's revenge was at hand; the whole Western world paid homage at his feet soon after he had translated into English"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"his Gitanjali (\"Song Offerings\"). A trainload of pundits, including his one-time critics, went to Santiniketan to offer their congratulations. \"Rabindranath received his guests only afte r an intentionally long delay, and then heard their praise in stoic silence. Fi nally he turned against them their own habitual weapons of criticism. \"'Gentlemen,' he said, 'the fragrant ho nors you here bestow are incongruously mingled with the putrid odors of your past contempt. Is there possibly any connection between my award of the No bel Prize, and your suddenly acute powers of appreciation? I am still the sa me poet who displeased you when I first offered my humble flowers at the shrine of Bengal.' \"The newspapers published an account of the bold chastisement given by Tagore. I admired the outspoken words of a man unhypnotized by flattery,\" I went on. \"I was introduced to Rabindranath in Calcutta by his secretary, Mr. C. F. Andrews, 29-1 who was simply attired in a Bengali dhoti . He referred lovingly to Tagore as his gurudeva . \"Rabindranath received me graciously. He emanated a soothing aura of charm, culture, and courtliness. Replying to my question about his literary background, Tagore told me that one ancient source of his inspiration, besides our religious epics, had been the classical poet, Bidyapati.\" Inspired by these memories, I began to si ng Tagore's version of an old Bengali song, \"Light the Lamp of Thy Love.\" Bhol a and I chanted joyously as we strolled over the Vidyalaya grounds. About two years after founding the Ranchi school, I received an invitation from Rabindranath to visit him at Santiniketan in order to discuss our educational ideals. I went gladly. The poet was seated in his study when I entered; I thought then, as at our first meeting, that he wa s as striking a model of superb manhood as any painter could desire. His beautifu lly chiseled face, nobly patrician, was"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"framed in long hair and flowing beard. La rge, melting eyes; an angelic smile; and a voice of flutelike quality which was li terally enchanting. Stalwart, tall, and grave, he combined an almost woma nly tenderness with the delightful spontaneity of a child. No idealized concept ion of a poet could find more suitable embodiment than in this gentle singer. Tagore and I were soon deep in a compara tive study of our schools, both founded along unorthodox lines. We discovered many identical features-outdoor instruction, simplicity, ample scope for the child's creative spirit. Rabindranath, however, laid considerable stress on the study of literature and poetry, and the self-expression through music and song wh ich I had already noted in the case of Bhola. The Santiniketan children observed periods of silence, but were given no special yoga training. The poet listened with flattering attent ion to my description of the energizing \"Yogoda\" exercises and the yoga concentrati on techniques which are taught to all students at Ranchi. Tagore told me of his own early educational struggles. \"I fled from school after the fifth grade,\" he said, laughing. I cou ld readily understa nd how his innate poetic delicacy had been affronted by th e dreary, disciplinary atmosphere of a schoolroom. \"That is why I opened Santiniketan under the shady trees and the glories of the sky.\" He motioned eloquently to a little gr oup studying in the beautiful garden. \"A child is in his natural setting amidst the flowers and songbirds. Only thus may he fully express the hidden wealth of his in dividual endowment. True education can never be crammed and pumped from witho ut; rather it must aid in bringing spontaneously to the surface the infi nite hoards of wisdom within.\" 29-2 I agreed. \"The idealistic and hero-worshiping instincts of the young are starved on an exclusive diet of statistics and chronological eras.\""},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"The poet spoke lovingly of his father, Devendranath, who had inspired the Santiniketan beginnings. \"Father presented me with this fertile land, where he had already built a guest house and temple,\" Rabindranath told me. \"I started my educational experiment here in 1901, with only ten boys. The ei ght thousand pounds which came with the Nobel Prize all went for the upkeep of the school.\" The elder Tagore, Devendranath, known far and wide as \"Maharishi,\" was a very remarkable man, as one may discover from his Autobiography . Two years of his manhood were spent in meditation in the Himalayas. In turn, his father, Dwarkanath Tagore, had been celebrated throughout Bengal for his munificent public benefactions. From this illustriou s tree has sprung a family of geniuses. Not Rabindranath alone; all his relati ves have distinguished themselves in creative expression. His brothers, Gogonendra and Abanindra, are among the foremost artists 29-3 of India; another brother, Dwijendra, is a deep-seeing philosopher, at whose gentle call the bi rds and woodland creatures respond. Rabindranath invited me to stay overnigh t in the guest house. It was indeed a charming spectacle, in the evening, to see the poet seated with a group in the patio. Time unfolded backward: the scene before me was like that of an ancient hermitage-the joyous singer encircled by hi s devotees, all aureoled in divine love. Tagore knitted each tie with the cords of harmony. Never assertive, he drew and captured the heart by an irresistible ma gnetism. Rare blossom of poesy blooming in the garden of the Lord, attracting others by a natural fragrance! In his melodious voice, Rabindranath read to us a few of his exquisite poems, newly created. Most of his songs and pl ays, written for the delectation of his students, have been composed at Santiniket an. The beauty of his lines, to me, lies in his art of referring to God in nearly every stanza, yet seldom mentioning the sacred Name. \"Drunk with the bliss of sing ing,\" he wrote, \"I forget myself and call thee friend who art my lord.\""},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"The following day, after lunch, I bade the poet a reluctant farewell.

CHAPTER: 30 The Law Of Miracles"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"The great novelist Leo Tolstoy wrote a delightful story, The Three Hermits . His friend Nicholas Roerich 30-1 has summarized the tale, as follows: \"On an island there lived three old hermit s. They were so simple that the only prayer they used was: 'We are three; Thou art Three-have mercy on us!' Great miracles were manifested during this naive prayer. \"The local bishop 30-2 came to hear about the three hermits and their inadmissible prayer, and decided to visi t them in order to teach them the canonical invocations. He arrived on the island, told the hermits that their heavenly petition was undignified, and taught them many of the customary prayers. The bishop then left on a boat . He saw, following the ship, a radiant light. As it approached, he discerned the three hermits, who were holding hands and running upon the waves in an effort to overtake the vessel. \"'We have forgotten the prayers you taught us,' they cried as they reached the bishop, 'and have hastened to ask you to repeat them.' The awed bishop shook his head. \"'Dear ones,' he replied humbly, 'conti nue to live with your old prayer!'\" How did the three saints walk on the water? How did Christ resurrect his crucified body? How did Lahiri Mahasaya and Sri Yuk teswar perform their miracles? Modern science has, as yet, no answer; though with the advent of the atomic bomb and the wonders of radar, the scope of the world-mind has been abruptly enlarged. The word \"impossible\" is be coming less prominent in the scientific vocabulary. The ancient Vedic scriptures declare that the physical world operates under one fundamental law of maya , the principle of relativity and duality. God, the Sole"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Life, is an Absolute Unity; He canno t appear as the separate and diverse manifestations of a creation except under a false or unreal veil. That cosmic illusion is maya . Every great scientific discovery of modern times has served as a confirmation of this simple pronouncement of the rishis. Newton's Law of Motion is a law of maya : \"To every action there is always an equal and contrary reaction; the mutual actions of any two bodies are always equal and oppositely directed.\" Action and reaction are thus exactly equal. \"To have a single force is impossible. There mu st be, and always is, a pair of forces equal and opposite.\" Fundamental natural activities all betray their mayic origin. Electricity, for example, is a phenomenon of repulsion and attraction; its electrons and protons are electrical opposites. Another example: the atom or final particle of matter is, like the earth itself, a magnet with po sitive and negative poles. The entire phenomenal world is under the inexorable sway of polarity; no law of physics, chemistry, or any other science is ever found free from inherent opposite or contrasted principles. Physical science, then, cannot formulate laws outside of maya , the very texture and structure of creation. Nature herself is maya ; natural science must perforce deal with her ineluctable quiddity. In her own domain, she is eternal and inexhaustible; future scientists can do no more than probe one aspect after another of her varied infinitude. Science thus remains in a perpetual flux, unable to reach finality; fit indeed to formulat e the laws of an already existing and functioning cosmos, but powerless to dete ct the Law Framer and Sole Operator. The majestic manifestations of gravitat ion and electricity have become known, but what gravitation and electricity are, no mortal knoweth. 30-3 "},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":" -by B. K.

All ot he rs are wo rshiping"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"heathen images. So long as man remains subject to the dualistic delusions of nature, the Janus-faced Maya is his goddess; he cannot know the one true God. The world illusion, maya , is individually called avidya , literally, \"not- knowledge,\" ignorance, delusion. Maya or avidya can never be destroyed through intellectual conviction or analysis, but solely through attaining the interior state of nirbikalpa samadhi . The Old Testament prophets, and seers of all lands and ages, spoke from that state of consciousness. Ezekiel says (43:1-2): \"Afterwards he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east: and, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.\" Through the divine eye in the forehead (east), the yogi sails his consciousness into omnipresence, hearing the Word or Aum, divine sound of many waters or vibrations which is the sole reality of creation. Among the trillion mysteries of the cosmos, the most phenomenal is light. Unlike sound-waves, whose transmission requires air or other material media, light- waves pass freely through the vacuum of in terstellar space. Even the hypothetical ether, held as the interplanetary medium of light in the undulatory theory, can be discarded on the Einsteinian grounds that the geometrical properties of space render the theory of ether unnecessary. Under either hypothesis, light remains the most subtle, the freest from material dependence, of any natural manifestation. In the gigantic conceptions of Einstein , the velocity of light-186,000 miles per second-dominates the whole Theory of Rela tivity. He proves mathematically that the velocity of light is, so far as ma n's finite mind is concerned, the only constant in a universe of unstayable flux. On the so le absolute of light-velocity depend all human standards of time and space. Not abstractly eternal as hitherto considered, time and space are relative and finite factors, deriving their measurement validity only in reference to the yardstick of light-velocity. In joining space as a dimensional relativity, time has surrendered age- old claims to"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"a changeless value. Time is now stripped to its rightful nature-a simple essence of ambiguity! With a few equational strokes of his pen, Einstein has banished from the cosmos every fixed reality except that of light. In a later development, his Unified Field Theory, the great physicist embodies in one mathematical formula the laws of gravitation and of electromagnetism. Reducing the cosmical structure to vari ations on a single law, Einstein 30-4 reaches across the ages to the rishis wh o proclaimed a sole texture of creation- that of a protean maya . On the epochal Theory of Relativity have arisen the mathematical possibilities of exploring the ultimate atom. Great scientists are now boldly asserting not only that the atom is energy rather than matte r, but that atomic energy is essentially mind-stuff. \"The frank realization that physical scie nce is concerned with a world of shadows is one of the most significant advances,\" Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington writes in The Nature Of Th e Physical World . \"In the world of physics we watch a shadowgraph performance of the drama of familiar life. The shadow of my elbow rests on the shadow table as the shadow in k flows over the shadow paper. It is all symbolic, and as a symbol the physicist le aves it. Then comes the alchemist Mind who transmutes the symbols. . . . To put the conclusion crudely, the stuff of the world is mind-stuff. . . . The realistic matter and fields of force of former physical theory are altogether irrelevant except in so far as the mind-stuff has itself spun these imaginings. . . . The external world has thus become a worl d of shadows. In removing our illusions we have removed th e substance, for indeed we have seen that substance is one of the greatest of our illusions.\" With the recent discovery of the electron microscope came definite proof of the light-essence of atoms and of the inescapable duality of nature. The New York Times gave the following report of a 1937 demonstration of the electron microscope before a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science:"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"\"The crystalline structure of tungsten, hith erto known only indirectly by means of X-rays, stood outlined boldly on a fluore scent screen, showing nine atoms in their correct positions in the space lattice, a cube, with one atom in each corner and one in the center. The atoms in the crysta l lattice of the tungsten appeared on the fluorescent screen as points of light, a rranged in geometric pattern. Against this crystal cube of light the bombarding molecules of air could be observed as dancing points of light, similar to poin ts of sunlight shimmering on moving waters. . . . \"The principle of the electron microscope was first discovered in 1927 by Drs. Clinton J. Davisson and Lester H. Germ er of the Bell Telephone Laboratories, New York City, who found that the electron had a dual personality partaking of the characteristic of both a particle and a wave. The wave quality gave the electron the characteristic of light, and a search was begun to devise means for 'focusing' electrons in a manner similar to the focusing of light by means of a lens. \"For his discovery of the Jekyll-Hyde qu ality of the electron, which corroborated the prediction made in 1924 by De Brogli e, French Nobel Prize winning physicist, and showed that the entire realm of phys ical nature had a dual personality, Dr. Davisson also received the Nobel Prize in physics.\" \"The stream of knowledge,\" Sir James Jeans writes in The Mysterious Universe , \"is heading towards a non-mechanical realit y; the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great ma chine.\" Twentieth-century science is thus sounding like a page from the hoary Vedas . From science, then, if it must be so, le t man learn the philosophic truth that there is no material universe; its warp and woof is maya , illusion. Its mirages of reality all break down under analysis. As one by one the reassuring props of a physical cosmos crash beneath him, man dimly percei ves his idolatrous reliance, his past transgression of the divine command: \"Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.\""},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"In his famous equation outlining the equivalence of mass and energy, Einstein proved that the energy in any particle of matter is equal to its mass or weight multiplied by the square of the velocity of light. The release of the atomic energies is brought about through the annihilation of the material particles. The \"death\" of matter has been the \"birth\" of an Atomic Age. Light-velocity is a mathematical standa rd or constant not because there is an absolute value in 186,000 miles a second, but because no material body, whose mass increases with its velocity, can ever attain the velocity of light. Stated another way: only a material body whose mass is infinite could equal the velocity of light. This Conception Brings Us To The Law Of Miracles . The masters who are able to materialize and dematerialize their bodies or any other object, and to move with the velocity of light, and to utilize the creative light-rays in bringing into instant visi bility any physical manifestation, have fulfilled the necessary Einsteinian con dition: their mass is infinite. The consciousness of a perfected yogi is e ffortlessly identified, not with a narrow body, but with the universal structure. Gravitation, whether the \"force\" of Newton or the Einsteinian \"manifesta tion of inertia,\" is powerless to compel a master to exhibit the property of \"weight\" which is the distinguishing gravitational condition of all material objects. He who knows himself as the omnipresent Spirit is subject no longer to the rigidities of a body in time and space. Their imprisoning \"rings-pass-not\" have yielded to the solvent: \"I am He.\" \"Fiat lux! And there was light.\" God's first command to His ordered creation ( Genesis 1:3) brought into being the only atom ic reality: light. On the beams of this immaterial medium occur all divine manifestations. Devotees of every age testify to the appearance of God as flame and light. \"The King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto.\" 30-5 "},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"A yogi who through perfect meditation has merged his consciousness with the Creator perceives the cosmical essence as light; to him there is no difference between the light rays composing water and the light rays composing land. Free from matter-consciousness, free from the three dimensions of space and the fourth dimension of time, a master transf ers his body of ligh t with equal ease over the light rays of earth, water, fi re, or air. Long concentration on the liberating spiritual eye has enabled the yogi to destroy all delusions concerning matter and its gravitational weight; thenceforth he sees the universe as an essentially undifferentia ted mass of light. \"Optical images,\" Dr. L. T. Troland of Ha rvard tells us, \"are built up on the same principle as the ordinary 'half-tone' engr avings; that is, they are made up of minute dottings or stripplings far too sma ll to be detected by the eye. . . . The sensitiveness of the retina is so great that a visual sensation can be produced by relatively few Quanta of the right kind of light.\" Through a master's divine knowledge of light phenomena, he can instantly project into perceptible manifestation the ubiquitous light atoms. The actual form of the projection- whether it be a tree, a medicine, a huma n body-is in conformance with a yogi's powers of will and of visualization. In man's dream-consciousness, where he ha s loosened in sleep his clutch on the egoistic limitations that daily hem him ro und, the omnipotence of his mind has a nightly demonstration. Lo! there in the dream stand the long-dead friends, the remotest continents, the resurrected scenes of his childhood. With that free and unconditioned consciousness, known to al l men in the phenomena of dreams, the God- tuned master has forged a never-se vered link. Innocent of all personal motives, and employing the creative will be stowed on him by the Creator, a yogi rearranges the light atoms of the univer se to satisfy any sincere prayer of a devotee.

In it the relativi ty of human consciousness was vividly established; I clearly perceived the unity of the Eternal Light behind the painful dualities of maya . The vision descended on me as I sat one morning in my little attic room in Father's Gurpar Road home. For months World War I had been raging in Europe; I reflected sadly on the vast toll of death. As I closed my eyes in meditation, my consciousness was suddenly transferred to the body of a captain in command of a ba ttleship. The thunder of guns split the air as shots were exchanged between sh ore batteries and the ship's cannons. A huge shell hit the powder magazine and tore my ship asunder. I jumped into the water, together with the few sailor s who had survived the explosion. Heart pounding, I reached the shore safe ly. But alas! a stray bullet ended its furious flight in my chest. I fell groa ning to the ground. My whole body was paralyzed, yet I was aware of possessing it as one is conscious of a leg gone to sleep. \"At last the mysterious footstep of Death has caught up with me,\" I thought. With a final sigh, I was about to sink into unconsciousness when lo! I found myself seated in the lotus posture in my Gurpar Road room. Hysterical tears poured forth as I joy fully stroked and pinched my regained possession-a body free from any bullet hole in the breast. I rocked to and fro, inhaling and exhaling to assure myself that I was alive. Amidst these self- congratulations, again I found my conscious ness transferred to the captain's dead body by the gory shore. Utter confusion of mind came upon me."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"\"Lord,\" I prayed, \"am I dead or alive?\" A dazzling play of light filled the whole ho rizon. A soft rumbling vibration formed itself into words: \"What has life or death to do with Ligh t? In the image of My Light I have made you. The relativities of life and death belong to the cosmic dream. Behold your dreamless being! Awake, my child, awake!\" As steps in man's awakening, the Lord insp ires scientists to discover, at the right time and place, the secrets of His creati on. Many modern discoveries help men to apprehend the cosmos as a varied expression of one power-light, guided by divine intelligence. The wonders of the motion pic ture, of radio, of television, of radar, of the photo- electric cell-the all-seeing \"electric eye,\" of atomic energies, are all based on the electromagnetic phenomenon of light. The motion picture art can portray any miracle. From the impressive visual standpoint, no marvel is barred to trick photography. A man's transparent astral body can be seen rising from his gross ph ysical form, he can walk on the water, resurrect the dead, reverse the natural se quence of developments, and play havoc with time and space. Assembling the light images as he pleases, the photographer achieves optical wonders which a true ma ster produces with actual light rays. The lifelike images of the motion pi cture illustrate many truths concerning creation. The Cosmic Director has wri tten His own plays, and assembled the tremendous casts for the pageant of the centuries. From the dark booth of eternity, He pours His creative beam thro ugh the films of successive ages, and the pictures are thrown on the screen of sp ace. Just as the mo tion-picture images appear to be real, but are only combination s of light and shade, so is the universal variety a delusive seeming. The planetar y spheres, with their countless forms of life, are naught but figures in a cosmic motion picture, temporarily true to five sense perceptions as the scenes are cast on the screen of man's consciousness by the infinite creative beam."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"A cinema audience can look up and see that all screen images are appearing through the instrumentality of one im ageless beam of light. The colorful universal drama is similarly issuing from the single white light of a Cosmic Source.

One day I entered a motion picture house to view a newsreel of the European battlefields. World War I was still be ing waged in the West; the newsreel recorded the carnage with such realism th at I left the theater with a troubled heart. \"Lord,\" I prayed, \"why dost Th ou permit such suffering?\" To my intense surprise, an instant answer came in the form of a vision of the actual European battlefields. The horror of the struggle, filled with the dead and dying, far surpassed in ferocity an y representation of the newsreel. \"Look intently!\" A gentle voice spoke to my inner consciousness. \"You will see that these scenes now being enacted in France are nothing but a play of chiaroscuro. They are the cosmic motion picture, as real and as unreal as the theater newsreel you have just seen-a play within a play.\" My heart was still not comforted. The divine voice went on: \"Creation is light and shadow both, else no picture is possible. The good and evil of maya must ever alternate in supremacy. If joy were ceasel ess here in this world, would man ever seek another? Without suffering he scarce ly cares to recall that he has forsaken his eternal home. Pain is a prod to remembrance. The way of escape is through wisdom! The tragedy of death is unreal; those who shudder at it are like an ignorant actor who dies of fright on the stage when nothing more is fired at him than a blank cartridge.

As I finished writing this chapter, I sat on my bed in the lotus posture. My room was dimly lit by two shaded lamps. Lifting my gaze, I noticed that the ceiling was dotted with small mustard-colored lights , scintillating and quivering with a radiumlike luster. Myriads of pencilled ra ys, like sheets of rain, gathered into a transparent shaft and poured silently upon me. At once my physical body lost its gr ossness and became metamorphosed into astral texture. I felt a floating sensation as, barely touching the bed, the weightless body shifted slightly and altern ately to left and right. I looked around the room; the furniture and walls were as us ual, but the little mass of light had so multiplied that the ceiling was invisible. I was wonder-struck. \"This is the cosmic motion picture mech anism.\" A voice spoke as though from within the light. \"Shedding its beam on the white screen of your bed sheets, it is producing the picture of your body. Behold, your form is nothing but light!\" I gazed at my arms and moved them back and forth, yet could not feel their weight. An ecstatic joy overwhelmed me. This cosmic stem of light, blossoming as my body, seemed a divine replica of the light beams streaming out of the projection booth in a cinema house and manifesting as pictures on the screen. For a long time I experienced this motion picture of my body in the dimly lighted theater of my own bedroom. Despite the many visions I have had, none was ever more singular.

CHAPTER: 31 An Interview With The Sacred Mother"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"\"Reverend Mother, I was baptized in infa ncy by your prophet-husband. He was the guru of my parents and of my own guru Sri Yukteswarji. Will you therefore give me the privilege of hearing a few incidents in your sacred life?\" I was addressing Srimati Kashi Moni, th e life-companion of Lahiri Mahasaya. Finding myself in Benares for a short period , I was fulfilling a long-felt desire to visit the venerable lady. She received me graciously at the old Lahiri homestead in the Garudeswar Mohulla section of Benares. Although aged, she was blooming like a lotus, silently emanating a spiritual fragrance. She was of medium build, with a slender neck and fair skin. Large, lustrous eyes softened her motherly face. \"Son, you are welcome here. Come upstairs.\" Kashi Moni led the way to a very small r oom where, for a time, she had lived with her husband. I felt honored to witness the shrine in which the peerless master had condescended to play the human drama of matrimony. The gentle lady motioned me to a pillow seat by her side. \"It was years before I came to realize the divine stature of my husband,\" she began. \"One night, in this very room, I had a vivid dream. Glorious angels floated in unimaginable grace above me. So realis tic was the sight that I awoke at once; the room was strangely enveloped in dazzling light. \"My husband, in lotus posture, was le vitated in the center of the room, surrounded by angels who were worshiping him with the supplicating dignity of palm-folded hands. Astonished beyond me asure, I was convinced that I was still dreaming. \"'Woman,' Lahiri Mahasaya said, 'you are not dreaming. Forsake your sleep forever and forever.' As he slowly descen ded to the floor, I prostrated myself at his feet. \"'Master,' I cried, 'again and again I bow before you! Will you pardon me for having considered you as my husband? I die with shame to realize that I have"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"remained asleep in ignorance by the side of one who is divinely awakened. From this night, you are no longer my husband, but my guru. Will you accept my insignificant self as your disciple?' 31-1 \"The master touched me gently. 'Sacred soul, arise. You are accepted.' He motioned toward the angels. 'Please bow in turn to each of these holy saints.' \"When I had finished my humble genufl ections, the angelic voices sounded together, like a chorus from an ancient scripture. \"'Consort of the Divine One, thou art ble ssed. We salute thee.' They bowed at my feet and lo! their refulgent forms vanished. The room darkened. \"My guru asked me to receive initiation into Kriya Yoga . \"'Of course,' I responded. 'I am sorry not to have had its blessing earlier in my life.' \"'The time was not ripe.' Lahiri Mahasa ya smiled consolingly. 'Much of your karma I have silently helped you to work out. Now yo u are willing and ready.' \"He touched my forehead. Masses of whirling light appeared; the radiance gradually formed itself into the opal-blue spiritual eye, ringed in gold and centered with a white pentagonal star. \"'Penetrate your consciousness through the st ar into the kingdom of the Infinite.' My guru's voice had a new note , soft like distant music. \"Vision after vision broke as oceanic surf on the shores of my soul. The panoramic spheres finally melted in a sea of bliss. I lost myself in ever-surging blessedness. When I returned hours later to awareness of this world, the master gave me the technique of Kriya Yoga ."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"\"From that night on, Lahiri Mahasaya never slept in my room again. Nor, thereafter, did he ever sleep. He remained in the front room downstairs, in the company of his disciples both by day and by night.\" The illustrious lady fell into silence. Re alizing the uniqueness of her relationship with the sublime yogi, I finally ventured to ask for further reminiscences. \"Son, you are greedy. Nevertheless you sh all have one more story.\" She smiled shyly. \"I will confess a sin which I commi tted against my guru- husband. Some months after my initiation, I began to feel forlorn and neglected. One morning Lahiri Mahasaya entered this little room to fetch an article; I quickly followed him. Overcome by violent delusion , I addressed him scathingly. \"'You spend all your time with the disciple s. What about your responsibilities for your wife and children? I regret that yo u do not interest yourself in providing more money for the family.' \"The master glanced at me for a mome nt, then lo! he was gone. Awed and frightened, I heard a voice resounding from every part of the room: \"'It is all nothing, don't you see? How could a nothing like me produce riches for you?' \"'Guruji,' I cried, 'I implore pardon a milli on times! My sinful eyes can see you no more; please appear in your sacred form.' \"'I am here.' This reply came from ab ove me. I looked up and saw the master materialize in the air, his head touching the ceiling. His eyes were like blinding flames. Beside myself with fear, I lay sobbing at his feet after he had quietly descended to the floor. \"'Woman,' he said, 'seek divine wealth, not the paltry tinsel of earth. After acquiring inward treasure, you will fi nd that outward supply is always forthcoming.' He added, 'One of my spir itual sons will make provision for you.'"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"\"My guru's words naturally came true; a disciple did leave a considerable sum for our family.\" I thanked Kashi Moni for sharing wi th me her wondrous experiences. 31-2 On the following day I returned to her home and enjoyed several hours of philosophical discussion with Tincouri and Ducouri La hiri. These two saintly sons of India's great yogi followed closely in his ideal footsteps. Both men were fair, tall, stalwart, and heavily bearded, with soft voices and an old-fashioned charm of manner. His wife was not the only woman disciple of Lahi ri Mahasaya; there were hundreds of others, including my mother . A woman chela once asked the guru for his photograph. He handed her a print, remarking, \"If you deem it a protection, then it is so; otherwise it is only a picture.\" A few days later this woman and Lahiri Mahasaya's daughter-in-law happened to be studying the Bhagavad Gita at a table behind which hung the guru's photograph. An electrical storm broke out with great fury. \"Lahiri Mahasaya, protect us!\" The women bowed before the picture. Lightning struck the book which they had been read ing, but the two devotees were unhurt. \"I felt as though a sheet of ice had been placed around me to ward off the scorching heat,\" the chela explained. Lahiri Mahasaya performed two miracles in connection with a woman disciple, Abhoya. She and her husband, a Calcutta lawyer, started one day for Benares to visit the guru. Their carriage was delaye d by heavy traffic; they reached the Howrah main station only to hear the Benares train whistling for departure. Abhoya, near the ticket office, stood quietly. \"Lahiri Mahasaya, I beseech thee to stop th e train!\" she silently prayed. \"I cannot suffer the pangs of delay in waiting another day to see thee.\""},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"The wheels of the snorting train continued to move round and round, but there was no onward progress. The engineer an d passengers descended to the platform to view the phenomenon. An English rail road guard approached Abhoya and her husband. Contrary to all preceden t, he volunteered his services. \"Babu,\" he said, \"give me the money. I will buy your tickets while you get aboard.\" As soon as the couple was seated and had received the tickets, the train slowly moved forward. In panic, the engineer and passengers clambered again to their places, knowing neither how the train starte d, nor why it had stopped in the first place. Arriving at the home of Lahiri Mahasaya in Benares, Abhoya silently prostrated herself before the master, and tried to touch his feet. \"Compose yourself, Abhoya,\" he remarked. \"How you love to bother me! As if you could not have come here by the next train!\" Abhoya visited Lahiri Maha saya on another memorable occasion. This time she wanted his intercession, not with a train, but with the stork. \"I pray you to bless me that my ninth chil d may live,\" she said. \"Eight babies have been born to me; all died soon after birth.\" The master smiled sympathetically. \"Your coming child will live . Please follow my instructions carefully. The baby, a girl, will be born at night. See that the oil lamp is kept burning until dawn. Do not fall as leep and thus allow the light to become extinguished.\" Abhoya's child was a daughter, born at night, exactly as foreseen by the omniscient guru. The mother instructed her nurse to keep the lamp filled with oil. Both women kept the urgent vigil far into the early morning hours, but finally fell asleep. The lamp oil was almost gone; the light flickered feebly."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"The bedroom door unlatched and flew open with a violent sound. The startled women awoke. Their astonished eyes be held the form of Lahiri Mahasaya. \"Abhoya, behold, the light is almost go ne!\" He pointed to the lamp, which the nurse hastened to refill. As soon as it burned again brightly, the master vanished. The door closed; the latch was affixed without visible agency. Abhoya's ninth child survived; in 1935, when I made inquiry, she was still living. One of Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples, the venerable Kali Kumar Roy, related to me many fascinating details of his life with the master. \"I was often a guest at his Benares home for weeks at a time,\" Roy told me. \"I observed that many saintly figures, danda 31-3 swamis, arrived in the quiet of night to sit at the guru's feet. Sometime s they would engage in discussion of meditational and philosophical points. At dawn the exalted guests would depart. I found during my visits that Lahiri Maha saya did not once lie down to sleep. \"During an early period of my associatio n with the master, I had to contend with the opposition of my employer,\" Roy went on. \"He was steeped in materialism. \"'I don't want religious fanatics on my st aff,' he would sneer. 'If I ever meet your charlatan guru, I shall give hi m some words to remember.' \"This alarming threat failed to interrupt my regular program; I spent nearly every evening in my guru's pres ence. One night my employer followed me and rushed rudely into the parlor. He was doubtless fully bent on uttering the pulverizing remarks he had promised. No sooner had the man seated himself than Lahiri Mahasaya addressed the little grou p of about twelve disciples. \"'Would you all like to see a picture?' \"When we nodded, he asked us to darken the room. 'Sit behind one another in a circle,' he said, 'and place your hands over the eyes of the man in front of you.'"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"\"I was not surprised to see that my employer also was following, albeit unwillingly, the master's directions. In a few minutes Lahiri Mahasaya asked us what we were seeing. \"'Sir,' I replied, 'a beautiful woman appears. She wears a red- bordered sari , and stands near an elephant-ear plant.' All the other disciples gave the same description. The master turned to my employer. 'Do you recognize that woman?' \"'Yes.' The man was evidently struggling with emotions new to his nature. 'I have been foolishly spending my money on her, though I have a good wife. I am ashamed of the motives which brought me here. Will you forgive me, and receive me as a disciple?' \"'If you lead a good moral life for six months, I shall accept you.' The master enigmatically added, 'Otherwise I won't have to initiate you.' \"For three months my employer refraine d from temptation; then he resumed his former relationship with the woman. Two months later he died. Thus I came to understand my guru's veiled prophecy about the improbability of the man's initiation.\" Lahiri Mahasaya had a very famous frie nd, Swami Trailanga, who was reputed to be over three hundred years old. The two yogis often sat together in meditation. Trailanga's fame is so widespread that few Hindus would deny the possibility of truth in any story of his astounding miracles. If Christ returned to earth and walked the streets of New York, displaying his divine powers, it would cause the same excitement that was created by Tr ailanga decades ago as he passed through the crowded lanes of Benares. On many occasions the swami was seen to drink, with no ill effect, the most deadly poisons. Thousands of people, in cluding a few who are still living, have seen Trailanga floating on the Ganges. For days together he would sit on top of the water, or remain hidden for very long periods under the waves. A common"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"sight at the Benares bathing ghats was the swami's motionless body on the blistering stone slabs, wholly exposed to the merciless Indian sun. By these feats Trailanga sought to teach men that a yogi's life does not depend upon oxygen or ordinary conditions and precautions. Whether he were above water or under it, and whether or not his body lay exposed to the fierce solar rays, the master proved that he lived by divine consciousness: death could not touch him. The yogi was great not only spiritually, but physically. His weight exceeded three hundred pounds: a pound for each year of his life! As he ate very seldom, the mystery is increased. A master, however, easily ignores all usual rules of health, when he desires to do so for some spec ial reason, often a subtle one known only to himself. Great saints who have aw akened from the cosmic mayic dream and realized this world as an idea in the Di vine Mind, can do as they wish with the body, knowing it to be only a manipulatable form of condensed or frozen energy. Though physical scientists now understa nd that matter is nothing but congealed energy, fully-illumined masters have long passed from theory to practice in the field of matter-control. Trailanga always remained completely nu de. The harassed police of Benares came to regard him as a baffling problem child. The natural swami, like the early Adam in the garden of Eden, was utterl y unconscious of his nakedness. The police were quite conscious of it, ho wever, and unceremo niously committed him to jail. General embarrassment ensued; the enormous body of Trailanga was soon seen, in its usual entirety, on the prison r oof. His cell, still securely locked, offered no clue to his mode of escape. The discouraged officers of the law once more performed their duty. This time a guard was posted before the swami's ce ll. Might again retired before right. Trailanga was soon observed in his nonchalant stroll over the roof. Justice is blind; the outwitted police de cided to follow her example. The great yogi preserved a habitual silence. 31-4 In spite of his round face and huge, barrel-like stomach, Trailanga at e only occasionally. After weeks without"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"food, he would break his fast with potful s of clabbered milk offered to him by devotees. A skeptic once determined to expose Trailanga as a charlatan. A large bucket of calcium-lime mixture, used in whitewashing walls, was placed before the swami. \"Master,\" the materialist said, in mock reverence, \"I have brought you some clabbered milk. Please drink it.\" Trailanga unhesitatingly drained, to th e last drop, the containerful of burning lime. In a few minutes the evildoer fell to the ground in agony. \"Help, swami, help!\" he cried. \"I am on fire! Forgive my wicked test!\" The great yogi broke his habitual silence. \"Scoffer,\" he said, \"you did not realize when you offered me poison that my life is one with your own. Except for my knowledge that God is present in my stomach, as in every atom of creation, the lime would have killed me. Now that you know the divine meaning of boomerang, never again play tricks on anyone.\" The well-purged sinner, healed by Trai langa's words, slunk feebly away. The reversal of pain was not due to any volition of the master, but came about through unerring application of the la w of justice which upholds creation's farthest swinging orb. Men of God-realiz ation like Trailanga allow the divine law to operate instantaneously; they ha ve banished forever all thwarting crosscurrents of ego. The automatic adjustments of righteousness, often paid in an unexpected coin as in the case of Trailanga and his would be murderer, assuage our hasty indignance at human injustice. \"Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.\" 31-5 What need for man's brief resources? the univ erse duly conspires for retribution. Dull minds discredit the possibility of divine justice, love, omniscience, immortality. \"Airy scriptural conjectures!\" This inse nsitive viewpoint, aweless before the cosmic spectacle, arouses a train of even ts which brings its own awakening."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"The omnipotence of spiritual law was referre d to by Christ on the occasion of his triumphant entry into Jerusalem. As th e disciples and the multitude shouted for joy, and cried, \"Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest, \" certain Pharisees complained of the undignified spectacle. \"Master,\" they protested, \"rebuke thy disciples.\" \"I tell you,\" Jesus replied, \"that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.\" 31-6 In this reprimand to the Pharisees, Christ was pointing out that divine justice is no figurative abstraction, and that a ma n of peace, though his tongue be torn from its roots, will yet find his speech an d his defense in the bedrock of creation, the universal order itself. \"Think you,\" Jesus was saying, \"to silence men of peace? As well may you hope to throttle the voice of God, whose very ston es sing His glory and His omnipresence. Will you demand that men not celebrate in honor of the peace in heaven, but should only gather together in multitudes to shout for war on earth? Then make your preparations, O Pharisees, to overtoppl e the foundations of the world; for it is not gentle men alone, but stones or ea rth, and water and fire and air that will rise up against you, to bear wi tness of His ordered harmony.\" The grace of the Christlike yogi, Tr ailanga, was once bestowed on my sajo mama (maternal uncle). One morning Uncle saw the master surrounded by a crowd of devotees at a Benares ghat. He managed to edge his way close to Trailanga, whose feet he touched humbly. Uncle was astonished to find himself instantly freed from a painful chronic disease. 31-7 The only known living disciple of the gr eat yogi is a woman, Shankari Mai Jiew.

Be sides a few of Master's other disciples, I was present with a small grou p of my Ranchi students. \"In this passage Jesus calls himself the Son of God. Though he was truly united with God, his reference here has a deep impersonal significance,\" my guru explained. \"The Son of God is the Christ or Divine Consciou sness in man. No mortal can glorify God. The only honor that man can pay his Creator is to seek Him; man cannot glorify an Abstraction that he does not know. The 'glory' or nimbus around the head of the saints is a symbolic witness of their capacity to render divine homage.\" Sri Yukteswar went on to read the marvelou s story of Lazarus' resurrection. At its conclusion Master fell into a long silence, the sacred book open on his knee. \"I too was privileged to behold a simi lar miracle.\" My guru finally spoke with solemn unction. \"Lahiri Mahasaya resurrected one of my friends from the dead.\" The young lads at my side smiled with k een interest. There was enough of the boy in me, too, to enjoy not only the philosop hy but, in particular, any story I could get Sri Yukteswar to relate about his wondrous experiences with his guru. \"My friend Rama and I were inseparable,\" Master began. \"Because he was shy and reclusive, he chose to visit our guru Lahiri Mahasaya only during the hours of midnight and dawn, when the crowd of da ytime disciples was absent.

As our master never objected to the services of physicians at times of seriou s illness, two specia lists were summoned. Amidst the frantic rush of ministering to the stricken man, I was deeply praying to Lahiri Mahasaya for help. I hurried to his home and sobbed out the story. \"'The doctors are seeing Rama. He will be well.' My guru smiled jovially. \"I returned with a light heart to my friend 's bedside, only to find him in a dying state. \"'He cannot last more than one or two hour s,' one of the physicians told me with a gesture of despair. Once more I hastened to Lahiri Mahasaya. \"'The doctors are conscientious men. I am sure Rama will be well.' The master dismissed me blithely. \"At Rama's place I found both doctors gone. One had left me a note: 'We have done our best, but his case is hopeless.' \"My friend was indeed the picture of a dying man. I did not understand how Lahiri Mahasaya's words could fail to com e true, yet the sight of Rama's rapidly ebbing life kept suggesting to my mind: 'A ll is over now.' Tossing thus on the seas of faith and apprehensive doubt, I minist ered to my friend as best I could. He roused himself to cry out: \"'Yukteswar, run to Master and tell him I am gone.

I canno t but be struck by the coincidence that the year 1945 has also ushered in a ne w age-the era of revolutionary atomic energies. All thoughtful minds turn as ne ver before to the urgent problems of peace and brotherhood, lest the continued use of physical force banish all men along with the problems.

Though India's civilization is ancient ab ove any other, few historians have noted that her feat of national survival is by no means an accident, but a logical incident in the devotion to eternal verities whic h India has offered through her best men in every generation. By sheer continuity of being, by intransitivity before the ages-can dusty scholars truly tell us how many?-India has given the worthiest answer of any people to the challenge of time. The Biblical story 32-5 of Abraham's plea to the Lord that the city of Sodom be spared if ten righteous men could be found therein, and the divine reply: \"I will not destroy it for ten's sake,\" gains new meaning in the light of India's escape from the oblivion of Babylon, Egypt and other mighty nations who were once her contemporaries.

For three decades in India, America, and Europe, I have found a deep and sincere interest in his message of liberating yoga; a written account of the master's life, even as he foretold, is now needed in the West, where lives of the great modern yogis are little known. Nothing but one or two small pamphlets in English has been written on the guru's life. One biography in Bengali, Sri Sri 32-6 Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya , appeared in 1941. It was written by my disciple, Swami Satyananda, who for many years has been the acharya (spiritual preceptor) at our Vidyalaya in Ranchi. I have translated a few passag es from his book and have incorporated them into this section devoted to Lahiri Mahasaya. It was into a pious Brahmin family of an cient lineage that Lahiri Mahasaya was born September 30, 1828. His birthplace was the village of Ghurni in the Nadia district near Krishnagar, Bengal. He wa s the youngest son of Muktakashi, the second wife of the esteemed Gaur Mohan La hiri. (His first wife, after the birth of three sons, had died during a pilgrimage .) The boy's mother passed away during his childhood; little about her is known ex cept the revealing fact that she was an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva, 32-7 scripturally designated as the \"King of Yogis.\" The boy Lahiri, whose given name was Sh yama Charan, spent his early years in the ancestral home at Nadia. At the age of three or four he was often observed sitting under the sands in the posture of a yogi, his body completely hidden except for the head. The Lahiri estate was destroyed in the wi nter of 1833, when the near- by Jalangi River changed its course and disappeared into the depths of the Ganges.

A devotee rescued the stone image of Lord Shiva from the swirling waters and placed it in a new temple, now we ll-known as the Ghurni Shiva Site. Gaur Mohan Lahiri and his family left Na dia and became residents of Benares, where the father immediately erecte d a Shiva temple. He conducted his household along the lines of Vedic disc ipline, with regular observance of ceremonial worship, acts of charity, and scriptural study. Just and open-minded, however, he did not ignore the bene ficial current of modern ideas. The boy Lahiri took lessons in Hindi and Urdu in Benares study-groups. He attended a school conducted by Joy Na rayan Ghosal, receiving instruction in Sanskrit, Bengali, French, and English. Applying himself to a close study of the Vedas , the young yogi listened eagerly to scriptural discussions by learned Brahmins, including a Marhatta pundit named Nag-Bhatta. Shyama Charan was a kind, gentle, and courageous youth, beloved by all his companions. With a well-proportioned, bright, and powerful body, he excelled in swimming and in many skillful activities. In 1846 Shyama Charan Lahiri was married to Srimati Kashi Moni, daughter of Sri Debnarayan Sanyal. A model Indian ho usewife, Kashi Moni cheerfully carried on her home duties and the traditional ho useholder's obligation to serve guests and the poor. Two saintly sons, Tincouri and Ducouri, blessed the union. At the age of 23, in 1851, Lahiri Mahasa ya took the post of accountant in the Military Engineering Department of the English government. He received many promotions during the time of his service. Thus not only was he a master before God's eyes, but also a success in the littl e human drama where he played his given role as an office worker in the world. As the offices of the Army Department were shifted, Lahiri Mahasaya was transferred to Gazipur, Mirjapur, Dana pur, Naini Tal, Benares, and other localities. After the death of his fath er, Lahiri had to assume the entire"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"responsibility of his family, for whom he bought a quiet residence in the Garudeswar Mohulla neighborhood of Benares. It was in his thirty-third year that Lahiri Mahasaya saw fulfillment of the purpose for which he had been reincarnated on earth. The ash- hidden flame, long smouldering, received its opportunity to bu rst into flame. A divine decree, resting beyond the gaze of human beings, works mysteriously to bring all things into outer manifestation at the proper time. He met his great guru, Babaji, near Ranikhet, and was initiated by him into Kriya Yoga . This auspicious event did not happen to hi m alone; it was a fortunate moment for all the human race, many of whom were later privileged to receive the soul- awakening gift of Kriya . The lost, or long-vanished, highest art of yoga was again being brought to light. Many spiritually thirsty men and women eventually found their way to the cool waters of Kriya Yoga . Just as in the Hindu legend, where Mother Ganges offers her divine draught to the parched devotee Bhagirath, so the celestial flood of Kriya rolled from the secret fastnesses of the Himalayas into the dusty haunts of men. 32-1: John 11:1-4. 32-2: A cholera victim is often rational and fully conscious right up to the moment of death. 32-3: The god of death. 32-4: Literally, \"Supreme soul.\" 32-5: Genesis 18:23-32. 32-6: Sri , a prefix meaning \"holy,\" is attached (generally twice or thrice) to names of great Indian teachers. 32-7: One of the trinity of Godhead-Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva-whose universal work is, respectively, that of creation, preservation, and dissolution-restoration. Shiva (sometimes spelled Siva), represented in mythology as the Lord of Renunci ates, appears in visions to His devotees under various aspects, such as Mahadeva, the matted-hair ed Ascetic, and Nataraja, the Cosmic Dancer."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"CHAPTER: 33 Babaji, The Yogi-Christ Of Modern India The northern Himalayan crags near Badrin arayan are still blessed by the living presence of Babaji, guru of Lahiri Maha saya. The secluded master has retained his physical form for centuries, perhaps for millenniums. The deathless Babaji is an avatara . This Sanskrit word means \"descent\"; its roots are ava , \"down,\" and tri , \"to pass.\" In the Hindu scriptures, avatara signifies the descent of Divinity into flesh. \"Babaji's spiritual state is beyond human comprehension,\" Sri Yukteswar explained to me. \"The dwarfed vision of men cannot pierce to his transcendental star. One attempts in vain even to picture the avatar's attainment. It is inconceivable.\" The Upanishads have minutely classified every stage of spiritual advancement. A siddha (\"perfected being\") has progressed from the state of a jivanmukta (\"freed while living\") to that of a paramukta (\"supremely free\"-full power over death); the latter has completely escaped from the mayic thralldom and its reincarnational round. The paramukta therefore seldom returns to a physical body; if he does, he is an avatar, a divinely appointed medium of supernal blessings on the world. An avatar is unsubject to the universal economy; his pure body, visible as a light image, is free from any debt to nature. The casual gaze may see nothing extraordinary in an avatar's form but it casts no shadow nor makes any footprint on the ground. These are outward symbolic proofs of an inward lack of darkness and material bondage. Such a God-man alone knows the Truth behind the relativities of life and death. Omar Kh ayyam, so grossly misunderstood, sang of this liberated man in his immortal scripture, the Rubaiyat :"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"\"Ah, Moon of my Delight who know'st no wane, The Moon of Heav'n is rising once again; How oft hereafter rising sh all she look Through this same Garden after me-in vain!\" The \"Moon of Delight\" is God, eternal Po laris, anachronous never. The \"Moon of Heav'n\" is the outward cosmos, fettered to the law of periodic recurrence. Its chains had been dissolved forever by the Persian seer through his self-realization. \"How oft hereafter rising shall she look . . . after me-in vain!\" What frustration of search by a frantic universe for an absolute omission! Christ expressed his freedom in another way: \"And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.\" 33-1 Spacious with omnipresence, could Christ indeed be followed except in the overarching Spirit? Krishna, Rama, Buddha, and Patanjali were among the ancient Indian avatars. A considerable poetic literature in Tamil has grown up around Agastya, a South Indian avatar. He worked many miracl es during the centuries preceding and following the Christian era, and is credited with retaining his physical form even to this day. Babaji's mission in India has been to assi st prophets in carrying out their special dispensations. He thus qualifies fo r the scriptural classification of Mahavatar (Great Avatar). He has stated that he ga ve yoga initiation to Shankara, ancient founder of the Swami Order, and to Kabi r, famous medieval saint. His chief nineteenth-century disciple was, as we kn ow, Lahiri Mahasaya, revivalist of the lost Kriya art."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":" BABAJI, THE MAHAVATAR Guru of Lahiri Mahas aya I have helped an artist to draw a true likenes s of the great Yogi -Christ of modern India. The Mahavatar is in constant communion with Christ; together they send o ut vibrations of redemption, and have pla nned the spiritual technique of salvation for this age. The work of these two fu lly-illu mined masters-one with the body, and one without it-is to inspire the nations to forsake suicidal wars, race hatreds, religious sectarianism, and the boomerang-evils of mate rialism. Babaji is well aware of the trend of modern times, espe cially of the i nfluence and complexities of Western civilizat ion, and realizes the necessity of spre ading the self-liberations of yoga equally in the West and in the East. That there is no historical referen ce to Babaji need not surprise us. The great guru has never openly appeared in any century; the misinterpreting glare of"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"publicity has no place in his millennial plans. Like the Creator, the sole but silent Power, Babaji works in a humble obscurity. Great prophets like Christ and Krishna come to earth for a specific and spectacular purpose; they depart as soon as it is accomplished. Other avatars, like Babaji, undertake work which is concern ed more with the slow evolutionary progress of man during the centuries than with any one outstanding event of history. Such masters always veil themselves from the gross public gaze, and have the power to become invisible at will. For these reasons, and because they generally instruct their disciples to ma intain silence about them, a number of towering spiritual figures remain world-un known. I give in these pages on Babaji merely a hint of his life-only a few facts which he deems it fit and helpful to be publicly imparted. No limiting facts about Babaji's family or birthplace, dear to the annalist's heart, have ever been discovered. His speech is generally in Hindi, but he converses easily in any language. He has adopted the simple name of Babaji (revered father); other titles of respect given him by Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples are Mahamuni Babaji Maharaj (s upreme ecstatic saint), Maha Yogi (greatest of yogis), Trambak Baba and Shiva Baba (title s of avatars of Shiva). Does it matter that we know not the patronymic of an earth-released master? \"Whenever anyone utters with reverence th e name of Babaji,\" Lahiri Mahasaya said, \"that devotee attracts an instant spiritual blessing.\" The deathless guru bears no marks of age on his body; he appe ars to be no more than a youth of twenty-five. Fair-skinned, of medium build and height, Babaji's beautiful, strong body radiates a percep tible glow. His eyes are dark, calm, and tender; his long, lustrous hair is copper-col ored. A very strange fact is that Babaji bears an extraordinarily exact resemblanc e to his disciple Lahiri Mahasaya. The similarity is so striking that, in his later years, La hiri Mahasaya might have passed as the father of the youthful-looking Babaji."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Swami Kebalananda, my saintly Sanskrit tu tor, spent some time with Babaji in the Himalayas. \"The peerless master moves wi th his group from place to place in the mountains,\" Kebalananda told me. \"His small band contains two highly advanced American disciples. After Babaji has been in one locality for some time, he says: 'Dera danda uthao.' ('Let us lift our camp and staff.') He carries a symbolic danda (bamboo staff). His words are the signal for moving with his group instantaneously to another place. He do es not always employ this method of astral travel; sometimes he goes on foot from peak to peak. \"Babaji can be seen or recognized by others only when he so desires. He is known to have appeared in many slightly diffe rent forms to various devotees-sometimes without beard and moustache, and sometime s with them. As his undecaying body requires no food, the master seldom eats. As a social courtesy to visiting disciples, he occasionally accepts fruits, or rice cooked in milk and clarified butter. \"Two amazing incidents of Babaji's life are known to me,\" Kebalananda went on. \"His disciples were sitting one night arou nd a huge fire which was blazing for a sacred Vedic ceremony. The master sudde nly seized a burning log and lightly struck the bare shoulder of a ch ela who was close to the fire. \"'Sir, how cruel!' Lahiri Mahasaya, who was present, made this remonstrance. \"'Would you rather have seen him burned to ashes before your eyes, according to the decree of his past karma?' \"With these words Babaji placed his he aling hand on the chela's disfigured shoulder. 'I have freed you tonight from painful death. The karmic law has been satisfied through your slight suffering by fire.' \"On another occasion Babaji's sacred circle was disturbed by the arrival of a stranger. He had climbed with astonishing skill to the nearly inaccessible ledge near the camp of the master."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"\"'Sir, you must be the great Babaji.' Th e man's face was lit with inexpressible reverence. 'For months I have pursued a ceaseless search for you among these forbidding crags. I implore you to accept me as a disciple.' \"When the great guru made no response, the man pointed to the rocky chasm at his feet. \"'If you refuse me, I will jump from this mountain. Life has no further value if I cannot win your guidance to the Divine.' \"'Jump then,' Babaji said unemotionally. 'I cannot accept you in your present state of development.' \"The man immediately hurled himself ov er the cliff. Babaji instructed the shocked disciples to fetch the stranger's body. When they returned with the mangled form, the master placed his divine hand on the dead man. Lo! he opened his eyes and prostrated himself humbly before the omnipotent one. \"'You are now ready for discipleship.' Baba ji beamed lovingly on his resurrected chela. 'You have courageously passed a difficult test. Death shall not touch you again; now you are one of our immortal fl ock.' Then he spoke his usual words of departure, 'Dera danda uthao' ; the whole group vanished from the mountain.\" An avatar lives in the omnipresent Spirit; for him there is no distance inverse to the square. Only one reason, therefore, can motivate Babaji in maintaining his physical form from century to century: the desire to furnish humanity with a concrete example of its own possibilities . Were man never vouchsafed a glimpse of Divinity in the flesh, he would rema in oppressed by the heavy mayic delusion that he cannot transcend his mortality. Jesus knew from the beginning the sequen ce of his life; he passed through each event not for himself, not from any karmic compulsion, but solely for the upliftment of reflective human beings. His four reporter-disciples-Matthew,"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"Mark, Luke, and John-recorded the ineffable drama for the benefit of later generations. For Babaji, also, there is no relativity of past, present, future; from the beginning he has known all phases of his life. Ye t, accommodating himself to the limited understanding of men, he has played many acts of his divine life in the presence of one or more witnesses. Thus it came about that a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya was present when Babaji deemed the time to be ripe for him to proclaim the possibility of bodily immortality. He uttered this promise before Ram Gopal Muzumdar, that it might finally become known for the inspiration of other seeking hearts. The great ones speak thei r words and participate in the seemingly natural course of events, solely for the good of man, even as Christ said: \"Father . . . I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by i said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.\" 33-2 During my visit at Ranbajpur with Ram Gopal, \"the sleepless saint,\" 33-3 he related the wondrous story of his first meeting with Babaji. \"I sometimes left my isolated cave to sit at Lahiri Mahasaya's feet in Benares,\" Ram Gopal told me. \"One midnight as I wa s silently meditating in a group of his disciples, the master made a surprising request. \"'Ram Gopal,' he said, 'go at once to the Dasasamedh bathing ghat .' \"I soon reached the secluded spot. The night was bright with moonlight and the glittering stars. After I had sat in pati ent silence for awhile, my attention was drawn to a huge stone slab near my feet. It rose gradually, revealing an underground cave. As the stone remained balanced in some unknown manner, the draped form of a young and surpassing ly lovely woman was levitated from the cave high into the air. Surrounded by a so ft halo, she slowly descended in front of me and stood motionless, steeped in an inne r state of ecstasy. She finally stirred, and spoke gently."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"\"'I am Mataji, 33-4 the sister of Babaji. I have asked him and also Lahiri Mahasaya to come to my cave tonight to discu ss a matter of great importance.' \"A nebulous light was rapidly floating ov er the Ganges; the strange luminescence was reflected in the opaque waters. It appr oached nearer and nearer until, with a blinding flash, it appeared by the side of Mataji and condensed itself instantly into the human form of Lahiri Mahasaya . He bowed humbly at the feet of the woman saint. \"Before I had recovered from my bewilderment, I was further wonder- struck to behold a circling mass of mystical light traveling in the sky. Descending swiftly, the flaming whirlpool neared our group and materialized itself into the body of a beautiful youth who, I understood at on ce, was Babaji. He looked like Lahiri Mahasaya, the only difference being that Babaji appeared much younger, and had long, bright hair. \"Lahiri Mahasaya, Mataji, and myself kn elt at the guru's feet. An ethereal sensation of beatific glory thrilled every fi ber of my being as I touched his divine flesh. \"'Blessed sister,' Babaji said, 'I am intend ing to shed my form and plunge into the Infinite Current.' \"'I have already glimpsed your plan, belo ved master. I wanted to discuss it with you tonight. Why should yo u leave your body?' The glorious woman looked at him beseechingly. \"'What is the difference if I wear a visibl e or invisible wave on the ocean of my Spirit?' \"Mataji replied with a quaint flash of wit. 'Deathless guru, if it makes no difference, then please do not ever relinquish your form.' 33-5 "},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"\"'Be it so,' Babaji said solemnly. 'I will never leave my physical body. It will always remain visible to at least a small number of people on this earth.

An aureole of dazzling light templed their bodies as they vanished into the night sky. Mataji's form floated to the cave and descended; the stone slab closed of itself, as if working on an invisible leverage. \"Infinitely inspired, I wended my way ba ck to Lahiri Mahasaya's place.

For the first time I fully realized the truth in the scriptural verses which state that a man of self-realization can appear at different places in two or more bodies at the same time. \"Lahiri Mahasaya later explained to me many metaphysical points concerning the hidden divine plan for this earth,\" Ram Gopal concluded. \"Babaji has been chosen by God to remain in his body fo r the duration of this particular world"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"cycle.

CHAPTER: 34 Materializing A Palace In The Himalayas \"Babaji's first meeting with Lahiri Mahasaya is an enthralling story, and one of the few which gives us a detailed glimpse of the deathless guru.\" These words were Swami Kebalananda's preamble to a wondrous tale. The first time he recounted it I wa s literally spellbound. On many other occasions I coaxed my gentle Sanskrit tutor to repeat th e story, which was later told me in substantially the same words by Sri Yuk teswar. Both these Lahiri Mahasaya disciples had heard the awesome tale direct from the lips of their guru. \"My first meeting with Babaji took plac e in my thirty-third year,\" Lahiri Mahasaya had said. \"In the autumn of 1861 I was stationed in Danapur as a"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"government accountant in the Military Engineering Department.

Traveling by horse and buggy, we arrived in thirty days at the Himalayan site of Ranikhet. 34-2 \"My office duties were not onerous; I wa s able to spend many hours roaming in the magnificent hills. A rumor reached me that great saints blessed the region with their presence; I felt a strong desire to see them. During a ramble one early afternoon, I was astounded to hear a distant voice calling my name. I continued my vigorous upward climb on Drongiri Mo untain. A slight uneasiness beset me at the thought that I might not be able to retrace my steps before darkness had descended over the jungle. \"I finally reached a small clearing whose sides were dotted with caves. On one of the rocky ledges stood a smiling young man, extending his hand in welcome. I noticed with astonishment that, except for his copper-colored hair, he bore a remarkable resemblance to myself. \"'Lahiri, you have come!' The saint addre ssed me affectionately in Hindi. 'Rest here in this cave. It was I who called you.' \"I entered a neat little grotto which conta ined several woolen blankets and a few kamandulus (begging bowls). \"'Lahiri, do you remember that seat?'

All your earthly thirsts are about to be quenched forever.' He mu rmured some mystic words of blessing. 'My son, arise. Receive your initiati on into the kingdom of God through Kriya Yoga .' \"Babaji stretched out his hand; a homa (sacrificial) fire appeared, surrounded by fruits and flowers. I received the libera ting yogic technique before this flaming altar. \"The rites were completed in the early dawn. I felt no need for sleep in my ecstatic state, and wandered around the palace, filled on all sides with treasures and priceless objets d'art . Descending to the gorgeous gardens, I noticed, near-by, the same caves and barren mountain ledges which yesterday had boasted no adjacency to palace or flowered terrace."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"\"Reentering the palace, fabulously gliste ning in the cold Himalayan sunlight, I sought the presence of my master. He was still enthroned, surrounded by many quiet disciples. \"'Lahiri, you are hungry.' Babaji added, 'Close your eyes.' \"When I reopened them, the enchanting palace and its picturesque gardens had disappeared. My own body and the forms of Babaji and the cluster of chelas were all now seated on the bare ground at the exact site of the vanished palace, not far from the sunlit entrances of the rocky grottos. I recalled that my guide had remarked that the palace would be dematerialized, its captive atoms released into the thought- essence from which it ha d sprung. Although stunned, I looked trustingly at my guru. I knew not what to expect next on this day of miracles. \"'The purpose for which the palace was created has now been served,' Babaji explained. He lifted an earthen vessel from the ground. 'Put your hand there and receive whatever food you desire.' \"As soon as I touched the broad, empty bowl, it became heaped with hot butter- fried luchis , curry, and rare sweetmeats. I helped myself, observing that the vessel was ever-filled. At the end of my meal I looked around for water. My guru pointed to the bowl before me. Lo! the food had va nished; in its place was water, clear as from a mountain stream. \"'Few mortals know that the kingdom of God includes the kingdom of mundane fulfillments,' Babaji observed. 'The divine realm extends to the earthly, but the latter, being illusory, cannot include the essence of reality.' \"'Beloved guru, last night you demonstrated for me the link of beauty in heaven and earth!' I smiled at memories of the vanished palace; surely no simple yogi had ever received initiation into the august mysteries of Spirit amidst surroundings of more impressive luxury! I gazed tranquilly at the stark contrast of the present scene. The gaunt ground, the skyey roof, the caves offering"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"primitive shelter-all seemed a gracious natural setting for the seraphic saints around me. \"I sat that afternoon on my blanket, hallowed by associations of past- life realizations. My divine guru approached and passed his hand over my head. I entered the nirbikalpa samadhi state, remaining unbrokenly in its bliss for seven days. Crossing the successive strata of se lf- knowledge, I penetrated the deathless realms of reality. All delusive limita tions dropped away; my soul was fully established on the eternal altar of the Cosm ic Spirit. On the eighth day I fell at my guru's feet and implored him to keep me always near him in this sacred wilderness. \"'My son,' Babaji said, embracing me, 'your role in this incarnation must be played on an outward stage. Prenata lly blessed by many lives of lonely meditation, you must now ming le in the world of men. \"'A deep purpose underlay the fact that you did not meet me this time until you were already a married man, with modest business responsibilities. You must put aside your thoughts of joining our secret band in the Himalayas; your life lies in the crowded marts, serving as an exam ple of the ideal yogi-householder. \"'The cries of many bewildered worldl y men and women have not fallen unheard on the ears of the Great Ones,' he went on. 'You have been chosen to bring spiritual solace through Kriya Yoga to numerous earnest seekers. The millions who are encumbered by family ties and heavy worldly duties will take new heart from you, a householder like themselves. You must guide them to see that the highest yogic attainments are not barred to the family man. Even in the world, the yogi who faithfully disc harges his responsibilities, without personal motive or attachment, treads the sure path of enlightenment. \"'No necessity compels you to leave the world, for inwardly you have already sundered its every karmic tie. Not of this world, you must yet be in it. Many years still remain during which you must conscientiously fulfill your family, business,"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"civic, and spiritual duties. A sweet new br eath of divine hope will penetrate the arid hearts of worldly men. From your balanced life, they will understand that liberation is dependent on inner, ra ther than outer, renunciations.' \"How remote seemed my family, the office, the world, as I listened to my guru in the high Himalayan solitudes. Yet adam antine truth rang in his words; I submissively agreed to leave this blessed haven of peace. Babaji instructed me in the ancient rigid rules which govern the tr ansmission of the yogic art from guru to disciple. \"'Bestow the Kriya key only on qualified chelas,' Babaji said. 'He who vows to sacrifice all in the quest of the Divine is fit to unravel the final mysteries of life through the science of meditation.' \"'Angelic guru, as you have already fa vored mankind by resurrecting the lost Kriya art, will you not increase that benefit by relaxing the strict requirements for discipleship?' I gazed beseechingly at Ba baji. 'I pray that you permit me to communicate Kriya to all seekers, even though at first they cannot vow themselves to complete inner renunciati on. The tortured men and women of the world, pursued by the threefold suffering, 34-7 need special encouragement. They may never attempt the road to freedom if Kriya initiation be withheld from them.' \"'Be it so. The divine wish has been ex pressed through you.' With these simple words, the merciful guru banished the rigorous safeguards that for ages had hidden Kriya from the world. 'Give Kriya freely to all who humbly ask for help.' \"After a silence, Babaji added, 'Repeat to each of your disciples this majestic promise from the Bhagavad Gita: \"Swalpamasya Dharmasya, Trayata Mahato Bhoyat\" -\"Even a little bit of the practice of this religion will sa ve you from dire fears and colossal sufferings.\"' 34-8 "},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"\"As I knelt the next morning at my guru's feet for his farewell blessing, he sensed my deep reluctance to leave him. \"'There is no separation for us, my beloved child.'

The darkened room soon filled with a dim aural moonli ght; the luminous figure of Babaji emerged. \"'Lahiri, do you call me for a trifle?' The master's gaze was stern. 'Truth is for earnest seekers, not for those of idle curios ity. It is easy to believe when one sees; there is nothing then to deny. Supersensu al truth is deserved and discovered by those who overcome their natural material istic skepticism.' He added gravely, 'Let me go!' \"I fell entreatingly at his feet.

Great was the metamorphosis of these doubting Thomases into devout St. Pauls. After we had eaten, Babaji blessed each of us in turn. There was a sudden flash; we witnessed the instantaneous dechemicalization of the electronic elements of Babaji's body in to a spreading vaporous light. The God- tuned will power of the master had loosen ed its grasp of the ether atoms held together as his body; forthwith the trillions of tiny lifetronic sparks faded into the infinite reservoir. \"'With my own eyes I have seen the conqueror of death.'

Firmly an chored in the Spirit, again I assumed the manifold business and family ob ligations of a householder.\" Lahiri Mahasaya also related to Swami Kebalananda and Sri Yukteswar the story of another meeting with Babaji, under circumstances which recalled the guru's promise: \"I shall come wh enever you need me.\" \"The scene was a Kumbha Mela at Allahabad,\" Lahiri Maha saya told his disciples. \"I had gone there during a short vacation from my office duties. As I wandered amidst the throng of monks and sadhus who had come from great distances to attend the holy festival, I noticed an ash-smeared ascetic who was holding a begging bowl.

From a reverent study of the Bible from an Oriental viewpoint, 35-2 and from intuitional perception, I am convinced that John the Baptist was, in past lives, the guru of Christ. There are numerous passag es in the Bible which infer that John and Jesus in their last incarnations were , respectively, Elijah and his disciple Elisha. (These are the spellings in the Old Testament. The Greek translators spelled the names as Elias and Eliseus; they reappear in the New Testament in these changed forms.) The very end of the Old Testament is a prediction of the reincarnation of Elijah and Elisha: \"Behold, I will send you Elij ah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.\" 35-3 Thus John (Elijah), sent \"before the coming . . . of the Lord,\" was born slightly earlier to serve as a herald for Christ. An angel appeared to Zacharias the fath er to testify that his coming son John would be no other than Elijah (Elias)."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"\"But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. . . .

Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.\" 35-6 Again, Christ says: \"For all the prophets and th e law prophesied until John. And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.\" 35-7 When John denied that he was Elias (Elijah), 35-8 he meant that in the humble garb of John he came no longer in the outward elevation of Elijah the great guru. In his former incarnation he had given the \"mantle\" of his glory an d his spiritual wealth to his disciple Elisha. \"And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee. . . . And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him.\" 35-9 The roles became reversed, because Elijah-John was no longer needed to be the ostensible guru of Elisha-Jesus, now perfected in divine realization. When Christ was transfigured on the mountain 35-10 it was his guru Elias, with Moses, whom he saw. Again, in his hour of extremity on the cross, Jesus cried out the divine name: \" Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Some of th em that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias. . . . Let us see whether Elias will come to save him.\" 35-11 The eternal bond of guru and disciple that existed between John and Jesus was present also for Babaji and Lahiri Mahasa ya.

It was not until the disciple had reached his thirty-third year that Babaji deemed the time to be ripe to openly reestablish the never-severed link. Then, after their brief meeting near Rani khet, the selfless master banished his dearly-beloved disciple from the little mountain group, releasing him for an outward world mission. \"My son, I shall come whenever you need me.\" What mortal lover can bestow that infinite promise? Unknown to society in general, a great sp iritual renaissance began to flow from a remote corner of Benares. Just as the fr agrance of flowers cannot be suppressed, so Lahiri Mahasaya, quietly living as an ideal householder, could not hide his innate glory. Slowly, from every part of India, the devotee-bees sought the divine nectar of the liberated master. The English office superintendent was one of the first to notice a strange transcendental change in his employee, whom he endearingly called \"Ecstatic Babu.\" \"Sir, you seem sad. What is the trouble? \" Lahiri Mahasaya made this sympathetic inquiry one morning to his employer. \"My wife in England is critically ill. I am torn by anxiety.\" \"I shall get you some word about her.\" Lahiri Mahasaya left the room and sat for a short time in a secluded spot. On his return he smiled consolingly. \"Your wife is improving; she is now wr iting you a letter.\" The omniscient yogi quoted some parts of the missive. \"Ecstatic Babu, I already know that you ar e no ordinary man. Yet I am unable to believe that, at will, you ca n banish time and space!\" The promised letter finally arrived. The astounded superintendent found that it contained not only the good news of hi s wife's recovery, but also the same phrases which, weeks earlier, La hiri Mahasaya had repeated."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"The wife came to India some months late r.

The woman approached him reverently. \"Sir,\" she said, \"it was your form, haloed in glorious light, that I beheld months ago by my sickbed in London. At that moment I was completely healed! Soon after, I was able to undertake th e long ocean voyage to India.\" Day after day, one or two devotees besought the sublime guru for Kriya initiation. In addition to these spiritua l duties, and to those of his business and family life, the great master took an enthusiastic interest in education. He organized many study groups, and played an active part in the growth of a large high school in the Bengalitola section of Benares. His regular discourses on the scriptures came to be called his \" Gita Assembly,\" eagerly a ttended by many truth- seekers. By these manifold activities, Lahiri Mahasaya sought to answer the common challenge: \"After performing one's business and social duties, where is the time for devotional meditation?\" The harmon iously balanced life of the great householder-guru became the silent in spiration of thousands of questioning hearts. Earning only a modest salary, thrifty, unostentatious, accessible to all, the master carried on naturally and happily in the path of worldly life. Though ensconced in the seat of the Supreme One, Lahiri Mahasaya showed reverence to all men, irrespective of th eir differing merits. When his devotees saluted him, he bowed in turn to them. With a childlike humility, the master often touched the feet of others, but se ldom allowed them to pay him similar honor, even though such obeisance towa rd the guru is an ancient Oriental custom. A significant feature of Lahiri Mahasaya's life was his gift of Kriya initiation to those of every faith. Not Hindus only, but Moslems and Christians were among his foremost disciples. Monists and dualists, those of all faiths or of no established faith, were impartially received and instructed by the universal guru."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"One of his highly advanced chelas wa s Abdul Gufoor Khan, a Mohammedan.

Like all God-inspired prophets, Lahiri Mahasa ya gave new hope to the outcastes and down-trodden of society. \"Always remember that you belong to no one, and no one belongs to you. Reflect that some day you will sudde nly have to leave everything in this world-so make the acquaintanceship of God now,\" the gr eat guru told his disciples. \"Prepare yourself for the coming astral journey of death by daily riding in the balloon of God-perception.

Cease being a prisoner of the body; using the secret key of Kriya , learn to escape into Spirit.\" The great guru encouraged his various students to adhere to the good traditional discipline of their own faith. St ressing the all-inclusive nature of Kriya as a practical technique of liberation, Lahiri Ma hasaya then gave hi s chelas liberty to express their lives in conformance with environment and up bringing. \"A Moslem should perform his namaj 35-13 worship four times daily,\" the master pointed out. \"Four times daily a Hindu should sit in meditation. A Christian should go down on his knees four times daily, praying to God and then reading the Bible.\" With wise discernment the guru guid ed his followers into the paths of Bhakti (devotion), Karma (action), Jnana (wisdom), or Raja (royal or complete) Yogas , according to each man's natural tendencies .

The distant disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya were often made aware of his enfolding presence. \"I am ever with those who practice Kriya ,\" he said consolingly to chelas who could not remain near him. \"I will guide you to the Cosmic Home through your enlarging perceptions.\" Swami Satyananda was told by a devotee that, unable to go to Benares, the man had nevertheless received precise Kriya initiation in a dream. Lahiri Mahasaya had appeared to instruct the chela in answer to his prayers. If a disciple neglected any of his worldl y obligations, the master would gently correct and discipline him. \"Lahiri Mahasaya's words were mild and healing, even when he was forced to speak openly of a chela's faults,\" Sri Yuk teswar once told me. He added ruefully, \"No disciple ever fled from our master's barbs.\" I could not help laughing, but I truthfully assured Sri Yukteswar that, shar p or not, his every word was music to my ears. Lahiri Mahasaya carefully graded Kriya into four progressive initiations. 35-15 He bestowed the three higher techniques only after the devotee had manifested definite spiritual progress. One day a cert ain chela, convinced that his worth was not being duly evaluated, gave voice to his discontent. \"Master,\" he said, \"surely I am ready now for the second initiation.\" At this moment the door opened to admi t a humble disciple, Brinda Bhagat. He was a Benares postman. \"Brinda, sit by me here.\" The great guru smiled at him affectionately. \"Tell me, are you ready for the second technique of Kriya ?\""},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"The little postman folded his hands in supp lication. \"Gurudeva,\" he said in alarm, \"no more initiations, please!

Innocent alike of sin and syntax, little Brinda won renown in the domain of learned pundits. Besides the numerous Benare s disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya, hundreds came to him from distant parts of India. He himself traveled to Bengal on several occasions, visiting at the homes of the fathers-in-law of his two sons. Thus blessed by his presence, Bengal became honeycombed with small Kriya groups. Particularly in the districts of Krishnagar and Bishnupur, many silent devotees to this day have kept the invisible current of spiritual meditation flowing. Among many saints who received Kriya from Lahiri Mahasaya may be mentioned the illustrious Swami Vhaskarananda Saraswati of Benares, and the Deogarh ascetic of high stature, Balananda Brahmachari. For a time Lahiri Mahasaya served as private tutor to the son of Maharaja Is wari Narayan Sinha Bahadur of Benares. Recognizing the mast er's spiritual attainment, the maharaja, as well as his son, sought Kriya initiation, as did the Maharaja Jotindra Mohan Thakur. A number of Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples with influential worldly position were desirous of expanding the Kriya circle by publicity. The guru refused his"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"permission. One chela, the royal physician to the Lord of Benares, started an organized effort to spread the master's name as \"Kashi Baba\" (Exalted One of Benares). 35-16 Again the guru forbade it. \"Let the fragrance of the Kriya flower be wafted naturally, without any display,\" he said. \"Its seeds will take root in th e soil of spiritually fertile hearts.\" Although the great master did not adop t the system of preaching through the modern medium of an organization, or th rough the printing press, he knew that the power of his message woul d rise like a resistless flood, inundating by its own force the banks of human minds. The change d and purified lives of devotees were the simple guarantees of the deathless vitality of Kriya . In 1886, twenty-five years after his Rani khet initiation, Lahiri Mahasaya was retired on a pension. 35-17 With his availability in th e daytime, disciples sought him out in ever-increasing numbers. The great guru now sat in silence most of the time, locked in the tranquil lotus pos ture. He seldom left his little parlor, even for a walk or to visit other parts of the house. A quiet stream of chelas arrived, almost ceaselessly, for a darshan (holy sight) of the guru. To the awe of all beholders, Lahiri Mahasaya's habitual physiological state exhibited the superhuman features of breathlessness, sleeplessness, cessation of pulse and heartbeat, calm eyes unblinking for hours, and a profound aura of peace. No visitors departed without up liftment of spirit; all knew they had received the silent blessing of a true man of God. The master now permitted his disciple, Panchanon Bhattacharya, to open an \"Arya Mission Institution\" in Calcutta. Here the saintly disciple spread the message of Kriya Yoga , and prepared for public benefit certain yogic herbal 35-18 medicines. In accordance with ancient custom, the master gave to people in general a neem 35-19 oil for the cure of various diseases. When the guru requested a disciple to"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"distil the oil, he could easily accomplish the task. If anyone else tried, he would encounter strange difficulties, fin ding that the medicin al oil had almost evaporated after going through the requir ed distilling processes. Evidently th e master's bl essing was a necessary ingredient. Lahiri Mahasaya's handwriting and signature, in Bengali script, are shown above. The lines occur in a letter to a chela; the great master interprets a Sanskrit verse as follows: \"He who has attained a state of calmness wherein his eyelids do not blink, has a chieved Sambhabi Mudra .\" (signed) \"Sri Shyama Charan Deva Sharm an\" The Arya Mission Institution undertook th e publication of many of the gur u's scriptural commentaries. Like Jesus and othe r great prophets, Lahiri Mahasaya himself wr ote no books, but his penetr atin g interpret ations were recorded and arranged by various disciples. So me of these voluntary amanuenses were more discerning than others in correctl y conve ying the profound insight of the guru; yet, on the whole, their efforts were successful. Through their zeal, the world possesse s u nparalleled commentaries by Lahi ri Mahasaya on twent y-six ancient scriptures. Sri Ananda Mohan La hiri, a gran dson of the master, ha s written a n interesting booklet on Kriya . \"The text of the Bh agavad Gita is a part of the great epic, the Mahab har ata , which possesse s several knot- points ( vyas-kutas ),\" Sri Ananda wrote. \"Keep those knot-points unquestion ed, and we find nothing but mythical stories of a peculiar an d easily-misun derstood type. Keep those knot-points"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"unexplained, and we have lost a scie nce which the East has preserved with superhuman patience after a quest of thousands of years of experiment. 35-20 It was the commentaries of Lahiri Mahasaya which brought to light, clear of allegories, the very science of religion that had been so cleverly put out of sight in the riddle of scriptural letters and imag ery. No longer a mere unintelligible jugglery of words, the otherwise unmeanin g formulas of Vedic worship have been proved by the master to be full of scientific significance. . . . \"We know that man is usually helpless against the insurgent sway of evil passions, but these are rendered powerl ess and man finds no motive in their indulgence when there dawns on him a consciousness of superior and lasting bliss through Kriya . Here the give-up, the nega tion of the lower passions, synchronizes with a take-up, the assertion of a beatitude. Without such a course, hundreds of moral maxims which run in mere negatives are useless to us. \"Our eagerness for worldly activity kills in us the sense of spiritual awe. We cannot comprehend the Great Life behind all names and forms, just because science brings home to us how we can us e the powers of nature; this familiarity has bred a contempt for her ultimate secret s. Our relation with nature is one of practical business. We tease her, so to speak, to know how she can be used to serve our purposes; we make use of he r energies, whose Source yet remains unknown. In science our relation with nature is one that exists between a man and his servant, or in a philosophical se nse she is like a captive in the witness box. We cross-examine her, challenge her, and minutely weigh her evidence in human scales which cannot measure her hidden values. On the other hand, when the self is in communion with a higher power, nature automatically obeys, without stress or strain, the will of man. This effortless command over nature is called 'miraculous' by the un comprehending materialist. \"The life of Lahiri Mahasaya set an ex ample which changed the erroneous notion that yoga is a mysterious practice. Every man may find a way through Kriya to understand his proper relation with nature, and to feel spiritual reverence for all"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"phenomena, whether mystical or of ever yday occurrence, in spite of the matter- of-factness of physical science. 35-21 We must bear in mind that what was mystical a thousand years ago is no longer so, and what is mysterious now may become lawfully intelligible a hundred years hence. It is the Infinite, the Ocean of Power, that is at the back of all manifestations. \"The law of Kriya Yoga is eternal. It is true like mathematics; like the simple rules of addition and subtraction, the law of Kriya can never be destroyed. Burn to ashes all the books on mathematic s, the logically-minded will always rediscover such truths; destroy all the sa cred books on yoga, its fundamental laws will come out whenever there appears a true yogi who comprises within himself pure devotion and consequently pure knowledge.\" Just as Babaji is among the greatest of avatars, a Mahavatar , and Sri Yukteswar a Jnanavatar or Incarnation of Wisdom, so Lahi ri Mahasaya may justly be called Yogavatar , or Incarnation of Yoga. By the standards of both qualitative and quantitative good, he elevated the spiritua l level of society. In his power to raise his close disciples to Christlike stature and in his wide disse mination of truth among the masses, Lahiri Mahasaya ranks among the saviors of mankind. His uniqueness as a prophet lies in his practical stress on a definite method, Kriya , opening for the first time the doors of yoga freedom to all men. Apart from the miracles of his own life, surely the Yogavatar reached the zenith of all wonders in reducing the ancient complexitie s of yoga to an effective simplicity not beyond the ordinary grasp. In reference to miracles, Lahiri Mahasaya often said, \"The operation of subtle laws which are unknown to people in gene ral should not be publicly discussed or published without due discrimination.\" If in these pages I have appeared to flout his cautionary words, it is because he ha s given me an inward reassurance. Also, in recording the lives of Babaji, Lahi ri Mahasaya, and Sri Yukteswar, I have thought it advisable to omit many true miraculous stories, which could hardly"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"have been included without writing, also, an explanatory volume of abstruse philosophy.

Reincarnational cycles are a more reasonable explanation for the different states of evolution in which mankind is found, than the common Western theory which assumes that something (consciousness of egoity) came out of nothing, exis ted with varying degrees of lustihood for thirty or ninety years, and then returned to the original void.

Himalayan herbs were employed in a rejuvenation treatment which arou sed the attention of the world in 1938 when the method was used on Pundit Madan Mohan Malaviya, 77-year-old Vice-Chancellor of Benares Hindu University. To a remarkable extent, the noted sch olar regained in 45 days his health, strength, memory, normal eyesight; indications of a third se t of teeth appeared, while all wrinkles vanished. The herbal treatment, known as Kaya Kalpa , is one of 80 rejuvenation methods outlined in Hindu Ayurveda or medical science. Pundit Malaviya underwent the treatment at the hands of Sri Kalpacharya Swami Beshundasji, who claims 1766 as his birth year. He possesses documents proving him to be more than 100 years old; Associated Press reporters remarked that he looked about 40. Ancient Hindu treatises divided me dical science into 8 branches: salya (surgery); salakya (diseases above the neck); kayachikitsa (medicine proper); bhutavidya (mental diseases); kaumara (care of infancy); agada (toxicology); Rasayana (longevity); Vagikarana (tonics). Vedic physicians used delicate surgical instruments, employed plastic su rgery, understood medical methods to counteract the effects of poison gas, performed Caesarean sections and brain operations, were skilled in dynamization of drugs. Hippocrates, famous physician of the 5th century B.C., borrowed much of his materia medica from Hindu sources. 35-19: The East Indian margosa tree.

Norman Brown in the May, 1939 issue of the Bulletin of the American Council of Learned Societies, Washington, D.C. 35-21: One thinks here of Carlyle's observation in Sartor Resartus: \"The man who cannot wonder, who does not habitually wonder (and worship), w ere he president of innumerable Royal Societies and carried . . . the epitome of all laboratories and observatories, with their results, in his single head,-is but a pair of spectacles behind which there is no eye.\" CHAPTER: 36 Babaji's Interest In The West \"Master, did you ever meet Babaji?\" It was a calm summer night in Serampore; the large stars of the tropics gleamed over our heads as I sat by Sri Yukteswar's side on the second-story balcony of the hermitage. \"Yes.\" Master smiled at my direct ques tion; his eyes lit with reverence. \"Three times I have been blessed by the sight of the deathless guru. Our first meeting was in Allahabad at a Kumbha Mela .\" The religious fairs held in India si nce time immemorial are known as Kumbha Melas ; they have kept spiritual goals in constant sight of the multitude. Devout Hindus gather by the millions every six ye ars to meet thousands of sadhus, yogis, swamis, and ascetics of all kinds. Ma ny are hermits who never leave their secluded haunts except to attend the melas and bestow their blessings on worldly men and women. \"I was not a swami at the time I met Babaji,\" Sri Yukteswar went on. \"But I had already received Kriya initiation from Lahiri Mahasaya. He encouraged me to attend the mela which was convening in January, 1894 at Allahabad. It was my first experience of a kumbha ; I felt slightly dazed by the clamor and surge of the"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"crowd. In my searching gazes around I sa w no illumined face of a master. Passing a bridge on the bank of the Ganges, I noticed an acquaintance standing near-by, his begging bowl extended. \"'Oh, this fair is nothing but a chaos of noise and beggars,' I thought in disillusionment. 'I wonder if Western scientists, patiently enlarging the realms of knowledge for the practical good of mankind, are not more pleasing to God than these idlers who profess religion but concentrate on alms.' \"My smouldering reflections on social refo rm were interrupted by the voice of a tall sannyasi who halted before me. \"'Sir,' he said, 'a saint is calling you.' \"'Who is he?' \"'Come and see for yourself.' \"Hesitantly following this laconic advice , I soon found myself near a tree whose branches were sheltering a guru with an attractive group of disciples. The master, a bright unusual figure, with sparkling dark eyes, rose at my approach and embraced me. \"'Welcome, Swamiji,' he said affectionately. \"'Sir,' I replied emphatically, 'I am not a swami.' \"'Those on whom I am divinely directed to bestow the title of \"swami\" never cast it off.' The saint addressed me simply, bu t deep conviction of truth rang in his words; I was engulfed in an instant wave of spiritual blessing. Smiling at my sudden elevation into the ancient monastic order, 36-1 I bowed at the feet of the obviously great and angelic being in hu man form who had thus honored me. \"Babaji-for it was indeed he-motioned me to a seat near him under the tree. He was strong and young, and looked like Lahiri Mahasaya; yet the resemblance did"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"not strike me, even though I had often he ard of the extraordinary similarities in the appearance of the two masters. Babaji possesses a power by which he can prevent any specific thought from arising in a person's mind. Evidently the great guru wished me to be perfectly natural in his presence, not overawed by knowledge of his identity. \"'What do you think of the Kumbha Mela ?' \"'I was greatly disappointed, sir.' I added hastily, 'Up until the time I met you. Somehow saints and this commotion don't seem to belong together.' \"'Child,' the master said, though apparent ly I was nearly twice his own age, 'for the faults of the many, judge not the wh ole. Everything on earth is of mixed character, like a mingling of sand and su gar. Be like the wise ant which seizes only the sugar, and leaves the sand unto uched. Though many sadhus here still wander in delusion, yet the mela is blessed by a few men of God-realization.' \"In view of my own meeting with this exalted master, I quickly agreed with his observation. \"'Sir,' I commented, 'I have been thinking of the scientific men of the West, greater by far in intelligence than most pe ople congregated here, living in distant Europe and America, professing different cr eeds, and ignorant of the real values of such melas as the present one. They are th e men who could benefit greatly by meetings with India's masters. But, alth ough high in intellectual attainments, many Westerners are wedded to rank mate rialism. Others, famous in science and philosophy, do not recognize the essential unity in religion. Their creeds serve as insurmountable barriers that threaten to separate them from us forever.' \"'I saw that you are interested in the We st, as well as the East.' Babaji's face beamed with approval. 'I felt the pangs of your heart, broad enough for all men, whether Oriental or Occidental. That is why I summoned you here."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"\"'East and West must establish a golden mi ddle path of activity and spirituality combined,' he continued. 'India has much to learn from the West in material development; in return, India can teach the universal methods by which the West will be able to base its re ligious beliefs on the unshakable foundations of yogic science. \"'You, Swamiji, have a part to play in the coming harmonious exchange between Orient and Occident. Some years hence I sh all send you a disciple whom you can train for yoga dissemination in the West. The vibrations there of many spiritually seeking souls come floodlike to me. I perceive potential saints in America and Europe, waiting to be awakened.'\" At this point in his story, Sri Yukte swar turned his gaze fully on mine. \"My son,\" he said, smiling in the moonlight, \"you are the disciple that, years ago, Babaji promised to send me.\" I was happy to learn that Babaji had direct ed my steps to Sri Yukteswar, yet it was hard for me to visualize myself in the remote West, away from my beloved guru and the simple hermitage peace. \"Babaji then spoke of the Bhagavad Gita ,\" Sri Yukteswar went on. \"To my astonishment, he indicated by a few words of praise that he was aware of the fact that I had written interpretations on various Gita chapters. \"'At my request, Swamiji, please undert ake another task,' the great master said. 'Will you not write a short book on the underlying basic unity between the Christian and Hindu scriptures? Show by parallel references that the inspired sons of God have spoken the same tr uths, now obscured by men's sectarian differences.' \"'Maharaj,' 36-2 I answered diffidently, 'what a command! Shall I be able to fulfill it?'"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"\"Babaji laughed softly. 'My son, why do yo u doubt?' he said reassuringly. 'Indeed, Whose work is all this, and Who is the Doer of all actions? Whatever the Lord has made me say is bound to materialize as truth.' \"I deemed myself empowered by the blessi ngs of the saint, and agreed to write the book. Feeling reluctantly that the part ing-hour had arrived, I rose from my leafy seat. \"'Do you know Lahiri?' 36-3 the master inquired. 'He is a great soul, isn't he? Tell him of our meeting.' He then gave me a message for Lahiri Mahasaya. \"After I had bowed humbly in farewell, the saint smiled benignly. 'When your book is finished, I shall pay you a visit, ' he promised. 'Good-by for the present.' \"I left Allahabad the following day and entr ained for Benares. Reaching my guru's home, I poured out the story of the wonderful saint at the Kumbha Mela. \"'Oh, didn't you recognize him?' Lahiri Mahasaya's eyes were dancing with laughter. 'I see you couldn't, for he prev ented you. He is my incomparable guru, the celestial Babaji!' \"'Babaji!' I repeated, awestruck. 'The Yogi-Christ Babaji! The invisible-visible savior Babaji! Oh, if I could just recall th e past and be once more in his presence, to show my devotion at his lotus feet!' \"'Never mind,' Lahiri Maha saya said consolingly. 'He has promised to see you again.' \"'Gurudeva, the divine master asked me to give you a message. \"Tell Lahiri,\" he said, \"that the stored-up power for this life now runs low; it is nearly finished.\"' \"At my utterance of these enigmatic words, Lahiri Mahasaya's figure trembled as though touched by a lightning current. In an instant everything about him fell silent; his smiling countenance turned incredibly stern. Like a wooden statue,"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"somber and immovable in its seat, his bo dy became colorless. I was alarmed and bewildered. Never in my life had I seen this joyous soul manifest such awful gravity. The other disciples present stared apprehensively. \"Three hours passed in utter silence. Then Lahiri Mahasaya resumed his natural, cheerful demeanor, and spoke affectionate ly to each of the chelas. Everyone sighed in relief. \"I realized by my master's reaction that Babaji's message had been an unmistakable signal by which Lahiri Mahasaya understood that his body would soon be untenanted. His awesome silenc e proved that my guru had instantly controlled his being, cut his last cord of attachment to the material world, and fled to his ever-living identity in Spirit. Babaji's remark had been his way of saying: 'I shall be ever with you.' \"Though Babaji and Lahiri Mahasaya we re omniscient, and had no need of communicating with each other through me or any other intermediary, the great ones often condescend to play a part in the human drama. Occasionally they transmit their prophecies through messenger s in an ordinary way, that the final fulfillment of their words may infuse greate r divine faith in a wide circle of men who later learn the story. \"I soon left Benares, and set to work in Serampore on the scriptural writings requested by Babaji,\" Sri Yukteswar conti nued. \"No sooner had I begun my task than I was able to compose a poem dedicated to the deathless guru. The melodious lines flowed effortlessly from my pen, though never before had I attempted Sanskrit poetry. \"In the quiet of night I busied myself over a comparison of the Bible and the scriptures of Sanatan Dharma . 36-4 Quoting the words of the blessed Lord Jesus, I showed that his teachings were in e ssence one with the revelations of the Vedas .

The ghat was deserted; I stood still for awhile, enjoying the sunny peace. After a dip in the sparkling waters, I started for home. The only sound in the silence was that of my Ganges-drenched cloth, swish- swashing with every step. As I passed beyond the site of the large banyan tree near the river bank, a strong impulse urged me to look back. There, under the shade of the banyan, and surroun ded by a few disciples, sat the great Babaji! \"'Greetings, Swamiji!' The beautiful voice of the master rang out to assure me I was not dreaming. 'I see you have successfully completed your book. As I promised, I am here to thank you.' \"With a fast-beating heart, I prostrated my self fully at his feet. 'Param-guruji,' I said imploringly, 'will you and your chel as not honor my near-by home with your presence?' \"The supreme guru smilingly declined. 'No, child,' he said, 'we are people who like the shelter of trees; this spot is quite comfortable.' \"'Please tarry awhile, Master.' I gazed entrea tingly at him. 'I shall be back at once with some special sweetmeats.' \"When I returned in a few minutes with a di sh of delicacies, lo! the lordly banyan no longer sheltered the celestial troupe. I searched all around the ghat, but in my heart I knew the little band had already fled on etheric wings. \"I was deeply hurt. 'Even if we meet agai n, I would not care to talk to him,' I assured myself. 'He was unkind to leave me so suddenly.' This was a wrath of love, of course, and nothing more."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"\"A few months later I visite d Lahiri Mahasaya in Benares. As I entered his little parlor, my guru smiled in greeting. \"'Welcome, Yukteswar,' he said.

Lahiri Mahasaya touched me gently on the forehead; at once I beheld, near the door, the form of Babaji, blooming like a perfect lotus. \"I remembered my old hurt, and did not bo w. Lahiri Mahasaya looked at me in astonishment. \"The divine guru gazed at me with fathom less eyes. 'You are annoyed with me.' \"'Sir, why shouldn't I be?' I answered. 'O ut of the air you came with your magic group, and into the thin air you vanished.' \"'I told you I would see you, but didn't say how long I woul d remain.' Babaji laughed softly. 'You were full of excite ment. I assure you that I was fairly extinguished in the ether by th e gust of your restlessness.' \"I was instantly satisfied by this unflatte ring explanation. I knelt at his feet; the supreme guru patted me kindly on the shoulder. \"'Child, you must meditate more,' he said . 'Your gaze is not yet faultless-you could not see me hiding behind the sunlight.' With these words in the voice of a celestial flute, Babaji disappear ed into the hidden radiance. \"That was one of my last visits to Be nares to see my guru,\" Sri Yukteswar concluded. \"Even as Babaji had foretold at the Kumbha Mela , the householder- incarnation of Lahiri Mahasaya was draw ing to a close.

No longer need I seek him out in his little parlor; I find every day of my life blessed by his omnipresent guidance.\" Years later, from the lips of Swami Keshabananda, 36-6 an advanced disciple, I heard many wonderful details about the passing of Lahiri Mahasaya. \"A few days before my guru relinquished his body,\" Keshabananda told me, \"he materialized himself before me as I sat in my hermitage at Hardwar. \"'Come at once to Benares.' With these words Lahiri Mahasaya vanished. \"I entrained immediately for Benares. At my guru's home I found many disciples assembled. For hours that day 36-7 the master expounded the Gita ; then he addressed us simply. \"'I am going home.' \"Sobs of anguish broke out like an irresistible torrent. \"'Be comforted; I shall rise again.' Afte r this utterance Lahiri Mahasaya thrice turned his body around in a circle, face d the north in his lotus posture, and gloriously entered the final maha- samadhi . 36-8 \"Lahiri Mahasaya's beautiful body, so de ar to the devotees, was cremated with solemn householder rites at Manikarnika Ghat by the holy Ganges,\" Keshabananda continued. \"The following day, at ten o'clock in the morning, while I was still in Benares, my room was suffus ed with a great light.

Henceforth I shall spend some time with Babaji in the Himalayas, and with Babaji in the cosmos.' \"With a few words of blessing to me , the transcendent master vanished. Wondrous inspiration filled my heart; I was uplifted in Spirit even as were the disciples of Christ and Kabir 36-9 when they had gazed on their living gurus after physical death. \"When I returned to my isolated Hardwar hermitage,\" Keshabananda went on, \"I carried with me the sacred ashes of my guru. I know he has escaped the spatio- temporal cage; the bird of omnipresence is freed. Yet it comforted my heart to enshrine his sacred remains.\" Another disciple who was blessed by the sight of his resurrected guru was the saintly Panchanon Bhattacharya, foun der of the Calcutta Arya Mission Institution. 36-10 I visited Panchanon at his Calcutta home, an d listened with delight to the story of his many years with the master. In conclus ion, he told me of the most marvelous event in his life. \"Here in Calcutta,\" Panchanon said, \"at ten o'clock of the morning which followed his cremation, Lahiri Ma hasaya appeared before me in living glory.\" Swami Pranabananda, the \"saint with two bodies,\" also confided to me the details of his own supernal experience. \"A few days before Lahiri Mahasaya left his body,\" Pranabananda told me at the time he visited my Ranchi sc hool, \"I received a letter from him, requesting me to"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"come at once to Benares. I was delayed, however, and could not leave immediately. As I was in the midst of my travel preparations, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was suddenly overwhelmed with joy to see the shining figure of my guru. \"'Why hurry to Benares?' Lahiri Mahasaya said, smiling. 'You shall find me there no longer.' \"As the import of his words dawned on me, I sobbed broken-heartedly, believing that I was seeing him only in a vision. \"The master approached me comfortingly. 'Here, touch my flesh,' he said. 'I am living, as always. Do not lament; am I not with you forever?'\" From the lips of these three great disciples, a story of wondrous truth has emerged: At the morning hour of ten, on the day after the body of Lahiri Mahasaya had been consigned to the flames, the resurrected master, in a real but transfigured body, appeared before three di sciples, each one in a different city. \"So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brou ght to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?\" 36-11 36-1: Sri Yukteswar was later formally initiated into the Swami Order by the Mahant (monastery head) of Buddh Gaya. 36-2: \"Great King\"-a title of respect. 36-3: A guru usually refers to his own disciple simp ly by his name, omitting any title. Thus, Babaji said \"Lahiri,\" not \"Lahiri Mahasaya.\" 36-4: Literally, \"eternal religion,\" the name given to the body of Vedic teachings. Sanatan Dharma has come to be called Hinduism since the time of the Greeks who designated the people on the banks of the river Indus as Indoos , or Hindus .

Babaji, the guru of Lahiri Mahasaya, was the param-guru of Sri Yukteswar. 36-6: My visit to Keshabananda's as hram is described on pp. 405-408. 36-7: September 26, 1895 is the date on which Lahiri Mahasaya left his body. In a few more days he would have reached his sixty-eighth birthday. 36-8: Facing the north, and thrice revolving the bo dy, are parts of a Vedic rite used by masters who know beforehand when the final hour is about to strike for the physical body. The last meditation, during which the master merges himself in the Cosmic AUM, is called the maha , or great, samadhi . 36-9: Kabir was a great sixteenth-century saint wh ose large following included both Hindus and Mohammedans. At the time of his death, the disciples quarreled over the manner of conducting the funeral ceremonies. The exasperated master rose from his final sleep, and gave his instructions. \"Half of my remains shall be buried by the Moslem rites;\" he said, \"let the other half be cremated with a Hindu sacrament.\" He then vanished. When the disciples opened the coffin which had contained his body, nothing was foun d but a dazzling array of gold-col ored champak flowers. Half of these were obediently buried by the Moslems, who revere his shrine to this day. In his youth Kabir was approached by two disciples who wanted minute intellectual guidance along the mystic path. The master responded simply: \"Path presupposes distance; If He be near, no path needest thou at all. Verily it maketh me smile To hear of a fish in water athirst!\" 36-10: Panchanon established, in a seventeen-acre ga rden at Deogarh in Bihar, a temple containing a stone statue of Lahiri Mahasaya.

To him America seemed incredibly remote; he fe ared he might never see me again. \"How can you go?\" he asked sternly. \"Who will finance you?\" As he had affectionately borne the expenses of my education and whole life, he doubtless hoped that his question would bring my project to an embarrassing halt. \"The Lord will surely finance me.\" As I ma de this reply, I thought of the similar one I had given long ago to my brother An anta in Agra. Without very much guile, I added, \"Father, perhaps God will put it into your mind to help me.\" \"No, never!\" He glanced at me piteously. I was astounded, therefore, when Father handed me, the following day, a check made out for a large amount."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"\"I give you this money,\" he said, \"not in my capacity as a father, but as a faithful disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya. Go then to that far Western land; spread there the creedless teachings of Kriya Yoga .\" I was immensely touched at the selfless spir it in which Father had been able to quickly put aside his personal desires. The just realization had come to him during the preceding night that no or dinary desire for foreign travel was motivating my voyage. \"Perhaps we shall not meet again in this life.\" Father, who was sixty- seven at this time, spoke sadly. An intuitive conviction prompted me to reply, \"Surely the Lord will bring us together once more.\" As I went about my preparations to leave Master and my native land for the unknown shores of America, I experience d not a little trepidation. I had heard many stories about the materialistic West ern atmosphere, one very different from the spiritual background of India, pervaded with the centuried aura of saints. \"An Oriental teacher who will dare the West ern airs,\" I thought, \"must be hardy beyond the trials of any Himalayan cold!\" One early morning I began to pray, with an adamant determination to continue, to even die praying, until I heard the vo ice of God. I wanted His blessing and assurance that I would not lose myself in the fogs of modern utilitarianism. My heart was set to go to America, but even mo re strongly was it resolved to hear the solace of divine permission. I prayed and prayed, muffling my sobs. No answer came. My silent petition increased in excruciating crescendo until, at noon, I had reached a zenith; my brain could no longer withstand the pressure of my agonies. If I cried once more with an increased depth of my inner pa ssion, I felt as though my brain would split. At that moment there came a knock outside the vestibule adjoining the"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"Gurpar Road room in which I was sitting. Opening the door, I saw a young man in the scanty garb of a renunciate. He ca me in, closed the door behind him and, refusing my request to sit down, indicated wi th a gesture that he wished to talk to me while standing. \"He must be Babaji!\" I thought, daze d, because the man before me had the features of a younger Lahiri Mahasaya. He answered my thought. \"Yes, I am Ba baji.\" He spoke melodiously in Hindi. \"Our Heavenly Father has heard your prayer. He commands me to tell you: Follow the behests of your guru and go to America. Fear not; you will be protected.\" After a vibrant pause, Babaji addressed me again. \"You are the one I have chosen to spread the message of Kriya Yoga in the West. Long ago I met your guru Yukteswar at a Kumbha Mela ; I told him then I would send you to him for training.\" I was speechless, choked with devotional awe at his presence, and deeply touched to hear from his own lips that he had gu ided me to Sri Yukteswar. I lay prostrate before the deathless guru. He graciously lifted me from the floor. Telling me many things about my life, he then ga ve me some personal instruction, and uttered a few secret prophecies. \" Kriya Yoga , the scientific technique of God-realization,\" he finally said with solemnity, \"will ultimately spread in all lands, and aid in harmonizing the nations through man's personal, transcendental pe rception of the Infinite Father.\" With a gaze of majestic power, the mast er electrified me by a glimpse of his cosmic consciousness. In a short while he started toward the door. \"Do not try to follow me,\" he said. \"Y ou will not be able to do so.\" \"Please, Babaji, don't go away!\" I cr ied repeatedly. \"Take me with you!\""},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"Looking back, he replied, \"Not now. Some other time.\" Overcome by emotion, I disregarded his warning. As I tried to pursue him, I discovered that my feet were firmly r ooted to the floor. From the door, Babaji gave me a last affectionate glance. He ra ised his hand by way of benediction and walked away, my eyes fixed on him longingly. After a few minutes my feet were free. I sat down and went into a deep meditation, unceasingly thanking God not only for answering my prayer but for blessing me by a meeting with Babaji. My whole body seemed sanctified through the touch of the ancient, ever-youthful master. Long had it been my burning desire to behold him. Until now, I have never recounted to anyone this story of my meeting with Babaji. Holding it as the most sacred of my hu man experiences, I have hidden it in my heart. But the thought occurred to me that readers of this autobiography may be more inclined to believe in the reality of the secluded Babaji and his world interests if I relate that I saw him with my own eyes. I have helped an artist to draw a true picture of the great Yogi-Chris t of modern India; it appears in this book. The eve of my departure for the United St ates found me in Sri Yukteswar's holy presence. \"Forget you were born a Hindu, and don't be an American. Take the best of them both,\" Master said in his calm way of wi sdom. \"Be your true self, a child of God. Seek and incorporate into your being the best qualities of all your brothers, scattered over the earth in various races.\" Then he blessed me: \"All those who come to you with faith, seeking God, will be helped. As you look at them , the spiritual current emanating from your eyes will enter into their brains and change their material habits, making them more God- conscious.\""},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"He went on, \"Your lot to attract sincere souls is very good. Everywhere you go, even in a wilderness, you will find friends.\" Both of his blessings have been amply demonstrated. I came alone to America, into a wilderness without a single friend, but there I found thousands ready to receive the time-tested soul-teachings. I left India in August, 1920, on The City Of Sparta , the first passenger boat sailing for America after the close of World War I. I had been able to book passage only after the removal, in ways fairly miraculous, of many \"red-tape\" difficulties concerned with the granting of my passport. During the two-months' voyage a fello w passenger found out that I was the Indian delegate to the Boston congress. \"Swami Yogananda,\" he said, with the fi rst of many quaint pronunciations by which I was later to hear my name spok en by the Americans, \"please favor the passengers with a lecture next Thursday ni ght. I think we would all benefit by a talk on 'The Battle of Life and How to Fight It.'\" Alas! I had to fight the battle of my own life, I discovered on Wednesday. Desperately trying to organize my idea s into a lecture in English, I finally abandoned all preparations; my thoughts, li ke a wild colt eyeing a saddle, refused any cooperation with the laws of English gr ammar. Fully trusting in Master's past assurances, however, I appeared before my Thursday audience in the saloon of the steamer. No eloquence rose to my lips; speechlessly I stood before the assemblage. After an endurance contest lasting ten minutes, the audience realized my predicament and began to laugh."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":" I stand on the dais before one of my classes in America. This class of a thousand yoga students was held in Washington, D.C. The situation was not funny to me at th e moment; indignantly I sent a silent prayer to Master. \"You can ! Speak!\" His voice sounded instan tly within my consciousness. My thoughts fell at once into a friendly relation with the English la nguage. Forty- five minutes later the a udience was still attentive. The talk won me a number of invitations to lecture later befo re various groups in Ame rica. I never could remember, afterward, a word that I had spoken. By discreet in quiry I learned from a numb er of passengers: \"You gave an inspiring lecture in stirring and correct English.\" At this delightful news I humbly thanked my guru for his timely help, realizing a new that he was ever with me, se tting at naught all barr iers of time and space. Once in awhile, during the remainder of the ocean trip, I experienced a few apprehensive twinges about the coming En glish-lecture ordeal at the Boston congress."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"\"Lord,\" I prayed, \"please let my inspir ation be Thyself, and not again the laughter-bombs of the audience!\" The City Of Sparta docked near Boston in late September. On the sixth of October I addressed the congress with my maiden speech in America. It was well received; I sighed in relief. The ma gnanimous secretary of the American Unitarian Association wrote the following comment in a published account 37-4 of the congress proceedings: \"Swami Yogananda, delegate from the Br ahmacharya Ashram of Ranchi, India, brought the greetings of his Association to the Congress. In fluent English and a forcible delivery he gave an address of a philosophical character on 'The Science of Religion,' which has been printed in pamphlet form for a wider distribution. Religion, he maintained, is universa l and it is one. We cannot possibly universalize particular customs and convictions, but the common element in religion can be universalized, and we can ask all alike to follow and obey it.\" Due to Father's generous check, I was able to remain in America after the congress was over. Four happy years were spent in humble circumstances in Boston. I gave public lectures, taught classes, and wrote a book of poems, Songs Of The Soul , with a preface by Dr. Frederick B. Robinson, president of the College of the City of New York. 37-5 Starting a transcontinental tour in the summer of 1924, I spoke before thousands in the principal cities, ending my wester n trip with a vacation in the beautiful Alaskan north. With the help of large-hearted students, by the end of 1925 I had established an American headquarters on the Mount Wash ington Estates in Los Angeles. The building is the one I had seen years before in my vision at Kashmir. I hastened to send Sri Yukteswar pictures of these distant American activities. He replied with a postcard in Bengali, which I here translate:"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"11th August, 1926 Child of my heart, O Yogananda!

Seeing the gate, the winding hilly way upward, and th e beautiful scenery spread out beneath the Mount Washington Estates, I yearn to behold it all with my own eyes. Everything here is going on well. Throug h the grace of God, may you ever be in bliss. SRI YUKTESWAR GIRI Years sped by. I lectured in every part of my new land, and addressed hundreds of clubs, colleges, churches, and groups of every denomination. Tens of thousands of Americans received yoga in itiation. To them all I dedicated a new book of prayer thoughts in 1929- Whispers From Eternity , with a preface by Amelita Galli-Curci. 37-6 I give here, from the book, a poem entitled \"God! God! God!\", composed one night as I stood on a lecture platform: From the depths of slumber, As I ascend the spiral stairway of wakefulness, I whisper: God! God! God! Thou art the food, and when I break my fast Of nightly separation from Thee, I taste Thee, and mentally say: God! God! God! No matter where I go, the spotlight of my mind Ever keeps turning on Thee; And in the battle din of activity My silent war cry is ever: God! God! God!

And my joy comes singing evermore: God! God! God! In waking, eating, working, dreaming, sleeping, Serving, meditating, chanting, divinely loving, My soul constantly hums, unheard by any: God! God! God! Sometimes-usually on the first of the month when the bills rolled in for upkeep of the Mount Washington and other Self-Rea lization Fellowship centers!-I thought longingly of the simple peace of India. But daily I saw a widening understanding between West and East; my soul rejoiced. I have found the great heart of America expressed in the wondrous lines by Emma Lazarus, carved at the base of the Statue of Liberty, the \"Mother of Exiles\":  From her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. \"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!\" cries she With silent lips. \"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

CHAPTER: 38 Luther Burbank -- A Saint Amidst The Roses \"The secret of improved plant breeding, apart from scientific knowledge, is love.\" Luther Burbank uttered this wisdom as I walked beside him in his Santa Rosa garden. We halted near a bed of edible cacti. \"While I was conducting experiments to ma ke 'spineless' cacti,\" he continued, \"I often talked to the plants to create a vibrat ion of love. 'You have nothing to fear,' I would tell them. 'You don't need your defensive thorns. I will protect you.' Gradually the useful plant of the desert emerged in a thornless variety.\" I was charmed at this miracle. \"Please, de ar Luther, give me a few cacti leaves to plant in my garden at Mount Washington.\" A workman standing near-by started to strip off some leaves; Burbank prevented him. \"I myself will pluck them for the swami.\" He handed me three leaves, which later I planted, rejoicing as they grew to huge estate."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"The great horticulturis t told me that his first notable triumph was the large potato, now known b y his name. With the i nde fatigability of genius, he went on to present the world with hundreds of cr ossed improvements on nature-his new Burbank varieties of tomato, corn, squash, c herries, plums, nectarines, berries, poppies, lilies, roses. I focused my camera as Luther led me be fore the famous walnut tree by which he had proved that natur al evolution can be telescopically hastened. \"In only sixteen years,\" he said, \"t his wa lnut tree reached a state of abundant nut production to which a n unaided nature would have brought the tr ee in twice that time.\" Luther Burbank, belov ed friend, poses wit h me in his Santa Rosa garden. Burbank's little adopted daughter came romping with he r dog into the garden. \"She is m y human pla nt.\" Luther waved to her affection ately. \"I see humanity now as one vast plant, needing for its hi ghest fulfillments only love, the natural blessings o f the great outdoors, and intellige nt crossing and selection.

We must return to nature and nature's God.\" \"Luther, you would delight in my Ranchi school, with its outdoor classes, and atmosphere of joy and simplicity.\" My words touched the chord closest to Burb ank's heart-child education. He plied me with questions, interest gleami ng from his deep, serene eyes. \"Swamiji,\" he said finally , \"schools like yours are the only hope of a future millennium. I am in revolt against the ed ucational systems of our time, severed from nature and stifling of all individualit y. I am with you heart and soul in your practical ideals of education.\" As I was taking leave of the gentle sa ge, he autographed a small volume and presented it to me. 38-1 \"Here is my book on The Training Of The Human Plant ,\" 38-2 he said. \"New types of training are n eeded-fearless experiments. At times the most daring trials have succeeded in brin ging out the best in fruits and flowers. Educational innovations for children sh ould likewise become more numerous, more courageous.\" I read his little book that night with intense interest. His eye envisioning a glorious future for the race, he wrote: \"The most stubborn living thing in this world, the most difficult to swerve, is a plant once fixed in certain habits. . . . Remember that this plant has preserved its individuality all through the ages; perhaps it is one which can be traced backward through eons of time in the very rocks themselves, never having varied to an y great extent in all these vast periods. Do you suppose, after all these ages of repetition, the plant does not become possessed of a will, if you so choose to call it, of unparalleled tenacity? Indeed, there are plants, like certain of the palms, so persistent that no human power has yet been able to change them. The human will is a weak thing beside the will of a plant. But see how this whole plant's life long stubbornness is broken simply by"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"blending a new life with it, making, by crossing, a complete and powerful change in its life. Then when the break comes, fix it by these generations of patient supervision and selection, and the new plant sets out upon its new way never again to return to the old, its tenaci ous will broken and changed at last. \"When it comes to so sensitive and pliable a thing as the nature of a child, the problem becomes vastly easier.\" Magnetically drawn to this great America n, I visited him again and again. One morning I arrived at the same time as the postman, who deposited in Burbank's study about a thousand letters. Horticultur ists wrote him from all parts of the world. \"Swamiji, your presence is just the excu se I need to get out into the garden,\" Luther said gaily. He opened a large desk-drawer containing hundreds of travel folders. \"See,\" he said, \"this is how I do my traveling. Tied down by my plants and correspondence, I satisfy my desire for foreign lands by a glance now and then at these pictures.\" My car was standing before his gate; Luther and I drove along the streets of the little town, its gardens bright with his own varieties of Santa Rosa, Peachblow, and Burbank roses. \"My friend Henry Ford and I both believe in the ancient theory of reincarnation,\" Luther told me. \"It sheds light on aspect s of life otherwise inexplicable. Memory is not a test of truth; just because man fa ils to remember his past lives does not prove he never had them. Memory is blan k concerning his womb-life and infancy, too; but he probably passed through them!\" He chuckled. The great scientist had received Kriya initiation during one of my earlier visits. \"I practice the technique devoutly, Swam iji,\" he said. After many thoughtful questions to me about various aspects of yoga, Luther remarked slowly:"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"\"The East indeed possesses immense hoar ds of knowledge which the West has scarcely begun to explore.\" Intimate communion with nature, who un locked to him many of her jealously guarded secrets, had given Burbank a boundless spiritual reverence. \"Sometimes I feel very close to the In finite Power,\" he confided shyly. His sensitive, beautifully modeled face lit wi th his memories. \"The n I have been able to heal sick persons around me, as well as many ailing plants.\" He told me of his mother, a sincere Ch ristian. \"Many times after her death,\" Luther said, \"I have been blessed by her appearance in visions; she has spoken to me.\" We drove back reluctantly toward his home and those waiting thousand letters. \"Luther,\" I remarked, \"next month I am st arting a magazine to present the truth- offerings of East and West. Please help me decide on a good name for the journal.\" We discussed titles for awhile, and finally agreed on East-West . After we had reentered his study, Burbank gave me an article he had written on \"Science and Civilization.\" \"This will go in the first issue of East-West ,\" I said gratefully. As our friendship grew deeper, I called Burbank my \"American saint.\" \"Behold a man,\" I quoted, \"in whom there is no guile!\" His heart was fathomlessly deep, long acquainted with humility, patience, sacrifice. His little home amidst the roses was austerely simple; he knew the worthlessness of luxury, the joy of few possessions. The modesty with which he wore his scientific fame repeatedly reminded me of the trees that bend low wi th the burden of ripening fruits; it is the barren tree that lifts its head high in an empty boast."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"I was in New York when, in 1926, my dear friend passed away. In tears I thought, \"Oh, I would gladly walk all the way fr om here to Santa Rosa for one more glimpse of him!\" Locking my self away from secretaries and visitors, I spent the next twenty-four hours in seclusion. The following day I conducted a Vedic memorial rite around a large picture of Luther. A group of my American students, garbed in Hindu ceremonial clothes, chanted the ancient hymns as an offering was made of flowers, water, and fire- symbols of the bodily elem ents and their release in the Infinite Source. Though the form of Burbank lies in Santa Rosa under a Lebanon cedar that he planted years ago in his garden, his soul is enshrined for me in every wide-eyed flower that blooms by the wayside. Withdr awn for a time into the spacious spirit of nature, is that not Luther whisperi ng in her winds, walking her dawns? His name has now passed into the herita ge of common speech. Listing \"burbank\" as a transitive verb, Webster's New Intern ational Dictionary defines it: \"To cross or graft (a plant). Hence, figuratively, to improve (anything, as a process or institution) by selecting good features and rejecting bad, or by adding good features.\" \"Beloved Burbank,\" I cried after reading th e definition, \"your very name is now a synonym for goodness!\" LUTHER BURBANK SANTA ROSA, CALIFORNIA U.S.A.

This would be my only chance, I felt, to visit the great Catholic mystic, Therese Neumann of Konnersreuth. Years earlier I had read an amazing account of Therese. Information given in the article was as follows: (1) Therese, born in 1898, had been injure d in an accident at the age of twenty; she became blind and paralyzed. (2) She miraculously regained her sight in 1923 through prayers to St. Teresa, \"The Little Flower.\" Later Therese Neuma nn's limbs were instantaneously healed. (3) From 1923 onward, Therese has abstained completely from food and drink, except for the daily swallowing of one small consecrated wafer. (4) The stigmata, or sacred wounds of Christ, appeared in 1926 on Therese's head, breast, hands, and feet. On Friday of every week thereafter, she has passed through the Passion of Christ, suffering in her own body all his historic agonies. (5) Knowing ordinarily only the simple Ge rman of her village, during her Friday trances Therese utters phrases which scholars have identified as ancient Aramaic. At appropriate times in her vision, she speaks Hebrew or Greek. (6) By ecclesiastical permission, Ther ese has several times been under close scientific observation. Dr. Fritz Gerlick, editor of a Protestant German newspaper, went to Konnersreuth to \"expos e the Catholic fraud,\" but ended up by reverently writing her biography. 39-2 As always, whether in East or West, I was eager to meet a saint. I rejoiced as our little party entered, on July 16th, th e quaint village of Konnersreuth.

Dr. Wurz greeted us cordially at his home; \"Yes, Therese is here.\" He sent he r word of the visitors. A messenger soon appeared with her reply. \"Though the bishop has asked me to s ee no one without his permission, I will receive the man of God from India.\" Deeply touched at these words, I followed Dr. Wurz upstairs to the sitting room. Therese entered immediately, radiating an aura of peace and joy. She wore a black gown and spotless white head dress. Although her age was thirty-seven at this time, she seemed much younger, po ssessing indeed a childlike freshness and charm. Healthy, well- formed, rosy-cheek ed, and cheerful, this is the saint that does not eat! Therese greeted me with a very gentle handshaking. We both beamed in silent communion, each knowing the other to be a lover of God."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"Dr. Wurz kindly offered to serve as interp reter. As we seated ourselves, I noticed that Therese was glancing at me with na ive curiosity; evidently Hindus had been rare in Bavaria. \"Don't you eat anything?\" I wanted to hear the answer from her own lips. \"No, except a consecrated rice-flour wafer, once every morning at six o'clock.\" \"How large is the wafer?\" \"It is paper-thin, the size of a small coin.\" She added, \"I take it for sacramental reasons; if it is unconsecrated, I am unable to swallow it.\" \"Certainly you could not have lived on that, for twelve whole years?\" \"I live by God's light.\" How simp le her reply, how Einsteinian! \"I see you realize that energy flows to yo ur body from the ether, sun, and air.\" A swift smile broke over her face. \"I am so happy to know you understand how I live.\" \"Your sacred life is a daily demonstration of the truth uttered by Christ: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.'\" 39-3 Again she showed joy at my explanation. \"I t is indeed so. One of the reasons I am here on earth today is to prove that man can live by God's invisible light, and not by food only.\" \"Can you teach others how to live without food?\" She appeared a trifle shocked. \"I cannot do that; God does not wish it.\" As my gaze fell on her strong, graceful ha nds, Therese showed me a little, square, freshly healed wound on each of her pa lms. On the back of each hand, she"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"pointed out a smaller, crescent-shaped wound, freshly healed. Each wound went straight through the hand. The sight brough t to my mind distinct recollection of the large square iron nails with crescent-t ipped ends, still used in the Orient, but which I do not recall having seen in the West. The saint told me something of her week ly trances. \"As a helpless onlooker, I observe the whole Passion of Christ.\" Each week, from Thursday midnight until Friday afternoon at one o'clock, her woun ds open and bleed; she loses ten pounds of her ordinary 121-pound weight. Sufferi ng intensely in her sympathetic love, Therese yet looks forward joyously to these weekly visions of her Lord. I realized at once that her strange life is intended by God to reassure all Christians of the historical authenticity of Jesus' life and crucifixion as recorded in the New Testament, and to dramatica lly display the ever-living bond between the Galilean Master and his devotees. Professor Wurz related some of hi s experiences with the saint. \"Several of us, including Therese, often travel for days on sight- seeing trips throughout Germany,\" he told me. \"It is a striking contrast-while we have three meals a day, Therese eats nothing. She re mains as fresh as a rose, untouched by the fatigue which the trips cause us. As we grow hungry and hunt for wayside inns, she laughs merrily.\" The professor added some interesting physiological details: \"Because Therese takes no food, her stomach has shru nk. She has no excretions, but her perspiration glands function; her skin is always soft and firm.\" At the time of parting, I expressed to Therese my desire to be present at her trance. \"Yes, please come to Konnersreuth next Frid ay,\" she said graciously. \"The bishop will give you a permit. I am very happy you sought me out in Eichstatt.\""},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"Therese shook hands gently, many times, and walked with our party to the gate. Mr. Wright turned on the automobile radi o; the saint examined it with little enthusiastic chuckles. Such a large crowd of youngsters gathered that Therese retreated into the house. We saw her at a window, where she peered at us, childlike, waving her hand. From a conversation the next day with tw o of Therese's brothers, very kind and amiable, we learned that the saint sleeps only one or two hours at night. In spite of the many wounds in her body, she is ac tive and full of energy. She loves birds, looks after an aquarium of fish, and works often in her garden. Her correspondence is large; Catholic devotees write her for prayers and healing blessings. Many seekers have been cu red through her of serious diseases. Her brother Ferdinand, about twenty-three, explained that Therese has the power, through prayer, of working out on her own body the ailments of others. The saint's abstinence from food dates from a time when she prayed that the throat disease of a young man of her pari sh, then preparing to enter holy orders, be transferred to her own throat. On Thursday afternoon our party drove to the home of the bishop, who looked at my flowing locks with some surprise. He readily wrote out the necessary permit. There was no fee; the rule made by the Ch urch is simply to protect Therese from the onrush of casual touris ts, who in previous years ha d flocked on Fridays by the thousands. We arrived Friday morning about nine-t hirty in Konnersreuth. I noticed that Therese's little cottage possesses a specia l glass-roofed section to afford her plenty of light. We were glad to see th e doors no longer closed, but wide-open in hospitable cheer. There was a line of about twenty visitors, armed with their permits. Many had come from great distances to view the mystic trance."},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"Therese had passed my first test at th e professor's house by her intuitive knowledge that I wanted to see her for spir itual reasons, and not just to satisfy a passing curiosity. My second test was connected with the fact th at, just before I went upstairs to her room, I put myself into a yogic trance state in order to be one with her in telepathic and televisic rapport. I entere d her chamber, filled with visitors; she was lying in a white robe on the bed. Wi th Mr. Wright following closely behi nd me, I halted just insid e the threshold, awestruck at a strange and most frightful spectacle. THERESE NEUMANN Famous Catholic Stigmatist who insp ired my 1935 pilgrimage to Konnersreuth, Bavaria Blood flowed thinly a nd continuously in an inch-wide stream from Therese's lower eyelids.

The white garment was redly"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"splotched over her heart from the wound in her side at the spot where Christ's body, long ages ago, had suffered the final indignity of the soldier's spear-thrust. Therese's hands were extended in a gestur e maternal, pleading; her face wore an expression both tortured and divine. She appeared thinner, changed in many subtle as well as outward ways. Murmurin g words in a foreign tongue, she spoke with slightly quivering lips to pers ons visible before her inner sight. As I was in attunement with her, I began to see the scenes of her vision. She was watching Jesus as he carried the cr oss amidst the jeering multitude. 39-4 Suddenly she lifted her head in consternation: the Lord had fallen under the cruel weight. The vision disappeared. In the exhaustion of fervid pity, Therese sank heavily against her pillow. At this moment I heard a loud thud behind me. Turning my head for a second, I saw two men carrying out a prostrate body . But because I was coming out of the deep superconscious state, I did not immediately recognize the fallen person. Again I fixed my eyes on Therese's face, deathly pale under the rivulets of blood, but now calm, radiating purity and holine ss. I glanced behind me later and saw Mr. Wright standing with his hand ag ainst his cheek, from which blood was trickling. \"Dick,\" I inquired anxiously, \"were you the one who fell?\" \"Yes, I fainted at the terrifying spectacle.\" \"Well,\" I said consolingly, \"you are br ave to return and look upon the sight again.\" Remembering the patiently waiting line of pilgrims, Mr. Wright and I silently bade farewell to Therese and left her sacred presence. 39-5 The following day our little group motore d south, thankful that we were not dependent on trains, but could stop th e Ford wherever we chose throughout the"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"countryside. We enjoyed every minute of a tour through Germany, Holland, France, and the Swiss Alps. In Italy we made a special trip to Assisi to honor the apostle of humility, St. Francis. The Eu ropean tour ended in Greece, where we viewed the Athenian temples, and saw th e prison in which the gentle Socrates 39-6 had drunk his death potion. One is filled with admiration for the artistry with which the Greeks have everywhere wrough t their very fancies in alabaster. We took ship over the sunny Medite rranean, disembarking at Palestine. Wandering day after day over the Holy La nd, I was more than ever convinced of the value of pilgrimage. The spirit of Christ is all- pervasive in Palestine; I walked reverently by his side at Bethlehem, Gethsemane, Calvary, the holy Mount of Olives, and by the River Jordan and the Sea of Galilee. Our little party visited the Birth Manger, Joseph's carpenter shop, the tomb of Lazarus, the house of Martha and Mary, the hall of the Last Supper. Antiquity unfolded; scene by scene, I saw the divine drama that Christ once played for the ages. On to Egypt, with its modern Cairo and ancient pyramids.

The medulla is the principal entrance for the body's supply of universal life force (AUM), and is directly connected with man's power of will, concentrated in the seventh or Christ Consciousness center ( Kutastha ) in the third eye between the eyebrows. Cosmic energy is then stored up in the brain as a reservoir of infinite potentialities, poetically mentioned in the Vedas as the \"thousand-petaled lotus of light.\" The Bible invariably refers to AUM as the \"Holy Ghost\" or invisible life force which divinely upholds all"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"creation. \"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?\"-I Corinthians 6:19. 39-4: During the hours preceding my arrival, Therese had already passed through many visions of the closing days in Christ's life. Her entrancement usually starts with scenes of the events which followed the Last Supper. Her visions end with Jesu s' death on the cross or, occasionally, with his entombment. 39-5: Therese has survived the Nazi persecution, and is still present in Konnersreuth, according to 1945 American news dispatches from Germany. 39-6: A passage in Eusebius relates an interest ing encounter between Socrates and a Hindu sage. The passage runs: \"Aristoxenus, the musician, tell s the following story about the Indians. One of these men met Socrates at Athens, and asked him what was the scope of his philosophy. 'An inquiry into human phenomena,' replied Socrates. At this the Indian burst out laughing. 'How can a man inquire into human phenomena,' he said, 'when he is ignorant of divine ones?'\" The Aristoxenus mentioned was a pupil of Aristotle, and a noted writer on harmonics. His date is 330 B.C. CHAPTER: 40 I Return To India Gratefully I was inhaling the blessed air of India. Our boat Rajputana docked on August 22, 1935 in the huge harbor of Bombay. Even this, my first day off the ship, was a foretaste of the year ahead- twelve months of ceaseless activity. Friends had gathered at the dock with ga rlands and greetings; soon, at our suite in the Taj Mahal Hotel, there was a stre am of reporters and photographers. Bombay was a city new to me; I found it energetically modern, with many innovations from the West. Palms line the spacious boulevards; magnificent state structures vie for interest with ancient temples. Very little time was given to sight-seeing, however; I was impatient, eager to see my beloved guru and other dear ones. Consigning the Ford to a baggage car, our party was soon speeding eastward by train toward Calcutta. 40-1 Our arrival at Howrah Station found such an immense crowd assembled to greet us that for awhile we were unable to dismount from the train. The young"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"Maharaja of Kasimbazar and my br other Bishnu headed the reception committee; I was unprepared for the warm th and magnitude of our welcome. Preceded by a line of automobiles and mo torcycles, and amidst the joyous sound of drums and conch shells, Miss Blet ch, Mr. Wright, and myself, flower- garlanded from head to foot, drove slowly to my father's home. My aged parent embraced me as one returning from the dead; long we gazed on each other, speechless with joy. Brothers and sisters, uncles, aunts, and cousins, students and friends of years long past were grouped around me, not a dry eye among us. Passed now into the archives of memory, the scene of loving reunion vividly endures, unforgettable in my heart. As for my meeting with Sri Yukteswar, word s fail me; let the following description from my secretary suffice. \"Today, filled with the highest anticipati ons, I drove Yoganandaji from Calcutta to Serampore,\" Mr. Wright recorded in his travel diary. \"We passed by quaint shops, one of them the favorite eating haunt of Yoganandaji during his college days, and finally entered a narrow, walled lane. A sudden left turn, and there before us towered the simple but inspiring two-story ashram, its Spanish-style balcony jutting from the upper floor. The pervasive impression was that of peaceful solitude. \"In grave humility I walked behind Yoganandaji into the courtyard within the hermitage walls. Hearts beating fast, we proceeded up some old cement steps, trod, no doubt, by myriads of truth-seeker s. The tension grew keener and keener as on we strode. Before us, near the head of the stairs, quietly appeared the Great One, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, standing in the noble pose of a sage. \"My heart heaved and swelled as I felt myself blessed by the privilege of being in his sublime presence. Tears blurred my eager sight when Yoganandaji dropped to his knees, and with bowed head offered his soul's gratitude and greeting,"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"touching with his hand his guru's feet and then, in humble obeisance, his own head. He rose then and was embraced on both sides of the bosom by Sri Yukteswarji. \"No words passed at the beginning, but the most intense feeling was expressed in the mute phrases of the soul. How their eyes sparkled and were fired with the warmth of renewed soul-union! A tender vibration surged through the quiet patio, and even the sun eluded the clouds to add a sudden blaze of glory. \"On bended knee before the master I gave my own unexpressed love and thanks, touching his feet, calloused by time an d service, and receiving his blessing. I stood then and faced two beautiful deep ey es smouldering with introspection, yet radiant with joy. We ente red his sitting room, whose whole side opened to the outer balcony first seen from the street . The master braced himself against a worn davenport, sitting on a covered mattress on the cement floor. Yoganandaji and I sat near the guru's feet, with oran ge-colored pillows to lean against and ease our positions on the straw mat. \"I tried and tried to penetrate the Bengali conversation between the two Swamijis-for English, I discovered, is null and void when they are together, although Swamiji Maharaj, as the great guru is called by others, can and often does speak it. But I perceived the saintl iness of the Great One through his heart- warming smile and twinkling eyes. One quality easily discernible in his merry, serious conversation is a decided positive ness in statement-the mark of a wise man, who knows he knows, because he kn ows God. His great wisdom, strength of purpose, and determination are apparent in every way. \"Studying him reverently from time to time, I noted that he is of large, athletic stature, hardened by the trials and sacrifices of renunciation. His poise is majestic. A decidedly sloping forehead, as if seeking the heavens, dominates his divine countenance. He has a rather la rge and homely nose, with which he amuses himself in idle moments, flipping and wiggling it with his fingers, like a child. His powerful dark eyes are haloed by an ethereal blue ring. His hair, parted"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"in the middle, begins as silver and change s to streaks of silvery-gold and silvery- black, ending in ringlets at his should ers. His beard and moustache are scant or thinned out, yet seem to enhance his fea tures and, like his character, are deep and light at the same time. \"He has a jovial and rollicking laugh which comes from deep in his chest, causing him to shake and quiver throughout his body-very cheerful and sincere. His face and stature are striking in their power, as are his muscular fingers. He moves with a dignified tread and erect posture. \"He was clad simply in the common dhoti and shirt, both once dyed a strong ocher color, but now a faded orange. \"Glancing about, I observed that this rather dilapidated room suggested the owner's non-attachment to material comfo rts. The weather-stained white walls of the long chamber were streaked with fading blue plaster. At one end of the room hung a picture of Lahiri Mahasaya, garlan ded in simple devotion. There was also an old picture showing Yoganandaji as he had first arrived in Boston, standing with the other delegates to the Congress of Religions. \"I noted a quaint concurrence of modernity and antiquation. A huge, cut-glass, candle-light chandelier was covered wi th cobwebs through disuse, and on the wall was a bright, up-to-date calendar. Th e whole room emanated a fragrance of peace and calmness. Beyond the balcony I could see coconut trees towering over the hermitage in silent protection. \"It is interesting to observe that the mast er has merely to clap his hands together and, before finishing, he is served or attended by some small disciple. Incidentally, I am much attracted to one of them-a thin lad, named Prafulla, 40-2 with long black hair to his shoulders, a most penetrating pair of sparkling black eyes, and a heavenly smile; his eyes twinkl e, as the corners of his mouth rise, like the stars and the crescent moon appearing at twilight."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"\"Swami Sri Yukteswarji's joy is obviously intense at the return of his 'product' (and he seems to be somewhat inquisitive about the 'product's product'). However, predominance of the wisdom-aspect in the Great One's nature hinders his outward expression of feeling. \"Yoganandaji presented him with some gifts , as is the custom when the disciple returns to his guru. We sat down later to a simple but well- cooked meal. All the dishes were vegetable and rice combinat ions. Sri Yukteswarji was pleased at my use of a number of Indian customs, 'finger-eating' for example. \"After several hours of flying Bengali phrases and the exchange of warm smiles and joyful glances, we paid obeisa nce at his feet, bade adieu with a pronam , 40-3 and departed for Calcutta with an everlasting memory of a sacred meeting and greeting. Although I write chiefly of my external impressions of him, yet I was always conscious of the true basis of the saint-his spiritual glory. I felt his power, and shall carry that feeling as my divine blessing.\" From America, Europe, and Palestine I had brought many presents for Sri Yukteswar. He received them smilingly, but without remark. For my own use, I had bought in Germany a combination umbrella-cane. In India I decided to give the cane to Master. \"This gift I appreciate indeed!\" My gu ru's eyes were turned on me with affectionate understanding as he made the unwonted comment. From all the presents, it was the cane that he singled out to display to visitors. \"Master, please permit me to get a new ca rpet for the sitting room.\" I had noticed that Sri Yukteswar's tiger skin was placed over a torn rug. \"Do so if it pleases you.\" My guru's voic e was not enthusiastic. \"Behold, my tiger mat is nice and clean; I am monarch in my own little kingdom. Beyond it is the vast world, interested only in externals.\""},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"As he uttered these words I felt the years roll back; once again I am a young disciple, purified in the da ily fires of chastisement! As soon as I could tear myself away fr om Serampore and Calcutta, I set out, with Mr. Wright, for Ranchi. What a welcome there, a veritable ovation! Tears stood in my eyes as I embraced the selfless teache rs who had kept the banner of the school flying during my fifteen years' absence. The bright faces and happy smiles of the residential and day students were ample testimony to the worth of their many- sided school and yoga training. Yet, alas! the Ranchi institution was in dire financial difficulties. Sir Manindra Chandra Nundy, the old Maharaja whose Kasimbazar Palace had been converted into the central school building, and wh o had made many princely donations was now dead. Many free, benevolent featur es of the school were now seriously endangered for lack of sufficient public support. I had not spent years in America without learning some of its practical wisdom, its undaunted spirit before obstacles. For one week I remained in Ranchi, wrestling with critical problems. Then came interviews in Calcutta with prominent leaders and educators, a long talk with the young Maharaja of Kasimbazar, a financial appeal to my fa ther, and lo! the shaky foundations of Ranchi began to be righted. Many donations including one huge check arrived in the nick of time from my American students. Within a few months after my arrival in In dia, I had the joy of seeing the Ranchi school legally incorporated. My lifelong dream of a permanently endowed yoga educational center stood fulfilled. That vision had guided me in the humble beginnings in 1917 with a group of seven boys. In the decade since 1935, Ranchi has en larged its scope far beyond the boys' school. Widespread humanitarian activi ties are now carried on there in the Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya Mission."},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"The school, or Yogoda Sat-Sanga Brahmacharya Vidyalaya, conducts outdoor classes in grammar and high school subjects. The residential students and day scholars also receive vocational traini ng of some kind. The boys themselves regulate most of their activities thro ugh autonomous committees. Very early in my career as an educator I discovered that boys who impishly delight in outwitting a teacher will cheerfully accept disciplinary rules that are set by their fellow students. Never a model pupil my self, I had a ready sympathy for all boyish pranks and problems. Sports and games are encouraged; the fi elds resound with hockey and football practice. Ranchi students often win the cup at competitive events. The outdoor gymnasium is known far and wide. Muscle recharging through will power is the Yogoda feature: mental direction of life ener gy to any part of the body. The boys are also taught asanas (postures), sword and lathi (stick) play, and jujitsu. The Yogoda Health Exhibitions at the Ranchi Vidyalaya have been attended by thousands. Instruction in primary subjects is given in Hindi to the Kols , Santals , and Mundas , aboriginal tribes of the province . Classes for girls only have been organized in near-by villages. The unique feature at Ranchi is the initiation into Kriya Yoga . The boys daily practice their spiritual exercises, engage in Gita chanting, and are taught by precept and example the virtues of simplici ty, self-sacrifice, honor, and truth. Evil is pointed out to them as being that whic h produces misery; good as those actions which result in true happiness. Evil may be compared to poisoned honey, tempting but laden with death. Overcoming restlessness of body and mi nd by concentration techniques has achieved astonishing results: it is no no velty at Ranchi to see an appealing little figure, aged nine or ten years, sitting for an hour or more in unbroken poise, the unwinking gaze directed to the spiritual eye. Often the picture of these Ranchi"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"students has returned to my mind, as I observed collegians over the world who are hardly able to sit still through one class period. 40-4 Ranchi lies 2000 feet above sea level; the climate is mild and equable. The twenty-five acre site, by a large bathing po nd, includes one of the finest orchards in India-five hundred fruit trees-mango, gu ava, litchi, jackfruit, date. The boys grow their own vegetables, and spin at their charkas . A guest house is hospitably open for Western visitors. The Ranchi library contains numerous magazines, and about a thousand volumes in English and Bengali, donations from the West and the East. There is a collection of the scriptures of the world. A well-classi fied museum displays archeological, geological, and anthropological exhibits ; trophies, to a great extent, of my wanderings over the Lord's varied earth. The charitable hospital and dispensary of the Lahiri Mahasaya Mission, with many outdoor branches in distant villages, have already ministered to 150,000 of India's poor. The Ranchi students are trained in first aid, and have given praiseworthy service to their province at tragic times of flood or famine. In the orchard stands a Shiva temple, with a statue of the blessed master, Lahiri Mahasaya. Daily prayers and scripture clas ses are held in the garden under the mango bowers. Branch high schools, with the residential and yoga features of Ranchi, have been opened and are now flourishing. These are the Yogoda Sat- Sanga Vidyapith (School) for Boys, at Lakshmanpur in Bihar; and the Yogoda Sat-Sanga High School and hermitage at Ejmalichak in Midnapore. A stately Yogoda Math was dedicated in 1939 at Dakshineswar, directly on the Ganges. Only a few miles north of Calcutta , the new hermitage affords a haven of peace for city dwellers. Suitable accommodations are available for Western guests, and particularly for those seekers who are intensely dedicating their lives"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"to spiritual realization. The activities of the Yogoda Math include a fortnightly mailing of Self- Realization Fellowship teac hings to students in various parts of India. It is needless to say that all these educ ational and humanitarian activities have required the self-sacrificing service and de votion of many teachers and workers. I do not list their names here, because they are so numerous; but in my heart each one has a lustrous niche. Inspired by the ideals of Lahiri Mahasaya, these teachers have abandoned promising worl dly goals to serve humbly, to give greatly. Mr. Wright formed many fast friendship s with Ranchi boys; clad in a simple dhoti , he lived for awhile among them . At Ranchi, Calcutta, Serampore, everywhere he went, my secretary, who ha s a vivid gift of description, hauled out his travel diary to record his adventures. One evening I asked him a question. \"Dick, what is your impression of India?\" \"Peace,\" he said thoughtfully. \"The racial aura is peace.\" 40-1: We broke our journey in Central Provinces, halfway across the continent, to see Mahatma Gandhi at Wardha. Those days are described in chapter 44 . 40-2: Prafulla was the lad who had been presen t with Master when a cobra approached (see page 116 ). 40-3: Literally, \"holy name,\" a word of greeting among Hindus, accompanied by palm-folded hands lifted from the heart to the forehead in salutation. A pronam in India takes the place of the Western greeting by handshaking. 40-4: Mental training through certain concentration techniques has produced in each Indian generation men of prodigious memory . Sir T. Vijayaraghavachari, in the Hindustan Times , has described the tests put to the modern profession al \"memory men\" of Madras. \"These men,\" he wrote, \"were unusually learned in Sanskrit literature. Seated in the midst of a large audience, they were equal to the tests that several members of the audience simultaneously put them to. The test would be like this: one person would start ringing a bell, the number of rings having to be counted by the 'memory man.' A second person would dictat e from a paper a long exercise in arithmetic, involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A third would go on reciting from the"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"Ramayana or the Mahabharata a long series of poems, which had to be reproduced; a fourth would set problems in versification which required the co mposition of verses in proper meter on a given subject, each line to end in a specified word, a fifth man would carry on with a sixth a theological disputation, the exact language of which had to be quoted in the precise order in which the disputants conducted it, and a seventh man was all the while turning a wheel, the number of revolutions of which had to be counted. The memory expert had simultaneously to do all these feats purely by mental processes, as he was allowed no paper and pencil. The strain on the faculties must have been terrific. Ordinarily men in unconscious envy are apt to depreciate such efforts by affecting to believe that they involve only the exercise of the lower functionings of the brain. It is not, however, a pure question of memory. The greater factor is the immense concentration of mind.\" CHAPTER: 41 An Idyl In South India \"You are the first Westerner, Dick, ever to enter that shrine. Many others have tried in vain.\" At my words Mr. Wright looked startled, then pleased. We had just left the beautiful Chamundi Temple in the hills overlooking Mysore in southern India. There we had bowed before the gold and silver altars of the Goddess Chamundi, patron deity of the family of the reigning maharaja. \"As a souvenir of the unique honor,\" Mr . Wright said, carefully stowing away a few blessed rose petals, \"I will always pres erve this flower, sprinkled by the priest with rose water.\" My companion and I 41-1 were spending the month of November, 1935, as guests of the State of Mysore. The Maharaja, H.H. Sri Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV, is a model prince with intelligent devotion to his people. A pious Hindu, the Maharaja has empowered a Mohammedan, the able Mirza Ismail, as his Dewan or Premier. Popular representation is given to the seven million inhabitants of Mysore in both an Assembly and a Legislative Council."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"The heir to the Maharaja, H.H. the Yuvaraja, Sir Sri Krishna Narasingharaj Wadiyar, had invited my secretary an d me to visit his enlightened and progressive realm. During the past fo rtnight I had addressed thousands of Mysore citizens and students, at the To wn Hall, the Maharajah's College, the University Medical School; and three mass meetings in Bangalore, at the National High School, the Intermediate College, and the Chetty Town Hall where over three thousand persons had assemb led. Whether the eager listeners had been able to credit the glowing picture I drew of America, I know not; but the applause had always been loudest when I spoke of the mutual benefits that could flow from exchange of the best features in East and West. Mr. Wright and I were now relaxing in th e tropical peace. His travel diary gives the following account of hi s impressions of Mysore: \"Brilliantly green rice fields, varied by ta sseled sugar cane patches, nestle at the protective foot of rocky hills-hills dotting the emerald panorama like excrescences of black stone-and the play of colors is enhanced by the sudden and dramatic disappearance of the sun as it seeks rest behind the solemn hills. \"Many rapturous moments have been spent in gazing, almost absent- mindedly, at the ever-changing canvas of God stretched across the firmament, for His touch alone is able to produce colors that vibrate with the freshness of life. That youth of colors is lost when man tries to im itate with mere pigments, for the Lord resorts to a more simple and effective medium-oils that are neither oils nor pigments, but mere rays of light. He tosse s a splash of light here, and it reflects red; He waves the brush again and it blen ds gradually into orange and gold; then with a piercing thrust He stabs the clouds with a streak of purple that leaves a ringlet or fringe of red oozing out of th e wound in the clouds; and so, on and on, He plays, night and morning alike, ever-changing, ever-new, ever-fresh; no patterns, no duplicates, no colors just the same. The beauty of the Indian change in day to night is beyond compare elsewh ere; often the sky looks as if God had"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"taken all the colors in His kit and given them one mighty kaleidoscopic toss into the heavens. \"I must relate the splendor of a twilight visit to the huge Krishnaraja Sagar Dam, 41-2 constructed twelve miles outside of Mysore. Yoganandaji and I boarded a small bus and, with a small boy as offici al cranker or battery substitute, started off over a smooth dirt road, just as the sun was setting on the horizon and squashing like an overripe tomato. \"Our journey led past the omnipresent square rice fields, through a line of comforting banyan trees, in between a grove of towering coconut palms, with vegetation nearly as thick as in a jung le, and finally, approaching the crest of a hill, we came face-to-face with an immens e artificial lake, reflecting the stars and fringe of palms and other trees, surrounde d by lovely terraced gardens and a row of electric lights on the brink of the dam-and below it our eyes met a dazzling spectacle of colored beams playing on geys erlike fountains, like so many streams of brilliant ink pouring forth-gorgeously blue waterfalls, arresting red cataracts, green and yellow sprays, elephants spouti ng water, a miniature of the Chicago World's Fair, and yet modernly outstanding in this ancient land of paddy fields and simple people, who have given us such a loving we lcome that I fear it will take more than my strength to br ing Yoganandaji back to America. \"Another rare privilege-my first elephant ride. Yesterday the Yuvaraja invited us to his summer palace to enjoy a ride on one of his elephants, an enormous beast. I mounted a ladder provided to climb aloft to the howdah or saddle, which is silk- cushioned and boxlike; and then for a rolling, tossing, swaying, and heaving down into a gully, too much thrilled to wo rry or exclaim, but hanging on for dear life!\" Southern India, rich with historical and archaeological remains, is a land of definite and yet indefinable charm.

Hyderabad history is a long, colorful story, starting three thousand years ag o under the Andhra kings, and continuing under Hindu dynasties until A.D. 1294, when it passed to a line of Moslem rulers who reign to this day. The most breath-taking display of architecture, sculpture, and painting in all India is found at Hyderabad in the ancien t rock- sculptured caves of Ellora and Ajanta. The Kailasa at Ellora, a huge mono lithic temple, possesses carved figures of gods, men, and beasts in the stupendo us proportions of a Michelangelo. Ajanta is the site of five cathedrals and twen ty-five monasteries, all rock excavations maintained by tremendous frescoed pillars on which artists and sculptors have immortalized their genius. Hyderabad City is graced by the Osmani a University and by the imposing Mecca Masjid Mosque, where ten thousand Mo hammedans may assemble for prayer. Mysore State too is a scenic wonderland, three thousand feet above sea level, abounding in dense tropical forests, the home of wild elephants, bison, bears, panthers, and tigers. Its two chief citi es, Bangalore and Mysore, are clean, attractive, with many park s and public gardens. Hindu architecture and sculpture achieved their highest perfection in Mysore under the patronage of Hindu kings from th e eleventh to the fifteenth centuries. The temple at Belur, an eleventh-century masterpiece completed during the reign of King Vishnuvardhana, is unsurpassed in the world for its delicacy of detail and exuberant imagery. The rock pillars found in northern Myso re date from the third century B.C., illuminating the memory of King Asoka. He succeeded to the throne of the Maurya dynasty then prevaili ng; his empire included nearly all of modern India, Afghanistan, and Baluchistan. This i llustrious emperor, considered even by Western historians to have been an incomparable ruler, has left the following wisdom on a rock memorial:"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"This religio us inscription has been engrav ed in order that our sons and grandsons may not thi nk a new c onquest is necessary ; that they may not think conquest by the sword deserves the name of conquest; that they may see in it nothing but destruction and violence; that they may consider nothin g as true conquest save the conquest of religion. Such conquests have value in this world and in the next. My companions and I pose before the \"dream in marbl e,\" the Taj Mahal at Agra. Asoka was a grandson of the formidable Chandragupta Maurya (known to the Greeks as S androcottus), who in his youth had met Alexander the Great. Later Chandragupta destroyed the Macedonian garrisons left in India, defeated the invading Greek army of Seleucus in the Punjab, and then received at his Patna court the Hellenic ambassador Megasthenes. Intensely i nteresting stories hav e been minutely recorded by Greek historians and others who accompanied or followed after Alexander in his expedition to India. The narratives of Arrian, Diodoros , Plutarch, and Strabo the geograp her have been translated by Dr. J. W. M'Crindle 41 -3 to throw a shaft of li ght on ancient Ind ia.

Shortly after the Greek warrior had a rrived in Taxila in northern India, he sent a messenger, Onesikritos, a disciple of the Hellenic school of Diogenes, to fetch an Indian teacher, Dandamis, a great sannyasi of Taxila. \"Hail to thee, O teacher of Brahmins!\" Onesikritos said after seeking out Dandamis in his forest retreat. \"The so n of the mighty God Zeus, being Alexander who is the Sovereign Lord of all men, asks you to go to him, and if you comply, he will reward you with great gifts, but if yo u refuse, he will cut off your head!\" The yogi received this fairly compulsive invitation calmly, and \"did not so much as lift up his head from his couch of leaves.\" \"I also am a son of Zeus, if Alexander be such,\" he commented. \"I want nothing that is Alexander's, for I am content with what I have, while I see that he wanders with his men over sea and land for no ad vantage, and is never coming to an end of his wanderings. \"Go and tell Alexander that God the Supreme King is never the Author of insolent wrong, but is the Creator of light, of peac e, of life, of water, of the body of man and of souls; He receives all men when death sets them free, being in no way subject to evil disease. He alone is th e God of my homage, who abhors slaughter and instigates no wars. \"Alexander is no god, since he must tast e of death,\" continued the sage in quiet scorn. \"How can such as he be the worl d's master, when he has not yet seated himself on a throne of inner universal dominion? Neither as yet has he entered living into Hades, nor does he know the course of the sun through the central regions of the earth, while the nations on its boundaries have not so much as heard his name!\" After this chastisement, surely the most caustic ever sent to assault the ears of the \"Lord of the World,\" the sage added iron ically, \"If Alexander's present dominions"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"be not capacious enough for his desires, let him cross the Gang es River; there he will find a region able to sustain all his men, if the country on this side be too narrow to hold him. 41-4 \"Know this, however, that what Alexande r offers and the gifts he promises are things to me utterly useless; the things I prize and find of real use and worth are these leaves which are my house, these blooming plan ts which supply me with daily food, and the water which is my dr ink; while all other possessions which are amassed with anxious care are wont to prove ruinous to those who gather them, and cause only sorrow and vexation, with which every poor mortal is fully fraught. As for me, I lie upon the forest leaves, and having nothing which requires guarding, close my eyes in tranquil slum ber; whereas had I anything to guard, that would banish sleep. The earth supplies me with everything, even as a mother her child with milk. I go wherever I please, and there are no cares with which I am forced to cumber myself. \"Should Alexander cut off my head, he cannot also destroy my soul. My head alone, then silent, will remain, leaving the body like a torn garment upon the earth, whence also it was taken. I then, becoming Spirit, shall ascend to my God, who enclosed us all in flesh and left us upon earth to prove whether, when here below, we shall live obedient to His ordina nces and who also will require of us all, when we depart hence to His presence, an account of our life, since He is Judge of all proud wrongdoing; for the groans of the oppressed become the punishment of the oppressor. \"Let Alexander then terrify with these th reats those who wish for wealth and who dread death, for against us these weapons are both alike powerless; the Brahmins neither love gold nor fear death. Go th en and tell Alexander this: Dandamis has no need of aught that is yours, and therefore will not go to you, and if you want anything from Dandamis, come you to him.\" With close attention Alexander received through Onesikritos the message from the yogi, and \"felt a stronger desire than ever to see Dandamis who, though old"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"and naked, was the only antagonist in wh om he, the conqueror of many nations, had met more than his match.\" Alexander invited to Taxila a number of Brahmin ascetics noted for their skill in answering philosophical questions with pi thy wisdom. An account of the verbal skirmish is given by Plutarch; Alexande r himself framed all the questions. \"Which be the more numerous, the living or the dead?\" \"The living, for the dead are not.\" \"Which breeds the larger animals, the sea or the land?\" \"The land, for the sea is only a part of land.\" \"Which is the cleverest of beasts?\" \"That one with which man is not yet ac quainted.\" (Man fears the unknown.) \"Which existed first, the day or the night?\" \"The day was first by one day.\" This repl y caused Alexander to betray surprise; the Brahmin added: \"Impossible ques tions require impossible answers.\" \"How best may a man ma ke himself beloved?\" \"A man will be beloved if, possessed with great power, he still does not make himself feared.\" \"How may a man become a god?\" 41-5 \"By doing that which it is impossible for a man to do.\" \"Which is stronger, life or death?\" \"Life, because it bears so many evils.\""},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"Alexander succeeded in taking out of India, as his teacher, a true yogi. This man was Swami Sphines, called \"Kalanos\" by the Greeks because the saint, a devotee of God in the form of Kali, greeted ev eryone by pronouncing Her auspicious name. Kalanos accompanied Alexander to Persia. On a stated day, at Susa in Persia, Kalanos gave up his aged body by enteri ng a funeral pyre in view of the whole Macedonian army. The historians record the astonishment of the soldiers who observed that the yogi had no fear of pain or death, and who never once moved from his position as he was consumed in the flames. Before leaving for his cremation, Kalanos had embraced all hi s close companions, but refrained from bidding farewell to Alexander, to whom the Hindu sage had merely remarked: \"I shall see you shortly in Babylon.\" Alexander left Persia, and died a year late r in Babylon. His Indian guru's words had been his way of saying he would be present with Alex ander in life and death. The Greek historians have left us many vivid and inspiring pictures of Indian society. Hindu law, Arrian tells us, protects the people and \"ordains that no one among them shall, under any circumstan ces, be a slave but that, enjoying freedom themselves, they shall respect the equal right to it which all possess.

The remedies most esteemed are ointments and plasters.

Traveling to South India, Chandragupta spent the last twelve years of his life as a penniless ascetic, seeking self-realization in a rocky cave at Sravanabelagola, now honored as a Myso re shrine. Near-by stands the world's largest statue, carved out of an immens e boulder by the Jains in A.D. 983 to honor the saint Comateswara.

In modern Madras Presidency the nonviolent ideals of Mahatma Gandhi have made great headway; the white distinguishing \"Gandhi caps\" are seen everywhere. In the south generally the Mahatma has effected many important temple reforms for \"untouchables\" as well as caste-system reforms. The origin of the caste system, formulated by the great legislator Manu, was admirable. He saw clearly that men are distinguished by natural evolution into four great classes: those capable of offering service to society through their bodily labor ( Sudras ); those who serve through mentality, skill, agriculture, trade, commerce, business li fe in general ( Vaisyas ); those whose talents are administrative, executive, and protective-rulers and warriors ( Kshatriyas ); those of contemplative nature, spiritually inspired and inspiring ( Brahmins ). \"Neither birth nor sacraments nor study nor ance stry can decide whether a person is twice-born (i.e., a Brahmin );\" the Mahabharata declares, \"character and conduct"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"only can decide.\" 41-9 Manu instructed society to show respect to its members insofar as they possessed wisdom, virtue, ag e, kinship or, lastly, wealth. Riches in Vedic India were always despised if they were hoarded or unavailable for charitable purposes. Ungenerous men of gr eat wealth were assigned a low rank in society. Serious evils arose when the caste system became hardened through the centuries into a hereditary halter. Social reformer s like Gandhi and the members of very numerous societies in India today are maki ng slow but sure progress in restoring the ancient values of caste, based solely on natural qualification and not on birth. Every nation on earth has its own distin ctive misery-producing karma to deal with and remove; India, too, with her versatile and invulnerable spirit, shall prove herself equal to the task of caste-reformation. So entrancing is southern India that Mr. Wright and I yearned to prolong our idyl. But time, in its immemorial rudene ss, dealt us no courteous extensions. I was scheduled soon to address the conclud ing session of the Indian Philosophical Congress at Calcutta University. At the end of the visit to Mysore, I enjoyed a talk with Sir C. V. Raman, president of the In dian Academy of Sciences. This brilliant Hindu physicist was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1930 for his important discovery in the diffusion of light-the \"Raman Effect\" now known to every schoolboy. Waving a reluctant farewell to a crowd of Madras students and friends, Mr. Wright and I set out for the north. On th e way we stopped before a little shrine sacred to the memory of Sadasiva Brahman, 41-10 in whose eighteenth-century life story miracles cluster thickly. A larger Sa dasiva shrine at Nerur, erected by the Raja of Pudukkottai, is a pilgrimage sp ot which has witnesse d numerous divine healings. Many quaint stories of Sadasiva, a lovable and fully-illumined master, are still current among the South Indian villagers. Immersed one day in samadhi on the bank of the Kaveri River, Sadasiva was s een to be carried away by a sudden flood."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"Weeks later he was found buried deep bene ath a mound of earth. As the villagers' shovels struck his body, the saint rose and walked briskly away. Sadasiva never spoke a word or wore a cloth. One morning the nude yogi unceremoniously entered the tent of a Mohammedan chieftain. His ladies screamed in alarm; the warrior dealt a savage sword thrust at Sadasiva, whose arm was severed. The master departed un concernedly. Overcome by remorse, the Mohammedan picked up the arm from the floor and followed Sadasiva. The yogi quietly inserted his arm into the bleedin g stump. When the warrior humbly asked for some spiritual instruction, Sadasiva wrote with his finger on the sands: \"Do not do what you want, and then you may do what you like.\" The Mohammedan was uplifted to an exalted state of mind, and understood the saint's paradoxical advice to be a guide to soul freedom through mastery of the ego. The village children once expressed a desi re in Sadasiva's presence to see the Madura religious festival, 150 miles away . The yogi indicated to the little ones that they should touch his body. Lo! inst antly the whole group was transported to Madura. The children wandered happily among the thousands of pilgrims. In a few hours the yogi brought his small ch arges home by his simple mode of transportation. The astonished parents he ard the vivid tales of the procession of images, and noted that several children were carrying bags of Madura sweets. An incredulous youth derided the saint an d the story. The following morning he approached Sadasiva. \"Master,\" he said scornfully, \"why don't yo u take me to the festival, even as you did yesterday for the other children?\" Sadasiva complied; the boy immediately found himself among the distant city throng.

These four castes render service to humanity by (1) body, (2) mind, (3) will power, (4) Spirit. \"These four stages have their correspondence in the eternal gunas or qualities of nature, tamas , rajas , and sattva : obstruction, activity, and expansion; or , mass, energy, and intelligence. The four natural castes are marked by the gunas as (1) tamas (ignorance), (2) tamas- rajas (mixture of ignorance and activity), (3) rajas-sattva (mixture of right activity and enlightenment), (4) sattva (enlightenment). Thus has nature marked every man with his caste, by the predominance in himself of one, or the mixture of two, of the gunas . Of course every human being has all three gunas in varying proportions. The guru will be able rightly to determine a man's caste or evolutionary status. \"To a certain extent, all races and na tions observe in practice, if not in theory, the features of caste. Where there is great license or so-called liberty, pa rticularly in intermarriage between extremes in the natural castes, the race dwindles away and becomes extinct. The Purana Samhita compares the offspring of such unions to barren hybrids, like the mule which is incapable of propagation of its own species. Artificial species are eventually exterm inated. History offers ab undant proof of numerous great races which no longer have any living repres entatives. The caste system of India is credited by her most profound thinkers with being the check or preventive against license which has preserved the purity of the race and brought it safely through millenniums of vicissitudes, while other races have vanished in oblivion.\" 41-10: His full title was Sri Sadasivendra Saraswat i Swami.

CHAPTER: 42 Last Days With My Guru \"Guruji, I am glad to find you alone this morning.\" I had just arrived at the Serampore hermitage, carrying a fragrant burden of fruit and roses. Sri Yukteswar glanced at me meekly. \"What is your question?\" Master looked about the room as though he were seeking escape."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"\"Guruji, I came to you as a high-school youth; now I am a grown man, even with a gray hair or two. Though you have show ered me with silent affection from the first hour to this, do you realize that once only, on the day of meeting, have you ever said, 'I love you'?\" I looked at him pleadingly. Master lowered his gaze. \"Yogananda, must I bring out into the cold realms of speech the warm sentiments best guarded by the wordless heart?\" \"Guruji, I know you love me, but my mort al ears ache to he ar you say so.\" \"Be it as you wish. During my married life I often yearned for a son, to train in the yogic path. But when you came into my life, I was content; in you I have found my son.\" Two clear teardrops stood in Sr i Yukteswar's eyes. \"Yogananda, I love you always.\" \"Your answer is my passport to heaven.\" I felt a weight lift from my heart, dissolved forever at his words. Often had I wondered at his silence. Realizing that he was unemotional and self-contained, yet sometimes I feared I had been unsuccessful in fully satisfyi ng him. His was a strange nature, never utterly to be known; a nature deep and still, unfathomable to the outer world, whose values he had long transcended. A few days later, when I spoke before a hu ge audience at Albert Hall in Calcutta, Sri Yukteswar consented to sit beside me on the platform, with the Maharaja of Santosh and the Mayor of Calcutta. Though Master made no remark to me, I glanced at him from time to time during my address, and thought I detected a pleased twinkle in his eyes. Then came a talk before the alumni of Serampore College. As I gazed upon my old classmates, and as they gazed on their own \"Mad Monk,\" tears of joy showed unashamedly. My silver-tongued profe ssor of philosophy, Dr. Ghoshal, came forward to greet me, all our past misund erstandings dissolved by the alchemist Time."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"A Winter Solstice Festival was celebrated at the end of December in the Serampore hermitage. As always, Sri Yukte swar's disciples gathered from far and near. Devotional sankirtans , solos in the nectar-sweet voice of Kristo-da, a feast served by young disciples, Master's profoundly moving discourse under the stars in the thronged courtyard of the ashram-m emories, memories! Joyous festivals of years long past! Tonight, however, there was to be a new feature. \"Yogananda, please address the assembla ge-in English.\" Master's eyes were twinkling as he made this doubly unus ual request; was he thinking of the shipboard predicament that had preceded my first lecture in English? I told the story to my audience of brother disciple s, ending with a fervent tribute to our guru. \"His omnipresent guidance was with me not alone on the ocean steamer,\" I concluded, \"but daily throughout my fifteen years in the vast and hospitable land of America.\" After the guests had departed, Sri Yukteswar called me to the same bedroom where-once only, after a festival of my early years-I had been permitted to sleep on his wooden bed. Tonight my guru was sitting there quietly, a semicircle of disciples at his feet. He smiled as I quickly entered the room. \"Yogananda, are you leaving now for Calc utta? Please return here tomorrow. I have certain things to tell you.\" The next afternoon, with a few simple wo rds of blessing, Sri Yukteswar bestowed on me the further monastic title of Paramhansa . 42-1 \"It now formally supersedes your former title of swami ,\" he said as I knelt before him. With a silent chuckle I thought of the struggle which my American students would undergo over the pronunciation of Paramhansaji . 42-2 \"My task on earth is now finished; you mu st carry on.\" Master spoke quietly, his eyes calm and gentle.

You will be able to successfully sail the boat of your life and that of the orga nization to the divine shores.\" In tears, I was embracing his feet; he rose and blessed me endearingly. The following day I summoned from Ranc hi a disciple, Swami Sebananda, and sent him to Puri to assume the hermitage duties. 42-3 Later my guru discussed with me the legal details of settling hi s estate; he was anxious to prevent the possibility of litigation by relatives, after his death, for possession of his two hermitages and other properties, which he wished to be deeded over solely for charitable purposes. \"Arrangements were recently made for Master to visit Kidderpore, 42-4 but he failed to go.\" Amulaya Babu, a brother disciple, made this remark to me one afternoon; I felt a cold wave of premonit ion. To my pressing inquiries, Sri Yukteswar only replied, \"I shall go to Kidderpore no more.\" For a moment, Master trembled like a frightened child. (\"Attachment to bodily residence, spring ing up of its own nature [i.e., arising from immemorial roots, past experiences of death],\" Patanjali wrote, 42-5 \"is present in slight degree even in great sain ts.\" In some of his discourses on death, my guru had been wont to add: \"Just as a long-caged bird hesitates to leave its accustomed home when the door is opened.\") \"Guruji,\" I entreated him with a sob, \"d on't say that! Never utter those words to me!\" Sri Yukteswar's face relaxed in a peaceful smile. Though nearing his eighty-first birthday, he looked well and strong. Basking day by day in the sunshine of my guru's love, unspoken but keenly felt, I banished from my conscious mind th e various hints he had given of his approaching passing."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"\"Sir, the Kumbha Mela is convening this month at Allahabad.\" I showed Master the mela dates in a Bengali almanac. 42-6 \"Do you really want to go?\" Not sensing Sri Yukteswar's reluctance to have me leave him, I went on, \"Once you beheld the blessed sight of Babaji at an Allahabad kumbha . Perhaps this time I shall be fortunate enough to see him.\" \"I do not think you will meet him ther e.\" My guru then fell into silence, not wishing to obstruct my plans. When I set out for Allahabad the followi ng day with a small group, Master blessed me quietly in his usual manner. Apparently I was remaining oblivious to implications in Sri Yukteswar's attitude be cause the Lord wished to spare me the experience of being forced, helplessly, to witness my guru's passing. It has always happened in my life that, at the death of those dearly beloved by me, God has compassionately arranged that I be distant from the scene. 42-7 Our party reached the Kumbha Mela on January 23, 1936. The surging crowd of nearly two million persons wa s an impressive sight, even an overwhelming one. The peculiar genius of the Indian people is the reverence innate in even the lowliest peasant for the worth of the Sp irit, and for the monks and sadhus who have forsaken worldly ties to seek a di viner anchorage. Imposters and hypocrites there are indeed, but India respects all for the sake of the few who illumine the whole land with supernal blessings.

Shaven-headed swamis appeared by the thousands, ocher-robed and carrying their bamboo staff and b egging bow l. Their faces beamed with the renunciate' s peace as they walked about or held philosophical discussions with disciples.

Some wore beards several feet in length, curled and tied in a knot. They meditated quietly, or extended their ha nds in blessing to the passing throng- beggars, maharajas on elephants, women in multicolored saris - their bangles and anklets tinkling, fakirs with thin arms held grotesquely aloft, brahmacharis carrying meditation elbow-props, humble sages whose solemnity hid an inner bliss. High above the din we heard the ceaseless summons of the temple bells. On our second mela day my companions and I entered various ashrams and temporary huts, offering pronams to saintly personages. We received the blessing of the leader of the Giri branch of the Swami Order- a thin, ascetical monk with eyes of smiling fire. Our next visit took us to a hermitage whose guru had observed for the past nine years the vows of silence and a strict fruitarian diet. On the central dais in the ashram hall sat a blind sadhu, Pragla Chakshu, profoundly learned in the shastras and highly revered by all sects. After I had given a brief discourse in Hindi on Vedanta , our group left the peaceful hermitage to greet a near-by swami, Krishnananda, a handsome monk with rosy cheeks and impressive should ers. Reclining near him was a tame lioness. Succumbing to the monk's spir itual charm- not, I am sure, to his powerful physique!-the jungle animal refus es all meat in favor of rice and milk. The swami has taught the tawny- haired beast to utter \" Aum \" in a deep, attractive growl-a cat devotee! Our next encounter, an interview with a learned young sadhu, is well described in Mr. Wright's sparkling travel diary. \"We rode in the Ford across the very low Ganges on a creaking pontoon bridge, crawling snakelike through the crowds an d over narrow, twisting lanes, passing the site on the river bank which Yogana ndaji pointed out to me as the meeting place of Babaji and Sri Yukteswarji.

His face, especially his eyes and perfect teeth, beamed and glistened. Although I was puzzled by the Hindi, his expressions were very revealing; he was full of enthusiasm, love, spiritual glory. No one cou ld be mistaken as to his greatness. \"Imagine the happy life of one unattach ed to the material world; free of the clothing problem; free of food cravin g, never begging, never touching cooked food except on alternate days, never carrying a begging bowl; free of all money entanglements, never handling money, neve r storing things away, always trusting in God; free of transportation worries , never riding in vehicles, but always walking on the banks of the sacred rive rs; never remaining in one place longer than a week in order to avoi d any growth of attachment. \"Such a modest soul! unusually learned in the Vedas , and possessing an M.A. degree and the title of shastri (master of scriptures) from Benares University. A sublime feeling pervaded me as I sat at his feet; it all seemed to be an answer to my desire to see the real, the ancient India, for he is a true representative of this land of spiritual giants.\" I questioned Kara Patri about his wandering life. \"Don't you have any extra clothes for winter?\" \"No, this is enough.\" \"Do you carry any books?\" \"No, I teach from memory those pe ople who wish to hear me.\""},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"\"What else do you do?\" \"I roam by the Ganges.\" At these quiet words, I was overpowered by a yearning for the simplicity of his life. I remembered America, and all the respon sibilities that lay on my shoulders. \"No, Yogananda,\" I thought, sadly for a moment, \"in this life roaming by the Ganges is not for you.\" After the sadhu had told me a few of his spiritual realizations, I shot an abrupt question. \"Are you giving these descriptions fr om scriptural lore, or from inward experience?\" \"Half from book learning,\" he answered with a straightforward smile, \"and half from experience.\" We sat happily awhile in me ditative silence. After we had left his sacred presence, I said to Mr. Wright, \"He is a king sitting on a throne of golden straw.\" We had our dinner that night on the mela grounds under the stars, eating from leaf plates pinned together with sticks. Dishwashings in India are reduced to a minimum! Two more days of the fascinating kumbha ; then northwest along the Jumna banks to Agra. Once again I gazed on the Taj Mahal; in memory Jitendra stood by my side, awed by the dream in marble. Then on to the Brindaban ashram of Swami Keshabananda. My object in seeking out Keshabananda was connected with this book. I had never forgotten Sri Yukteswar's request that I write the life of Lahiri Mahasaya. During my stay in India I was taking every opportunity of contacting direct disciples and relatives of the Yogavatar. Recording their conversations in"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"voluminous notes, I verified facts and dates, and collected photographs, old letters, and documents. My Lahiri Mahasaya portfolio began to swell; I realized with dismay that ahead of me lay arduou s labors in authorship. I prayed that I might be equal to my role as biograph er of the colossal guru. Several of his disciples feared that in a written account their master might be belittled or misinterpreted. \"One can hardly do justice in cold words to the life of a divine incarnation,\" Panchanon Bhattacharya had once remarked to me. Other close disciples were similarly sati sfied to keep the Yogavatar hidden in their hearts as the deathless precepto r. Nevertheless, mindful of Lahiri Mahasaya's prediction about his biograph y, I spared no effort to secure and substantiate the facts of his outward life. Swami Keshabananda greeted our party warmly at Brindaban in his Katayani Peith Ashram, an imposing brick building with massive black pillars, set in a beautiful garden. He ushered us at once into a sitting room adorned with an enlargement of Lahiri Mahasaya's pictur e. The swami was approaching the age of ninety, but his muscular body radiated strength and health. With long hair and a snow-white beard, eyes twinkling with joy, he was a veritable patriarchal embodiment. I informed him that I wanted to mention his name in my book on India's masters. \"Please tell me about your earlier life.\" I smiled entreatingly; great yogis are often uncommunicative. Keshabananda made a gesture of humility . \"There is little of external moment. Practically my whole life has been spent in the Himalayan solitudes, traveling on foot from one quiet cave to another. For a while I maintained a small ashram outside Hardwar, surrounded on all sides by a grove of tall trees. It was a peaceful spot little visited by travelers, owing to the ubiquitous presence of cobras.\""},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"Keshabananda chuckled. \"Later a Ganges flood washed away the hermitage and cobras alike. My disciples then helped me to build this Brindaban ashram.\" One of our party asked the swami how he had protected himself against the Himalayan tigers. 42-9 Keshabananda shook his head. \"In those hi gh spiritual altitudes,\" he said, \"wild beasts seldom molest the yogis. Once in the jungle I encountered a tiger face-to- face. At my sudden ejaculation, the animal was transfixed as though turned to stone.\" Again the swami chuckled at his memories. \"Occasionally I left my seclusio n to visit my guru in Benares. He used to joke with me over my ceaseless travels in the Himalayan wilderness. \"'You have the mark of wanderlust on your foot,' he told me once. 'I am glad that the sacred Himalayas are extensive enough to engross you.' \"Many times,\" Keshabananda went on, \"bot h before and after his passing, Lahiri Mahasaya has appeared bo dily before me. For him no Himalayan height is inaccessible!\" Two hours later he led us to a dining pa tio. I sighed in silent dismay. Another fifteen-course meal! Less than a year of In dian hospitality, and I had gained fifty pounds! Yet it would have been considered the height of rudeness to refuse any of the dishes, carefully prepared for the endless banquets in my honor. In India (nowhere else, alas!) a well-padded sw ami is considered a delightful sight. 42-10 "},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":" Mr. Wright, myself, Miss Bletch -- in Egypt Rabindranath Tagore, inspir ed poet of Bengal, and Nobel Prizeman in literature"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":" Mr. Wright and I pose with the venerable Swami Keshabananda and a disciple at the stately hermit age in Brindaban After dinner, Keshabananda led me to a secluded nook. \"Your arrival is not unexpected,\" he said. \"I have a message for you.\" I was surprised; no on e had known of my plan to visit Keshabananda. \"While roaming last year in the northern Himalayas ne ar Badrinar ayan,\" the swami continued, \"I lost my way. Shelter appeared in a spacious cave, which was empty, though the embers of a fire glowed in a hole in the rocky floor. Wondering about the occupant of this lonely retreat, I sat near the fire, my gaze fixed on the sunlit entrance to the cave. \"'Keshabananda, I am glad you are here.' These words came from behind me. I turned, startled, and was dazzled to behold Babaji! The great guru had materialized himself in a recess of the cave. Overjoyed to see him again after many years, I prostrat ed myself a t his hol y fe et. \"'I called you here,' Babaji went on. 'That is why you lo st your way and were led to my temporary abode in this cave. It is a long time since our last me eting; I am pleased to greet you once more.'"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"\"The deathless master blessed me with some words of sp iritual help, then added: 'I give you a message for Yogananda.

Tell him, then, that I won't see him this time, as he is eagerly hoping; but I shal l see him on some other occasion.'\" I was deeply touched to receive from Kesh abananda's lips this consoling promise from Babaji. A certain hurt in my heart va nished; I grieved no longer that, even as Sri Yukteswar had hinted, Babaji did not appear at the Kumbha Mela. Spending one night as guests of the ashram, our party set out the following afternoon for Calcutta. Riding over a brid ge of the Jumna River, we enjoyed a magnificent view of the skyline of Brindaba n just as the sun set fire to the sky-a veritable furnace of Vulcan in color, re flected below us in the still waters. The Jumna beach is hallowed by memories of the child Sri Krishna. Here he engaged with innocent sweetness in his lilas (plays) with the gopis (maids), exemplifying the supernal love which ev er exists between a divine incarnation and his devotees. The life of Lord Kr ishna has been misunderstood by many Western commentators. Scriptural allegory is baffling to literal minds. A hilarious blunder by a translator will illustrate th is point. The story concerns an inspired medieval saint, the cobbler Ravidas, wh o sang in the simple terms of his own trade of the spiritual glory hidden in all mankind: Under the vast vault of blue Lives the divinity clothed in hide. One turns aside to hide a smile on hearin g the pedestrian interpretation given to Ravidas' poem by a Western writer: \"He afterwards built a hut, set up in it an idol which he made from a hide, and applied himself to its worship.\""},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"Ravidas was a brother disciple of the grea t Kabir. One of Ravidas' exalted chelas was the Rani of Chitor. She invited a la rge number of Brahmins to a feast in honor of her teacher, but they refused to eat with a lowly cobbler. As they sat down in dignified aloofness to eat their own uncontaminated meal, lo! each Brahmin found at his side the form of Ravidas. This mass vision accomplished a widespread spiritual revival in Chitor. In a few days our little group reached Ca lcutta. Eager to see Sri Yukteswar, I was disappointed to hear that he had left Se rampore and was now in Puri, about three hundred miles to the south. \"Come to Puri ashram at once.\" This telegram was sent on March 8th by a brother disciple to Atul Chandra Roy Chowdhry, one of Master's chelas in Calcutta. News of the message reached my ears; anguished at its implications, I dropped to my knees and implored God that my guru's life be spared. As I was about to leave Father's home for the train, a divine voice spoke within. \"Do not go to Puri tonight. Thy prayer cannot he granted.\" \"Lord,\" I said, grief-stricken, \"Thou dost no t wish to engage with me in a 'tug of war' at Puri, where Thou wilt have to de ny my incessant prayers for Master's life. Must he, then, depart for high er duties at Thy behest?\" In obedience to the inward command, I did not leave that night for Puri. The following evening I set out for the train; on the way, at seven o'clock, a black astral cloud suddenly covered the sky. 42-11 Later, while the train roared toward Puri, a vision of Sri Yukteswar appeared before me. He was sitting, very grave of countenance, with a light on each side. \"Is it all over?\" I lifted my arms beseechingly. He nodded, then slowly vanished."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"As I stood on the Puri train platform the following morning, still hoping against hope, an unknown man approached me. \"Have you heard that your Master is go ne?\" He left me without another word; I never discovered who he was nor how he had know n where to find me. Stunned, I swayed against the platform wa ll, realizing that in diverse ways my guru was trying to convey to me the de vastating news. Seething with rebellion, my soul was like a volcano. By the ti me I reached the Puri hermitage I was nearing collapse. The inner voice was tenderly repeating: \"Collect yourself. Be calm.\" I entered the ashram room where Master 's body, unimaginably lifelike, was sitting in the lotus posture-a picture of he alth and loveliness. A short time before his passing, my guru had been slightly i ll with fever, but before the day of his ascension into the Infinite, his body had become completely well. No matter how often I looked at his dear form I could not realize that its life had departed. His skin was smooth and soft; in his face was a beatific expr ession of tranquillity. He had consciously relinquished his body at the hour of mystic summoning. \"The Lion of Bengal is gone!\" I cried in a daze. I conducted the solemn rites on Ma rch 10th. Sri Yukteswar was buried 42-12 with the ancient rituals of the sw amis in the garden of his Puri ashram. His disciples later arrived from far and near to honor their guru at a vernal equinox memorial service. The Amrita Bazar Patrika , leading newspaper of Calcutta, carried his picture and the following report: The death Bhandara ceremony for Srimat Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri Maharaj, aged 81, took place at Puri on March 21. Many disciples came down to Puri for the rites. One of the greatest expounders of the Bhagavad Gita , Swami Maharaj was a great disciple of Yogiraj Sri Shyama Char an Lahiri Mahasaya of Benares.

It was Sri Yukteswarji's prophe tic powers and deep realization that inspired Swami Yogananda to cross the oceans and spread in America the message of the masters of India. His interpretations of the Bhagavad Gita and other scriptures testify to the depth of Sri Yukteswarji's command of the philosophy, both Eastern and Western, and remain as an eye-opener for the unity between Orient and Occident. As he believed in the unity of all religious faiths, Sri Yukteswar Maharaj established Sadhu Sabha (Society of Saints) with the cooper ation of leaders of various sects and faiths, for the inculcation of a scientific spirit in religion. At the time of his demise he nominated Swami Yoganand a his successor as the president of Sadhu Sabha. India is really poorer today by the passing of such a great man. May all fortunate enough to have come near him inculcate in themselves the true spirit of India's culture and sadhana which was personified in him. I returned to Calcutta. Not trusting myse lf as yet to go to the Serampore hermitage with its sacred memories, I su mmoned Prafulla, Sri Yukteswar's little disciple in Serampore, and made arra ngements for him to enter the Ranchi school. \"The morning you left for the Allahabad mela ,\" Prafulla told me, \"Master dropped heavily on the davenport. \"'Yogananda is gone!' he cried. 'Yogananda is gone!' He added cryptically, 'I shall have to tell him some ot her way.'

After a fortnight in May of farewell banquets and speeches at Calcutta, Miss Bletch, Mr. Wright and myse lf left in the Ford for Bombay. On our arrival, the ship authorities asked us to cancel our passage, as no room could be found for the Ford, which we would need again in Europe. \"Never mind,\" I said gloomily to Mr. Wr ight. \"I want to return once more to Puri.\" I silently added, \"Let my tears once again water the grave of my guru.\" 42-1: Literally, param , highest; hansa , swan.

The largest mela is held every twelfth year; the next largest ( Ardha or half) Kumbha occurs every sixth year. Smaller melas convene every third year, attracting about a million devotees. The four sacred mela cities are Allahabad, Hardwar, Nasik, and Ujjain. Early Chinese travelers have left us many striking pictures of Indian society. The Chinese priest, Fa- Hsien, wrote an account of his eleven years in India during the reign of Chandragupta II (early 4th century). The Chinese author relates: \"Throughout the country no one kills any living thing, nor drinks wine. . . . They do not keep pigs or fowl; there are no dealings in cattle, no butchers' shops or distilleries. Rooms with beds and mattresses, food and clothes, are provided for resident and traveling priests without fail, and this is the same in all places. The priests occupy themselves with benevolent ministrations and with chanting liturgies; or they sit in meditation.\" Fa-Hsien tells us the Indian people were happy and honest; capital punishment was unknown. 42-7: I was not present at the deaths of my mo ther, elder brother Ananta , eldest sister Roma, Master, Father, or of several close disciples.

The tiger is an animal of great conscious dignity. He prowls around and challenges man unt il he comes to the flypaper; he then slinks away. No dignified tiger would dare face a human being after squatting down upon a sticky flypaper!\" 42-10: After I returned to America I took off sixty-five pounds. 42-11: Sri Yukteswar passed at this hour-7:00 P.M., March 9, 1936. 42-12: Funeral customs in India require crematio n for householders; swamis and monks of other orders are not cremated, but buried.

The divine figure waved to me, smiling and nodding in greeting. When I could not understand the exact message of Lord Krishna, he departed with a gesture of blessing. Wondrously uplifted, I felt that some spiritual event was presaged. My Western voyage had, for the time bein g, been cancelled. I was scheduled for several public addresses in Bombay before leaving on a return visit to Bengal. Sitting on my bed in the Bombay hotel at three o'clock in the afternoon of June 19, 1936-one week after the vision of Krishna-I was roused from my meditation by a beatific light. Before my open and astonished eyes, the whole room was transformed into a strange world, the sunlight transmuted into supernal splendor.

I could detect the same faint, fragrant, natural odor whic h had been characteristic of his body before. The thrilling touch of his divine fl esh still persists around the inner sides of my arms and in my palms whenev er I recall those glorious hours. \"As prophets are sent on earth to help men work out their physical karma, so I have been directed by God to serve on an astral planet as a savior,\" Sri Yukteswar explained. \"It is called Hiranyaloka or 'Illumined Astral Planet.' There I am aiding advanced beings to rid themselv es of astral karm a and thus attain liberation from astral rebirths.

Treasure beyond all treasure s, my guru who had laughed at death to reach me! \"There are many astral planets, teeming wi th astral beings,\" Master began. \"The inhabitants use astral planes, or masses of light, to travel from one planet to another, faster than electricity and radioactive energies. \"The astral universe, made of various su btle vibrations of light and color, is hundreds of times larger than the materi al cosmos. The entire physical creation hangs like a little solid basket under th e huge luminous balloon of the astral sphere.

The terrestrial blemishes- weeds, bacteria, insects, snakes-are absent. Unlike the variable climates and seasons of the earth, the astral planets maintain the even temperature of an eternal spring, with occasional luminous white snow and rain of many-col ored lights. Astral planets abound in opal lakes and bright seas and rainbow rivers. \"The ordinary astral universe-not the su btler astral heaven of Hiranyaloka-is peopled with millions of astral beings wh o have come, more or less recently, from the earth, and also with myriads of fair ies, mermaids, fishes, animals, goblins, gnomes, demigods and spirits, all resi ding on different astral planets in accordance with karmic qualifications. Various spheric mansions or vibratory regions are provided for good and evil spirits. Good ones can travel freely, but the evil spirits are confined to limited zones. In the same way that human beings live on the surface of the earth, worms inside the soil, fish in water, and birds in air, so astral beings of different grades are assigned to suitable vibratory quarters. \"Among the fallen dark angels expelled fr om other worlds, friction and war take place with lifetronic bombs or mental mantric 43-3 vibratory rays.

Astral beings dematerialize or materialize their fo rms at will. Flowers or fish or animals can metamorphose themselves, for a time, in to astral men. All astral beings are free to assume any form, and can easily commune together. No fixed, definite, natural law hems them round-any astral tree, for example, can be successfully asked to produce an astral mango or other desired fruit, flower, or indeed any other object. Certain karmic restrictions ar e present, but there are no distinctions in the astral world about desirability of various forms. Everything is vibrant with God's creative light. \"No one is born of woman; offspring are ma terialized by astral beings through the help of their cosmic will into specially patterned, astrally condensed forms. The recently physically disembodied being arrives in an astral family through invitation, drawn by similar mental and spiritual tendencies. \"The astral body is not subject to cold or heat or other natural conditions. The anatomy includes an astral brain, or the thousand- petaled lotus of light, and six awakened centers in the sushumna , or astral cerebro-spinal axis. The heart draws cosmic energy as well as light from the astral brain, and pumps it to the astral nerves and body cells, or lifetrons. Astr al beings can affect their bodies by lifetronic force or by mantric vibrations. \"The astral body is an exact counterpart of the last physical form. Astral beings retain the same appearance which they possessed in youth in their previous earthly sojourn; occasionally an astral being chooses, like myself, to retain his old age appearance.\" Master, emanating the very essence of youth, chuckled merrily. \"Unlike the spacial, three-dimensional physical world cognized only by the five senses, the astral spheres are visible to th e all-inclusive sixth sense-intuition,\" Sri"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"Yukteswar went on. \"By sheer intuitional feel ing, all astral beings see, hear, smell, taste, and touch.

They are able to hear through the eyes or tongue, and can taste thro ugh the ears or skin, and so forth. 43-4 \"Man's physical body is exposed to count less dangers, and is easily hurt or maimed; the ethereal astral body may occasi onally be cut or bruised but is healed at once by mere willing.\" \"Gurudeva, are all astral persons beautiful?\" \"Beauty in the astral world is known to be a spiritual quality, and not an outward conformation,\" Sri Yukteswar replied. \"Astral beings therefore attach little importance to facial features. They ha ve the privilege, however, of costuming themselves at will with new, colorful, astrally materialized bodies. Just as worldly men don new array for gala events, so as tral beings find occasions to bedeck themselves in specially designed forms. \"Joyous astral festivities on the higher as tral planets like Hiranyaloka take place when a being is liberated from the astral world through spiritual advancement, and is therefore ready to enter the heaven of the causal world. On such occasions the Invisible Heavenly Father, and the sain ts who are merged in Him, materialize Themselves into bodies of Their own choi ce and join the astral celebration.

Their minds are usually engrossed in the conscious state of highest nirbikalpa bliss. \"Inhabitants in all parts of the astral wo rlds are still subject to mental agonies. The sensitive minds of the higher beings on planets like Hiranyaloka feel keen pain if any mistake is made in conduct or perception of truth. These advanced beings endeavor to attune their every ac t and thought with the perfection of spiritual law. \"Communication among the astral inhabitant s is held entirely by astral telepathy and television; there is none of the confusion and misunderstanding of the written and spoken word which earth-dwe llers must endure. Just as persons on the cinema screen appear to move and ac t through a series of light pictures, and do not actually breathe, so the astral bein gs walk and work as intelligently guided and coordinated images of light, witho ut the necessity of drawing power from oxygen. Man depends upon solids, liquid s, gases, and energy for sustenance; astral beings sustain themselves principally by cosmic light.\" \"Master mine, do astral beings eat anyt hing?\" I was drinking in his marvelous elucidations with the receptivity of all my faculties-mind, heart, soul."},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"Superconscious perceptions of truth are permanently real and changeless, while fleeting sense experiences and impressions are never more than temporarily or relatively true, and soon lose in memory all their vividness. My guru's words were so penetratingly imprinted on the parchm ent of my being that at any time, by transferring my mind to the superconscious state, I can clearly relive the divine experience. \"Luminous raylike vegetables abound in the astral soils,\" he answered. \"The astral beings consume vegetables, and drink a nectar flowing from glorious fountains of light and from astral brooks and rivers. Just as invisible images of persons on the earth can be dug out of th e ether and made visible by a television apparatus, later being dismissed again into space, so the God-created, unseen astral blueprints of vegetables and plants floating in the ether are precipitated on an astral planet by the will of its inhabi tants. In the same way, from the wildest fancy of these beings, whole gardens of fragrant flowers are materialized, returning later to the etheric invisibili ty. Although dwellers on the heavenly planets like Hiranyaloka are almost freed fr om any necessity of eating, still higher is the unconditioned existence of almost completely liberated souls in the causal world, who eat nothing save the manna of bliss. \"The earth-liberated astral being meets a mu ltitude of relatives, fathers, mothers, wives, husbands, and friends, acquired du ring different incarnations on earth, 43- 5 as they appear from time to time in various parts of the astral realms.

Though the outward appearance of loved ones may have changed, more or less according to the development of new qualities in the latest life of any particular soul, the astral being employs his unerring intuition to recognize all those once dear to him in other planes of existence, and to welcome them to their new astral home.

As certain redwood trees outlive most trees by mille nniums, or as some yogis live several hundred years though most me n die before the age of sixty, so some astral beings live much longer than the usual span of astral existence. Visitors to the astral world dwell there for a longer or shorter period in accordance with the weight of their physical karma, which draws them ba ck to earth within a specified time. \"The astral being does not have to conte nd painfully with death at the time of shedding his luminous body. Many of th ese beings nevertheless feel slightly nervous at the thought of dropping their astral form for the subtler causal one. The astral world is free from unwilling de ath, disease, and old age. These three dreads are the curse of earth, where man has allowed his consciousness to identify itself almost wholly with a frail physical body requiring constant aid from air, food, and sleep in order to exist at all. \"Physical death is attended by the disappe arance of breath and the disintegration of fleshly cells. Astral death consists of the dispersement of lifetrons, those manifest units of energy which constitute the life of astral beings. At physical death a being loses his consciousness of flesh and becomes aware of his subtle body in the astral world. Experiencing astral death in due time, a being thus passes from the consciousness of astral birt h and death to that of physical birth and death. These recurrent cycles of as tral and physical encasement are the ineluctable destiny of all unenlightened be ings.

The nineteen components are intellige nce; ego; feeling; mind (sense- consciousness); five instruments of knowledge , the subtle counterparts of the senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch; five instruments of action , the mental correspondence for the executive abilities to procreate, excrete, talk, walk, and exercise manual skill; and five instruments of life force , those empowered to perform the crystallizing, assimilating, el iminating, metabolizing, and circulating functions of the body. This subtle astr al encasement of nineteen elements survives the death of the physical body, which is made of sixteen gross metallic and nonmetallic elements. \"God thought out different ideas within Himself and projected them into dreams. Lady Cosmic Dream thus sprang out decorated in all her colossal endless ornaments of relativity. \"In thirty-five thought categories of th e causal body, God elaborated all the complexities of man's nineteen astral and sixteen physical counterparts. By condensation of vibratory forces, first su btle, then gross, He produced man's astral body and finally his physical form . According to the law of relativity, by which the Prime Simplicity has become the bewildering manifold, the causal cosmos and causal body are different from the astral cosmos and astral body; the physical cosmos and physical body are likewise characteristically at variance with the other forms of creation."},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"\"The fleshly body is made of the fixed, objectified dreams of the Creator. The dualities are ever-present on earth: dise ase and health, pain and pleasure, loss and gain. Human beings find limitation and resistance in three-dimensional matter. When man's desire to live is seve rely shaken by dise ase or other causes, death arrives; the heavy overcoat of th e flesh is temporarily shed. The soul, however, remains encased in the astral and causal bodies. 43-7 The adhesive force by which all three bodies are held toge ther is desire. The power of unfulfilled desires is the root of all man's slavery. \"Physical desires are rooted in egotism and sense pleasures. The compulsion or temptation of sensory experience is more powerful than the desire-force connected with astral attachme nts or causal perceptions. \"Astral desires center around enjoyment in terms of vibration. Astral beings enjoy the ethereal music of the spheres and are en tranced by the sight of all creation as exhaustless expressions of changing light. The astral beings also smell, taste, and touch light. Astral desires are thus conne cted with an astral being's power to precipitate all objects and experiences as forms of light or as condensed thoughts or dreams. \"Causal desires are fulfilled by perception only. The nearly-free beings who are encased only in the causal body see the whole universe as realizations of the dream-ideas of God; they can materialize anything and everything in sheer thought. Causal beings therefore consider the enjoyment of physical sensations or astral delights as gross and suffocating to the soul's fine sensibilities. Causal beings work out their desires by materializing them instantly. 43-8 Those who find themselves covered only by the delicate veil of the causal body can bring universes into manifestation even as the Cr eator. Because all creation is made of the cosmic dream-texture, the soul thin ly clothed in the causal has vast realizations of power."},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"\"A soul, being invisible by nature, can be distinguished only by the presence of its body or bodies. The mere presence of a bo dy signifies that its existence is made possible by unfulfilled desires. 43-9 \"So long as the soul of man is encased in one, two, or three body- containers, sealed tightly with the corks of ignoranc e and desires, he cannot merge with the sea of Spirit. When the gross physical re ceptacle is destroyed by the hammer of death, the other two coverings-astral and causal-still remain to prevent the soul from consciously joining the Omnipresent Life. When desirelessness is attained through wisdom, its power disintegrate s the two remaining vessels. The tiny human soul emerges, free at last; it is one with the Measureless Amplitude.\" I asked my divine guru to shed further light on the high and mysterious causal world. \"The causal world is indescribably subtle,\" he replied. \"In order to understand it, one would have to possess such tremendo us powers of concentration that he could close his eyes and visualize the astr al cosmos and the physical cosmos in all their vastness-the luminous balloon with the solid basket-as existing in ideas only. If by this superhuman concentration one succeeded in converting or resolving the two cosmoses with all their complexities into sheer ideas, he would then reach the causal world and stand on the borderline of fusion between mind and matter. There one perceives all crea ted things- solids, liquids, gases, electricity, energy, all beings, gods, men, animals, plants, bacteria-as forms of consciousness, just as a man can close his eyes and realize that he exists, even though his body is invisible to his physical eyes and is present only as an idea. \"Whatever a human being can do in fancy, a causal being can do in reality. The most colossal imaginative human intelligence is able, in mind only, to range from one extreme of thought to another, to skip mentally from planet to planet, or tumble endlessly down a pit of eternity, or soar rocketlike into the galaxied canopy, or scintillate like a searchlight ov er milky ways and th e starry spaces.

Causal beings see the difference between th eir bodies and thoughts to be merely ideas. As a man, closing his eyes, can vi sualize a dazzling white light or a faint blue haze, so causal beings by thought alon e are able to see, hear, feel, taste, and touch; they create anything, or disso lve it, by the power of cosmic mind. \"Both death and rebirth in the causal worl d are in thought.

Christ had won this final freedom even before he was born as Jesus. In three stages of his past, symbolized in his earth- life as the three days of his experience of death and resurrection, he had attained the power to fully arise in Spirit. \"The undeveloped man must undergo cou ntless earthly and astral and causal incarnations in order to emerge from his three bodies. A master who achieves this final freedom may elect to return to ea rth as a prophet to bring other human beings back to God, or like myself he may choose to reside in the astral cosmos. There a savior assumes some of the burden of the inhabitants' karma 43-11 and thus helps them to terminat e their cycle of reincarnation in the astral cosmos and go on permanently to the causal spheres. Or a freed soul may enter the causal world to aid its beings to shorten their span in the causal body and thus attain the Absolute Freedom.\" \"Resurrected One, I want to know more about the karma which forces souls to return to the three worlds.\" I could listen forever, I thought, to my omniscient Master. Never in his earth-life had I been able at one time to assimilate so much of his wisdom. Now for the first time I was receiving a clear, definite insight into the enigmatic interspaces on the checkerboard of life and death. \"The physical karma or desires of man mu st be completely worked out before his permanent stay in astral worlds becomes possible,\" my guru elucidated in his"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"thrilling voice. \"Two kinds of beings live in the astral spheres. Those who still have earthly karma to dispose of and who must therefore reinhabit a gross physical body in order to pay their karmic debts could be classified, after physical death, as temporary visitors to the as tral world rather than as permanent residents. \"Beings with unredeemed earthly karma are not permitted after astral death to go to the high causal sphere of cosmic idea s, but must shuttle to and fro from the physical and astral worlds only, consciou s successively of their physical body of sixteen gross elements, and of their astral body of nineteen subtle elements. After each loss of his physical body, however, an undeveloped being from the earth remains for the most part in the deep s tupor of the death-sleep and is hardly conscious of the beautiful astral sphere. After the astral rest, such a man returns to the material plane for further lessons, gradually accustoming himself, through repeated journeys, to the worlds of subtle astral texture. \"Normal or long-established residents of the astral universe, on the other hand, are those who, freed forever from all mate rial longings, need return no more to the gross vibrations of earth. Such beings have only astral and causal karma to work out. At astral death these beings pass to the infinitely finer and more delicate causal world. Shedding the though t-form of the causal body at the end of a certain span, determined by cosmic law, these advanced beings then return to Hiranyaloka or a similar high astral planet, reborn in a new astral body to work out their unredeemed astral karma. \"My son, you may now comprehend more fu lly that I am resurrected by divine decree,\" Sri Yukteswar continued, \"as a sa vior of astrally reincarnating souls coming back from the causal sphere, in pa rticular, rather than of those astral beings who are coming up from the earth. Th ose from the earth, if they still retain vestiges of material karma, do not rise to the very high astral planets like Hiranyaloka."},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"\"Just as most people on earth have no t learned through meditation- acquired vision to appreciate the superior joys and advantages of astral life and thus, after death, desire to return to the limited, impe rfect pleasures of earth, so many astral beings, during the normal disintegration of their astral bodies, fail to picture the advanced state of spiritual joy in the caus al world and, dwelling on thoughts of the more gross and gaudy astral happiness, yearn to revisit the astral paradise. Heavy astral karma must be redeemed by such beings before they can achieve after astral death a permanent stay in the causal thought-world, so thinly partitioned from the Creator. \"Only when a being has no further desire s for experiences in the pleasing-to-the- eye astral cosmos, and cannot be tempted to go back there, does he remain in the causal world. Completing there the work of redeeming all causal karma or seeds of past desires, the confined soul thrusts out the last of the three corks of ignorance and, emerging from the final jar of the causal body, commingles with the Eternal. \"Now do you understand?\" Master smiled so enchantingly! \"Yes, through your grace. I am speechless with joy and gratitude.\" Never from song or story had I ever rece ived such inspiring knowledge. Though the Hindu scriptures refer to the causal and astral worlds and to man's three bodies, how remote and meaningless those pages compared with the warm authenticity of my resurrected Master ! For him indeed existed not a single \"undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns\"! \"The interpenetration of man's three bodi es is expressed in many ways through his threefold nature,\" my great guru went on. \"In the wakeful state on earth a human being is conscious more or less of his three vehicles.

Then he sleeps; if he dreams, he remains in his astral body, effortlessly creating any object even as do the astral beings.

You passed my test; your love shone through the clouds of all reprim ands.\" He added tenderly, \"I have also come today to tell you: Never again shall I wear the stern gaze of censure. I shall scold you no more.\" How much I had missed the chastisements of my great guru! Each one had been a guardian angel of protection. \"Dearest Master! Rebuke me a mi llion times-do scold me now!\" \"I shall chide you no more.\" His divine vo ice was grave, yet with an undercurrent of laughter. \"You and I shall smile together, so long as our two forms appear different in the maya -dream of God.

The Hindu scriptures refer not only to the anu , \"atom,\" and to the paramanu , \"beyond the atom,\" finer electronic energies; but also to prana , \"creative lifetronic force.\" Atoms and electrons are blind forces; prana is inherently intelligent.

The villagers are illiterate; they cannot be educated exce pt by example!\" She laughed gaily. I looked in admiration at this highbo rn Englishwoman wh ose true Christian humility enables her to do the scavenge ring work usually performed only by \"untouchables.\" \"I came to India in 1925,\" she told me. \"In this land I feel that I have 'come back home.' Now I would never be willing to return to my old life and old interests.\" We discussed America for awhile. \"I am always pleased and amazed,\" she said, \"to see the deep interest in spiritual su bjects exhibited by the many Americans who visit India.\" 44-4 Mirabai's hands were soon busy at the charka (spinning wheel), omnipresent in all the ashram rooms and, indeed, due to the Mahatma, omnipresent throughout rural India. Gandhi has sound economic and cultural reasons for encouraging the revival of cottage industries, but he does not counsel a fanatical repudiation of all modern progress. Machinery, trains, automobiles, the telegraph have played important parts in his own colossal life! Fifty years of public service, in prison and out, wrestling daily with practical details and harsh realities in the political world, have only increased his balance, open-mindedness, sanity, and humorous appreciation of the quaint human spectacle."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Our trio enjoyed a six o'clock supper as guests of Babasaheb Deshmukh. The 7:00 P.M. prayer hour found us back at the Maganvadi ashram, climbing to the roof where thirty satyagrahis were grouped in a semicirc le around Gandhi. He was squatting on a straw mat, an ancient p ocket watch propped up before him. The fading sun cast a last gleam over the palms and banyans; the hum of night and the crickets had started. The atmosphere was serenity itself; I was enraptured. A solemn chant led by Mr. Desai, with responses from the group; then a Gita reading. The Mahatma motioned to me to give the concluding prayer. Such divine unison of thought and aspiration! A me mory forever: the Wardha roof top meditation under the early stars. Punctually at eight o'clock Gandhi ended hi s silence. The herculean labors of his life require him to apport ion his time minutely. \"Welcome, Swamiji!\" The Mahatma's greetin g this time was not via paper. We had just descended from the roof to hi s writing room, simply furnished with square mats (no chairs), a low desk with books, papers, and a few ordinary pens (not fountain pens); a nondescript clock ticked in a corner. An all-pervasive aura of peace and devotion. Gandhi was bestow ing one of his captivating, cavernous, almost toothless smiles. \"Years ago,\" he explained, \"I started my w eekly observance of a day of silence as a means for gaining time to look after my correspondence. But now those twenty- four hours have become a vita l spiritual need. A periodical decree of silence is not a torture but a blessing.\" I agreed wholeheartedly. 44-5 The Mahatma questioned me about America and Europe; we discussed India and world conditions. \"Mahadev,\" Gandhi said as Mr. De sai entered the room, \"please make arrangements at Town Hall for Swamiji to speak there on yoga tomorrow night.\""},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"As I was bidding the Mahatma good night, he considerately handed me a bottle of citronella oil. \"The Wardha mosquitoes don't know a thing about ahimsa , 44-6 Swamiji!\" he said, laughing. The following morning our little group breakfasted early on a tasty wheat porridge with molasses and milk. At ten- thirty we were called to the ashram porch for lunch with Gandhi and the satyagrahis . Today the menu included brown rice, a new selection of vegetables, and cardamom seeds. Noon found me strolling about the ashram grounds, on to the grazing land of a few imperturbable cows. The protection of cows is a passion with Gandhi. \"The cow to me means the entire sub-human world, extending man's sympathies beyond his own species,\" the Mahatma ha s explained. \"Man through the cow is enjoined to realize his identity with all th at lives. Why the ancient rishis selected the cow for apotheosis is obvious to me. The cow in India was the best comparison; she was the giver of plenty. No t only did she give milk, but she also made agriculture possible. The cow is a poem of pity; one reads pity in the gentle animal. She is the second mother to millions of mankind. Protection of the cow means protection of the whole dumb creation of God. The appeal of the lower order of creation is all the more forceful because it is speechless.\" Three daily rituals are enjoined on the orthodox Hindu. One is Bhuta Yajna , an offering of food to the animal king dom. This ceremony symbolizes man's realization of his obligations to less evolve d forms of creation, instinctively tied to bodily identifications which also corrode hu man life, but lacking in that quality of liberating reason which is peculiar to humanity. Bhuta Yajna thus reinforces man's readiness to succor the weak, as he in turn is comforted by countless solicitudes of higher unseen beings. Man is also under bond for rejuvenating gifts of nature, prodigal in earth, sea, and sky. The evolutionary barrier of"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"incommunicability among nature, animals, man, and astral angels is thus overcome by offices of silent love. The other two daily yajnas are Pitri and Nri. Pitri Yajna is an offering of oblations to ancestors, as a symbol of man's acknowledgment of his debt to the past, essence of whose wisdom illumines humanity today. Nri Yajna is an offering of food to strangers or the poor, symbol of the present responsibilities of man, his duties to contemporaries. In the early afternoon I fulfilled a neighborly Nri Yajna by a visit to Gandhi's ashram for little girls. Mr. Wright accompa nied me on the ten-minute drive. Tiny young flowerlike faces atop the long-stemmed colorful saris ! At the end of a brief talk in Hindi 44-7 which I was giving outdoors, the skies unloosed a sudden downpour. Laughing, Mr. Wright and I climbed aboard the car and sped back to Maganvadi amidst sheets of driving silver. Su ch tropical intensity and splash! Reentering the guest house I was struck anew by the stark simplicity and evidences of self-sacrifice which are everywhere present. The Gandhi vow of non- possession came early in his married life. Renouncing an extensive legal practice which had been yielding him an annu al income of more than $20,000, the Mahatma dispersed all his wealth to the poor. Sri Yukteswar used to poke gentle fun at the commonly inadequate conceptions of renunciation. \"A beggar cannot renounce wealth,\" Mast er would say. \"If a man laments: 'My business has failed; my wife has left me; I will renounce all and enter a monastery,' to what worldly sacrifice is he referring? He did not renounce wealth and love; they renounced him!\" Saints like Gandhi, on the other hand, have made not only tangible material sacrifices, but also the more difficult re nunciation of selfish motive and private goal, merging their inmost being in the stream of humanity as a whole."},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"The Mahatma's remarkable wife, Kasturabai, did not object when he failed to set aside any part of his wealth for the use of herself and their children. Married in early youth, Gandhi and his wife took the vo w of celibacy after the birth of several sons. 44-8 A tranquil heroine in the intense drama that has been their life together, Kasturabai has followed her husband to prison, shared his three-week fasts, and fully borne her share of his endless responsibilities. She has paid Gandhi the following tribute: I thank you for having had the privilege of being your lifelong companion and helpmate. I thank you for the most perfect marriage in the world, based on brahmacharya (self-control) and not on sex. I thank you for having considered me your equal in your life work for Indi a. I thank you for not being one of those husbands who spend their time in gamb ling, racing, women, wine, and song, tiring of their wives and children as th e little boy quickly tires of his childhood toys. How thankful I am that you were not one of those husbands who devote their time to growing rich on the ex ploitation of the labor of others. How thankful I am that you put God and country before bribes, that you had the courage of your convictions and a complete and implicit faith in God. How thankful I am for a husband that put God and his country before me. I am grateful to you for your tolerance of me and my shortcomings of youth, when I grumbled and rebelled against the change you made in our mode of living, from so much to so little. As a young child, I lived in your parents' home; your mother was a great and good woman; she trained me, taught me how to be a brave, courageous wife and how to keep the love and respect of her son, my future husband. As the years passed and you became India's most beloved lead er, I had none of the fears that beset the wife who may be cast aside when her husband has climbed the ladder of success, as so often happens in other count ries. I knew that death would still find us husband and wife."},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"For years Kasturabai performed the duties of treasurer of the public funds which the idolized Mahatma is able to raise by the millions. There are many humorous stories in Indian homes to the effect that husbands are nervous about their wives' wearing any jewelry to a Gandhi meeting; the Mahatma's magical tongue, pleading for the downtrodden, charms the gold bracelets and diamond necklaces right off the arms and necks of the wealthy into the collection basket! One day the public treasurer, Kasturabai, could not account for a disbursement of four rupees. Gandhi duly published an auditing in which he inexorably pointed out his wife's four rupee discrepancy. I had often told this story before classe s of my American students. One evening a woman in the hall had given an outraged gasp. \"Mahatma or no Mahatma,\" she had cried, \"if he were my husband I would have given him a black eye for such an unnecessary public insult!\" After some good-humored banter had passed between us on the subject of American wives and Hindu wi ves, I had gone on to a fuller explanation. \"Mrs. Gandhi considers the Mahatma not as her husband but as her guru, one who has the right to discipline her for ev en insignificant errors,\" I had pointed out. \"Sometime after Kasturabai had been publicly rebuked, Gandhi was sentenced to prison on a political charge. As he was calmly bidding farewell to his wife, she fell at his feet. 'Master,' she said humbly, 'if I have ever offended you, please forgive me.'\" 44-9 At three o'clock that afternoon in Wardha, I betook myself, by previous appointment, to the writing room of the saint who had been able to make an unflinching disciple out of his own wife-r are miracle!

I would rather try inwardly to calm the snake by vibrations of love. I cannot possibly lower my standards to suit my circumstances.\" With his amazing candor, Gandhi added, \"I must confess that I could not carry on this conversation were I faced by a cobra!\" I remarked on several very recent Wester n books on diet whic h lay on his desk. \"Yes, diet is important in the Satyagraha movement-as everywhere else,\" he said with a chuckle. \"Because I advocate complete continence for satyagrahis , I am always trying to find out the best diet for the celibate. One must conquer the palate before he can control the procr eative instinct. Semi-starvation or unbalanced diets are not the answer. After overcoming the inward greed for food, a satyagrahi must continue to follow a rational vegetarian diet with all necessary vitamins, minerals, calories, and so fort h. By inward and outward wisdom in regard to eating, the SATYAGRAHI'S sexual fluid is easily turned into vital energy for the whole body.\" The Mahatma and I compared our knowledg e of good meat-substitutes. \"The avocado is excellent,\" I said. \"There are numerous avocado groves near my center in California.\" Gandhi's face lit with interest. \"I wonder if they would grow in Wardha? The satyagrahis would appreciate a new food.\" \"I will be sure to send some avocado plants from Los Angeles to Wardha.\" 44-10 I added, \"Eggs are a high-protein food; are they forbidden to satyagrahis ?\""},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"\"Not unfertilized eggs.\" The Mahatma la ughed reminiscently. \"For years I would not countenance their use; even now I personally do not eat them. One of my daughters-in-law was once dying of malnutrition; her doctor insisted on eggs. I would not agree, and advised him to give her some egg-substitute. \"'Gandhiji,' the doctor said, 'unfertilized e ggs contain no life sperm; no killing is involved.' \"I then gladly gave permission for my daughter-in-law to eat eggs; she was soon restored to health.\" On the previous night Gandhi had expressed a wish to receive the Kriya Yoga of Lahiri Mahasaya. I was touched by the Mahatma's open- mindedness and spirit of inquiry. He is childlike in his divine quest, revealing that pure receptivity which Jesus praised in children, \". . . of such is the kingdom of heaven.\" The hour for my promised instruction had arrived; several satyagrahis now entered the room-Mr. Desai, Dr. Pingale, and a few others who desired the Kriya technique. I first taught the littl e class the physical Yogoda exercises. The body is visualized as divided into twenty parts; the will directs energy in turn to each section. Soon everyone was vibrating before me like a human motor. It was easy to observe the rippling effect on Gandhi's twenty body parts, at all times completely exposed to view! Though very thin, he is not unpleasi ngly so; the skin of his body is smooth and unwrinkled. Later I initiated the group into the liberating technique of Kriya Yoga . The Mahatma has reverently studied all world religions. The Jain scriptures, the Biblical New Testament, and the s ociological writings of Tolstoy 44-11 are the three main sources of Gandhi's nonviolent convictions. He has stated his credo thus:"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"I believe the Bible, the Koran , and the Zend-Avesta 44-12 to be as divinely inspired as the Vedas . I believe in the institution of Guru s, but in this age millions must go without a Guru, because it is a rare thing to find a combination of perfect purity and perfect learning. But one need not despair of ever knowing the truth of one's religion, because the fundamentals of Hind uism as of every great religion are unchangeable, and easily understood. I believe like every Hindu in God and His oneness, in rebirth and salvation. . . . I can no more describe my feeling for Hi nduism than for my own wife. She moves me as no other woman in the world can. Not that she has no faults; I daresay she has many more than I see myself. But the f eeling of an indissoluble bond is there. Even so I feel for and about Hinduism with all its faults and limitations. Nothing delights me so much as the music of the Gita , or the Ramayana by Tulsidas. When I fancied I was taking my last breath, the Gita was my solace. Hinduism is not an exclusive religion. In it there is room for the worship of all the prophets of the world. 44-13 It is not a missionary religion in the ordinary sense of the term. It has no doubt absorbed many tribes in its fold, but this absorption has been of an evolutionary, imperceptible character. Hinduism tells each man to worship God according to his own faith or dharma , 44-14 and so lives at peace with all religions. Of Christ, Gandhi has written: \"I am sure that if He were living here now among men, He would bless the lives of many who perhaps have never even heard His name . . . just as it is written: 'Not ev ery one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord . . . but he that doeth the will of my Father.' 44-15 In the lesson of His own life, Jesus gave humanity the magnificent purpose an d the single objective toward which we all ought to aspire. I believe that He belo ngs not solely to Christianity, but to the entire world, to all lands and races.\" On my last evening in Wardha I addre ssed the meeting which had been called by Mr. Desai in Town Hall. The room was thronged to the window sills with about 400 people assembled to hear the talk on yoga. I spoke first in Hindi, then in"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"English. Our little group returned to the ashram in time for a good-night glimpse of Gandhi, enfolded in peace and correspondence. Night was still lingering when I rose at 5: 00 A.M. Village life was already stirring; first a bullock cart by the ashram gates, then a peasant with his huge burden balanced precariously on his head. After breakfast our trio sought out Gandhi for farewell pronams . The saint rises at four o'clock for his morning prayer. \"Mahatmaji, good-by!\" I knelt to touch his fe et. \"India is safe in your keeping!\" Years have rolled by since the Wardha idyl; the earth, oceans, and skies have darkened with a world at war. Alone am ong great leaders, Gandhi has offered a practical nonviolent alternative to armed might. To redress grievances and remove injustices, the Mahatma has em ployed nonviolent means which again and again have proved their effectiveness. He states his doctrine in these words: I have found that life persists in the mids t of destruction. Therefore there must be a higher law than that of destruction. Only under that law would well-ordered society be intelligible and life worth living. If that is the law of life we must work it out in daily existence. Wherever there are wars, wherever we are confronted with an opponent, conquer by love. I have found that the certain law of love has an swered in my own life as the law of destruction has never done. In India we have had an ocular demonstration of the operation of this law on the widest scale possible. I don't claim that nonviolence has penetrated the 360,000,000 people in India, but I do claim it has penetrated deeper than any other doctrine in an incredibly short time. It takes a fairly strenuous course of training to attain a mental state of nonviolence. It is a disciplined life, like the life of a soldier. The perfect state is reached only when the mind, body, and speech are in proper coordination. Every"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"problem would lend itself to solution if we determined to make the law of truth and nonviolence the law of life. Just as a scientist will work wonders out of various applications of the laws of nature, a man who applies the laws of lo ve with scientific precision can work greater wonders. Nonviolence is infinitely more wonderful and subtle than forces of nature like, for instance, electricity. The law of love is a far greater science than any modern science. Consulting history, one may reasonably st ate that the problems of mankind have not been solved by the use of brute forc e. World War I produced a world-chilling snowball of war karma that swelled into World War II. Only the warmth of brotherhood can melt the present colossal snowball of war karma which may otherwise grow into World War III. This unholy trinity will banish forever the possibility of World War IV by a finality of atomic bombs. Use of jungle logic instead of human reason in settling disputes will restore the earth to a jungle. If brothers not in life, then brothers in violent death. War and crime never pay. The billions of dollars that went up in the smoke of explosive nothingness would have been s ufficient to have made a new world, one almost free from disease and completely free from poverty. Not an earth of fear, chaos, famine, pestilence, the danse macabre , but one broad land of peace, of prosperity, and of widening knowledge. The nonviolent voice of Gandhi appeals to man's highest conscience. Let nations ally themselves no longer with death, but with life; not with destruction, but with construction; not with the Annihilator, but with the Creator. \"One should forgive, under any injury,\" says the Mahabharata . \"It hath been said that the continuation of species is due to man's being forgiving. Forgiveness is holiness; by forgiveness the universe is held together. Forgiveness is the might of the mighty; forgiveness is sacrifice; forg iveness is quiet of mind. Forgiveness and gentleness are the qualities of the self-po ssessed. They represent eternal virtue.\""},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"Nonviolence is the natural outgrowth of the law of forgiveness and love. \"If loss of life becomes necessary in a righteous battle,\" Gandhi proclaims, \"one should be prepared, like Jesus, to shed his own, not others', blood. Eventually there will be less blood spilt in the world.\" Epics shall someday be written on the Indian satyagrahis who withstood hate with love, violence with nonviolence, wh o allowed themselves to be mercilessly slaughtered rather than retaliate. The resu lt on certain historic occasions was that the armed opponents threw down their gu ns and fled, shamed, shaken to their depths by the sight of men who valued the life of another above their own. \"I would wait, if need be for ages,\" Gand hi says, \"rather than seek the freedom of my country through bloody means.\" Never does the Mahatma forget the majestic warning: \"All they that take the sw ord shall perish with the sword.\" 44-16 Gandhi has written: I call myself a nationalist, but my nationalism is as broad as the universe. It includes in its sweep all the nations of the earth. 44-17 My nationalism includes the well-being of the whole world. I do not wa nt my India to rise on the ashes of other nations. I do not want India to expl oit a single human being. I want India to be strong in order that she can infect th e other nations also with her strength. Not so with a single nation in Europe today; they do not give strength to the others. President Wilson mentioned his beautiful fo urteen points, but said: \"After all, if this endeavor of ours to arrive at peace fails, we have our armaments to fall back upon.\" I want to reverse that position, and I say: \"Our armaments have failed already. Let us now be in search of someth ing new; let us try the force of love and God which is truth.\" When we have go t that, we shall want nothing else. By the Mahatma's training of thousands of true satyagrahis (those who have taken the eleven rigorous vows mentioned in the first part of this chapter), who in turn spread the message; by patiently ed ucating the Indian masses to understand the spiritual and eventually material bene fits of nonviolence; by arming his"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"people with nonviolent weapons- non-coop eration with injustice, the willingness to endure indignities, prison, death itself rather than resort to arms; by enlisting world sympathy through countless examples of heroic martyrdom among satyagrahis , Gandhi has dramatically portrayed the practical nature of nonviolence, its solemn power to settle disputes without war. Gandhi has already won through nonviolent means a greater number of political concessions for his land than have ever been won by any leader of any country except through bullets. Nonviolent methods for eradication of all wrongs and evils have been strikingly a pplied not only in the politica l arena but in the delicate and complicated field of Indian social reform. Gandhi and his followers have removed many longstanding feuds between Hindus and Mohammedans; hundreds of thousands of Moslems look to the Mahatma as their leader. The untouchables have found in him their fearless and triumphant champion. \"If there be a rebirth in store for me,\" Gandhi wrote, \"I wish to be born a pariah in the midst of pariahs, because thereby I would be able to render them more effective service.\" The Mahatma is indeed a \"great soul,\" b ut it was illiterate millions who had the discernment to bestow the title. This ge ntle prophet is honored in his own land. The lowly peasant has been able to rise to Gandhi's high challenge. The Mahatma wholeheartedly believes in the inherent no bility of man. The inevitable failures have never disillusioned him. \"Even if the opponent plays him false twenty times,\" he writes, \"the satyagrahi is ready to trust him the twenty- first time, for an implicit trust in human nature is the very essence of the creed.\" 44-18 \"Mahatmaji, you are an exceptional man. You must not expect the world to act as you do.\" A critic once made this observation. \"It is curious how we delude ourselves, fancying that the body can be improved, but that it is impossible to evoke the hidden powers of the soul,\" Gandhi replied. \"I am engaged in trying to show that if I have any of those powers, I am as frail a mortal as any of us and that I never had anything extraordinary about me nor"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"have I now. I am a simple individual liab le to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have enough humility to confess my errors and to retrace my steps.

If we are to make progre ss, we must not repeat history but make new history. We must add to the inheri tance left by our ancestors. If we may make new discoveries and inventions in the phenomenal world, must we declare our bankruptcy in the spiritual domain? Is it impossible to multiply the exceptions so as to make them the rule ? Must man always be brute first and man after, if at all?\" 44-19 Americans may well remember with pride the successful nonviolent experiment of William Penn in founding his 17th ce ntury colony in Pennsylvania. There were \"no forts, no soldiers, no militia, even no arms.\" Amidst the savage frontier wars and the butcheries that went on between the new settlers and the Red Indians, the Quakers of Pennsylvania alone remained unmolested. \"Others were slain; others were massacred; but they were sa fe. Not a Quaker woman suffered assault; not a Quaker child was slain, not a Quaker man was tortured.\" When the Quakers were finally forced to give up the government of the state, \"war broke out, and some Pennsylvanians were killed. But only three Quakers were killed, three who had so far fallen from their faith as to carry weapons of defence.\" \"Resort to force in the Great War (I) fail ed to bring tranquillity,\" Franklin D. Roosevelt has pointed out. \"Victory and de feat were alike sterile. That lesson the world should have learned.\" \"The more weapons of violence, the more misery to mankind,\" Lao-tzu taught. \"The triumph of violence ends in a festival of mourning.\" \"I am fighting for nothing less than wo rld peace,\" Gandhi has declared. \"If the Indian movement is carried to success on a nonviolent Satyagraha basis, it will give a new meaning to patriotism and, if I ma y say so in all humility, to life itself.\""},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"Before the West dismisses Gandh i's prog ram as one of an impractic al dreamer, let it first reflect on a definition of Satyagraha by the Master of Galilee: \"Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: but I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: 44- 20 but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.\" Gandhi's epoch has e xtended, with the be autiful precision of cosmic timing, in to a century already desolated and devast ated by two World Wars.

Miss Slade, the Mahatma's Satyagraha disciple for twenty years, issued a signed statement to the United Press , dated Dec. 29, 1945, in which she explained that a series of baseless rumors arose after she had departed, with Gandhi's blessings, for a small site in northeastern India near the Himalayas, for the purpose of founding there her now-flourishing Kisan Ashram (center for medical and agricu ltural aid to peasant farmers). Mahatma Gandhi plans to visit the new ashram during 1946. 44-4: Miss Slade reminded me of another distinguished Western woman, Miss Margaret Woodrow Wilson, eldest daughter of America's great president. I met her in New York; she was intensely interested in India. Later she went to Pondicherry, where she spent the last five years of her life, happily pursuing a path of disciplin e at the feet of Sri Aurobindo Ghosh.

He was born into a family of strict Jains, who revere ahimsa as the root-virtue. Jainism, a sect of Hinduism, was founded in the 6th century B.C. by Mahavira, a contemporary of Buddha. Mahavira means \"great hero\"; may he look down the centuries on his heroic son Gandhi! 44-7: Hindi is the lingua franca for the whole of India.

Its subdialect, Urdu, is spoken by Moslems. 44-8: Gandhi has described his life with a devastating candor in The Story Of My Experiments With Truth (Ahmedabad: Navajivan Press, 1927- 29, 2 vol.)

One lays down each of these books with a certain dissatisfaction, as though saying: \"Here is a ma n who knew many notable persons, but who never knew himself.\" This reaction is impossible with Gandhi's autobiography; he exposes his faults and subterfuges with an impersonal devotion to truth rare in annals of any age. 44-9: Kasturabai Gandhi died in imprisonment at Poona on February 22, 1944. The usually unemotional Gandhi wept silently. Shortly after he r admirers had suggested a Memorial Fund in her honor, 125 lacs of rupees (nearly four million dollars ) poured in from all over India.

Babson: \"What line of research will see the greatest development during the next fifty years?\" \"I think the greatest discovery will be made along spir itual lines,\" Steinmetz replied. \"Here is a force which history clearly teaches has been the greatest power in the development of men. Yet we have merely been playing with it and have never seriously studied it as we have the physical forces. Someday people will learn that material things do not bring happiness and are of little use in making men and women creative and powerful. Then the scientists of the world will turn their laboratories over to the study of God and prayer and the spiritual forces which as yet have hardly been scratched. When this day comes, the world will see more advancement in one generation than it has seen in the past four.\" 44-20: That is, resist not evil with evil. ( Matthew 5:38-39) CHAPTER: 45 The Bengali \"Joy-Permeated\" Mother \"Sir, please do not leave India without a glimpse of Nirmala Devi. Her sanctity is intense; she is known far and wide as Ananda Moyi Ma (Joy- Permeated Mother).\" My niece, Amiyo Bose , gazed at me earnestly. \"Of course! I want very much to see the woman saint.\" I added, \"I have read of her advanced state of God-realization. A little article about her appeared years ago in East-West .\" \"I have met her,\" Amiyo we nt on. \"She recently visi ted my own little town of Jamshedpur. At the entreaty of a disciple, Ananda Moyi Ma went to the home of a dying man. She stood by his bedside; as her hand touched his forehead, his death-rattle ceased. The disease vanished at once; to the man's glad astonishment, he was well.\" A few days later I heard that the Blissful Mother was staying at the home of a disciple in the Bhowanipur section of Calcutta. Mr. Wright and I set out"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"immediately from my father's Calcutta home. As the Ford neared the Bhowanipur house, my companion and I observed an unusual street scene. Ananda Moyi Ma was standing in an open-topped automobile, blessing a throng of about one hundred disciples. She was evidently on the point of departure. Mr. Wright parked the Ford some distance away, and accompanied me on foot toward the quiet assemblage. The woman saint glanced in our direction; she alit from her car and walked toward us. \"Father, you have come!\" With these fervent words she put her arm around my neck and her head on my shoulder. Mr. Wright, to whom I had just remarked that I did not know the saint, was hugely enjo ying this extraordinary demonstration of welcome. The eyes of the one hundred chel as were also fixed with some surprise on the affectionate tableau. I had instantly seen that the saint was in a high state of samadhi . Utterly oblivious to her outward garb as a woma n, she knew hersel f as the changeless soul; from that plane she was joyously greeting another devotee of God. She led me by the hand into her automobile. \"Ananda Moyi Ma, I am delaying your journey!\" I protested. \"Father, I am meeting you for the first ti me in this life, after ages!\" she said. \"Please do not leave yet.\" We sat together in the rear seats of the car. The Blissful Mother soon entered the immobile ecstatic state. Her beautiful eyes glanced heavenward and, half-opened, became stilled, gazing into the near-f ar inner Elysium. The disciples chanted gently: \"Victory to Mother Divine!\" I had found many men of God-realization in India, but never before had I met such an exalted woman saint. Her gentle face was burnished with the ineffable joy that had given her the name of Bliss ful Mother. Long black tresses lay loosely behind her unveiled head. A red dot of sandalwood paste on her forehead"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"symbolized the spiritual eye, ever open wi thin her. Tiny face, tiny hands, tiny feet-a contrast to her spiritual magnitude! I put some questions to a near-by woman chela while Ananda Moyi Ma remained entranced. \"The Blissful Mother travels widely in In dia; in many parts she has hundreds of disciples,\" the chela told me. \"Her courageous efforts have brought about many desirable social reforms. Although a Brahmin, the saint recognizes no caste distinctions. 45-1 A group of us always travel with her, looking after her comforts. We have to mother her; she takes no noti ce of her body. If no one gave her food, she would not eat, or make any inquiries. Even when meals are placed before her, she does not touch them. To prevent he r disappearance from this world, we disciples feed her with our own hands. For days together she often stays in the divine trance, scarcely breathing, her eyes unwinking. One of her chief disciples is her husband. Many years ago, soon afte r their marriage, he took the vow of silence.\" The chela pointed to a broad-shouldered, fine-featured man with long hair and hoary beard. He was standing quietly in the midst of the gathering, his hands folded in a disciple's reverential attitude. Refreshed by her dip in the Infinite, Ananda Moyi Ma was now focusing her consciousness on the material world. \"Father, please tell me where you stay.\" Her voice was clear and melodious. \"At present, in Calcutta or Ranchi; but soon I shall be returning to America.\" \"America?\" \"Yes. An Indian woman saint would be sincerely appreciated there by spiritual seekers. Would you like to go?\""},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"\"If Father can take me, I will go.\" This reply caused her near-by disciples to start in alarm. \"Twenty or more of us always travel with the Blissful Mother,\" one of them told me firmly. \"We could not live without he r. Wherever she goes, we must go.\" Reluctantly I abandoned the plan, as possessing an impractical feature of spontaneous enlargement! \"Please come at least to Ranchi, with your disciples,\" I said on taking leave of the saint. \"As a divine child yourself, you wi ll enjoy the little ones in my school.\" \"Whenever Father takes me, I will gladly go.\" A short time later the Ranchi Vidyalaya was in gala array for the saint's promised visit. The youngsters looked forward to an y day of festivity-no lessons, hours of music, and a feast for the climax! \"Victory! Ananda Moyi Ma, ki jai!\" This reiterated chant from scores of enthusiastic little throats greeted the saint' s party as it entered the school gates. Showers of marigolds, tinkle of cymbals, lusty blowing of conch shells and beat of the mridanga drum! The Blissful Mother wand ered smilingly over the sunny Vidyalaya grounds, ever carrying within her the portable paradise. \"It is beautiful here,\" Ananda Moyi Ma sa id graciously as I led her into the main building. She seated herself with a childlike smile by my side. The closest of dear friends, she made one feel, yet an aura of remoteness was ever around her-the paradoxical isolation of Omnipresence. \"Please tell me something of your life.\" \"Father knows all about it; why repeat it?\" She evidently felt that the factual history of one short incarnation was beneath notice."},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"I laughed, gently repeating my question. \"Father, there is little to tell.\" She spread her graceful hands in a deprecatory gesture. \"My consciousness has never associ ated itself with this temporary body. Before I came on this earth, Father, 'I was the same.' As a little girl, 'I was the same.' I grew into womanhood, but still 'I was the same.' When the family in which I had been born made arrangements to have this body married, 'I was the same.' And when, passion-drunk, my husband came to me and murmured endearing words, lightly touching my bo dy, he received a violent shock, as if struck by lightning, for even then 'I was the same.' \"My husband knelt before me, folded hi s hands, and implored my pardon. \"'Mother,' he said, 'because I have desecr ated your bodily temple by touching it with the thought of lust-not knowing that within it dwelt not my wife but the Divine Mother-I take this so lemn vow: I shall be your di sciple, a celibate follower, ever caring for you in silence as a servant, never speaking to anyone again as long as I live. May I thus atone for the sin I have today committed against you, my guru.' \"Even when I quietly accepted this propos al of my husband's, 'I was the same.' And, Father, in front of you now, 'I am the same.' Ever afterward, though the dance of creation change around me in the hall of eternity, 'I shall be the same.'\" Ananda Moyi Ma sank into a deep medita tive state. Her form was statue- still; she had fled to her ever-calling kingdom. The dark pools of her eyes appeared lifeless and glassy. This expression is often present when saints remove their consciousness from the physical body, which is then hardly more than a piece of soulless clay. We sat together for an hour in the ecstatic trance. She returned to this world with a gay little laugh. \"Please, Ananda Moyi Ma,\" I said, \"come with me to the garden. Mr. Wright will take some pictures.\""},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"\"Of course, Father. Your will is my wi ll.\" Her glorious eyes retained the unchanging divine luster as she posed for many photographs. Time for the feast! Ananda Moyi Ma squa tted on her blanket-seat, a disciple at her elbow to feed her. Like an infant, the saint obediently swallowed the food after the chela had brought it to her lips. It was plain that the Blissful Mother did not recognize any difference betw een curries and sweetmeats! As dusk approached, the saint left with he r party amidst a shower of rose petals, her hands raised in blessing on the little lads. Their faces shone with the affection she had effortlessly awakened. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy streng th:\" Christ has proclaimed, \"this is the first commandment.\" 45-2 Casting aside every inferior attachment , Ananda Moyi Ma offers her sole allegiance to the Lord. Not by the hairspli tting distinctions of scholars but by the sure logic of faith, the childlike saint ha s solved the only problem in human life- establishment of unity with God. Man ha s forgotten this stark simplicity, now befogged by a million issues. Refusing a monotheistic love to God, the nations disguise their infidelity by punctilious respect befo re the outward shrines of charity. These humanitarian gestures ar e virtuous, because for a moment they divert man's attention from himself, b ut they do not free him from his single responsibility in life, referred to by Jesus as the first commandment. The uplifting obligation to love God is assumed with man's first breath of an air freely bestowed by his only Benefactor. On one other occasion after her Ranchi visit I had opportunity to see Ananda Moyi Ma. She stood among her disciples some months later on the Serampore station platform, waiting for the train."},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"\"Father, I am going to the Himalayas,\" she told me. \"Generous disciples have built me a hermitage in Dehra Dun.\" As she boarded the train, I marveled to see that whether amidst a crowd, on a train, feasting, or sitting in silence, her eyes never looked away from God. Within me I still hear her voice, an echo of measureless sweetness: \"Behold, now and always one with the Eternal, 'I am ever the same.'\" 45-1: I find some further facts of Ananda Moyi Ma's life, printed in East-West . The saint was born in 1893 at Dacca in central Bengal. Illiterate, she has yet stunned the intellectuals by her wisdom. Her verses in Sanskrit have filled scholars with wonderment. She has brought consolation to bereaved persons, and effected miraculous cures, by her mere presence. 45-2: Mark 12:30. CHAPTER: 46 The Woman Yogi Who Never Eats \"Sir, whither are we bound this morning? \" Mr. Wright was driving the Ford; he took his eyes off the road long enough to gaze at me with a questioning twinkle. From day to day he seldom knew what pa rt of Bengal he would be discovering next. \"God willing,\" I replied devoutly, \"we are on our way to see an eighth wonder of the world-a woman saint whose diet is thin air!\" \"Repetition of wonders-after Therese Neumann.\" But Mr. Wright laughed eagerly just the same; he even accelerated the speed of the car. More extraordinary grist for his travel diary! Not one of an average tourist, that! The Ranchi school had just been left be hind us; we had risen before the sun. Besides my secretary and myself, three Be ngali friends were in the party. We drank in the exhilarating air, the natural wine of the morning. Our driver guided"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"the car warily among the early peasants and the two-wheeled carts, slowly drawn by yoked, hump-shouldered bullocks, inclin ed to dispute the road with a honking interloper. \"Sir, we would like to know more of the fasting saint.\" \"Her name is Giri Bala,\" I informed my companions. \"I first heard about her years ago from a scholarly gentleman, St hiti Lal Nundy. He often came to the Gurpar Road home to tutor my brother Bishnu.\" \"'I know Giri Bala well,' Sthiti Babu told me. 'She employs a certain yoga technique which enables her to live with out eating. I was her close neighbor in Nawabganj near Ichapur. 46-1 I made it a point to watch her closely; never did I find evidence that she was taking eith er food or drink. My interest finally mounted so high that I approached the Maharaja of Burdwan 46-2 and asked him to conduct an investigation. Astounded at the story, he invited her to his palace. She agreed to a test and lived for two mont hs locked up in a small section of his home. Later she returned for a palace visit of twenty days; and then for a third test of fifteen days. The Maharaja himself told me that these three rigorous scrutinies had convinced him beyond doubt of her non-eating state.' \"This story of Sthiti Babu's has remained in my mind for over twenty- five years,\" I concluded. \"Sometimes in America I wond ered if the river of time would not swallow the yogini 46-3 before I could meet her. She must be quite aged now. I do not even know where, or if, she lives. B ut in a few hours we shall reach Purulia; her brother has a home there.\" By ten-thirty our little group was convers ing with the brother, Lambadar Dey, a lawyer of Purulia. \"Yes, my sister is living. She sometimes st ays with me here, but at present she is at our family home in Biur.\" Lambadar Babu glanced doubtfully at the Ford. \"I hardly think, Swamiji, that any automobile has ever penetrated into the interior"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"as far as Biur. It might be best if you all resign yourselve s to the anc ient jolt of the bullock cart!\" As one voice our party pledged loya lty to the Pride of Detroit. \"The Ford comes from America, \" I told the lawyer. \"It would be a shame to deprive it o f an opportunity to get ac quainted with the heart of Bengal!\" \"May Gane sh 46 -4 go with you!\" L ambadar Babu said, laughing. He added courteously, \"If you ever get there, I am sur e Giri Bala will be glad to see you. She is approaching her seventies, but continues in excellent health.\" \"Please tell me, sir, if it is absolutely true that she eats no thin g?\" I looked direct ly into his eyes, those telltale windows of the mind. GIRI BALA This great woman yogi has not taken food or drink since 1880. I am pictured with her, in 1936, at her home in the isolat ed Bengal village of Biur. Her non-eating state has been rigorously in vestigated by the Maharaja of Burdwan . She employs"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"a certain yoga technique to recharge her body with cosmic energy from the ether, sun, and air. \"It is true.\" His gaze was open and honora ble. \"In more than five decades I have never seen her eat a morsel. If the world suddenly came to an end, I could not be more astonished than by the sight of my sister's taking food!\" We chuckled together over the improb ability of these two cosmic events. \"Giri Bala has never sought an inacce ssible solitude for her yoga practices,\" Lambadar Babu went on. \"She has lived he r entire life surrounded by her family and friends. They are all well accustomed now to her strange state. Not one of them who would not be stupefied if Giri Bala suddenly decided to eat anything! Sister is naturally retiring, as befits a Hi ndu widow, but our little circle in Purulia and in Biur all know that she is literally an 'exceptional' woman.\" The brother's sincerity was manifest. Our little party thanked him warmly and set out toward Biur. We stopped at a street shop for curry and luchis , attracting a swarm of urchins who gathered round to watch Mr. Wright eating with his fingers in the simple Hindu manner. 46-5 Hearty appetites caused us to fortify ourselves against an afternoon which, unknown at the moment, was to prove fairly laborious. Our way now led east through sun-baked rice fields into the Burdwan section of Bengal. On through roads lined with dense vegetation; the songs of the maynas and the stripe-throated bulbuls streamed out from trees with huge, umbrellalike branches. A bullock cart now and then, the rini, rini, manju, manju squeak of its axle and iron-shod wooden wheels contrasting sharply in mind with the swish, swish of auto tires over the aristocratic asphalt of the cities. \"Dick, halt!\" My sudden request brought a jolting protest from the Ford. \"That overburdened mango tree is fairly shouting an invitation!\""},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"The five of us dashed like children to the mango-strewn earth; the tree had benevolently shed its fruits as they had ripened. \"Full many a mango is born to lie un seen,\" I paraphrased, \"and waste its sweetness on the stony ground.\" \"Nothing like this in America, Swamiji, eh?\" laughed Sailesh Mazumdar, one of my Bengali students. \"No,\" I admitted, covered with mango juice and contentment. \"How I have missed this fruit in the West! A Hi ndu's heaven without mangoes is inconceivable!\" I picked up a rock and downed a proud beauty hidden on the highest limb. \"Dick,\" I asked between bites of ambrosia, wa rm with the tropical sun, \"are all the cameras in the car?\" \"Yes, sir; in the baggage compartment.\" \"If Giri Bala proves to be a true saint, I want to write about her in the West. A Hindu yogini with such inspiring powers should not live and die unknown-like most of these mangoes.\" Half an hour later I was still strolling in the sylvan peace. \"Sir,\" Mr. Wright remarked, \"we should re ach Giri Bala before the sun sets, to have enough light for photographs.\" He ad ded with a grin, \"The Westerners are a skeptical lot; we can't expect them to believe in the lady without any pictures!\" This bit of wisdom was indisputable; I turned my back on temptation and reentered the car. \"You are right, Dick,\" I sighed as we sp ed along, \"I sacrifice the mango paradise on the altar of Western realism. Photographs we must have!\""},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"The road became more and more sickly: wrinkles of ruts, boils of hardened clay, the sad infirmities of old age! Our group dismounted occasionally to allow Mr. Wright to more easily maneuver the For d, which the four of us pushed from behind. \"Lambadar Babu spoke truly,\" Sailesh ackn owledged. \"The car is not carrying us; we are carrying the car!\" Our climb-in, climb-out auto tedium was beguiled ever and anon by the appearance of a village, each one a scene of quaint simplicity. \"Our way twisted and turned through grov es of palms among ancient, unspoiled villages nestling in the forest shade,\" Mr. Wright has recorded in his travel diary, under date of May 5, 1936. \"Very fascinat ing are these clusters of thatched mud huts, decorated with one of the names of God on the door; many small, naked children innocently playing about, pausing to stare or run wildly from this big, black, bullockless carriage tearing ma dly through their village. The women merely peep from the shad ows, while the men lazily loll beneath the trees along the roadside, curious beneath their noncha lance. In one place, all the villagers were gaily bathing in the large tank (in their garments, changing by draping dry cloths around their bodies, dropping the wet ones). Women bearing water to their homes, in huge brass jars. \"The road led us a merry chase over mo unt and ridge; we bounced and tossed, dipped into small streams, detoured arou nd an unfinished causeway, slithered across dry, sandy river beds and finally, about 5:00 P.M., we were close to our destination, Biur. This minute village in the interior of Bankura District, hidden in the protection of dense foliage, is un approachable by travelers during the rainy season, when the streams are raging torrents and the roads serpentlike spit the mud-venom."},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"\"Asking for a guide among a group of worshipers on their way home from a temple prayer (out in the lonely field), we were besieged by a dozen scantily clad lads who clambered on the sides of the ca r, eager to conduct us to Giri Bala. \"The road led toward a grove of date pa lms sheltering a group of mud huts, but before we had reached it, the Ford was mo mentarily tipped at a dangerous angle, tossed up and dropped down. The narrow trail led around trees and tank, over ridges, into holes and deep ruts. The car became anchored on a clump of bushes, then grounded on a hillock, requiring a lift of earth clods; on we proceeded, slowly and carefully; suddenly the way wa s stopped by a mass of brush in the middle of the cart track, necessitating a detour down a precipitous ledge into a dry tank, rescue from which demanded some scraping, adzing, and shoveling. Again and again the road seemed impassa ble, but the pilgrimage must go on; obliging lads fetched spades and demoli shed the obstacles (shades of Ganesh!) while hundreds of children and parents stared. \"Soon we were threading our way along th e two ruts of antiquity, women gazing wide-eyed from their hut doors, men trai ling alongside and behind us, children scampering to swell the procession. Ours was perhaps the first auto to traverse these roads; the 'bullock cart union' must be omnipotent here! What a sensation we created-a group piloted by an American and pioneering in a snorting car right into their hamlet fastness, invading the ancient privacy and sanctity! \"Halting by a narrow lane we found ourselve s within a hundred feet of Giri Bala's ancestral home. We felt the thrill of fulfillment after the long road struggle crowned by a rough finish. We approached a large, two-storied building of brick and plaster, dominating the surroundin g adobe huts; the house was under the process of repair, for around it was the characteristically tropical framework of bamboos. \"With feverish anticipation and suppresse d rejoicing we stood before the open doors of the one blessed by the Lord's 'h ungerless' touch. Constantly agape were the villagers, young and old, bare an d dressed, women aloof somewhat but"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"inquisitive too, men and boys unabashedl y at our heels as they gazed on this unprecedented spectacle. \"Soon a short figure came into view in the doorway-Giri Bala! She was swathed in a cloth of dull, goldish silk; in typica lly Indian fashion, she drew forward modestly and hesitatingly, peering slight ly from beneath the upper fold of her swadeshi cloth. Her eyes glistened like smou ldering embers in the shadow of her head piece; we were enamored by a most benevolent and kindly face, a face of realization and understanding, free from the taint of earthly attachment. \"Meekly she approached and silently as sented to our snapping a number of pictures with our 'still' and 'movie' cameras. 46-6 Patiently and shyly she endured our photo techniques of posture adjustment and light arrangement. Finally we had recorded for posterity many photogra phs of the only woman in the world who is known to have lived without food or drink for over fifty years. (Therese Neumann, of course, has fasted since 19 23.) Most motherly was Giri Bala's expression as she stood before us, complet ely covered in the loose-flowing cloth, nothing of her body visible but her face with its downcast eyes, her hands, and her tiny feet. A face of rare peace and i nnocent poise-a wide, childlike, quivering lip, a feminine nose, narrow, spar kling eyes, and a wistful smile.\" Mr. Wright's impression of Giri Bala was shared by myself; spirituality enfolded her like her gently shining veil. She pronamed before me in the customary gesture of greeting from a householder to a monk. Her simple charm and quiet smile gave us a welcome beyond that of honeyed oratory; forgotten was our difficult, dusty trip. The little saint seated herself cross-legge d on the verandah. Though bearing the scars of age, she was not emaciated; her olive-colored skin had remained clear and healthy in tone. \"Mother,\" I said in Bengali, \"for over tw enty-five years I have thought eagerly of this very pilgrimage! I heard about your sa cred life from Sthiti Lal Nundy Babu.\""},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"She nodded in acknowledgment. \"Yes, my good neighbor in Nawabganj.\" \"During those years I have crossed the oceans, but I never forgot my early plan to someday see you. The sublime drama that you are here playing so inconspicuously should be blazoned befo re a world that has long forgotten the inner food divine.\" The saint lifted her eyes for a minute, smiling with serene interest. \"Baba (honored father) knows best,\" she answered meekly. I was happy that she had taken no offens e; one never knows how great yogis or yoginis will react to the thought of public ity. They shun it, as a rule, wishing to pursue in silence the profound soul rese arch. An inner sanction comes to them when the proper time arrives to displa y their lives openly for the benefit of seeking minds. \"Mother,\" I went on, \"please forgive me, then, for burdening you with many questions. Kindly answer only those that please you; I shall understand your silence, also.\" She spread her hands in a gracious gesture. \"I am glad to reply, insofar as an insignificant person like myself can give satisfactory answers.\" \"Oh, no, not insignificant!\" I protested sincerely. \"You are a great soul.\" \"I am the humble servant of all.\" She a dded quaintly, \"I love to cook and feed people.\" A strange pastime, I thought, for a non-eating saint! \"Tell me, Mother, from your own li ps-do you live without food?\" \"That is true.\" She was silent for a few moments; her next remark showed that she had been struggling with mental arit hmetic. \"From the age of twelve years"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"four months down to my present age of sixty-eight- a period of over fifty-six years-I have not eaten food or taken liquids.\" \"Are you never tempted to eat?\" \"If I felt a craving for food, I would have to eat.\" Simply yet regally she stated this axiomatic truth, one known too well by a world revolving around three meals a day! \"But you do eat something!\" My tone held a note of remonstrance. \"Of course!\" She smiled in swift understanding. \"Your nourishment derives from the finer energies of the air and sunlight, 46-7 and from the cosmic power which rechar ges your body through the medulla oblongata.\" \"Baba knows.\" Again she acquiesced, her manner soothing and unemphatic. \"Mother, please tell me about your early li fe. It holds a deep interest for all of India, and even for our brothers and sisters beyond the seas.\" Giri Bala put aside her habitual reserve, relaxing into a conversational mood. \"So be it.\" Her voice was low and firm. \"I was born in these forest regions. My childhood was unremarkable save that I wa s possessed by an insatiable appetite. I had been betrothed in early years. \"'Child,' my mother often warned me, 'try to control your greed. When the time comes for you to live among strangers in your husband's family, what will they think of you if your days are spent in nothing but eating?' \"The calamity she had foreseen came to pa ss. I was only twelve when I joined my husband's people in Nawabganj. My moth er-in-law shamed me morning, noon, and night about my gluttonous habits. Her scoldings were a blessing in disguise,"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"however; they roused my dormant spiri tual tendencies. One morning her ridicule was merciless. \"'I shall soon prove to you,' I said, stun g to the quick, 'that I shall never touch food again as long as I live.' \"My mother-in-law laughed in derision. 'S o!' she said, 'how can you live without eating, when you cannot live without overeating?' \"This remark was unanswerable! Yet an iron resolution scaffolded my spirit. In a secluded spot I sought my Heavenly Father. \"'Lord,' I prayed incessantly, 'please send me a guru, one who can teach me to live by Thy light and not by food.' \"A divine ecstasy fell over me. Led by a beatific spell, I set out for the Nawabganj ghat on the Ganges. On the way I encountered the priest of my husband's family. \"'Venerable sir,' I said trustingly, 'kindl y tell me how to live without eating.' \"He stared at me without reply. Finally he spoke in a consoling manner. 'Child,' he said, 'come to the temple this evening; I will conduct a special Vedic ceremony for you.' \"This vague answer was not the one I was seeking; I continued toward the ghat . The morning sun pierced the waters; I puri fied myself in the Ganges, as though for a sacred initiation. As I left the rive r bank, my wet cloth around me, in the broad glare of day my master ma terialized himself before me! \"'Dear little one,' he said in a voice of lo ving compassion, 'I am the guru sent here by God to fulfill your urgent prayer. He was deeply touched by its very unusual nature! From today you shall live by the astral light, your bodily atoms fed from the infinite current.'\""},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"Giri Bala fell into silence. I took Mr. Wr ight's pencil and pad and translated into English a few items for his information. The saint resumed the tale, her gentle voice barely audible. \"The ghat was deserted, but my guru cast round us an aura of guarding light, that no stray bathers later disturb us. He initiated me into a kria technique which frees the body from dependence on the gross food of mortals. The technique includes the use of a certain mantra 46-8 and a breathing exercise more difficult than the average person could perform. No medicine or magic is involved; nothing beyond the kria .\" In the manner of the American newspape r reporter, who had unknowingly taught me his procedure, I questioned Giri Bala on many matters which I thought would be of interest to the world. She gave me , bit by bit, the following information: \"I have never had any children; many ye ars ago I became a widow. I sleep very little, as sleep and waking are the same to me. I meditate at night, attending to my domestic duties in the daytime. I sl ightly feel the change in climate from season to season. I have never been sick or experienced any disease. I feel only slight pain when accidentally injured. I have no bodily excretions. I can control my heart and breathing. I often see my guru as well as other great souls, in vision.\" \"Mother,\" I asked, \"why don't you teach others the method of living without food?\" My ambitious hopes for the world's starvi ng millions were nipped in the bud. \"No.\" She shook her head. \"I was strictly commanded by my guru not to divulge the secret. It is not his wish to tamper with God's drama of creation. The farmers would not thank me if I taught many peop le to live without eating! The luscious fruits would lie uselessly on the ground. It appears that misery, starvation, and"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"disease are whips of our karma which ul timately drive us to seek the true meaning of life.\" \"Mother,\" I said slowly, \"what is the use of your having been singled out to live without eating?\" \"To prove that man is Spirit.\" Her face lit with wisdom. \"To demonstrate that by divine advancement he can gradually learn to live by the Eternal Light and not by food.\" The saint sank into a deep meditative state. Her gaze was directed inward; the gentle depths of her eyes became expr essionless. She gave a certain sigh, the prelude to the ecstatic breathless trance. For a time she had fled to the questionless realm, the heaven of inner joy. The tropical darkness had fallen. The ligh t of a small kerosene lamp flickered fitfully over the faces of a score of villagers squatting silently in the shadows. The darting glowworms and distant oil lanterns of the huts wove bright eerie patterns into the velvet night. It was the painful hour of parting; a slow, tedious journey lay before our little party. \"Giri Bala,\" I said as the saint opened her eyes, \"please give me a keepsake-a strip of one of your saris .\" She soon returned with a piece of Benares silk, extending it in her hand as she suddenly prostrated herself on the ground. \"Mother,\" I said reverently, \"rather le t me touch your own blessed feet!\" 46-1: In northern Bengal. 46-2: H.

Crile of Cleveland told a gathering of medical men on May 17, 1933 in Memphis. \"This all-important radiation, which releases electrical currents for the body's electrical circuit, the nervous system, is given to food by the sun's rays. Atoms, Dr. Cril e says, are solar systems. Atoms are the vehicles that are filled with solar radiance as so many coiled springs. These countless atomfuls of energy are taken in as food. Once in the human body, these tense vehicles, the atoms, are discharged in the body's protoplasm, the radiance fu rnishing new chemical energy, new electrical currents. 'Your body is made up of such atoms,' Dr. Crile said. 'They are your muscles, brains, and sensory organs, such as the eyes and ears.'\" Someday scientists will discover how man can live directly on solar energy. \"Chlorophyll is the only substance known in nature that somehow possesses the power to act as a 'sunlight trap,'\" William L. Laurence writes in the New York Times . \"It 'catches' the energy of sunlight and stores it in the plant. Without this no life could exist. We obtain the energy we need for living from the solar energy stored in the plant-food we eat or in the flesh of the animals that eat the plants. The energy we obtain from coal or oil is solar energy trapped by the chlorophyll in plant life millions of years ago. We live by the sun through the agency of chlorophyll.\" 46-8: Potent vibratory chant. The literal translation of Sanskrit mantra is \"instrument of thought,\" signifying the ideal, inaudible sounds which represent one aspect of creation; when vocalized as syllables, a mantra constitutes a universal terminology. The infinite powers of sound derive from AUM, the \"Word\" or creative hum of the Cosmic Motor.

England, too, is receptive to the time less yoga message. Reporters and newsreel cameramen swarmed over my quarters at Grosvenor House. The British National Council of the World Fellowship of Faiths organized a meeting on September 29th at Whitefield's Congregational Ch urch where I addressed the audience on the weighty subject of \"How Faith in Fello wship may Save Civilization.\" The eight o'clock lectures at Caxton Hall attracte d such crowds that on two nights the overflow waited in Windsor House auditori um for my second talk at nine-thirty. Yoga classes during the following week s grew so large that Mr. Wright was obliged to arrange a transfer to another hall. The English tenacity has admirable expres sion in a spiritual relationship. The London yoga students loyally organized themselves, after my departure, into a Self-Realization Fellowship center, hold ing their meditation meetings weekly throughout the bitter war years. Unforgettable weeks in England; days of sight-seeing in London, then over the beautiful countryside. Mr. Wright and I summoned the trusty Ford to visit the birthplaces and tombs of the great poets and heroes of British history.

The Christmas Day feast included delicaci es brought fifteen thousand miles for this glad occasion: gucchi mushrooms from Kashmir, canned rasagulla and mango pulp, papar biscuits, and an oil of the Indian keora flower which flavored our ice cream. The evening found us grouped around a huge sparkling Christmas tree, the near-by fireplace crackling with logs of aromatic cypress. Gift-time! Presents from the earth's far cor ners-Palestine, Egypt, India, England, France, Italy. How laboriously had Mr. Wright counted the trunks at each foreign junction, that no pilfering hand receive the treasures intended for loved ones in America!

One by one I distributed the gaily wrapped packages from the immense pile under the tree. \"Sister Gyanamata!\" I handed a long box to the saintly American lady of sweet visage and deep realization who, during my absence, had been in charge at Mt.

A dearly beloved disciple, Mr. Dickinson had been present at every Christmas festivity since the 1925 founding of Mt. Washington. At this eleventh annual celebration, he was standing before me , untying the ribbons of his square little package. \"The silver cup!\" Struggling with emotion, he stared at the present, a tall drinking cup. He seated himself some distance away , apparently in a daze. I smiled at him affectionately before resuming my role as Santa Claus. The ejaculatory evening closed with a prayer to the Giver of all gifts; then a group singing of Christmas carols. Mr. Dickinson and I were chatting together sometime later. \"Sir,\" he said, \"please let me thank you now for the silver cup. I could not find any words on Christmas night.\" \"I brought the gift especially for you.\" \"For forty-three years I have been waiting fo r that silver cup! It is a long story, one I have kept hidden within me.\" Mr. Dickinson looked at me shyly. \"The beginning was dramatic: I was drowning. My older brother had playfully pushed me into a fifteen-foot pool in a small town in Nebraska. I was only five years old then. As I was about to sink for the se cond time under the water, a dazzling multicolored light appeared, filling all spac e. In the midst was the figure of a man with tranquil eyes and a reassuring smil e. My body was sinking for the third time when one of my brother's companions bent a tall slender willow tree in such a low dip that I could grasp it with my desperat e fingers. The boys lifted me to the bank and successfully gave me first-aid treatment. \"Twelve years later, a youth of seventeen , I visited Chicago with my mother.

After a little pause, he added, smiling, 'He will pour out to you more blessings than you are now able to hold.' \"I left Chicago in a few days,\" Mr. Dick inson went on, \"and never saw the gre at Vivekananda again.

Main building and part of the grounds of the Self-Rea lization Fellowship This Self-Realization Fe llowship ashram had been made possible through the generosity of a few American disciples, American businessmen of endless responsibilities who yet find time daily for their Kriya Yoga . Not a word of the hermitage construction had been allowed to reach me during my stay in India and Europe. Astonishment, delight! During my earlier years in America I had combed the coast of California in quest of a small site for a seaside ashram; wh enever I had found a suitable location, some obstacle had invariably arisen to thwart me. Gazing now over the broad acres of Encinitas, 48-1 humbly I saw the effortless fulfillment of Sri Yukteswar's long-ago prophecy: \"a hermitage by the ocean.\" A few months later, Easter of 1937, I conducted on the smooth lawns at Encinitas the first of many Sunrise Services. Like th e magi of old, several hundred students gazed in devotional awe at the daily miracle, the early solar fire rite in the eastern sky.

What a shame if the lecture were to be marred by a commentary of overripe tomatoes!\" I had laughingly disagreed. \"Music is a un iversal language. Americans will not fail to feel the soul-aspiration in this lofty chant.\" 48-2 During the lecture Mr. Hunsicker had sat behind me on the platform, probably fearing for my safety. His doubts were groundless; not only had there been an absence of unwelcome vegetables, but for one hour and twenty-five minutes the strains of \"O God Beautiful!\" had sounded uninterruptedly from three thousand throats. Blase' no longer, dear New York ers; your hearts had soared out in a simple paean of rejoicing! Divine heal ings had taken place that evening among the devotees chanting with lo ve the Lord's blessed name. The secluded life of a literary minstrel was not my role for long. Soon I was dividing every fortnight between Los An geles and Encinitas. Sunday services, classes, lectures before clubs and college s, interviews with students, ceaseless streams of correspondence, articles for East-West , direction of activities in India and numerous small centers in American citi es.

I had summoned him in 1928 to assume leadership of the Washington Self-Realization Fellowship center. \"Premananda,\" I told him during a vi sit to his new temple, \"this Eastern headquarters is a memorial in stone to yo ur tireless devotion. Here in the nation's capital you have held aloft the light of Lahiri Mahasaya's ideals.\" Premananda accompanied me from Washington for a brief visit to the Self- Realization Fellowship center in Boston. What joy to see again the Kriya Yoga band who had remained steadfast since 1920! The Boston leader, Dr. M. W.

I wanted you to know that Boston possesses some luxurious apartments!\" The shadows of approaching carnage were lengthening over the world; already the acute ear might hear the frightful dr ums of war. During interviews with thousands in California, and through a wo rld-wide correspondence, I found that men and women were deeply searching their hearts; the tragic outer insecurity had emphasized need for the Eternal Anchorage. \"We have indeed learned the value of meditation,\" the leader of the London Self- Realization Fellowship center wrote me in 1941, \"and know that nothing can disturb our inner peace.
