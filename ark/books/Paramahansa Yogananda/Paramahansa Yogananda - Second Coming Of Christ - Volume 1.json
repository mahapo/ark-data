Many of the religious and philosophical concepts and methods he introduced decades ago are now finding expression in education, psychology, business, medicine, and other spheres of endeavor—contributing in far-reaching ways to a more integrated, humane, and spiritual vision of hu- man life. The fact that Paramahansa Yogananda's teachings are being interpreted and creatively applied in many different fields, as well as by exponents of di- verse philosophical and metaphysical movements, points not only to the great practical utility of what he taught. It also makes clear the need for some means of ensuring that the spiritual legacy he left not be diluted, fragmented, or distorted with the passing of time. With the increasing variety of sources of information about Parama- hansa Yogananda, readers sometimes inquire how they can be certain that a publication accurately presents his life and teachings. In response to these in- quiries, we would like to explain that Sri Yogananda founded Self-Realization Fellowship to disseminate his teachings and to preserve their purity and integ- rity for future generations. He personally chose and trained those close disci- ples who head the Self-Realization Fellowship Publications Council, and gave them specific guidelines for the preparation and publishing of his lectures, writings, and Self-Realization Lessons. The members of the SRF Publications Council honor these guidelines as a sacred trust, in order that the universal message of this belove d world teacher may live on in its original power and authenticity. The Self-Realization Fellowship name and the SRF emblem (shown above) were originated by Sri Yogananda to identify the organization he founded to carry on his worldwide spiritual and humanitarian work. These appear on all Self-Realization Fellowship books, audio and video recordings, films, and other publications, assuring the reader that a work originates with the organization founded by Paramahansa Yogananda and faithfully conveys his teachings as he himself intended they be given. —SELF-REALIZATION FELLOWSHIP IV"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"on tents Volume I List of Illustrations     xi     Preface, by Sri Daya Mata    xiii    Introduction     xxi     1 Divine Incarnations: God's Emissaries   i   2 Jesus' Immaculate Conception and His Relationship With John the Baptist   33    3 The Birth of Jesus and the Adoration of the Three Wise Men    51    4 The Infancy and Youth of Jesus   63   5 The Unknown Years of Jesus' Life—Sojourn in India . . 79 6 The Baptism of Jesus    95    7 The Role of Satan in God's Creation   127  8 Jesus'Temptation in the Wilderness  155   9 Jesus Meets His First Disciples   181   10 \"Hereafter Ye Shall See Heaven Open\" Jesus' Discourse to Nathanael   195   11 Water Into Wine: \"This Beginning of Miracles....\" .... 213 12 Driving the Money Changers Out of the Temple  225 13 The Second Birth of Man—In Spirit Dialogue With Nicodemus, Part I  237  14 The Ascension of Man—Lifting Up the Serpent in the Wilderness Dialogue With Nicodemus, Part II   255   15 God's Love Gave to the World His Only Begotten Son Dialogue With Nicodemus, Part III (Conclusion) ... 271 16 Rejoicing in the Voice of the Bridegroom  285  17 The Woman of Samaria, Part I   293   v"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"i8 19 20 21 22 2 3 24 2 5 26 28 29 30 3i 3 2 33 34 35 36 vi Worship God \"in Spirit and in Truth\" The Woman of Samaria, Part II \"My Meat Is to Do the Will of Him That Sent Me\" The Woman of Samaria, Part III (Conclusion) \"Thy Son Liveth\": The Healing Power of Thought Transformation \"What Things the Father Doeth, These Also Doeth the Son Likewise\" Jesus' Discourse on Judgment and Resurrection After the Healing at the Pool of Bethesda \"Repent Ye, and Believe the Gospel\" Fishers of Men Casting Out Devils Healing the Sick The Beatitudes The Sermon on the Mount, Part I To Fulfill the Law The Sermon on the Mount, Part II The Lord's Prayer: Jesus Teaches His Followers How to Pray The Sermon on the Mount, Part III \"Seek Ye First the Kingdom of God, and His Righteousness\" The Sermon on the Mount, Part IV To Build the House of Life Upon the Rock of Wisdom The Sermon on the Mount, Part V (Conclusion) ....

In memories as vivid and sharply etched as though yesterday, I inwardly behold the great Guru, his face radiantly enraptured, as he records for the world the inspired exposition of the Gospel teachings imparted to him through direct, personal communion with Jesus of Nazareth. Still living in my consciousness are the sacred vibrations that enfolded us when through the years Paramahansaji, in ecstatic meditation, became absorbed in one of his many visions of Christ; and when my stenographic pen seemed to take on a life of its own in attunement with the Guru's voice as I took down his words during his lectures and classes and at every opportunity in his presence—words that flowed from his oneness with the infinite Christ -Kutastha wisdom of the universe. My first meeting with Paramahansa Yogananda was in 1931 when he came to my hometown of Salt Lake City to give a series of lectures and classes. Instantly I felt a soul-quickening recognition that at last I had found someone who truly knew God—one who could lead me to at- tainment of the God-realization that was so evident in the transforming power emanating from his very person. Not long after, in November of that year, I entered Paramahansaji's monastic ashram at the international headquarters of his society atop Mount Washington in Los Angeles to devote myself to a life of seeking and serving God under his guidance. Having been completely transfixed by the illuminating depth of the Guru's teachings of yoga and meditation, I found it something of Xlll"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"a surprise that this consummate exponent of India's ancient spiritual heritage would also give emphasis to the life and message of Jesus in the New Testament. Indeed, I was not only to witness in Paramahan- saji a living exemplar of this scriptural wisdom, but personally to record numerous lectures, temple services, informal talks, and writings in which he explicated the teachings of Jesus. The scope and content of The Second Coming of Christ are clearly set forth in the author's Introduction and the Discourses that follow. But perhaps it will add to the reader's appreciation to know something of the genesis of this work, of which I can speak firsthand —from its inception to the culminating presentation in these pages. Paramahansaji—as a delegate to the International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston—had arrived in America in 1920 to un- dertake the mission given him by a line of enlightened masters in In- dia:* to spread worldwide the ancient soul-science of yoga meditation, and (as he expressed in the Aims and Ideals of Self-Realization Fel- lowship) \"to reveal the complete harmony and basic oneness of orig- inal Christianity as taught by Jesus Christ and original Yoga as taught by Bhagavan Krishna; and to show that these principles of truth are the common scientific foundation of all true religions.\" The fulfillment of this sacred responsibility was his lifelong endeavor—beginning with classes in Boston in his first years in this country and continuing with ever newly expressed inspirations to the last days before his pass- ing more than thirty years later. After a few years in Boston, Paramahansaji embarked on a pro- gram of lectures and class series that, over the course of the next decade, took him over the length and breadth of the United States. He taught in nearly all the major cities; overflow audiences in the largest auditoriums were spellbound by his great wisdom and love for God — and by his dynamic personality, which was itself an explicit testimony to the practicality of the applied spiritual science he taught. The introduction of his unique exposition of the teachings of Jesus Christ dissolved theological boundaries between the liberating path to God's kingdom revealed by Lord Jesus and the Yoga science of God-union taught by Bhagavan Krishna in the sacred scripture of In- dia, the Bhagavad Gita. Paramahansaji's American students, consist- ing largely of persons raised in the Judeo-Christian tradition, longed * Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, and Swami Sri Yukteswar (see glossary). xiv"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"for more—especially to be able to study these explanations in writ- ten form and thereby better absorb the unguessed spiritual treasures that had been revealed in their own familiar scriptures by this man of God from India. Their requests did not go unheeded. In 1932, not long after I joined the ashram at Mount Washington, the Guru found time, amidst organizational demands and travel to fulfill lecture engagements, to begin including commentaries on the Gospels and the Bhagavad Gita in the magazine he had founded a few years earlier. Each installment consisted of a few verses of both scriptures along with Paramahansaji's explanations. \"These spiritual interpretations are the result of a long- unfulfilled promise to Yogoda students,\" he announced in the maga- zine.* Not infrequently, the copy was mailed to the magazine staff from whatever faraway city he was lecturing in at the time—even dur- ing his extended trip to India via Europe and Palestine in 1935-36. Of Paramahansaji's numerous remarkable experiences during that journey to India, especially of note in connection with this book is his visit to the Holy Land. In a letter sent from Jerusalem to his exalted disciple in America, Rajarsi Janakananda,f the Guru wrote of his ex- periences with Christ: \"There are no words adequate enough to express to you the joy and the vision and the blessedness which I perceived here. All the primitive atmosphere, the ancient background, is still pres- ent, marred only by a few modern buildings and hotels. His name is alive as before; only the Jesus that was and walked and suffered in the streets of Jerusalem very few people see. He was with me everywhere; and a very special communion I had in Bethlehem where he was born as the little babe body of Jesus. He touched me as I entered the ancient menagerie where Mary brought him into the world—in a humble lit- tle stable under an inn. This place is absolutely authentic. I know it from the Divine. But there are other places where different factions have marked Jesus did this and that, which have some errors. Every place was verified from within. Most places are authentic.\" * East-West magazine, founded by Paramahansa Yogananda in 1925; he later renamed it Self-Realiwtion (the name under which it continues to this day) to clearly identify it as the official organ of his Self-Realization Fellowship organization, which had been known as Yogoda Satsanga Society in earlier years. t First successor to Paramahansa Yogananda as president and spiritual head of Self- Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India (until his passing on Febru- ary 20, 1955).

It was in this ideal lo- cation, away from the demands of lecturing and organizational work, that the Guru was able to devote himself more fully to his writings and to spend more time in seclusion and deep communion with God. From the depths of these periods of divine communion in the Encinitas Hermitage, the Guru brought forth, in addition to profound scriptural commentaries, his long-contemplated Autobiography of a Yogi. It was my great blessing, along with my sister/ to record on a typewriter the Guru's dictation. He would work all day long and usu- ally far into the night. The thrill of the truths pouring from him were intoxicating, a wonderful blissful state of consciousness! Of his inter- pretations of Christ's words I wrote in my personal notes: \"I have watched Master's face as he dictates his inspirations. The joy and wis- dom of another world are expressed there. His eyes are afire with a blaze of love for Christ, and his voice is permeated with tenderness. It evokes reflections of how Christ must have spoken centuries ago.\" Of his own experience, the Guru remarked during that period: \"I am worshiping the Father in the greatest joy and glory that ever was given to me. I never dreamed before how deep are the teachings of Jesus. Through the interpretation that is being given to me now, I see that they express the same truths as Patanjali's aphorisms, the con- densed essence of Indian Yoga. Understood in this light, they can build a new age.\" Tara Mata, a close disciple of Gurudeva whom he had appointed as editor of his writings, wrote to a literary acquaintance describing the Guru's commentaries on Christ's words: \"He will come to a pas- sage which is so obscure that it defies all possibility of plain interpre- tation. He will look blankly at me or one of his other secretaries for a while, close his eyes, and presently out will come the whole plain meaning. He gets it entirely from inspiration; in fact, it is only through him that I know what 'inspired books' really means, \"f * Ananda Mata, a faithful disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda since 1931.

The pastor of a Congrega- tional Church in England, the Reverend Arthur Porter, a Doctor of Di- vinity who had taken the Guru's classes in New York City years earlier, wrote of Paramahansaji's interpretation as \"a masterpiece of divine insight.\" \"One realizes that the complexities, the seeming irrelevancies and contradiction of the New Testament, have at last been solved in the white light of a soulful penetration,\" his testimonial went on. \"[This] is not a product of scholarly study or comparison of existing Biblical commentaries, but has come forth in an awe-inspiring originality from the deeps of an unerring spiritual and intuitional judgment. It will live when whole libraries of intellectual theorizings on Christ have long been forgotten—the most important clarification of his teachings that has ever been offered the Christian world.\" During this period of working on the Gospel commentaries in Encinitas, Paramahansaji began plans to have the material made avail- able in book form. An interested gentleman with outside business con- tacts offered to seek a publisher. However, these attempts were unsuc- cessful; and Paramahansaji's Self-Realization Fellowship organization at that time had neither the printing facilities nor funds required to pub- lish and promote a major book. Paramahansaji accepted the resulting evaluation that for the worldwide public distribution he envisioned, the manuscript would require further attention. \"Continue to print the ar- ticles in our magazine for our readers,\" he instructed us. \"Later I will have to do more work on them.\" In the meantime, he had already turned his attention, and that of his assisting disciples, to his Autobiog- raphy of a Yogi, which was completed and published in late 1946. The final years of Gurudeva's life, from 1948 until 1952, were given over to long periods of intense concentration on his writings, his spiritual legacy to future generations. Knowing that his time on earth was drawing to a close, he found refuge for that work at a secluded retreat in the Mojave Desert, accompanied by a handful of close dis- ciples who were assisting him, including his editor Tara Mata and the young editor he was training, Mrinalini Mata.* He was focused on * Foreseeing that Tara Mata would not live long enough to complete the editorial work on all his writings, Paramahansaji designated Mrinalini Mata as her successor, and per- sonally tutored her in the editing of his teachings for publication and worldwide dis- xvil"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"completing the major publications that would make permanent the teachings he had bee n ordained to bring to the world. Much of this time was devoted to his translation of and voluminous commentary on the Bhagavad Gita: God Talks With Arjuna. He also undertook a concentrated review of many of his other works. His instruction for the completion of this present book was to draw on the full measure of material he had given on the life and teachings of Jesus in order to impart to a world audience the comprehensive presentation of the true teachings of the blessed Christ that he had divinely received. In his talks through the years, including weekly sermons at Self- Realization Fellowship temples, he often included some commentary on, or applicable to, one or more verses from the Gospels. From these, precious realizations about Christ's life and words came into being— freshly expressed concepts, clarification and elaboration of points Paramahansaji had introduced in the magazine serialization, and also new explanations of important Gospel passages that had not been in- cluded in the magazine series. These and other of Paramahansaji's truth-perceptions, forthcoming during his full lifetime of building and serving his Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga organization, have been made an integrated whole in this definitive edition of The Second Coming of Christ. Preparing this manuscript for publication in book form also en- tailed minimizing duplication of basic concepts that had been neces- sary when the commentaries were presented serially in the magazine over two decades—and also condensation of material that had been included in the early magazine articles primarily for Paramahansaji's students and followers and later incorporated into the printed Self- Realization Fellowship Lessons or elsewhere at his request. Additional work stemmed from the fact that in the earliest stages of composing his Gospel commentaries, Paramahansaji made use of a book that had been given to him entitled The Walks and Words of Jesus, by Reverend M. N. Olmsted, in which the author had compiled into one chrono- logical narrative the events and sayings recounted in all four of the Gospels (King James version).

Because of this, Paramahansaji had stopped using Rev. Olmsted's book partway through the maga- zine series, and switched to direct quotes from the King James Bible —which he had always used when giving explanation of Bible pas- sages in his classes and temple services. Accordingly, in preparing this book, wording of the verses from the King James Bible has been used throughout, and parallel references from all the Gospels have been cited in order to insure a thorough presentation of Jesus' words. In the fifty years since Paramahansaji's passing, advances in phys- ics, medicine, biology, and other fields—as well as archaeological and historical research that has shed much light on the early Christian movement—have contributed additional scientific and historical in- formation pertinent to Paramahansaji's farseeing spiritual vision and understanding of Jesus' life and world mission. In publisher's foot- notes, we have cited some of the more recent discoveries. This two-volume scriptural treatise thus represents the inclusive culmination of Paramahansa Yogananda's divine commission to make manifest to the world the essence of \"original Christianity as taught by Jesus Christ.\" In giving the foregoing background as to how this book came into being, my hope has been to convey also to the reader at least some- thing of the state of consciousness of the author. Truly his perceptions were of God. Paramahansaji's relationship with Christ far transcended a philosophical or moral appreciation of the message of the Gospels. He knew Jesus Christ in a personal way. He knew him through di- rectly partaking of the infinite Christ Consciousness, God's con- sciousness omnipresent in creation, that the Master of Galilee had manifested—the consciousness through which Jesus had performed not only his wonders of healing and other \"supernatural\" feats, but the far greater miracles of unconditional love, forgiveness, and spiri- tual transformation of lives. Paramahansaji endeavored during his thirty years of teaching in the West to awaken that consciousness in all who would know Christ truly. I had been at Mount Washington about a month when the Guru conducted the first all-day Christmas meditation. For over eight hours that day he meditated with a group of Self-Realization Fellowship members and friends, remaining continuously in communion with xix"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"God and Christ. As I sat in the afterglow of that memorable day, I re- member thinking: \"Here is a man from the Orient, of Hindu origin, yet such is his love for Christ that he has seen him and communed with him. It is he who has shown the West how truly to celebrate the birth and life of Jesus.\" During the more than twenty years of my discipleship that I served as Paramahansaji's confidential secretary and assistant, never once did I see him step down from the lofty plane of Christlike be- havior. I came to understand that his attunement with Jesus was founded not only in the profound depths of his joyous inner com- munion with the infinite Christ Consciousness in samadhi meditation, but also in his own realization and manifestation of the ideals of un- conditional love, forgiveness, compassion, adherence to the highest di- vine truths, that were the hallmarks of Jesus' incarnation on earth. Thus, Paramahansaji's commentaries, divinely received and their truths realized, provide us an authentic glimpse of the spirit of those days when Lord Jesus walked with his beloved disciples by the shores of the Sea of Galilee and preached in the villages and countryside, and in the streets and temple of Jerusalem, giving his teachings of the \"new testament\" for the world. Paramahansaji takes us with Jesus on the journey of that divine life, from his birth to his death and resurrection, inviting the reader into the inner circle of Jesus' disciples to know the love and wisdom of the Christ they knew and followed. As the Dis- courses unfold, the universal precepts of Jesus are brought alive for to- day. Truth does not change with time; nor does humanity's basic po- tential and irrevocable choice: either to remain hapless victims of flawed human nature or to ascend to the glorious fulfillment of our blissful, immortal God-nature. It is my hope and prayer that in this new millennium the publi- cation of my Guru's long-awaited Second Coming of Christ kindle the flame of love divine in the hearts of all who read these pages. The mes- sage herein illumines the universal path that welcomes and embraces persons of every race, nationality, and religion. May the surpassing truth and inspiration set forth in these volumes help to usher the world into an enlightened era of peace, unity, world brotherhood, and com- munion with our one Father-Mother-Friend-Beloved God.

He came two thousand years ago and, after imparting a universal path to God's kingdom, was crucified and resurrected; his reappearance to the masses now is not necessary for the fulfillment of his teachings. What is necessary is for the cosmic wis- dom and divine perception of Jesus to speak again through each one's own experience and understanding of the infinite Christ Consciousness that was incarnate in Jesus. That will be his true Second Coming. There is a distinguishing difference of meaning between Jesus and Christ. His given name was Jesus; his honorific title was \"Christ.\" In his little human body called Jesus was born the vast - • — Christ Consciousness, the omniscient Intelligence of Difference in meaning God omnipresent in every part and particle of ere- between \"Jesus\" and ation.

By the definite science of meditation known for millenniums to the yogis and sages of India, and to Jesus, any seeker of God can enlarge the cal- iber of his consciousness to omniscience—to receive within himself the Universal Intelligence of God. What Jesus gave as chronicled in the New Testament of the Bible very few people understand. They just read what he said and quote it; and because it i s written in the biblical Scripture they believe it blindly, with little effort to realize the wisdom therein through personal experience. Real- ization is to attune one's consciousness with Christ; then the right comprehension will come. When per- sons try to deduce the meaning of Jesus' words by intellectual analysis alone, or from the perspective of a specific dogma, they inevitably distort his sayings to suit their pur- pose—however well-intentioned—or to comfortably accommodate their level of understanding. Christ-wisdom has to be grasped by com- munion, not by rationalization . The only reliable standard of scriptural interpretation is the testi- mony of actual perception—to go into that state of consciousness in which the prophets perceived the truths they expounded and thereby wit- ness the meaning they intended. The words of Jesus fully unfold their wis- dom only to those who meditate deeply on the Christ Consciousness that Jesus possessed. Then one understands Jesus in the light of his spiritual experience of the Cosmic Consciousness of the Heavenly Father, realized through the Father's Christ-Intelligence reflection present in all creation.

He lived, died, and was gloriously resurrected as an in- spiration to others to live a divine life and attain in themselves his ex- periences of God and the afterlife. Jesus Christ was crucified once; but his teachings are crucified daily at the hands of superstition, dogmatism, and pedantic theologi- cal misinterpretations. My aim in offering to the world this spiritual interpretation of his words is to show how the Christ Consciousness of Jesus, free from such crucifixion, can be brought back a second time into the souls of all who make the effort to receive it. Surely, with the dawn of this more enlightened age, the time has come to stop the cru- cifixion of the Christ teachings as given by Jesus. His pristine message should be resurrected from its entombment by Self-realization, the in- ner enlightened experience of truth. In these pages I offer to the world an intuitionally perceived spiri- tual interpretation of the words spoken by Jesus, truths received through actual communion with Christ Consciousness. They will be found to be universally true if they are studied conscientiously and meditated upon with soul-awakened intuitive perception. They reveal the perfect unity that exists among the revelations of the Christian Bible, the Bhagavad Gita of India, and all other time-tested true scriptures. The saviors of the world do not come to foster inimical doctrinal divisions; their teachings should not be used toward that end. It is something of a misnomer even to refer to the New Testament as the \"Christian\" Bible, for it does not belong exclusively to any one sect. Truth is meant for the blessing and upliftment of the entire human race.

The material meaning of the teachings of Christ emphasizes their value as applied to physical and social well-being—the eternal laws of right living pertinent to man's personal, familial, business, community, national, and international duties as a member of God's worldwide human family. The mental interpretation explains the application of Christ's teaching for the improvement of man's mind and understanding—de- velopment of his intellectual and psychological faculties, his thoughts and moral values. Interpreted in relation to the spiritual side of man's being, Jesus' teachings point out the way to the kingdom of God—personal real- ization of each soul's infinite divine potentials as an immortal child of God, through devout communion and ultimate oneness with the Heavenly Father-Creator of all. Although both the material and the psychological interpretations of scriptures are necessary for the right conduct of a balanced, God- centered life, it is the spiritual interpretations that the God-sent emis- saries of scriptural content intended as of supreme importance. Even the most materially or intellectually accomplished individual may fail to make a true success of life. Rather, it is the person of spiritual at- tainment who scientifically achieve s all-round success, which means to be happy, healthy, intelligent, contented, and truly prosperous with blissful, all-fulfilling wisdom through God-communion.

There is a vast difference between theoretical religion and philos- ophy and their actual practice. Practically speaking, philosophy may be divided into three parts—ethics, psychology, and metaphysics. These three departments are covered in both the Hindu and Christian Bibles. Ethics—scriptural truth as applied to material life—sets forth the science of human duty, moral laws, how to behave. Psychology—truth applied to mental well-being—teaches one how to analyze himself; for no spiritual progress is possible without introspection and self-study by which one endeavors to find out what he is so that he can correct himself and become what he should be. Metaphysics—truths pertaining to the spiritual dimension of life —explains the nature of God and the science of knowing Him. These three, taken together and put into practice, constitute reli- gion. The ethical moral principles prescribed in the New Testament are the same as in the Gita. The psychology and the metaphysics of these two scriptures, rightly interpreted, likewise coincide in every respect. The superficial difference is that the Hindu scriptures—of which the Gita is a sublime summation—were written in a higher age of civi- lization, against a background of greater understanding among the general populace. Though Jesus himself embodied the highest wisdom, he expressed truth in simple, concise language; whereas the scriptures of India are composed in Sanskrit terminology of extraordinary depth and scientific precision. Point by point I have compared the salient message of the Bible and Hindu scriptures, and have found only har- monious unity between them. It is from this understanding that these explanations of Christ's words have been written. By way of example, some parallel or complementary verses from the Bhagavad Gita are cited. I have given a detailed explanation of these verses and the en- tirety of the Git a in a separate work,* to which I encourage readers to refer for additional insight into the truths implicit but not elaborated in Jesus' words that have come down to us in the four canonical Gospels.

None of these works, however, has supplanted the New Testament Gospels as the richest and most complete resource available about what Jesus actually said and did. Professor Luke Timothy Johnson of Emory University writes in The Real Jesus (HarperSanFrancisco, 1996): \"Haven't all the archaeological discoveries of the past forty years opened up exciting new sources for the historical analysis of earliest Chris- tianity?...The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947 was revolutionary because it provided previously unavailable and precious insight into the varieties of Judaism in first-century Palestine, and into the workings of a sectarian Judaism making claims analogous to those made by the Christians.

From personal experience I know the reality of his life and miracles, for I have seen him many, many times, and communed with him, and re- ceived his direct confirmation about these matters. He has come to me often as the baby Jesus and as the young Christ. I have seen him as he was before his crucifixion, his face very sad; and I have seen him in the glorious form in which he appeared after his resurrection. Jesus did not have a light complexion with blue eyes and blond hair as many Western painters have depicted him. His eyes were dark brown, and he had the olive-colored skin of his Asiatic heritage. His nose was a little flattened at the tip. His moustache, sparse beard, and long hair were black. His face and body were beautifully formed. Of all the pictures I have seen of him in the West, the rendering by Hof- mann comes closest to showing the accurate features of the incarnate Jesus.* I t is an erroneous assumption of limited minds that great ones such as Jesus, Krishna, and other divine incarnations are gone from the earth when they are no longer visible to human — sight. This is not so. When a liberated master has Jesus' wish to restore dissolved his body in Spirit, and yet manifests in his original teachings form to receptive devotees (as Jesus has appeared to the world throughout the centuries since his passing, such as to Saint Francis, Saint Teresa, and many others of East and West), it means he has an ongoing role to play in the destiny of the world. Even when masters have completed the specific role for which they took on a physical incarnation, it is the divinely ordained task of some to look after the welfare of humanity and assist in guiding its progress.

He is deeply concerned for mankind and wishes to give his followers the means to attain the divine freedom of entry into God's Infinite Kingdom. He is disappointed because many are the churches and temples founded in his name, often prosperous and powerful, but where is the communion that he stressed—actual contact with God? Jesus wants temples to be established in human souls, first and fore- most; then established outwardly in physical places of worship. In- stead, there are countless huge edifices with vast congregations being indoctrinated in churchianity, but few souls who are really in touch with Christ through deep prayer and meditation. To reestablish God in the temples of souls through revival of the original teachings of God-communion as propounded by Christ and Krishna is why I was sent to the West by Mahavatar Babaji, the death- less Yogi-Christ of modern India, whose existence was revealed to the world at large for the first time in 1946 in Autobiography of a Yogi: \"Babaji is ever in communion with Christ; together they send out vibrations of redemption and have planned the spiritual technique of salvation for this age. The work of these two fully illumined masters —one with a body, and one without a body—is to inspire the nations to forsake wars, race hatreds, religious sectarianism, and the boomer- ang evils of materialism.

My singular desire to discern rightly the true meaning of Christ's words was given wondrous confirmation one night during a period when I was working on these interpretations. It was in the Hermitage at Encinitas, California. I was sitting in my darkened room in medi- tation, praying deeply from my soul, when suddenly the blackness gave way to a celestial opal-blue effulgence. The entire room was like an opal flame. In that light the radiant form of the blessed Lord Jesus appeared. His face was divine. His appearance was of a young man in his twenties, with sparse beard and moustache; his long black hair, parted brew, but in Greek, the lingua franca of the eastern part of the Roman Empire at that time. Thus the translation of Jesus' words began even with this primary written form. For his commentaries on the Gospels, Paramahansa Yogananda used the King James translation (the \"Authorized Version\" of 1611). Reynolds Price, Professor of English at Duke University, has compared the King James Bible with later English translations of the original Greek text of the Gospels. In Three Gospels (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1997) he writes: \"We now have in English several popular ver- sions of the gospels that constitute what are well-intended but almost certainly major distortions of their originals....King James's translators proceeded under a single guid- ing principle (one word of the original in the fewest equivalent words of English, with the preservation when possible of at least some suggestion of the Greek word order).... \"Five minutes spent even today in the Bible section of an ordinary bookstore will show that no later version has equaled the King James in popularity; and in many con- servative churches still, it is the only version consulted, as it is in a thousand college courses on 'The Bible as Literature.' And while it is customary to say that such en- during popularity derives from the King James's sonorous diction and stately syntax —the diction of Shakespeare and Ben Jonson—a close comparison of its language to that of the original s will very often show that the power and memorability of the King James is an almost automatic result of its loyal adherence to principles of literalness and the avoidance of paraphrase.

Aeons past, in ancient higher ages in India, rishis enunciated the manifestation of Divine Beneficence, of \"God with us,\" in terms of di- vine incarnations, avatars—God incarnate on earth in enlightened be- ings. The eternal, omnipresent, unchanging Spirit has neither a cor- poreal nor heavenly form called God.

Rather, He makes Himself known through the divinity in worthy instruments. Many ar e the voices that have intermediated be- tween God and man, khanda avatars, or partial incarnations in God- knowing souls. Less common are the puma avatars, liberated beings who are fully one with God; their return to earth is to fulfill a God- ordained mission. The Lord in the sacred Hindu Bible, the Bhagavad Gita, declares: \"Whenever virtue declines and vice predominates, I in- carnate as an Avatar. In visible form I appear from age to age to pro- tect the virtuous and to destroy evildoing in order to reestablish righ- teousness\" (IV :7-8). The same one glorious infinite consciousness of God, the Universal Christ Consciousness, Kutastha Chaitanya, be- comes familiarly apparelled in the individuality of an enlightened soul, graced with a distinguishing personality and godly nature appropriate to the times and purpose of the incarnation. Without this intercession of God's love come to earth in the ex- ample, message, and guiding hand of His avatars, it would scarce be possible for groping humanity to find the path into God's kingdom midst the dark miasma of world delusion, the cosmic substance of hu- man habitation. Lest His benighted children be lost forever in cre- ation's delusive labyrinths, the Lord comes again and again in God- illumined prophets to light the way. The glory of Christ in the form of Jesus made visible the Invisible Light that leads to God. Because the periodic recurrence of divine incarnations is a part of God's creative enterprise, signs of such a birth are imprinted in the —— Grand Master Plan. Sages, through their awakened The mission of divine soul intuition, can read the heavenly inscriptions; love that Jesus came and if it be in accord with God's will that such a fu- to fulfill  ture event be made known, they prophesy in plain or veiled revelations. This is one of the many ways in which God assures His children of His awareness of their need for His presence amongst them. Of the future coming of Lord Jesus, sev- eral references in the Old Testament are cited by devout Christians and Biblical scholars. From the book of prophet Isaiah: \"The Lord Himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall con- ceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel\"* (7:14). * \"Which being interpreted is, 'God with us'\" (Matthew 1:23). 4"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"My servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high....So shall he sprinkle many nations (52:13, 15). All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all....He was taken from prison and from judgment...he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of My peo- ple was he stricken....He bare the sin of many, and made inter- cession for the transgressors (53:6, 8, 12). Divine intercession to mitigate the cosmic law of cause and effect, by which a man suffers from his errors, was at the heart of the mission of love Jesus came to fulfill. Moses brought the law from God to man, emphasizing the awful justice that befalls willful heedlessness. Jesus came to demonstrate the forgiveness and compassion of God, whose love is a shelter even from exacting law. Similarly, Jesus was preceded by Gautama Buddha, the \"Enlightened One,\" whose incarnation reminded a forget- ful generation of the Dharma Chakra, the ever-rotating wheel of karma —self-initiated action and its effects which make each man, and not a Cosmic Dictator, responsible for his own present condition. Buddha brought heart back into the arid theology and mechanical rituals into which the ancient Vedic religion of India had fallen after the passing of a higher age in which Bhagavan Krishna, India's most beloved of avatars, preached the way of divine love and God-realization through the prac- tice of the supreme spiritual science of yoga, union with God. \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\"* Such was the exceptional mission shouldered by Jesus. Intercession by intimates of God is the palliative elixir that gives a weakened mortal the necessary strength to rise and conquer the forces of cosmic law he has roused against himself by disobedient be- havior. The interceder stands with the devotee, offering him defense in the form of impermeable wisdom, and sometimes deflecting onto him- self a portion of a devastating onslaught. Jesus came in a darkened age that was little able to appreciate him; but his message of the love of God and his intercession on behalf of suffering humanity was not only for that time but for all ages to come—that God is with man in his darkest moments as well as in en- lightened times. He reminded a world fearful of their Creator as a God *John 15:13 (see Discourse 71). 5"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"DISCOURSE 1 of wrathful judgment that, though \"God is a Spirit: and they that wor- ship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth,\"* the Absolute is also a personal God who can be appealed to in prayer and who re- sponds as a loving Heavenly Father.

Those who unite their con- sciousness to God know both the transcendent and the immanent na- ture of Spirit—the singularity of the ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever- new Bliss of the Uncreate Absolute, and the myriad manifestations of His Being as the infinitude of forms into which He variegates Himself in the panorama of creation. The scientific evolution of cosmic creation from the Creator-Lord is outlined, in arcane terminology, in the Old Testament book of Gen- esis. In the New Testament, the opening verses of Saint John's Gospel may rightly be called Genesis According to Saint John. Both these pro- found Biblical accounts, when clearly grasped by intuitive perception, correspond exactly to the spiritual cosmology set forth in the scrip- tures of India handed down by her Golden Age God-knowing rishis. Saint John was perhaps the greatest of the disciples of Jesus. Just as a schoolteacher finds among his pupils one whose superior compre- hension ranks him first in the class, and others who must be ranked lower, so among the disciples of Jesus there were differing degrees of ability to appreciate and absorb the depth and breadth of the teachings of the Christ-man. The records left by Saint John, among the various books of the New Testament, evince the highest degree of divine real- ization, making known the deep esoteric truths experienced by Jesus and transferred to John. Not only in his gospel, but in his epistles and especially in the profound metaphysical experiences symbolically de- scribed in the Book of Revelation, John presents the truths taught by Jesus from the point of view of inward intuitive realization. In John's words we find precision; that is why his gospel, though last among the four in the New Testament, should be considered first when the true meaning of the life and teachings of Jesus is being sought. \"•John 4:24 (see Discourse 18). 6"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"s * f V v; -- ,- f,* ' / n the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness com- prehended it not.... That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not.

John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, \"This was he of whom I spake, 'He that cometh after me is preferred be- fore me: for he was before me.'\" And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.

In verses 6-8 and 15, however, Saint John digresses briefly to anticipate his historical narrative of the life and activities of Jesus by making reference to Christ's forerunner, John the Baptist; these verses, written as prose, depart from the poetic style of the rest of this opening passage. About these first eighteen verse s of John 1, scholars observe: \"With the exception of verses 6-8 and 15, which seem to be interruptions, this prologue is in the form of Semitic poetry.\"—Robert J.

This Unmanifested Absolute can- not be described except that It was the Knower, the Knowing, and the Known existing as One. In It the being, Its cosmic consciousness, and Its omnipotence, all were without differentiation: ever-existing, ever- conscious, ever newly joyous Spirit. In this Ever-New Bliss, there was no space or time, no dual con- ception or law of relativity; everything that was, is, or is to be existed as One Undifferentiated Spirit. Space and time and relativity are cate- gories of objects; as soon as a human being sees a planet hanging in the sky, he conceives that it is occupying dimensional space and exist- ing in time, relative to its place in the universe. But when there were no finite objects of creation, neither were there the dimensions of be- ing that define them, only the Blissful Spirit. When, whence, and why came creation into being? Who may make bold to read the Mind of the Infinite in seeking causes from the Uncaused, beginnings from the Ever-Existing, paltry reasons from Om- niscience?* Audacious mortals pursue their queries, while sages enter that Mind and return to state in unadorned simplicity that the One en- tertained a desireless desire to enjoy His Bliss through many, and the cosmos and its beings were born. The Unmanifested Spirit felt, \"I am alone. I am conscious Bliss, but there is no one to taste the sweetness of My Nectar of Joy.\" Even as He thus dreamed, He became many. In poetic fancy, I penned a depiction of this cosmic musing: * \"'For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways,' saith the Lord. 'For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts'\" (Isaiah 55:8-9). 8"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"\"The Spirit was invisible, existing alone in the home of Infinity. He piped to Himself the ever-new, ever-entertaining song of perfect be- atific Bliss. As He sang to Himself through His voice of Eternity, He wondered if aught but Himself were listening and enjoying His song. To His wittingly imposed astonishment, He felt His solitariness: He was the Cosmic Song, He was the Singing, and He was the Lone En- joyer. Even as thus He thought, lo, He became two: Spirit and Nature, Man and Woman, Positive and Negative, Stamen and Pistil of the flowers, Peacock and Peahen, Male Gem and Female Gem.\" Spirit, being the only existing Substance, had naught but Itself with which to create. Spirit and Its universal creation could not be es- sentially different, for two ever-existing Infinite Forces would conse- quently each be absolute, which is by definition an impossibility. An orderly creation requires the duality of Creator and created. Thus, Spirit first gave rise to a Magic Delusion, Maya, the cosmic Magical Measurer,* which produces the illusion of dividing a portion of the In- divisible Infinite into separate finite objects, even as a calm ocean be- comes distorted into individual waves on its surface by the action of a storm. All creation is nothing but Spirit, seemingly and temporarily diversified by Spirit's creative vibratory activity. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men (John 1:1-4). ord\" means intelligent vibration, intelligent energy, going forth from God. Any utterance of a word, such as \"flower,\" expressed by an intelligent being, consists of sound energy or vibra- tion, plus thought, which imbues that vibration with intelligent mean- ing. Likewise, the Word that is the beginning and source of all created substances is Cosmic Vibration imbued with Cosmic Intelligence.f *See also Discourse 7, page 140. fThough official church doctrine for centuries has interpreted \"the Word\" (Logos in the original Greek) to be a reference to Jesus himself, that was not the understanding origi- 9"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Thought of matter, energy of which matter is composed, matter it- self—all things—are but the differently vibrating thoughts of the Spirit, even as man in his dreams creates a world with lightning and clouds, people being born or dying, loving or fighting, experiencing heat or cold, pleasure or pain.

This universe is a vibratory dream motion picture of God's thoughts on the screen of time and space and human consciousness. \"The Word was with God, and the Word was God\": Before cre- ation, there is only undifferentiated Spirit.

As soon as Spirit evolved a cosmic vibratory thought, through the action of the cosmic magical measuring power of maya, delusion, the nally intended by Saint John in this passage. According to scholars, the concept John was expressing can best be understood not through the exegesis of much-later church ortho- doxy, but through the scriptural writings and the teachings of Jewish philosophers of John's own period—for example, the Book of Proverbs (with which John and any other Jewish person of his time would have been familiar). Karen Armstrong in A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1993) writes: \"The author of the Book of Proverbs, who was writing in the third century BCE...personifies Wisdom so that she seems a separate person: \"Yahweh created me [Wisdom] when his purpose first unfolded, before the oldest of his works. From everlasting I was firmly set, from the beginning, before earth came into being...when he laid the foundations of the earth, I was at his side, a master craftsman, delighting him day after day, ever at play in his presence, at play everywhere in the world, delighting to be with the sons of men\" (Proverbs 8:22-23, 30-31; The Jerusalem Bible).... \"In the Aramaic translations of the Hebrew scriptures known as the targums, which were being compose d at this time [i.e., when John's Gospel was written], the term Memra (word) is use d to describe God's activity in the world. It performs the same function as other technical terms like 'glory,' 'Holy Spirit' and 'Shekinah' which em- phasized the distinction between God's presence in the world and the incomprehensi- ble reality of God itself. Like the divine Wisdom, the 'Word' symbolized God's origi- nal plan for creation.\" The writings of early Church Fathers also indicate that this was the meaning in- tended by Saint John. In Clement of Alexandria (Edinburgh: William Blackwood and Sons, 1914) John Patrick states: \"Clement repeatedly identifies the Word with the Wis- dom of God.\" And Dr. Anne Pasquier, professor of theology at Universite Laval, Que- bec, writes in The Nag Hammadi Library After Fifty Years (John D. Turner and Anne McGuire, editors; New York: Brill, 1997): \"Philo, Clement of Alexandria, and Ori- gen...all associate the Logos with the word of God in the Old Testament accounts of the creation when 'God spoke and it was done.' The Valentinians do likewise....Ac- cording to the Valentinians, the prologue to John's Gospel depicts a spiritual genesis, the model for the material one, and it is seen as a spiritual interpretation of the Old Testament accounts of the creation.\" (Publisher's Note) 10"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Unmanifested Spirit became God the Father, the Creator of all creative vibration. God the Father, in the Hindu scriptures, is called Ishvara (the Cosmic Ruler) or Sat (the supreme pure essence of Cosmic Consciousness)—the Transcendental Intelli- gence. That is, God the Father exists transcenden- tally untouched by any tremor of vibratory creation —a conscious, separate Cosmic Consciousness. The vibratory force emanating from Spirit, en- dowed with the illusory creative power of maya, is the Holy Ghost: Cosmic Vibration, the Word, Aum {Om ) or Amen. All things, all cre- ated planets and living beings in the Holy Ghost, or Holy Vibration, are nothing but the frozen imagination of God. This Holy Ghost in the Hindu scriptures is called the Aum or Maha-Prakriti (Great Na- ture, the Cosmic Mother that gives birth to all creation); by the scien- tists, the structure of matter, its tissue or material, is also known, to a lesser degree, as cosmic vibration. \"These things saith the Amen [the Word, Aum\\ the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the cre- ation of God.\"* The holy Cosmic Sound of Aum or Amen is the wit- ness of the manifested Divine Presence in all creation. A cosmic vibration omnipresently active in space could not of itself create or sustain the wondrously complex cosmos. The universe is not the result merely of a fortuitous combination of vibrating forces and subatomic particles, as proposed by material scientists—a chance ex- crescence of solids, liquids, and gases into earth, oceans, atmosphere, plants, all harmoniously interrelated to provide a habitable home for hu- man beings. Blind forces cannot organize themselves into intelligently structured objects. As human intelligence is needed to put water into the small square compartments of an ice tray to be frozen into cubes, so in the coalescence of vibration into progressively evolving forms through- out the universe we see the results of a hidden Immanent Intelligence. The transcendent consciousness of God the Father became manifest within the Holy Ghost vibration as the Son—the Christ Consciousness, God's intelligence in all vibratory creation. This pure reflection of God in the Holy Ghost indirectly guides it to create, re-create, preserve, and mold creation according to God's divine purpose. * Revelation 3:14.

Imagine the sun as existing by itself, with nothing surrounding it—a bright mass of light with untold power and heat, its rays spreading into boundless space. Place a blue crystal ball within this radiation. The sun now exists in relation to the blue crystal ball. The sunlight is di- vided as the inactive, transcendental white light beyond and around the crystal ball, and as the essentially unchanged light appearing as blue light by its reflection in the blue crystal ball. This division of the one sunlight into white and blue light is due to the dividing effect of the third object, the blue crystal ball. Just as the sun is solitary pure brilliance, spherically spreading its rays in space when it stands by itself, so Spirit without any vibratory creation is the Unmanifested Absolute. But introduce the \"blue crys- tal ball\" of a manifested universe, and Spirit becomes differentiated as the vibratory substance of all manifestations evolved from the Aum or Holy Ghost; the pure reflected Intelligence of God as Christ Con- sciousness omnipresent in every object and pore of space in the realm of vibration; and the supreme Essence of all, Cosmic Consciousness, the transcendental God the Father of all creation.

He explains that \"just as a violin string can vi- brate in different patterns, each of which produces a different musical tone, the fila- ments of superstring theory can also vibrate in different patterns....A tiny string vi- brating in one pattern would have the mass and the electric charge of an electron; according to the theory, such a vibrating string would be what we have traditionally called an electron. A tiny string vibrating in a different pattern would have the requi- site properties to identify it as a quark, a neutrino, or any other kind of particle....Each arises from a different vibrational pattern executed by the same underlying entity....At the ultramicroscopic level, the universe would be akin to a string symphony vibrating matter into existence.\" (Publisher's Note) 14"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Thus John summarizes: \"In him (the Word) was life; and the life was the light of men\" (John 1:4).* The Biblical writers, not versed in the terminologies that express the knowledge of the modern age, quite aptly used \"Holy Ghost\" and \"the Word\" to designate the character of the Intelligent Cosmic Vi- bration. \"Word\" implies a vibratory sound, carrying materializing power. \"Ghost\" implies an intelligent, invisible, conscious force. \"Holy\" describes this Vibration because it is the manifestation of Spirit; and because it is trying to create the universe according to the perfect pattern of God.f * A subtle change in the meaning intended by Saint John, but one with far-reaching im- plications, is evident in most translations of this and the preceding verses. All nouns in Greek are either masculine, feminine, or neuter in gender. The noun logos (\"word\") is masculine, apparently leading English translators to use the masculine pronoun \"him\" when referring to \"the Word.\" However, since English does not differentiate the gen- der of nouns such as \"word,\" the correct pronoun in translation would be \"it\" — un- less referring to a person, in which case the personal pronoun \"him\" would be appro- priate. Thus, the use of \"him\" reflects a theological interpretation by the translator that \"the Word\" in fact signifies a person: Jesus. This interpretation became accepted as church orthodoxy in large part through the efforts of Irenaeus, second-century bishop of Lyons and author of the influential work Against Heresies. Dr. Elaine Pagels, professor of religion at Princeton University, writes in Beyond Belief (New York: Random House, 2003): \"Irenaeus tells us that Valenti- nus's disciple Ptolemy, reading these words [John 1:1-3], envisioned God, word, and finally Jesus Christ as, so to speak, waves of divine energy flowing down from above; thus, he suggests, the infinite divine Source above reveals itself in diminished form in the divine word, which reveals itself, in turn, in the more limited form of the human Jesus....Irenaeus challenges Ptolemy's interpretation of John's prologue and argues in- stead that 'God the Father' is equivalent to the word, and the word is equivalent to 'Jesus Christ.'...What Irenaeus's successors would derive from this was a kind of sim- ple, almost mathematical equation, in which God=«/or^=Jesus Christ. That many Christians to this day consider some version of this equation the essence of Christian belief is a mark of Irenaeus's accomplishment—and his success....Because Irenaeus's bold interpretation came virtually to define orthodoxy, those who read John's gospel today in any language except the Greek original will find that the translations make his conclusion seem obvious.\" However, the \"Word\" (as also \"the only begotten Son\") came to signify the per- son of Jesus only through a gradual evolution of doctrine brought about by complex theological and political influences. It was not until the fourth century, writes historian Karen Armstrong in A History of God (Ne w York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1993), that the church came to \"adopt an exclusive notion of religious truth: Jesus was the first and last Word of God to the human race.\" (Publisher's Note) fSee Discourse 7, which explains the dual nature assumed by the Cosmic Creative Vi- bration: pure Holy Ghost in tune with God's will; and obstructive Cosmic Satan, orig- inator of all evil, which tries to divorce all creatures from their Creator. 15"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The designation in the Hindu scriptures of this \"Holy Ghost\" as Aum signifies its role in God's creative plan: A stands for akara, or cre- —— ative vibration; u for ukara, preservative vibration; The Cosmic Word or and m for makara, the vibratory power of dissolu- Holy Ghost: intelli- tion.

Thus is the Word or Cosmic Vibration the origin of \"all things\": \"without him was not anything made that was made.\" The Word ex- isted from the very beginning of creation—God's first manifestation in bringing forth the universe. \"The Word was with God\"—imbued with God's reflected intelligence, Christ Consciousness — \"and the Word was God\"—vibrations of His own one Being. Saint John's declaration echoes an eternal truth resonating in var- ious passages of the hoary Vedas: that the cosmic vibratory Word (Vak ) was with God the Father-Creator (Prajapati) in the beginning of creation, when naught else existed; and that by Vak were made all things; and that Vak is itself Brahman (God). In the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord affirms: \"Among words, I am the one syllable Aum n (x:z$). \"Of all manifestations, I am the beginning, middle, and end\" (x:$z). \"I, the Unchanging and Everlasting, sustain and permeate the entire cosmos with but one fragment of My Being\" (x:42). With the understanding of this truth, we have the underlying sci- ence of the universe and a proper basis for appreciating these verses of Saint John in the context of their reference to the life of Jesus Christ. In scriptural parlance characteristic of India's sages, Saint John in the several opening verses of his Gospel posits, in a double entendre reference to the incarnation of Jesus, the divinity of the Christ state of Jesus as analogous to the Universal Christ manifestation of God that comes forth as Intelligence and Creative Vibration at the birth of cre- ation. Devotees in India make no differentiation between the divinity of God in the microcosm of the incarnate consciousness of an avatar —as in Lord Krishna, for example—and the divinity of God in the macrocosm of universal expression. Likewise, Saint John speaks alle- gorically of the Christ in Jesus as one and the same as the Christ man- 16"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"ifestation in Infinitude (the presence of God in creation), the latter be- ing the prime intent of his presentation in these verses. The Holy Trinity of Christianity—Father, Son, and Holy Ghost —in relation to the ordinary concept of the incarnation of Jesus is wholly inexplicable without differentiating between Jesus the body and Jesus the vehicle in which the only begotten Son, Christ Con- sciousness, was manifested. Jesus himself makes such distinction when speaking of his body as the \"son of man\"; and of his soul, which was not cir- cumscribed by the body but was one with the only begotten Christ Consciousness in all specks of vi- bration, as the \"son of God.\" \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son\"* to redeem it; that is, God the Father remained hidden beyond the vi- bratory realm that went out from His Being, but then secreted Him- self as the Christ Intelligence in all matter and in all living beings in order to bring, by beautiful evolutional coaxings, all things back to His home of Everlasting Blessedness. Without this presence of God ubiquitously permeating creation, man would indeed feel bereft of Di- vine Succor—how sweetly, sometimes almost imperceptibly, It comes to his aid when he bows his knee in supplication. His Creator and Supreme Benefactor is never more than a devotional thought away. Saint John said: \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.\"f The plural number in \"sons of God\" shows distinctly, from the teachings he received from Jesus, that not the body of Jesus but his state of Christ Consciousness was the only begotten son; and that all those who could clarify their consciousness and receive, or in an unobstructed way reflect, the power of God, could become the sons of God. They could be one with the only be- gotten reflection of God in all matter, as was Jesus; and through the son, Christ Consciousness, ascend to the Father, the supreme Cosmic Consciousness.^: *John 3:16, commented on in Discourse 15. tjohn 1:12 (explained in more detail on pages 24-27). t'T am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me\" (John 14:6).

So also, Swami Shankara (the founder of the Swami Order of renunciation circa A.D. 700), Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, and my guru Swami Sri Yukteswar,* and others having Christ Consciousness, became thereby sons of God. The Spirit could not be partial in creating Jesus as a Christ and all others as spiritually ineffectual mortal beings. Divinely imported Jesuses could be made by the thousands by God; and they would, be- ing predestined, naturally behave on earth as Christs—spiritual pup- pets of God. Such Christs could hardly be the ideals of mortals strug- gling with all their frailties. But when there is one who became a Christ by self-effort to conquer temptations and by proper use of God-given free choice and power of God-communion through intense worship or a scientific technique of meditation, then that example stirs hope of sal- vation in the frail, timorous, matter-tortured human breast. India's priceless contribution to the world, discovered anciently by her rishis, is the science of religion—yoga, \"divine union\"—by which God can be known, not as a theological concept but as an actual per- sonal experience. Of all scientific knowledge, the yoga science of God- realization is of the highest value to man, for it strikes at the root-cause of all human maladies: ignorance, the beclouding envelopment of delu- sion. When one becomes firmly established in God-realization, delu- sion is transcended and the subordinate mortal consciousness is ele- vated to Christlike status.

Spiritual laws defining the workings of the universe and man's place in it are the highest science, underpinning all scientific discoveries; but since scientists depend more on effects than ulti- mate causes, spiritual pronouncements of the sages How the darkness of are largely dismissed as superstition. By a gradual delusion blinds man pace of broadened understanding, however, spiri- to the light of God's tual science and material science find they are presence in creation standing on common ground . There are two manifestations of the darkness of delusion: one is maya , cosmic delusion, \"that which measures the Infinite\"; and the other is avidya, which means ignorance or individual illusion. If someone sees an elephant moving around in the air, it would be said that what he is seeing is an illusion or hallucination; but to him the perception is real. Maya is the mass hypnosis of God by which He makes every human being believe in the same illusory \"reality\" of cre- ation as perceived by the senses; avidya gives individuality of form, ex- perience, and expression (it supports the ego or I-consciousness). The light that \"shineth in the darkness\" of the delusion of cre- ation is the light of God. God is light. In the First Epistle of St. John (1:5) we read: \"This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.\" In the intelligent creative Cosmic Vibration that went forth from the cosmic consciousness of God were His first two expressions in manifested creation: sound (the holy Aum or Amen) and light (\"In the beginning....God said, 'Let there be light'\"—Genesis 1:1, 3). Units of divine light, finer than electrons and other subatomic particles, are the bricks of which matter is composed. All things seen on the screen of the universe are differentiated currents of the cosmic light and the shadows or \"darkness\" of delusion. The light of God shines within the darkness of cosmic delusion, but man, the perceiver, suffers from two blinding maladies: the limi- tation of his senses, or individual delusive ignorance, and the cosmic delusion, combined. Because of the limitation of the senses, man does not perceive the full spectrum of even material manifestations. If the power of vision were increased, one could see all kinds of lights—atoms, electrons, photons, vibratory auras—dancing around him. If the power of hear- 19"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"ing were sufficiently increased, man could hear the hum of the atoms, the planets in their course around the sun, the explosion of stars, mak- ing a tremendous rumbling throughout the universe. One would sense the whole universe throbbing with life. But none of the finer and higher vibrations can be sensed except to a limited degree with the aid of delicate supersensory instruments. \"Darkness\" denotes that limita- tion, because it produces the illusion of confinement of consciousness. Even the light of the sun is considered darkness, because it is a part of this physical world of duality; its grossness, also, hides the greater light of God. Only in spiritually transcendent ecstatic states is there no duality of day and night, light and darkness, but God's light alone. Just behind the darkness of closed eyes in meditation shines that radiance of God. Man is blinded by the relativities of life. Without the aid of phys- ical light he sees darkness. But beyond that darkness is another light that pervades the world. Hidden behind the ether of space is the tremendous light of the astral world, providing the life and energy that sustains the whole universe.\"\" The auroral rays of astral lifetrons are a * See \"ether\" in glossary. The Sanskrit word akasha, translated as both \"ether\" and \"space,\" refers specif- ically to the vibratory element that is the subtlest in the material world. \"Ether- permeated space is the boundary line between heaven, or the astral world, and earth,\" Paramahansaji said. \"All th e finer forces God has created are composed of light, or thought-forms, and are merel y hidden behind a particular vibration that manifests as ether.\" Frank Wilczek, Ph.D., professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology, writes in Physics Today (January 1999): \"There is a myth, repeated in many popular presentations and textbooks, that Albert Einstein swept [the ether] into the dustbin of history....The truth is more nearly the opposite: Einstein first purified, and then enthroned, the ethe r concept. As the twentieth century has progressed, its role in fundamental physics has only expanded. At present, renamed and thinly disguised, it dominates the accepted law s of physics.\" Physicists investigating the ether—now also called the quantum vacuum, the quan- tum field, and the zero-point field—have realized that \"the very underpinning of our universe [is] a heaving sea of energy, one vast quantum field,\" writes Lynne McTag- gart in The Field: The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe (New York: Harper- Collins, 2002). \"What we believe to be our stable, static universe,\" she explains, \"is in fact a seething maelstrom of subatomic particles fleetingly popping in and out of ex- istence....

Out of the astral light, God is creating planets and universes. I am in that light all the time; I see everything aglow with that heavenly essence—all physical mani- festation emanates from that astral light, and that light emanates from the creative manifestation of God as Light. If you saw God right now, you would see Him as one mass of light scintillating over the whole universe. As I close my eyes in ecstasy everything melts into that great Light. It is not imagination; rather, the perception of the Sole Reality of being. Whatever is seen in that state will happen; that is the proof of the reality of that Omnipresent Light of all becomings. Man is so drunk with delusion, it obliterates his true perception so that the darkness of his ignorance cannot apprehend the light of God vibrating everywhere. Both cosmic delusion ( maya) and individ- ual illusion or ignorance ( avidya ) work together to thus obscure and confound the soul's inherent intuitive sense of God's omnipresence. In meditation this darkness of sensory dependence goes away and intu- ition prevails, revealing oneself as light in the magnitude of a whole universe of light. That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world (John 1:9). of every virtual particle radiates energy. The zero-point energy in any one particular transaction in an electromagnetic field is unimaginably tiny—half a photon's worth. But if you add up all the particles of all varieties in the universe constantly popping in and out of being, you come up with a vast, inexhaustible energy source...all sitting there unobtrusively in the background of the empty space around us.\" \"Indeed, calculations of the quantity known as the zero-point energy suggest that a single cubic centimeter of empty space contains more energy than all of the matter in the known universe,\" states Will Keepin, Ph.D., in \"Lifework of David Bohm: River of Truth\" (ReVision magazine, Summer 1993). Keepin writes that for Bohm, who is regarded as one of the twentieth century's greatest physicists, \"this enormous energy inherent in 'empty' space can be viewed as theoretical evidence for the exis- tence of a vast, yet hidden realm....The vast physical universe we experience is but a set of 'ripples' on the surface of the implicate order.

It is the omnipresence of that light of God that supports the grand illu- sion of an infinitude of forms and their wondrous portrayals of indi- viduality. That light is the true light because it is infinite and everlast- ing, while man only borrows from it his temporary mortal existence from one life to the next.

His spirit is thus reflected in \"his own,\" since matter; life, and mind matter, life, and mind are direct manifestations of do not fully reflect Spirit, just as man's soul has manifested itself into the Spirit body and mind imbued with life. Although these physical instrumentalities belong to the soul, and are indeed manifes- tations of the soul, the limitations imposed on the body and mind by delusion prevent man from knowing his ever perfect, blissful soul, his true Self. He rather thinks of himself as a form, name, and specific characteristics subject to worries, troubles, and other afflictions of delusion. So it is said in this verse that the spirit of God came into \"his own,\" that is, became manifested in matter and life and His con- scious processes in human beings; and \"his own received him not\"; that is, through the intervention of cosmic delusion, matter, life, and mind do not fully and truly reflect and express (\"receive\") the Divine Immanence. realizes, as is clear from Paramahansa Yogananda's commentary, the relationship of \"light\" and \"word\" (logos) in this context—primal expressions of God's cosmic vi- bratory energy in creation.

The common condition of human beings is that their conscious- ness is hidebound by the body. Man's body, being a delimited vibra- tory expression, existing in but separated from Cosmic Vibration, sim- ilarly circumscribes the consciousness. Yoga teaches that the spiritual aspirant must retrace the various states of higher vibrations in order to lift the consciousness from the captive vibrations of breath, heart, and circulation to the more subtly vibrating sound emanating from the bodily atoms and life force. By a special technique of meditation on Aum, known to students of the Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons, the devotee becomes aware of his consciousness as limited by the con- strictions of the flesh, evidenced by the sounds of breath, heart, and circulation. And then, by a deepening of his meditation, he can hear the voice of the great Aum or Amen, the cosmic sound emanating from all atoms and sparks of cosmic energy. By listening to this omnipresent sound, and merging in its holy stream, the consciousness of the body- caged soul begins gradually to spread itself from the limitations of the body into omnipresence.

The Cosmic Consciousness (God the Father) existing transcendentally be- yond all vibratory (Holy Ghost) creation and the Christ Consciousness (Universal Intelligence, Kutastha Chaitanya) in all vibratory manifesta- tion are realized as one and the same.

He is the soul, the Self, made in the image of God (an individualized reflec- tion of God), which expresses itself in the manifested universe through the instrumentality of a body and a mind. The bodily instrument is a collective vibration of grossly stirring atoms, electromagnetic waves, and intelligent life force (subtle vital energy, finer than electrons). The men- tal faculty consists of both sensory instruments (of perception and ac- tion) and discriminative intelligence (which interprets sensory informa- tion and makes determinations regarding knowledge and action).

In that primordial period, the data shows, \"nothing existed but pure light, sprinkled with a smattering of subatomic par- ticles. Nothing happened, either, except that this light-and-matter fluid, as physicists call it, sloshed in and out of gravity wells, compressing the liquid in some places and spreading it out in others. Like banging on the head of a drum, the compression of the 'liquid light' as it fell into gravity wells set up the 'sound waves' that cosmologist Charles Lineweaver calls 'the oldest music in the universe.'\" Scientific American, July 2000, says that as the universe aged those sound waves \"developed on ever larger scales, filling the heavens with a deepening roar.\" About 300,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe cooled down to the point where elec- trons and protons condensed into atoms of hydrogen — and separated from the vi- brating light (photons). \"The photons went their separate ways, and the universe abruptly went silent.\" \"The rest,\" concludes K.

So each time man practices good- ness, he receives a special measure of God's grace. \"For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ\": Now here is a contentious verse of scriptural disagree- ment between Jews and Christians. But this verse is not intended to define any difference in the degree of spirituality between Jesus and Moses. The point is, every prophet has a special purpose to fulfill on earth. This statement of Saint John's merely recognizes Moses' gift from God to man in the form of the Ten Commandments. These are eternal verities, universal laws of life that make man's existence morally comfortable and spiritually fulfilling. The word \"command- ment,\" however, does not give the best connotation, for it is as if God is a dictator and man His servile attendant. These dictums should rather be regarded as a code of natural righteousness. If man does not follow those laws which evince the divine image within him, he falls out of tune with God into delusive suffering of his own making. 30"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":".Mary Visits line Mo liner oi Jolm (lie Baptistl And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: And she spake out with a loud voice, and said....\"Lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.\" — Luke 1:41—44 The relationship between Jesus and John was of a continuing journey together of two divine souls, begun in previous lifetimes....

We would have had no inkling of God the Father in His tran- scendent vibrationless abode beyond the etheric vastness of creation unless that \"only begotten\" Intelligence reflected in matter declared His existence. The word \"seen\" has such a provisory connotation. One who is body-bound, whose consciousness is limited to sensory perceptions and the thought that he is a mortal being—he cannot see God.

When the consciousness is impregnate with the Christ Intelli- gence, one sees that Intelligence as the reflection of God manifesting in everything. But when the Creative Vibration of the outgoing exter- nalization of God's consciousness is enshrouded in maya , the true Essence of manifestation is hidden. It is the Holy Ghost pure intelli- gence and its innate undistorted reflection of God as Christ Con- sciousness that proclaims the everywhereness of the Divine Presence and is the stabilizer and magnetic attraction in matter that keeps cre- ated forms linked to their Divine Source, and ultimately pulls them back to God. The nature of this Christ magnetism is God's Love—His eternal caring and watchfulness of the greatest and the tiniest of His manifestations, never allowing them to wander outside of His shelter- ing presence. This Omnipresent Love of God is why I consider Bhagavan Krishna and Jesus Christ, avatars of East and West, as the supreme ex- pressions of the Krishna-Christ Consciousness (the Universal Kutastha Chaitanya ), for in them was evident in the highest degree the incarna- tion of God's divine love and compassion. Krishna's love gave to the world the yoga of liberation from the sea of suffering through scien- tific meditation and right action, and the devotional approach of fling- ing oneself on the Divine Compassion. Jesus demonstrated in his every act of ministering to the sick and forsaken, and in the consummate sacrifice of his body to alleviate the sins of many, the incomparable love of God that is an infinitude of mercy and forgiveness. The para- mount meaning of the birth of Jesus is the forgiveness of God. Though man cast himself into the darkest abyss of God-forgetfulness, spurn- ing the Lord in favor of rampant material gratifications, yet is he ul- timately rescued by the pull of God's love within and around him that aids in a natural upward evolutionary return to God. This is the world message Jesus the Christ was born to declare, by the hidden love of God made manifest in the divinity of his life. 32"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"T here was in the days of Herod , the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course ofAbia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.

The ignorant and the wise alike require equal oppor- tunity from the hand of a just and loving God in order to fulfill this quest. For instance, a baby who dies prematurely cannot possibly have used its free will to be either virtuous enough to be granted salvation or vicious enough to be damned. Nature must bring that soul back to earth to give it a chance to use its free will to work out the past ac- tions (karma) that were the lawful cause of its untimely death, and to perform sufficient good actions to attain liberation.

My mind, therefore, early on, dwelt often on the life of Christ; his presence became a very real experience to me. As every human being has undergone many lifetimes to fashion his present nature and condition, an idle curiosity often imposed itself on my mind as to what incarnations Jesus must have passed through in order to reach Christhood. An ordinary materially minded man's consciousness is limited to the satisfaction of hunger, thirst, and minor necessities of the body, including gratification of desires. An intellectual man spreads his consciousness to explore the stars or the deeper regions of the secret caves of wisdom connected with the mind, life, or surroundings of human ex- istence.

Over the years, I made deep researches in Spirit to ascertain the out- standing previous incarnations of Jesus—with little result. (God keeps tightly closed the mystery door that closets a soul's past lives, lest undue and irrelevant attention be focused on former glories or disastrous er- rors rather than on the merits of the here and now. Nevertheless, glimpses He does vouchsafe when the purpose is beneficial.) One day as I sat in absorbed contemplation, with the Christian Bible in my hands, I deeply prayed, \"Father, tell me who was Jesus Christ before he came to earth in that incarnation.\" In unexpected instancy, the Father's silent omnipresent voice became manifest in audible words: \"Open the Bible!\" I obeyed the Divine Command; and the first verse on which my eyes fell was I Kings 19:19: So he (Elijah) departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him. Then I remembered what Jesus had spoken of John the Baptist: \"'But I say unto you, that Elijah is come already, and they knew him not....' Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist\" (Matthew 17:12-13).* It was Elisha, incarnate as Jesus, who could recognize his master in John the Baptist from their past as- sociation as Elijah and Elisha. In many places, as will be shown in these Discourses, Jesus made significant references to John the Baptist and showed deference to him—when Jesus asked to be baptized of him; when he extolled John as the greatest of prophets born of woman (which included himself); when Jesus was transfigured on the moun- tain and Moses and Elijah appeared and when afterward he identified Elijah as John the Baptist. Both John the Baptist and Jesus in their former incarnations as Elijah and Elisha had found complete liberation.

By divine appointment, Elisha was perfected through Elijah, who cast on him his mantle of spiritual realization. The hand of the Lord was on Elijah (I Kings 18:46). And God directed Elijah to initiate Elisha: And the Lord said unto him, \"Go, return on the way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest...Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room\" (I Kings 19:15-16). Thus did God distinctly appoint Elijah to be the guru of Elisha. The Guru of Gurus, the Supreme Preceptor, always designates the channel through which the disciple shall receive instruction Elijah as the past-life and liberation. Elijah, finding Elisha plowing with guru of Jesus the twelve yoke of oxen is significantly symbolic, since Elisha, later as Jesus, was to plow the hard soil of human consciousness with his twelve disciples to bring forth a har- vest of divine wisdom and salvation in many souls. By this incident did God indicate to Elijah the future remarkable world mission of Elisha; and that he was chosen for this divine dispensation because he was an extraordinary disciple. To cast a cloth mantle on another has no transforming power in and of itself. But the casting of a master's garment of Self-realization over the consciousness of an advanced disciple is the baptism by the Holy Ghost. Having received that initiation from Elijah, Elisha, without word or argument or persuasion, thereafter faithfully followed his guru. When it came time for the Lord to end the earthly incarnation of Elijah, the great prophet said to Elisha: \"Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee.\" And Elisha said, \"I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.\" And he (Elijah) said, \"Thou hast asked a hard thing: never- theless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.\" 40"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. And Elisha saw it, and he cried, \"My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.\" And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, \"Where is the Lord God of Elijah?\" And when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over. And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, \"The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Eli- sha.\" And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him (II Kings 2:9-15). So it was that Elisha, as Jesus, came with \"a double portion of spirit,\" to bring salvation to many disciples as well as to conquer by all-forgiving divine love when supremely tested with crucifixion. Eli- jah and Elisha both had performed many miracles, and were able to heal the sick, to produce abundance from a little food, and to raise the dead. Therefore, in accordance with the law of karma, Jesus possessed great powers even in childhood as a natural endowment from his in- carnation as Elisha. As Jesus imbued life into the shell of his dead body, spiritualizing and immortalizing it, so also even the decaying bones of the departed Elisha retained life-reviving power: And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Eli- sha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet (II Kings 13:20-21). The soul of Elijah, after converting his physical body into lumi- nous astral energy and ascending to heaven \"in the whirlwind of a 41"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"fiery chariot,\"* remained in the astral land to be timely reincarnated as John the Baptist to witness for the divine mission his disciple Elisha, reincarnated as Jesus, was preordained to fulfill.f Elijah and Elisha, both being one with Spirit, were spiritual equals. Yet Elijah, returning as John the Baptist, humbly took an insignificant part in that incarnation, just to see and support his reincar- nated disciple, Jesus, who came \"with a double por- tion of spirit\" to fulfill God's wish that he play an eminent role in rev- olutionizing the spiritual destiny of man. Both Jesus and John were fulfilling the will of God. It is natural that Elijah, being the master, wanted to be on earth to witness and be the one to prepare the way for his disciple to carry out his divine dispensation and be glorified as a savior on earth. A noble father is never jealous of his son's glory, but rather takes pride if the son surpasses his own repute in the eyes of the world. And though John played a lesser part, his ordeal of iniquitous imprisonment and beheading for the sake of truth was no less than the tribulation of Jesus on the cross. God's plan was in evidence from the moment of conception of these two souls in the wombs of their earthly mothers, embodying them for their incarnations as John and Jesus. Even when still in the womb, their spirits recognized one another and communicated their everlasting fealty and love. Advanced souls who have broken the cycles of compulsory in- carnations do not have to undergo the ordinary experience of oblivion that disconnects one life from the next. If they choose it to be so, their ever awake souls can retain their continuity of consciousness throughout the sequence of death, afterlife, and rebirth—even in the mother's womb. * \"The advanced yogi transmutes his cells into energy.

According to Smith's Bible Dictionary: \"In almost every respect Elisha presents the most complete contrast to Elijah....Elijah was a true Bedouin child of the desert. If he enters a city it is only to deliver his message of fire and be gone. Elisha, on the other hand, is a civilized man, an inhabitant of cities. And as with his manners so with his appearance.

Though the physical body of man was generally patterned after the physiological and anatomical instrumentalities that had resulted from the long process of evolution of animal species, hu- man beings were created by God with a unique endowment possessed by no lower forms: awakened spiritual centers of life and conscious- ness in the spine and brain that gave them the ability to express fully the divine consciousness and powers of the soul. By an act of special creation, God thus created the bodies of Adam and Eve in the im- maculate way of direct materialization, and empowered these first be- ings similarly to reproduce their own kind.

In the beginning, the sexual organs were not pronounced at all in the symbolic Adam and Eve. God warned them not to eat of the fruit \"in the midst of the garden\" (Genesis 3:3). That fruit was the sensual touch of sex in the middle of Sexual reproduction the bodily garden. When Adam and Eve succumbed in humans began to temptation and ate of that fruit—embraced each with the fall of Adam other in a lustful way—they were \"driven out\" of and Eve the Eden of spiritual consciousness. In their \"fall,\" having descended to the low estate of body identification, they lost their soul-awareness of the divine perceptions and capacities in the subtle cerebrospinal centers—including the power to create in the im- maculate way.* Their sexual organs developed, as in the lesser evolved forms of the animal kingdom. In the positive, more aggressive human form the protruding male organ developed; and in the negative, more passive body the recessive female organs developed.f The divinity and power of creation that God gave to Adam and Eve before their fall is still potentially present in every human soul, and will be brought back again when the Eden of godliness is reen- tered. The rishis of the ancient higher ages in India had the power to create by mind. By will power anything can be materialized in this world. In all cases, it is the Cosmic Vibration (Prakriti, Holy Ghost) that informs all matter. This vibration can be consciously wielded by the will power of Christlike beings who unite themselves with the Di- recting Intelligence of God's will in the Holy Vibration. Or God Him- self, directly or through His hierarchy of angelic agents, may transmit this power of the Holy Ghost to fulfill His purpose. When it is written in the Bible that God took a rib from Adam to fashion Eve (Genesis 2:21-22), \"rib\" refers to vibration: The creation of man (the positive or male manifestation of creative vibration) con- sisted of God's consciousness with reason uppermost and feeling par- * \"Unto the woman [God] said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children...\" (Genesis 3:16). fThe spiritual significance of the Adam and Eve story in Genesis is explained in more detail in Discourse 7 . 47"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"tially hidden; and with the same vibratory power He then created woman (the negative or feminine manifestation of the creative vibra- tion) with feeling uppermost and reason less dominant. From the pre- dominance of these qualities, He fashioned differences in their bodies that encased their sexless souls. God's plan—since creation depends on interaction between positive and negative forces—is that the God- given natures of man and woman would balance each other. When this vibration is equalized in a human being, he or she begins to man- ifest his or her innate divine soul-nature of perfect God-equilibrium. Many saints have been born in the natural way, and some in the immaculate way. The great ones who have attained liberation retain their individuality in Spirit; and at God's behest to return to the world as saviors, they can take a physical body either by immaculate con- ception or natural birth. (In higher world ages, they may even do so by direct materialization—though that is not for the eyes of unen- lightened times.) The mode of birth does not matter, nor does it nec- essarily indicate the degree of divinity. Sexual creation has the selfish sexual instincts of the parents in it. Therefore, some saints choose to be conceived in the immaculate way, —— the pure system of conception. So it is a fact that Buddha and other ava- Jesus was created by immaculate conception. His tars also born in the mother Mary, she who \"had found favor with immaculate way God,\" was filled with the Holy Ghost Cosmic Vi- bration: \"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.\" This sacred cre- ative Vibration, suffused with the reflection of God as the Christ Con- sciousness, entered the ovum in Mary's womb, immaculately creating the germ cell of life into which entered the soul of Jesus, the individ- ualized Christ Consciousness. From this pristine cell, according to the pattern inherent in the soul of Jesus, grew the body in which Jesus the Christ was born. It is not a myth. Gautama Buddha (as also other avatars) was born in the same way. His mother saw the Spirit enter her body. As told in traditional Indian allegory in the Jataka (ancient Buddhist scripture): \"And lying down on the royal couch, she fell asleep and dreamed the following dream: \"The four guardian angels came and lifted her up, together with her couch, and took her away to the Himalaya Mountains....After clothing her with divine garments, they anointed her with perfumes 48"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"and decked her with divine flowers. Not far off was Silver Hill, and in it a golden mansion. There they spread a divine couch with its head towards the east, and laid her down upon it. \"Now the Future Buddha had become a superb white elephant,* and was wandering about at no great distance, on Gold Hill. De- scending thence, he ascended Silver Hill, and approaching from the north, he plucked a white lotus with his silvery trunk, and trumpeting loudly, went into the golden mansion. And three times he walked round his mother's couch, with his right side towards it, and striking her on her right side, he seemed to enter her womb. Thus the concep- tion took place in the Midsummer Festival. \"On the next day the queen awoke, and told the dream to the king. And the king caused sixty-four eminent Brahmins to be summoned.... [and] told them the dream and asked them what would come of it? \"'Be not anxious, great king!' said the Brahmins; 'a child has planted itself in the womb of your queen....You will have a son. And he, if he continue to live the household life, will become a Universal Monarch; but if he leave the household life and retire from the world, he will become a Buddha, and roll back the clouds of sin and folly of this world.'\"t There is a cosmic metaphysical symbolism in the wondrous con- ception and birth of Jesus. His incarnate Christ Consciousness came immaculately through the Virgin Mary. Likewise, the universal Christ Intelligence was born or reflected in the cosmic body of pure vibratory creation (Cosmic \"Virgin Mary\") through the instrumentality of God the Father. The Holy Ghost Cosmic Vibration, Aum, Maha-Prakriti, is analogous to the Cosmic Virgin Mary because it is thus the mother of the immanent Universal Christ Intelligence, the Son of God, and of all created objects. * Symbolizing pure divine wisdom and royalty. In the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord says: \"Among stallions, know Me to be the nectar-born Uchchaihshravas; among elephants, Indra's white elephant, Airavata; and among men, the emperor\" (God Talks With Arj- una: The Bhagavad Gita X:Z7). The elephant is a symbol of wisdom. Significantly, Aira- vata is referred to as the guardian or supporter \"of the east quarter\" (in man's body, the \"east\" or center of wisdom in the forehead). The word Indra [\"king of the gods\"] implies one who is a conqueror of the senses (indriya). Wisdom is the vehicle of the yogi who has conquered his senses. God is indeed prominently manifested in the colos- sal wisdom of the sense conqueror. tThe Harvard Classics, Volume 45, Part 3: Buddhist Writings, trans.

Perception of the finer vibratory dimensions are unper- ceived by the gross sensory instruments of the body; but through the touch of God's grace, the veil of matter is parted, and with sight di- vine of the soul's spiritual eye of intuitive perception glimpses of the heavenly spheres and beings are revealed. The pageantry of Jesus' coming to earth lacked no detail of sym- bolic significance. As with the shepherds on the hillside, the shepherds of man's faith, devotion, and meditation will be bathed in the light of realization and lead those devotees who are humble in spirit to behold the infinite presence of Christ newborn within them. The observance by God and His hierarchy of the incarnation of di- vine ones is not only at the time of such a birth, but during succeeding celebrations of natal anniversaries as well. Each year at Christmastime there are stronger than usual vi- Spiritual celebration of brations of Christ-love and joy that emanate to earth Jesus' birth: commun- from the heavenly realms. The ether becomes filled ion with the Infinite with the Infinite Light that shone on earth when Christ in meditation Jesus was born. Those persons who are in tune through devotion and deep meditation feel in a wondrously tangible way the transforming vibrations of the omnipresent consciousness that was in Christ Jesus. To celebrate the birth of Jesus in solely materialistic ways is a des- ecration of the meaning of his holy life and of the immortal message of divine love and God-union that he preached. Seeing in the West the shal- low, often irreverent, observance given to the birth anniversary of this great avatar, I inaugurated in Self-Realization Fellowship the spiritual celebration of Christmas, before Christmas Day festivities, by devoting a daylong meditation service to the worship of Christ. The ideal is to honor Christ in spirit in meditation from morning till evening, absorbed in feeling in one's own consciousness the Infinite Christ that was born in Jesus. That experience is one of profound peace and joy, more than a human heart has ever known—expanding into an all-embracing con- sciousness. Often has the form of Jesus appeared before me during these services—such love in those eyes! It is my prayer—and my conviction that it will come to pass—that comparable observances of the real meaning of Christmas will become a tradition throughout the world. The message of the \"heavenly host\" to the shepherds in the coun- tryside of Bethlehem was \"on earth peace, good will toward men.\" Peace in the world starts with peace in individual hearts. \"The peace 55"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"of God, which passeth all understanding\"* is the peace Jesus came to bring to man; it is the only sure foundation for world amity. It is found in the interiorized state of one's God-communion in meditation. Then, like an ever full reservoir, it pours out freely to one's family, friends, community, nation, and the world. If everyone lived the ideals exem- plified in the life of Jesus, having made those qualities a part of their own selves through meditation, a millennium of peace and brother- hood would come on earth. A person who is imbued with God's peace can feel naught but goodwill toward all. The crib of ordinary consciousness is very small, filled to capacity with self-love. The cradle of goodwill of Christ-love holds the Infinite Consciousness that includes all beings, all nations, all races and faiths as one. L egends abound concerning the worship of the infant Jesus by the \"wise men from the east.\" A common tradition is that they were magi (Hebrew chartumim; Greek magoi ), a priestly class of mystics among ancient Medes and Persians credited with esoteric powers and knowledge by which they were able to interpret hidden meanings in the scriptures and to read secrets of the past and divine the future. The Roman Church honored the Wise Men with the title of kings, based on Psalms 72:10 relevant to the future coming of the Messiah: \"The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Saba shall offer gifts.\" The kings are sainted by the Church and identified as Gaspar, Melchior, and Balthasar; relics of these kings are enshrined at Cologne. The Wise Men are presumed to be three in number, commensurate with the New Testament account of the offer- ing of three gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

But recent archaeological evidence has revealed a different environment,\" reports the PBS television documentary From Jesus to Christ (Frontline, 1998). In the early 1970s, archaeologists began to excavate the ruins of the ancient city of Sepphoris , the capital of Galilee, located less than four miles from Jesus' hometown of Nazareth—within an hour's walking distance. \"What the excavations at Sepphoris suggest,\" says Professor Holland L. Hendrix, president of Union Theological Seminary, \"is that Jesus was quite proximate to a thriving and sophisticated urban envi- ronment that would have brought with it all of the diversity of the Roman Empire.\" Professor D. P. Singhal writes in India and World Civilization (Michigan State Uni- versity Press, 1969, Vol. I): \"The traditional account of Christian origins concentrates almost exclusively on the incidents connected with the rise of Christianity, giving the impression that nothing else was happening at that time in the area. Actually the situ- ation was vastly different . It was a period of intense political activity and diverse reli- gious practices, and it would hardly be an overstatement to suggest that in every city and village in the Roman Empire there were activities, customs, and rituals that even- tually played a part in the moulding of Christianity.... \"Hinduism, though not a proselytizing religion, had also reached western Asia. A Hindu settlement was established in Armenia in the Canton of Taron in the second cen- tury B.C. under the patronage of King Valarasaces of the Arsacidae dynasty. These Hin- dus built fine cities and temples, but the temples were destroyed early in the fourth cen- tury by St. Gregory the Illuminator.\" Dr. Singhal cites the Syrian writer Zenob as saying that by \"early in the fourth century A.D. there were about five thousand followers of Krishna in Armenia.\" Dr. Singhal further avers: \"Jesus, no doubt, principally enlarged and transformed the Jewish conceptions but he did so in the light of personal experiences in a cosmo- politan area where a variety of cultures, including that of India, had intermingled to produce a distinct religious environment.\" (Publisher's Note) 57"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"miliar religious dogmas may well begin to crack and crumble. What is needed is a reunion of the science of religion with the spirit, or inspira- tion, of religion—the esoteric with the exoteric. The yoga science taught by Lord Krishna, which provides practical methods for actual inner ex- perience of God to supplant the feeble life-expectancy of beliefs, and the spirit of Christ-love and brotherhood preached by Jesus—the only sure panacea to prevent the world from tearing itself apart by its unyielding differences—are in tandem one and the same universal truth, taught by these two Christs of East and West, only with a variant outward empha- sis according to the times and conditions of their respective incarnations. The pages of this book invite the reader to reach back with the teachings of Jesus to the cradle of religion that has from ages unnum- bered been tended by Mother India, and thence to the universality of religion in God-realization. In the words of Jesus: \"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.\"* The great ones come to preserve and restate not the dogma and expedient customs of religion, but the eternal principles of truth enunciated from time to time by God-knowing prophets.

However, in The Story of the Magi (Bombay: Society of St. Paul, 1954), Henry Heras, S.J., Director of the Indian Histor- ical Research Institute, St. Xavier's College, Bombay, presents an extensive array of his- torical information to support the view that the Wise Men were in fact Hindu rishis from India. (Father Heras's work was held in high repute; he was honored by the Gov- ernment of India in 1981 with a commemorative stamp for his outstanding contribu- tion to historical research and archaeology.) According to Father Heras, in the Gospel the word magoi is not used to identify the Wise Men as Zoroastrian priests, \"for if that were so, all the patristic tradition would have acknowledged Persia as the country of the Magi, which is not the case....

Further- more, scholarly and Christian tradition agree that Christianity arrived on the western coast of India very shortly after the time of Jesus, reportedly brought in person by one of Christ's twelve apostles, Thomas, who spent the last years of his life in India. Father Heras quotes an ancient Christian tex t called the Opus Imperfectum in Mattheum, which \"locates the preaching of St. Thomas the Apostle in the land of the Magi. Ancient Oriental writers knew very well that India was the field of the ministry of this Apostle. St. Jerome writes that St. Thomas preache d the Gospel to the Magi and finally slept, that is died, in India.\" Father Heras points out: \"If therefore the Magi were rishis of India, the traditional land of wisdom, it is not to be wondered at that they offered gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the infant and his mother, since these were precisely the gifts that from the most ancient times were offered in India to the parents of the newly born....The cus- tom of offering thes e three gifts to the parents of the recently born does not now exist in Persia; nor do scholars know that any such custom ever existed in that country.\" Centuries-old traditions in Indi a itself refer to the Wise Men as having come from that land. Fernao do Queyroz, a seventeenth-century Portuguese Jesuit priest who lived in Goa (Portuguese colony on the west coast of India), cited the work of earlier histo- rians (Manuel dos Anjos and Jeronimo Osorio, both of the sixteenth century) who wrote that whe n the famous Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama reached India in May 1498, he found at Calicut on the western coast a Hindu temple dedicated to the Vir- gin Mary. According to these Portuguese historians, da Gama was told that the annals of the Malabar Kingdom relate that the temple was founded by Chery Perimale (\"Chera Perumal\"), an ancient emperor of Malabar who also founded the city of Cali- cut. Da Gama was informed that Perimale \"was a Brahmin, one of the wisest in India, and was one of the three Magi who went to Bethlehem\" to adore the baby Jesus; on his return to Calicut he had the temple erected. Another account is found in the writings of Joao De Barros, a sixteenth-century Portuguese historian, who mentions the Malabar tradition that a king from South In- dia named \"Pirimal\" went to Mascate and thence with others to Bethlehem to adore the infant Jesus.

Life energy and conscious- ness are magnetically drawn either upward to the higher spiritual centers in the brain (\"north\") or downward to the lower spinal centers associated with material conscious- ness (\"south\"). \"East\" an d \"west\" refer to the orientation of man's life and awareness either inward (\"east\") through the intuitive spiritual eye to perceptions of the subtle di- vine realms or outward (\"west\") through the senses to interaction with the gross mate- rial creation.

They knelt and offered their symbolic gifts. These were the traditional gifts given in India to the newborn; but they held further meaning coming from the Wise Men to Jesus: Gold (material treasure) is offered to a giver of wisdom as a symbol of appreciation of the great value of liberating truth bestowed by the spiritual teacher. Incense symbolizes devotion, the fragrance of the heart's love offered to the master who is a channel through whom God's guidance and blessings flow. The myrrh was in recognition of the bitter trial and sacrifice that would be required of Jesus in fulfill- ing his divine mission. On a transcendent level of consciousness, in which others could neither participate nor bear witness, there was a spiritual exchange of soul-communion concerning the destiny of Jesus, which would be of universal benefit to man—as Jesus would be one of God's supreme message-bearers of Truth.* \"•Among Westerners who concur that the Wise Men came from India is the great twentieth-century mystic and stigmatist Therese Neumann of Konnersreuth, Germany, who experienced weekly visions of Jesus' passion and crucifixion, the \"stations of the cross.\" (See Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 39.)

The companion of His Excellency wrote me as follows: 'Neither Therese nor the pastor knew of our coming....Therese had just witnessed the Station in which Simon of Cyrene appears and now, in a period of rest, was talking of what she had seen and heard....and repeated in Syrian (that is, Aramaic) the words \"Slan- lak Malka de Judae!\" (Hail, King of the Jews!) We were of course astounded at hear- ing these words. The Bishop, who belongs to the Syro-Malabarian Rite, repeated them, but Therese corrected his expression, saying: \"Perhaps you speak the words as they are written, but I heard them this way,\" and she repeated them. Thereupon we recognized the mistake we had made. We had used a short a in the last syllable of the first word, whereas it ought to be a long a, as Therese used it....After a few minutes Father Naber motioned to His Excellenc y to come close to the bed.

Either unknown or discountenanced by the general Christian populace are an- cient manuscripts that purport to relate anecdotes about the child Jesus. Titled simply as \"The Gospels of the Infancy of Jesus Christ\" (of which one is attributed to Jesus' disciple Thomas), these are referenced as in use and held sacred by some Christians, including the Gnostics, as early as the second century, and by other Christian sects in the following ages.* Time works on men's minds, especially on those removed from the instant of happening, to enhance or detract from the character of note- worthy personages and the events associated with their lives.

Yet who can gainsay that the charm and mys- tery of pulling the threads of truth from the fabric of legendary tellings does not produce a singular inspiration and awe ab- sent in the merely prosaic? India well understood this and cloaked her most sacred spiritual wealth and the godly givers of this treasure with symbology and a depth of meaningful mythology that has pre- served her scriptural principles and codes through- out generations of foreign domination and influence. Perhaps the voices from antiquity should not be altogether silenced by offhand dismissal from our mental consideration. Discriminative perusal, however, is cer- tainly warranted. Both innocent distortion and outright willful falsity are inevitable when truth is passed through the interpretations of suc- cessive generations, or even of individuals within a single generation, each of which finds it expedient to make it \"clearly understood\" ac- cording to what best suits the present time and purpose. This sorting out of fact from fiction to maintain the integrity of the Christian church and doctrine was clearly the intention of the early church fathers. The twenty-seven books of the New Testament that to- day constitute the Biblical account of the life and teaching of Jesus were gleaned by the early church from a much larger collection of texts.* Councils of the so-called learned were assembled to debate and determine holy doctrine from heresy. Propounders who were judged to be heretics scholars believe was derived from an earlier version in the Syriac language (a dialect of Aramaic). Some of the stories therein also appear in the Koran. The second Infancy Gospel included in Hone's book is a short fragment of The In- fancy Gospel of Thomas. A manuscript of this gospel that is more complete than what Hone reproduced was later discovered and is readily available in works by later schol- ars; indeed, much of the material in the Arabic Infancy Gospel is now thought to have come from the earlier Infancy Gospel of Thomas. The very early origins of the mate- rial in Thomas' text are attested to by a reference to them in writings by the church fa- ther Irenaeus in A.D. 185. Interestingly, Hone mentions the fact that in 1599 it was discovered that the Ara- bic Infancy Gospel was in use by a congregation of Nestorian Christians active in the mountains of Malabar on the coast of India. Traditionally, this is the area associated with the missionary activity of the apostle Thomas himself (see page 59 n.).

One wonders how honest an appraisal could be made by an individual member of one of these councils when not only their reputation but their very life depended on the favor of a political and religious hierarchy. William Hone, in The Apocryphal New Testament, cites a legendary telling—at which one must wonder—of events at the Council of Nicaea, convened by Emperor Constantine in A.D. 325, which recounts how some three hundred bishops, having \"promiscuously put all the books that were referred to the Council for determination under the commun- ion table in a church, they besought the Lord that the inspired writings might get upon the table, while the spurious ones remained underneath, and that it happened accordingly.\" In regard to the bishops assembled at this Council, annotator Hone remarks: \"The Emperor Constantine says, that what was approved by these bishops could be nothing less than the determination of God Himself; since the Holy Spirit residing in such great and worthy souls, unfolded to them the divine will. Yet Sabinus, the Bishop of Heraclea, affirms that 'excepting Constantine himself, and Eu- sebius Pamphilus, these were a set of illiterate simple creatures that un- derstood nothing.'\" One can hardly suppress at least a modicum of men- tal fraternity with the commentator John Jortin (1698-1770; archdeacon of London) who, we are told by Hone, in analyzing the authority of these General Councils wryly concluded: \"The Council held by the Apostles at Jerusalem [Acts 1] was the first and the last in which the Holy Spirit may be affirmed to have presided.\"* The influence of the dark age in which Jesus took incarnation, and which continued for several successive centuries, may well be faulted as providing a confounding background of ignorance and superstition that led the church fathers to exclude certain texts from the official canon of scripture. It is not altogether surprising that in attempting to early Christians had no shortage of stories about Jesus. They undoubtedly spoke often of their recently departed master, sharing all that they remembered of him with each other and anyone els e who was willing to listen. When it became evident that Jesus' memory could not be preserved forever by oral traditions dependent on the recollec- tions of first-hand witnesses, some of his followers decided to write down what they believed about him fo r posterity. According to the Gospel of Luke (1:1-4), 'many' an- cient writers endeavored 'to draw up an account' of the activities of Jesus. Although many of these account s did not ultimately become New Testament gospels, they are identified and described in the writings of numerous early Christian authors, such as Origen (Homily on Luke 1:1).\" (Publisher's Note) * John Jortin, Remarks on Ecclesiastical History, Vol. II. 68"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"define and preserve the memory and message of Jesus, believers were wont to err on the side of authenticating only those doctrines and texts that would best defend the new faith against contrary or diluting forces and secure the power of church hierarchy as the supreme keepers of the faith.

For centuries, the existence of many of the texts that were suppressed and destroyed was virtually unknown to scholars and believers alike. Some of them came to light in the famous discovery at Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945. Because of the Nag Hammadi discoveries, writes Elaine Pagels, Ph.D., professor of religion at Princeton University and a renowned scholar of early Christianity, \"we now begin to see that what we call Chris- tianity—and what we identify as Christian tradition—actually represents only a small selection of specific sources, chosen from among dozens of others.... \"By A.D. 200...Christianity had become an institution headed by a three-rank hi- erarchy of bishops, priests, and deacons, who understood themselves to be the guard- ians of the only 'true faith.'...The efforts of the majority to destroy every trace of heretical 'blasphemy' proved so successful that, until the discoveries at Nag Hammadi, nearly all our information concerning alternative forms of early Christianity came from the massive orthodox attack s upon them....Had they been discovered 1,000 years ear- lier, [these] texts almost certainly would have been burned for their heresy....

The spiritually exceptional is quite the norm for incarnate souls who are able to pierce the veils of deceptive maya and behold the Lord's creation from His perspective. How else may the devotee and seeker recognize and appreciate the inner divinity of a godly per- son, except that it be manifested and extolled in the uncommon fea- tures and acts that characterize that life. A \"miraculous\" life may be a subtle vibratory influence that has the power to uplift others from ignorance, or it may be dramatic demonstrations as employed by Jesus to rouse faith in the power and word of God. One of the difficulties encountered in Western perception of divin- ity is the mindset that one is either human or divine. If human, he is made in man's image and subject to all the flaws inherent Human as well as therein; if divine, he is made in God's image and must divine attributes evi- bear no hint of imperfection. But India's Vedic wis- denced in the lives dom, and especially Bhagavan Krishna's yoga science of avatars  in the Bhagavad Gita, quite reconciles human attrib- utes and divinity in those whose consciousness tran- scends the ordinary and realizes its oneness with God. As the very exis- tence of manifestation is the result of a complex formula of laws and forces activated by the catalyst of maya —the delusive factor that divides and differentiates the one consciousness of Spirit into diverse forms—a divine being cannot even assume and maintain a corporeal form without becoming subject to the principles that create and sustain manifestation. Thus the divine being undergoes the natural experiences associated with the limited instrumentality of the body and the effects of its environment, while at the same time his soul remains unbeclouded by the cosmic hyp- nosis of maya that stultifies the common man. The accounts in the Infancy Gospels concerning the acts of Jesus would not be considered at all surprising or unexpected by the Eastern mind. In referring to these texts, William Hone notes in the preface to his second edition of The Apocryphal New Testament that \"the legends of the Koran and the Hindoo Mythology are considerably connected with this volume. Many of the acts and miracles ascribed to the Indian God, Creeshna [Krishna], during his incarnation, are precisely the same with those attributed to Christ in his infancy by the Apocryphal Gospels, and are largely particularized by the Rev.

Thus even in childhood Jesus possessed great powers, akin to those he had manifested in his previ- ous incarnation as Elisha, presaging the miracles of his adult ministry that showed command over life and death and over natural laws that do not yield their fixity except at a divine command. In the Infancy Gospels, Jesus is said to have spoken to his mother, even from the cra- dle, declaring his divine descent and world mission. When, as was the custom, the infant on the fortieth day after birth was presented to God at the temple in Jerusalem, \"angels stood around him, adoring him, as a king's guard stands around him.\" When honored by the Wise Men from the East, Mary gave to them one of the swaddling clothes in which Jesus was wrapped; \"at the same time there appeared to them an angel in the form of that star which had been their guide in their journey.\" On their return to their own country, \"kings and princes came to them, enquiring what they had seen and done.\" They pro- duced the swaddling cloth, and according to custom prepared a fire and worshiped the cloth and cast it into the sacred flame. \"And when the fire was put out, they took forth the swaddling cloth unhurt, as much as if the fire had not touched it.\" When King Herod, fearing the prophecy of the birth in Bethlehem of an almighty king, ordered the death of all infants, and God warned Joseph to flee into Egypt with Mary and Jesus, sev- - • • eral miracles occurred in the land of their exile in Miracles ascribed to the presence of the holy child.

A woman is dispossessed of a devil; a bride struck dumb by sorcerers is healed when she takes the infant Jesus lovingly in her arms. So also, others are cured of infirmities, including leprosy and other ills, sometimes by pouring over their body the water that had been used to bathe the infant Jesus.

As the child emerges from infancy, he begins a more conscious wielding of his God-given powers. The legendary tellings might well be misconstrued as describing a child with powers over matter and life and death itself who is of a capricious, even petu- lant, nature, at whose command the elements obey. Certainly, in and of itself this literal acceptance of the tales would rightly doom them to the ash heap of heresy. Whatever vestiges of authenticity may breathe within these legends must be viewed in the light of the singular pur- pose for which saviors come to earth. No vindictive or arrogant intent motivates the actions of such a one. If indeed, according to the ac- counts, some persons were withered or struck blind or lifeless in their encounters with the child Jesus, it was through his command that some consequence from their past-life evils was thereby mitigated. Correspondingly, children who taunted Elisha were destroyed by bears summoned from the woods by the prophet, not as an act of wrath, but in recognition of a present cause providing the opportunity for the atonement and expiation of long-past evil actions—fruition of the law of karma, cause and effect, God's law of justice.* It is, in fact, noted in the scriptures of India that karmic justice dispensed by the hand of writes of a tradition traceable to Peter, third-century bishop of Alexandria, who pur- portedly said that \"th e place in Egypt where Christ was banished is now called Matarea, about ten miles beyond Cairo; that the inhabitants constantly burn a lamp in remembrance of it; and that there is a garden of trees yielding a balsam, which were planted by Christ when a boy.\" (The Infancy Gospel itself refers to the balsam trees as having grown on that site after Mary washed Jesus' clothes there in a spring that gushed forth at the command of the divine child.) * \"It is written in the Bible (II Kings 2:24) that a crowd of children ridiculed the prophet Elisha. He then 'cursed them in the name of the Lord. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.' As a prophet of God, Elisha was acting as His instrument. The curse was karmically ordained through God's law; hence Elisha cannot be accused of causing the mutilation of the children. They suffered because of their own wickedness—the accumulation of their wrong thoughts and actions of past lives. Their seemingly childish taunting was the timely fruition of their past evil, which precipitated its inevitable consequence. The 'curse' that issued forth from the instrumental Elisha was the 'high voltage' of his spir- itual vibration, operating with no selfish intent to harm. \"If a man disregards a warning not to touch a live wire and is electrocuted, it is not the live wire but the man's foolishness that is responsible for his death. The same truth applies in the case of the wicked children who mocked Elisha.

Life and death, animate and inanimate matter, were all seen by the child Jesus as manipulatable vibrations of God's consciousness. We are told he formed sparrows from mud scooped from ponds after a rain- storm; and when chastised for such action on the Sabbath, he gave life to the birds and bade them fly away. More often than not, those who suffered death or affliction at his command were restored by him to life and health, just as later in his ministry he withdrew life from the fig tree and caused it to wither and restored life to Lazarus and raised him from the dead.

And presently it would become as Joseph would have it.\" After two years of labor on a commissioned throne for the ruler of Jerusalem, the seat was found to be lacking \"two spans on each side, of the appointed measure.\" The king was angry and Joseph fearful; whereupon Jesus directed his father to pull on one side while he pulled on the opposite.* And when \"each of them had with strength drawn his side, the throne obeyed, and was brought to the proper dimension of the place: which miracle when they who stood by saw, they were astonished, and praised God.\" (This was as elementary for Jesus as later it would be for him to change water into wine, or to multiply the loaves and fishes. )f * \"King\" is most likely a reference to Archelaus, ruler until A.D. 6.

Attempts at schooling by competent teachers met with frustration and even dis- grace for these scholars.

Quickly absorbing all knowledge, he is reputed to have recited from memory the entire Vedas as well as the more than 100,000 verses of the Mahabharata, having heard them from his father, Vyasa. Of exceptional renown is the sainted Swami Shankara, often ex- tolled as India's greatest philosopher. The annals surrounding him re- late that within his first year he was proficient in languages; by age two he could read; having once heard something he could recall it, and absorb its meaning intuitively. By the age of eight he had mastered the Vedas and completed his formal education—having become a wisdom 75"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"expert in all the holy scriptures, writings, and six systems of Hindu philosophy. He preached throughout India his Advaita (non-dualistic) philosophy. The very best of the learned could not match him in de- bate. By sixteen he had completed writing his extensive commentaries, which are veritably revered to this day by scholars. He reorganized the monastic Order of Swamis, of which he is known as Adi (\"the first\") Shankaracharya, head of this sacred tradition of sannyasis. Having completed his work, he died at the age of thirty-two. As told in the Biblical gospel of Luke, Jesus in his twelfth year, hav- ing been missing for three days is at last found in the temple at Jerusalem discoursing with the learned doctors and elders. One final amplification of this temple scene from the apocryphal Infancy Gospels might be noted; its recounting by the early Christians an attempt, no doubt, to express the awe and reverence they felt that Jesus was vested not only with heavenly wisdom, but earthly profundity as well. \"A certain principal rabbi asked him, Hast thou read books? Jesus answered he had read both books and the things which were contained in books. And he explained to them the books of the law, and precepts, and statutes, and the mysteries which are contained in the books of the prophets; things which the mind of no creature could reach.... \"When a certain astronomer, who was present, asked the Lord Jesus, Whether he had studied astronomy? The Lord Jesus replied, and told him the number of the spheres and heavenly bodies, as also their triangular, square, and sextile aspect; their progressive and retrograde motion; their size and several prognostications; and other things, which the reason of man had never discovered. \"There was also among them a philosopher well skilled in physic and natural philosophy, who asked the Lord Jesus, whether he had studied physic?\" Here the reply attributed to Jesus transforms the young child into what might be seen as a hoary rishi reciting yoga philosophy from the Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita: \"He replied, and explained to him physics and metaphysics, and also those things which were above and below the power of nature; the powers also of the body, its humors and their effects; also the number of its members, and bones, veins, arteries, and nerves; the several con- stitutions of the body, hot and dry, cold and moist, and the tendencies of them. How the soul operated upon the body; what its various sen- sations and faculties were; the faculty of speaking, anger, desire.

Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?\" In setting Jesus apart as one who is to be venerated but whose per- fection cannot be emulated, the majority of his followers pay only to- ken notice to the example of renunciation that he —— lived and preached: Seek ye first the kingdom of \"I must be about my God; sell that thou hast and give to the poor and Father's business\": follow me; take no thought for your life, what ye Jesus' ideal of shall eat, or what ye shall drink, nor yet for your renunciation body, what ye shall put on; who is my mother or my brethren save whosoever shall do the will of God; follow me and let the dead bury the dead; the foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head; whosoever that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disci- ple. Lofty admonitions! But all who have stood in purity before the omnipresence of God know that without letting go of corporeal at- tachments in one's consciousness—to which outer renunciation is an aid if not an absolute condition—there is no possibility of possessing the Infinite. Though Jesus stressed complete renunciation, he also said, \"Love thy neighbour,\" which means work for all—and this, while you \"Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.\" The perfect life of Jesus, even at such a tender age, brings forth a perfect utterance as to how a divine child, consecrated to serve hu- manity, behaves. Knowing himself as a son of God, he states outright that his highest duty is to look after the celestial business of spreading the kingdom of his Heavenly Father. His caring parents had no cause to worry for him who was protected by the King of kings. It was the first public hint by Jesus to his parents as to what they would have to expect about what his life was to be. Jesus knew that parental love and affection, being blindly com- pulsive, might demand from him greater attention to his earthly father's occupation than to the work of his Heavenly Father, for which he came on earth. With the innocence of a divine audacity Jesus remonstrates 77"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"that his parents should know this, and should wish for him to be busy with God's work. The world, busy with all its busy-ness, little under- stands, as Jesus' parents did not, the supreme focus of one who knows there is no greater duty than one's duty to God. The Mahabharata says that if one duty contradicts another, then it is not duty, but something to be avoided. Spiritual and material duties should not contradict, but rather complement one another. If contradiction occurs, those duties are incomplete and should be modified so that instead of contending against each other they work together like two stallions, pulling the car of life harmoniously and uniformly to one happy goal. ——  The ordinary man thinks of the world, his fam- Spiritual and material ily, and his work as his business; but the spiritual duties should com- man knows that duties to parents, children, family plement one another ties, the business world, and all else are to be car- ried out as servic e to God. Everyone should help to maintain the well-being of the world by a universal consciousness of love and service, rather than as a selfish man whose actions are com- pelled and actuated by instinctive blood ties and greed. Business should be spiritualized; everything should be done with the consciousness of God within. Man should endeavor in his works to please God by harmonizing all things with His ideals. Business that conforms with God's divine laws is of lasting benefit to mankind. Moneymaking enterprises that cater only to human luxury, and to false or evil propensities, are bound to be destroyed by the working of the divine law of the survival of the worthiest. Any business that harms the real spiritual comfort of people does no real service, and is bound to meet with destruction by the very nature of its activities. A successful life must be begun with spiritual culture, for all ma- terial and moral actions are governed by spiritual laws. Noble parents, lovers of God, should wish the first interest of their children to be in God's business. They should start their children on the right road in life by showing them the way to be proficient in contacting God and in doing all things with God-consciousness. A life can be successful, healthy, and complete—balanced wit h wisdom and happiness—when activity is guided by God's inner, intuitive direction. In expressing the proper attitude toward his parents—that though duty to parents is important, it is secondary to one's first and foremost duty to the Heavenly Father—Jesus spoke not only of his own divine dis- pensation, but the trut h that every man should remember: \"God first.\" 78"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"DISCOURSE 5 Tlie Unk HOWE JLeairs Jesuis ?

We are told only: And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man. For the contemporaries of such an extraordinary figure to find nothing noteworthy to record from his childhood to his thirtieth year is in and of itself extraordinary. Remarkable accounts, however, do exist, not in the land of Jesus' birth but farther east where he spent most of the unaccounted-for years. Hidden away in a Tibetan monastery priceless records lie. They speak of a Saint Issa from Israel \"in whom was manifest the soul of the universe\"; who from the age of fourteen to twenty-eight was in In- dia and regions of the Himalayas among the saints, monks, and pun- dits; who preached his message throughout that area and then re- turned to teach in his native land, where he was treated vilely, condemned, and put to death.

It was midst the natural grandeur of Kashmir a Tibetan monastery that he heard stories about a Saint Issa, the details of which left no doubt in him that Issa and Jesus Christ were one and the same person. He learned that copies of ancient manuscripts pre- served in some Tibetan monasteries contained a record of Issa's years of sojourn in India , Nepal, and Tibet. Undeterred by hazards and ob- stacles, he journeyed northward, finally arriving at the Himis monastery outside of Leh, the capital city of Ladakh, which he was told possessed a copy of the sacred books about Issa. Though he was received graciously, he did not gain access to the manuscripts. A dis- appointed Notovitch turned back toward India; but in a near-fatal mishap on the treacherous mountain pass, his leg was broken in a fall. Seizing this as an opportunity for a second attempt to see the sacred books, he asked to be carried back to Himis to receive the necessary care. This time, after repeated requests, the books were brought to him. Perhaps the lamas now felt obliged to treat as hospitably as pos- sible their stricken guest—a time-honored tradition in the East. With the help of an interpreter, he meticulously copied the contents of the pages pertinent to Jesus as they were read to him by the head lama. Returning to Europe, Notovitch found that his enthusiasm for the discovery was not shared by the Western Christian orthodoxy, which was loath to support such a radical revelation. So he published his notes himself in 1894 under the title The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ. In his publication, he urged that a qualified research team be dispatched to view and judge for itself the value of these previously se- creted documents. Though Notovitch's claims were challenged by crit- ics in America and Europe, the accuracy of his account was attested to by at least two other reputable persons who journeyed to Tibet to seek out and ascertain the authenticity of these manuscripts. In 1922, Swami Abhedananda, a direct disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahansa, visited the Himis Monastery, and confirmed all of the salient details about Issa published in Notovitch's book.* * Swami Abhedananda (1866-1939) was vice president of Ramakrishna Math and Mission from 1911 to 1924.

Afterwards we saw how widely spread in India, in Ladak and in Central Asia, was the legend of the visit of Christ to these parts during his long absence, quoted in the Gospel.\"f Answering the critics who had claimed that Notovitch's story was a fabrication, Roerich writes: \"There are always those who love scorn- fully to deny when something difficult enters their consciousness....

Ac- cording to the Tibetan manuscripts, it was not long Jesus' journey to India, after this that Jesus left his home in order to avoid motherland of religion plans for his betrothal as he reached maturity — which for an Israelite boy at that time was thirteen years of age. Certainly Jesus was above the commonality of marriage. Of what necessity was human love and family ties for one who pos- sessed supreme ardor for God and a universal love that embraced all human beings? The world urges a conformity to its pedestrian course, until 1921. While there, he had read Notovitch's book; and in 1922 he visited the Himis Monastery.

Gnostic mysti- cism had come to the Jews from the East, from India and Persia and Babylon; it had appealed t o them in their Babylonian captivity, and they had brought much of it back home with them in the Return.... \"Lest we should undervaluate Gnosticism because its terms, symbols, and vocabulary differ so from ours, it should be stated that Gnosticism was Egyptian Christianity for the two hundred years that the leaders of the new faith were working out its theology. It was gradually pushed out by orthodox Catholic Christianity and its books were burned. Sim- ilarly, Essenism was the early form of Palestinian Christianity.... At Qumran and at Cheno- boskion [Nag Hammadi], hidden for centuries, were the great libraries of these early forms of Christianity, which no w so suddenly and dramatically have been restored to us.

He openly denounced their practices of caste big- otry; many of the priestly rituals; and the emphasis on worship of many gods in idolic form rather than sole reverence for the one Supreme Spirit, the pure monotheistic essence of Hinduism which had become obscured by outer ritualistic concepts. Distancing himself from these disputes, Jesus left Puri. He spent the next six years with the Sakya Buddhist sect in the Himalayan moun- tainous regions of Nepal and Tibet. This Buddhist sect was monotheis- tic, having separated itself from the distorted Hinduism that prevailed during the dark age of Kali Yuga.* Though true God-realized masters have arisen in India in every age, preserving from generation to generation the eternal truths of Spirit ( Sanatana Dharma ), the outward religious practices of the masses have undergone cycles of progress and degradation as have the religions of other lands and cultures. According to my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar, the most recent descending and ascending Dark Ages (Kali Yuga) lasted from about 700 B.C. to A.D. 1700. In India, this period saw the gradual per- version and loss of the sublime spiritual science of the Vedas and Upa- nishads, resulting in priestly adherence to a number of misunderstood precepts falsely held to be taught by the scriptures. It was during this time of spiritual darknes s that the avatar Gautama Buddha took in- carnation in India (c. 563 B.C.), to right some of the gross abuses of a \"J\" but with an \"I,\" as in Latin and Greek (Iesous). Even today, in Spanish, though spelled with a \"J,\" Jesus is pronounced \"Hay-soos.\" The Biblical account, given in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew (see Discourse 2), is that both Mary and Joseph were instructed by an angel that the divine child was to be named Yeshua, \"savior\" (in Greek, Iesous; in English, Jesus): \"...thou shah call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins\" (Matthew 1:21). The Hebrew word Yeshua is a contraction of Yehoshua, \"Yahweh (Jehovah, the Creator ) is salva- tion.\" However, the language of daily use for Jesus and his fellow Galileans was not Hebrew, but the relate d dialect Aramaic, in which his name would have been pro- nounced \"Eshu.\" Thus, strangely enough, the name predicted for Jesus by the angel, and given to him by his family, was remarkably akin to the more ancient Sanskrit name bestowed by the Wise Men. Aside from the phonetic similarities, there is an underly- ing unity of meaning of the words Isha and Yeshua —the two appellations bestowed on the one revered by millions as \"Lord and Savior.\" (Publisher's Note) *The yugas, or world cycles of civilization, are explained in Discourse 39.

His message of compassion for all beings and his Noble Eightfold Path taught how to escape misery and free oneself from the karmic wheel of birth and death.* The Tibetan scrolls relate that while among the Buddhists, Jesus applied himself to the study of their sacred books and could perfectly expound from them. Apparently around age twenty-six or twenty- eight, he preached his message abroad as he wended his way back to Israel through Persia and adjacent countries, encountering fame from the populace and animosity from the Zoroastrian and other priestly classes. All this is not to say that Jesus learned everything he taught from his spiritual mentors and associates in India and surrounding regions. Avatars come with their own endowment of wisdom. Jesus' store of divine realization was merely awakened and molded to fit his unique mission by his sojourn among the Hindu pundits, Buddhist monks, and particularly the great masters of yoga from whom he received ini- tiation in the esoteric science of God-union through meditation. From the knowledge he had gleaned, and from the wisdom brought forth from his soul in deep meditation, he distilled for the masses simple parables of the ideal principles by which to govern one's life in the sight of God.

Buddha, however, meant extinction of the deluded ego, or pseudoself; the little self must he overcome in order that the real, eternal Self may achieve liberation from human incarnation. This perversion of Buddha's doctrine, with its emphasis on a nega- tive state of nonbeing (extinction), was later supplanted in India by the doctrine of Swami Shankara, founder o f the time-honored monastic Swami Order, who taught that the goal of life is the positive attainment of the ever-conscious, ever-existing, ever-newly blissful state of onenes s with Spirit. 87"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"just a few years after the death of Jesus. This was the language of the Buddhists of that day. When reports reached India through traders from Jerusalem of the ignominious death of Isa, the holy one who had been held in such reverential regard by their community during his time among them, they set about to record his history as a part of their sacred annals. The Buddhistic perspective is quite naturally evident in their accounts. If Jesus himself had written his life history and the substance of his teachings, they would have been expressed significantly differently than what has come down to this present day. With all the best efforts of those who related and recorded the events of Jesus' life, the view of each narrator was bound to have been somewhat influenced by his own background, be it of a Jewish, Gnostic, Greek, Roman, Buddhist, Zoroastrian, or any other religious persuasion or cultural bias—not to mention the additional assault of translation from one language to another, sometimes passing through many transitions. The manuscripts published by Notovitch, for example, were writ- ten originally in Pali, having been gathered from eyewitnesses or hearsay-tellings of persons from various linguistic and regional back- grounds and then translated into Pali. The manuscripts then made their way from India to Nepal and thence to Lhasa in Tibet where they were translated into Tibetan and eventually copied for various major monasteries. Notovitch, a Russian, copied the Tibetan pages with the assistance of a translator, eventually published them in French, and that edition was subsequently translated and published in English. Nevertheless, the overall value of these records is inestimable in a search for the historical Jesus. There are two ways to know an avatar. First, to glimpse his essence that shines through a melange of fact, leg- end, innocent or purposeful distortion; and by discriminatively sifting the significant from the unimportant, just as a person is recognized for himself apart from the accoutrements he wears. And second, to have direct knowledge of a great one through intuitive divine communion with that soul — as many through the centuries have known Jesus Christ, such as Saint Francis of Assisi to whom Jesus appeared nightly in flesh and blood, Saint Teresa of Avila, and many others of the Chris- tian faith; and such as Sri Ramakrishna of the Hindu faith, and I also who have been many times in the manifested presence of Jesus.

This great Christ, radiating the spiritual strength and power of the Orient to the West, is a divine liaison to unite God-loving peoples of East and West. Truth is not the monopoly of the Orient or the Occident. The pure silver-gold rays of sunlight appear to be red or blue when observed through red or blue glass. So, also, truth only appears to be different when colored by an Oriental or Occidental civilization. In looking at the simple essence of truth expressed by the great ones of various times and climes, one finds very little difference in their messages. What I received from my Gur u and the venerated masters of India I find the same as that which I have received from the teachings of Jesus the Christ. It amuses me when my Western brothers ask: \"Do you believe in Christ?\" I always say: \"Jesus the Christ\"—Jesus the divine son of man in whom was manifested the Christ Consciousness, the Son of God.

He has been Westernized too much.* Jesus was an Oriental, by birth and blood and training.

Most of the writings use Christian terminology, unmistakably related to a Jewish heritage. Many claim to offer traditions about Jesus that are secret, hidden from 'the many' who constitute what, in the second century, came to be called the 'catholic church.' These Christians are now calle d gnostics, from the Greek word gnosis, usually translated as 'knowledge.' For as those who claim to know nothing about ultimate reality are called agnostic (literally, 'not-knowing'), the person who does claim to know such things is called gnostic ('knowing'). But gnosis is not primarily rational knowledge.... As the gnostics use the term, we could translate it as 'insight,' for gnosis involves an intuitive process of knowing oneself....[According to gnostic teachers,] to know oneself, at the deepest level, is simultaneously to know God; this is the secret of gnosis.... \"The 'living Jesus' o f these texts speaks of illusion and enlightenment, not of sin and repentance, like the Jesus of the New Testament. Instead of coming to save us from sin, he comes as a guide who opens access to spiritual understanding.... \"Orthodox Christians believe that Jesus is Lord and Son of God in a unique way: he remains forever distinct from the rest of humanity whom he came to save. Yet the gnostic Gospel of Thomas relates that as soon as Thomas recognizes him, Jesus says to Thomas that they have both received their being from the same source: 'I am not your master. Because you have drunk, you have become drunk from the bubbling stream which I have measured out....He who will drink from my mouth will become as I am: I myself shall become he, and the things that are hidden will be revealed to him.' \"Does not such teaching—the identity of the divine and human, the concern with illusion and enlightenment, the founder who is presented not as Lord, but as spiritual guide—sound more Eastern than Western?...Could Hindu or Buddhist tradition have influenced gnosticism?...Ideas that we associate with Eastern religions emerged in the first century through the gnostic movement in the West, but they were suppressed and condemned by polemicists like Irenaeus.\" (Publisher's Note) 90"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"turing in the Orient, he had to use the medium of Oriental civiliza- tion, customs, mannerisms, language, parables, in spreading his mes- sage. Hence to understand Jesus Christ and his teachings one must be sympathetically open to the Oriental point of view—in particular, In- dia's ancient and present civilization, religious scriptures, traditions, philosophies, spiritual beliefs, and intuitive metaphysical experiences. Though, esoterically understood, the teachings of Jesus are universal, they are saturated with the essence of Oriental culture — rooted in Oriental influences which have been made adaptable to the Western environment. The Gospels can be rightly understood in the light of the teach- ings of India—not the caste-ridden, stone-worshiping, distorted in- terpretations of Hinduism, but the philosophical, soul-saving wisdom of her rishis: the kernel not the husk of the Vedas, Upanishads, and Bhagavad Gita. This essence of Truth — the Sanatana Dharma, or eternal principles of righteousness that uphold man and the universe —was given to the world thousands of years before the Christian era, and preserved in India with a spiritual vitality that has made the quest for God the be-al l and end-all of life and not an armchair diversion. In spite of the meaningless superstitions and pitiful provincialism in religious thinking that have crusted on both Hinduism and Chris- tianity down the ages, each of them has done immeasurable good to mankind—each has brought peace, happiness, consolation to millions of suffering souls; each has inspired people to highest spiritual en- deavor and granted salvation to many.

In order to un- derstand Christ-ianity—that is, the pure teachings of Jesus—one must first take away its Western crust, and then its Oriental crust. Behind the two opaque coverings lies the universality of true Christianity. Occidental Christianity is the outer crust, and Oriental Chris- tianity is the inner crust. The Oriental Christ always emphasized: \"Take no heed for the body, what ye shall eat, what ye shall wear. Bread, the men of the world seek after; seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things will be added unto you.\" The proposition of the 91"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Occidental Christian is instead: \"Take heed of the body first, that in a healthy body temple ye may find God. Bread, ye men of the world, seek first—and afterwards, seek the kingdom of God.\" In the warm Oriental climate, in a bygone age, \"bread,\" clothing, and shelter were simpler and attainable without much effort; thus there was more freedom to meditate on God in leisure and solitude. In the Occident, however, with its artificially high standard of living, one has to think and work for these material necessities, hard and fast and successfully, or he will have no time at all, or strength, to seek the kingdom of God. The universal teachings of Jesus Christ should be judiciously adapted according to the respective needs of the Oriental and Occiden- tal—emphasizing the principles of Christian religion, and omitting the nonessential forms added to them from time to time. Great care should be taken, however, to embody the essential, living Christianity while it is being transplanted from Oriental atmosphere to Occidental environ- ment. Otherwise, it would happen that, as some doctors say, \"the op- eration was successful,\" but the patient peacefully died on the table! No difference should be made between Occidental religious methods of sal- vation and the Oriental technique of salvation. The only distinction to be made is between true Christ-principles and dogma-bound beliefs. Oriental Christ-ianity would consider the exoteric practices of churchgoing, sermonizing, theological study of scriptures, as spiritual kindergarten work. The purpose of these would be to emphasize and support the necessity of \"university-level\" testing of religious beliefs in the laboratory of scientific esoteric meditation, under the direction of a Self-realized guide who through deep spiritual effort has found God in the light of his own intuitive soul-perception. While Western Chris- tianity has saved its civilization from a plenary slide into atheism and immorality, it has accomplished relatively little to awaken the desire, and the faith that it is possible, to attain personal metaphysical experi- ence of God, evolved out of the self-effort of scientific meditation. The community religious services of the West are marvelous if they turn the mind to God and truth, but they are not enough if they lack meditation and knowledge of the methods of actual communion with God. On the other hand, the East emphasizes direct, personal re- alization of God, but is wanting in organization and philanthropic so- cial welfare work.

It is not the religious denomination meaning in which one's name is registered, nor the culture or creed in which one was born, that gives salvation. The essence of truth goes beyond all outer form. It is that essence which is paramount in understanding Jesus and his universal call to souls to enter the king- dom of God, which is \"within you.\" The great message of Jesus Christ is living and thriving in both East and West. The West has concentrated on perfecting the physical conditions of man, and the East on developing the spiritual potentials of man. Both East and West are one-sided. Granted, the East is not practical enough; but the West is too practical to be spiritually practi- cal! That is why I advocate a harmonious union of the two; they need each other. Without spiritual idealism, material practicality is the har- binger of selfishness, sin , competition, and wars. This is a lesson for the West to learn. And unless idealism is tempered with practicality, there is confusion an d suffering and lack of natural progress. This is the lesson to be learned by the East. The East can learn from the West, and the West can learn from the East. Is it not strange that, perhaps due to God's secret plan, since the East needs material development, it was invaded by Western material civilization? And since the West needs spiritual balance, it has been silently but surely \"invaded\" by Hindu philosophy, not to conquer lands but to conquer souls with the liberation of God-realization.* *The following was written in 1932. by Dr. W.

A holy man of the desert solitudes, subsisting John the Baptist: fore- on wild honey and the fruit of locust trees, John en- runner of the Christ gaged himself in the mysteries and meditations of an Incarnate  anchorite, awaiting Jesus to proclaim himself ready to begin his ministry. Many believe that John was associated with the Essenes and their ascetic and esoteric practices; in- cluded among their ceremonies was baptism for purification of the body and spirit.f When John made himself known in the environs of Judea, crowds followed him as a saint and prophet. His renown made Tor this entire group of verses, cf. parallel references in Mark 1:1-8 and Luke 3:1-18. See Discourse 56, page 1099, for commentary on verse 12. tSee Luke 1:80, Discourse 2: \"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.\" The Bible gives no further infor- mation on the childhood and youth of John the Baptist. The Essenes were an ascetical Jewish sect extant from about 150 B.C. until the end of the first century A.D. The Jew- ish historian Flavius Josephus (c. A.D. 37-100) describes the Essenes in his Antiquities of the Jews (Book 18, Chap. 1, No. 2). The Roman scholar Pliny the Elder (A.D. 23- 79) wrote that th e Essenes lived near the Dead Sea in the hills above Ein Gedi (where in 1998 Israeli archaeologists excavated what are believed to be ruins of an Essene community). Many similarities exist between what historians know of the Essene way of life and tha t of John the Baptist described in the Gospels. In addition to purificatory baptism by water, there is also evidence that they adhered to a vegetarian diet. They maintained monastic-like communities in the desert in order to separate themselves from what they saw as the corrupt and worldly practices of the priests and populace. \"The Essene, like the Indian yogi, sought to obtain divine union and the 'gifts of the Spirit' by solitary reveri e in retired spots,\" wrote archaeologist Arthur Lillie in India in Primitive Christianity (London: K. Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1909). Historian D. P. Singhal writes in India and World Civilization (Michigan State University Press, 1969): \"Numer- ous authorities, such as Hilgenfeld and Renan, maintain that there was Buddhist influence on the Essene doctrines. And it was through this Jewish sect that Buddhist influences reached Palestine and later filtered through to Christianity....The life led by the Essenes,\" he says (quoting historian Sir Charles Eliot in Hinduism and Buddhism: An Historical Sketch) \"was 'just as might have been evolved by seekers after truth who were trying to put into practice in another country the religious ideals of India.'\" (Publisher's Note) 100"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"it possible for him to fulfill worthily his part in Jesus' destiny, a pattern set in their previous relationship as Elijah and Elisha.* One of God's grand illusions is the screening of one incarnation from another. Without this partitioning, no actor on the stage of life would be able to cope with his kaleidoscopic identity and its relation- ships with others, and with his place in the karmic cause-and-effect events whirling around him—a dizzying conflict of countless incar- nations with their interpersonal relationships branching off into their own limitless previous existences and experiences. By wiping clean the memory slate of each new lifetime, there is a freshness and a degree of progressive order maintained in the cosmic drama. The Hindu scriptures refer to creation as God's lila, a delusive phantasmagoria for man's entertainment through interaction with the workings of the Cosmic Creator. Without a perception of believabil- ity in each actor's part, the drama would soon lose its charm and come to a close. Thus even those of high spiritual estate accept the \"reality\" of their present position, dissociated outwardly from identity with their previous roles lest their overlay unduly influence and character- ize their new dramatic portrayal. God-realized and liberated souls can well remember previous enactments if they choose to do so; but for the effectiveness of the earthly theatrics, they fully submit themselves to God's direction for their part in an unfolding new scene. This is in evidence in the following verses concerning the statement of John the Baptist about his identity: And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, \"Who art thou?\" And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, \"I am not the Christ.\" And they asked him, \"What then?

HPhe priests and Levites, with only ordinary perception, were nat- urally unable to discern the qualities of a Christ. Wise men would not need to question a Christlike person, but would at once rec- ognize his spiritual aura. By asking John if he were the expected Christ, the Pharisees revealed their spiritual ignorance. John disavowed them of any notion that he was the foreordained Christ they sought. In spite of his greatness he did not see himself as one who had expressed Christ Consciousness. Why John denied that Though he had attained that consciousness as Eli- he was Elijah jah, yet owing to his acceptance of and delusive identification with his role as a lesser figure, he spoke the truth relative to his present life that the potential Christ in him was not manifest in his outward human consciousness. That is why John affirmed: \"I am not the Christ.\" John also denied that he was Elijah, because he chose not to re- member his previous exalted incarnation as that prophet. It was not part of John's role that he extol himself, but rather in absolute subju- gation of the eg o to portray a somewhat \"fallen\" spiritual state in which he could rightly declare, \"I am not Elijah.\" Therefore John gave an evasive answer when he was asked: \"Who art thou, that we may give an answer to them that sent us?\" His reply meant: \"I am the voice, or Cosmic Sound, crying or vibrat- ing in the wilderness of silence.\"* Wilderness signifies the conscious- ness of a saint wherein no verdure of fresh material desires can grow.

By his words John turned the minds of the multitude from himself to the Christ Savior whose special dispensation he had come to herald, and to witness and support. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.

Just as the electric current from a dynamo pervades the lightbulbs of a city, so the Cosmic Light manifests itself in the stones, the grass, the animals, the air, the thermal and electric currents; and enlivens every human being. John experienced and bore witness to that Light. In his incarnate consciousness he was not ac- tively manifesting oneness with the whole Cosmic Light, but rather knew himself as an individualized expression of it. He came to bear witness of that All-Pervading Light and of its immanent radiant power of Christ Consciousness that would be evidenced in the Lord Jesus.* *The above reference to John the Baptist by the apostle John served as both a factual record of the role of the Baptist and also as a metaphorical medium to express esoter- ically, in the context of the opening verses of the Gospel According to St. John, the un- derlying spiritual nature of the coming-forth and subsistence of God's creation.

W hen Jesus came to John asking to be baptized, John affirmed his inferior position, an incarnation of lesser prominence in the cosmic drama. With what artless humility, the hallmark of godliness, John had set aside his former preeminence — declaring himself un- worthy to baptize Jesus, and that he himself rather Guru-disciple relation- had need to be baptized. Certainly Jesus, a master, ship: the way of \"all was far above the need for ritualistic baptism, es- righteousness\" pecially by anyone of far lesser spiritual stature. A doctor of philosophy does not take lessons from a child engaged in elementary studies. Jesus, recognizing the divine in- strumentality of his past-life guru, therefore gave no credence to John's statement; rather he said: \"Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.\" These words speak volumes of Jesus' reverential regard for John, of whom he was later to proclaim, \"Ver- ily I say unto you, among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist.\"* In receiving baptism from John, Jesus not only honored in the eyes of the masses the ancient, pre-Christian, Hindu custom of bap- tism in holy waters, but also the tradition of initiation that uniquely distinguishes the guru-disciple relationship, the divine law through which \"all righteousness\" (truth and salvation) is bestowed on the dis- ciple by a God-ordained master. Jesus came to John for that spiritual anointing, an avowal of reverence for his guru from whom he had re- ceived \"a double portion of Spirit\" in their incarnations as Elijah and Elisha. The relationship of guru and disciple is not for one incarnation only. A guru, being the agent of salvation appointed by God, must take the disciple through successive incarnations, if necessary, until complete liberation of the disciple is reached.

This is why Jesus said, \"Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteous- ness.\" Though John and Jesus both knew that Jesus was far beyond the need for this outer ritual, they were quite sincerely enacting the necessary formalities in setting the right example for the world.* Words may be easily forgotten or distorted; the erudition of acts is far more indelible. John's declaration to the priests and Levites, \"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me...shall bap- tize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire,\" introduces a doctrine crucial to the attainment of salvation: that the real baptism consists of spiritual initiation bestowed by a true guru. Even though John said he baptized the masses with water, he did not say he was incapable of baptizing with Spirit, only that such initiation would be the preroga- tive of the Christ who by special dispensation would come to be their savior, or guru. In fact, it was the true baptism of Spirit that was be- stowed on Jesus when, after immersion in the Jordan (purification by water), \"the heavens were opened unto him.\" As John himself wit- nessed: \"I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him\" (John 1:32). If John were an ordinary man, he would not have seen the Spirit descending on Jesus. He himself was in tune with Spirit, but with unfeigned humbleness deflected attention from himself to the preeminence of Jesus. It is by the grace of the guru that heavenly consciousness unfolds to the initiated disciple, revealing the light of the omniscient spiritual eye, symbolized by the dove—through this medium one ascends from * \"Whatever a superior being does, inferior persons imitate. His actions set a standard for people of the world\" (God Talks With Arjutia: The Bhagavad Gita 111:21). 105"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"the body to Spirit through the Holy Ghost, the Christ Consciousness \"only begotten Son,\" and Cosmic Consciousness, or God the Father. ^T^he various processes of baptism and their corresponding effects ^L or spiritual states should be explained. The ritual of baptism by immersion in water originated in India, which laid stress on purification of the body precedent to the purifi- cation of the mind. Students who sought instruc- Different types of tion in the spiritual life from a holy man had first baptism  to purify their bodies by bathing, which in itself was the beginning of cleansing the mind, by show- ing proper respect to the teacher, and by interiorizing the thoughts in expectation of the blessings and the value of the lessons to be received. \"Cleanliness is next to godliness\" is a worthwhile first lesson. Immer- sion in water opens the pores of the skin, letting out disturbing body poisons and calming and soothing the circulatory system. Water cools the nerve endings and sends reports of calm sensations throughout the vital centers of the body, balancing evenly all the vital energies. Life came initially from energy, then from nebulae, then from wa- ter. All seeds of life are irrevocably connected with water. Physical life cannot exist without it. One who bathes every day and meditates im- mediately thereafter will feel the power of \"baptism\" by water. To bathe with the consciousness of purification in a holy river or a lake, or other natural waters surrounded by God's scenic grandeur, is a vi- brantly uplifting experience. While baptism by water as a sacred rite has its valid points, in- cluding the temporary cleansing of the mind, the ceremony, to be of lasting value, must be followed up with continued lessons in spiritual living and God-contact. Otherwise, the mind begins to revert to its old habits; their evils wear away the salutary effects of the baptismal rit- ual. Unless wickedness is purged by meditation and constant spiritual vigilance and endeavor, the initiated simply remain possessed of the same devils with a penchant for misbehavior. A story in India illus- trates this point metaphorically: A saint said to his would-be disciple, \"Son, it is necessary to bathe in the Ganges to purify the mind from sin. The sins will leave you while you bathe, for they cannot tolerate the holy waters. But take care, for they will wait in the trees skirting the river; and as soon as you come out of the sacred influence of the holy waters, they will again try to jump on you.\" 106"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"It is the mental attitude of faith and devotion in which one receives a ceremonial baptism—whether by immersion or the modified symbolic way of sprinkling water on the head—that determines the blessings re- ceived; and it is the continuity of right thought and action that assures the lasting benefit. The initiate thereafter should regularly baptize the self with Spirit by immersion of the consciousness in the wisdom, mag- netism, and spiritual radiation of the Holy Ghost in meditation. As the intent of baptism is to bring about an uplifting change in the consciousness by some form of symbolic immersion, it is good to consider how one can be \"baptized\" unknowingly by one's associates. The would-be \"initiate\" should therefore be discriminatively aware of the waters into which the consciousness is immersed. Vibrations of other people can be received by an exchange of mag- netism. One who comes near a holy person will be benefited; this is bap- tism by spiritual magnetism. The saint's thoughts and magnetic aura cast out a vibratory glow that changes the consciousness and brain cells of those who come within range. All who visit or live on the same grounds where a master lives or has lived will automatically be transformed if they are in tune. If that attunement is deep enough, even from thousands of miles away a holy person's uplifting vibrations can be received. If one loves poetry and is much in the company of a poet of no- ble ideals, one will be baptized with wholesome elevated feelings and the appreciation of the goodness and beauty in everything. Such bap- tism by feeling make s one aesthetically imaginative and sympathetic. If one associates long with persons of high morality and self-control, one's own life will feel a positive reinforcement of moral consciousness and self-control. If purposely and attentively one associates with successful creative business minds, the consciousness will be baptized with a creative business sense. HPhe ultimate baptism, acclaimed by John the Baptist and by all -L Self-realized masters, is to be baptized \"with the Holy Ghost, and with fire\" — that is, to become permeated with God's presence in the holy Creative Vibration whose Baptism by the Holy omnipresent omniscience not only uplifts and ex- Ghost pands the consciousness, but whose fire of cosmic life energy actually cauterizes sins of present bad habits and karmic ef- fects of past erroneous actions. 107"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The macrocosm of the universe with its diverse beings is made of the divine vibration, or cosmic energy, of the Holy Ghost, imbued with the Christ Intelligence, which in turn is a reflection of the Cosmic Con- sciousness of God.

His consciousness is a reflection of Christ Consciousness, his soul differentiated by his own personalized ego. His life force is individualized cosmic energy. His body is condensed cos- mic energy, enlivened by specialized life energy.* Life force vibrating grossly changes into electrons, atoms, molecules, and bodily flesh; life force vibrating progressively finer becomes consciousness. In the human being, the body, life force, and consciousness—being three different rates of vibration—are held together by the nucleus of ego and its pure na- ture, the soul. In order to free the soul, the Christ in man, from the lim- ited threefold vibrations of the human body, life force, and conscious- ness, the divine consciousness in man has first to be baptized or united with the Holy Ghost, the original cosmic vibration of Aum, the Word, the primal manifestation of God. Thence, the consciousness merges in the Omnipresent Christ immanent in creation and ascends to the transcen- dent Cosmic Consciousness, the Father. No one can reach God the Fa- ther except through the Holy Ghost and Christ Consciousness. HPhe way of ascension was made manifest in the baptism of Jesus. JL As told in the Gospel According to St. Matthew: And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo a voice from heaven, saying, \"This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased\" (Matthew 3:16-17,).f \"Spirit\" signifies the Unmanifested Absolute.

That triune manifestation is the cosmic aspect of Spirit descending in these three forms: as Cosmic Vibration, Christ Consciousness, and God the Father. This Trinity is manifested in the microcosm of man as the triune light of the spiritual eye. Man's body, unique among all creatures, possesses spiritual cere- brospinal centers of divine consciousness in which the descended Spirit is templed. These are known to the yogis, and to Saint John—who de- scribed them in Revelation as the seven seals, and as seven stars and seven churches, with their seven angels and seven golden candle- sticks.* When one is baptized by immersion in the light of Spirit, the microcosmic spiritual eye i n the body may be seen in its relation to the light of descending Spirit as the Cosmic Trinity. * \"Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches\" (Rev- elation 1:19-20). \"And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and o n the backside, sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, 'Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?'\" (Revelation 5:1-2). Yog a treatises identify these centers (in ascending or- der) as: muladhara (the coccygeal, at the base of the spine); svadhisthana (the sacral, two inches above muladhara); manipura (the lumbar, opposite the navel); anahata (the dorsal, opposite the heart); vishuddha (the cervical, at the base of the neck); ajna (seat of the spiritual eye, traditionally located between the eyebrows; in actuality, directly connected by polarity with the medulla oblongata); and sahasrara (\"thousand-petaled lotus\" in the uppermost part of the cerebrum). The seven centers are divinely planned exits or \"trap doors\" through which the soul has descended into the body and through which it must reascend by a process of meditation. By seven successive steps, the soul escapes into Cosmic Consciousness. Yoga treatises generally refer to the six lower cen- ters as chakras (\"wheels,\" becaus e the concentrated energy in each one is like a hub from which radiate rays of life-giving light and energy), with sahasrara referred to sep- arately as a seventh center.

This eye of light and consciousness appears as a golden aura (the Holy Ghost Vibration) surrounding an opal-blue sphere (Christ Conscious- ness) in the center of which is a five-pointed star of brilliant white light (doorway to the Cosmic Consciousness of Spirit). The threefold light of God in the spiritual eye is symbolized by a dove because it brings perennial peace. Also, looking in the spiritual eye produces in man's consciousness the purity signified by the dove. The mouth of the symbolic dove represents the star in the spiri- tual eye, the secret passage to Cosmic Consciousness. The two wings of the dove represen t the two spheres of consciousness emanating from Cosmic Consciousness: The blue light of the spiritual eye is the microcosm of the subjective Christ Intelligence in all creation; and the golden ring of ligh t in the spiritual eye is the microcosmic objective cosmic energy, Cosmic Vibration, or Holy Ghost.* All manifestation is a product of vibration, which is of the Holy Ghost, and is sustained by the inherence of God's consciousness. Thus the light of the spiritual eye is composed of vibratory lifetrons, the finest ultimate unit,pf intelligent energy emanating from the Holy Ghost (the subtlety of lifetrons is superseded only by the vibrations of pure con- sciousness). Lifetrons are the underlying support of the grosser electrons and structural atoms of which all matter is composed. Each microscopic lifetron contains in miniature the essence of all macroscopic creation.

During baptism by Spirit in the form of the Holy Ghost as experienced by Jesus, he saw the light of the spiritual eye as descended from the macrocosmic Divine Light; and from this came the voice of Aum, the intelligent, all-creative heavenly sound, vibrating as an intelligible voice: \"Thou art My Son, having lifted thy consciousness from the limitation of the body and all mat- ter to realize thyself as one with My perfect reflection, My only be- gotten image, immanent in all manifestation. I am Bliss, and My joy I express in thy rejoicing in attunement with My Omnipresence.\" Jesus felt his consciousness attuned to the Christ Consciousness, the \"only begotten\" reflection of God the Father's Intelligence in the Holy Vi- bration: he first felt his body as the entire vibratory creation in which his little body was included; then within his cosmic body of all cre- ation, he experienced his oneness with God's innate Presence as the In- finite Christ or Universal Intelligence, a magnetic aura of blissful Di- vine Love in which God's presence holds all beings. S aint John, the beloved disciple of Christ, records the testimony of John the Baptist, the guru through whose instrumentality Jesus re- ceived this baptism of Spirit: The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, \"Be- hold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is pre- ferred before me: for he was before me.' And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.\" And John bare record, saying, \"I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. And I knew 111"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"him not: but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, 'Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.' And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God\" (John 1:29-34). All masters who have attained the ultimate realization and one- ness with God are equal in the eyes of God. But the Father of the Uni- verse, during certain cycles of time, \"prefers,\" that The Lamb of God: a is, chooses, one soul to come to earth as a world world savior prophet to give spiritual impetus to His children. Sometimes in the world there are several masters present, but one is delegated by God to carry out a preeminent dis- pensation. That in no degree lessens the greatness of other masters, who are all one in Spirit. John came baptizing with water, in the cus- tomary ritualistic way, to draw the attention of Israel, true souls, to the advent of Jesus. Having stirred their receptivity, he could then humbly fulfill his own dispensation: to make manifest by his testimony the divine credentials of Jesus, who was \"preferred\"—chosen by God —for a grand mission of the reformation of humanity. Jesus was to do this by inspiring the world with a new consciousness through re- vival of the tr^ie rite of baptism by Spirit, the transformation of con- sciousness by immersion in the sacred vibration of the Holy Ghost. The expression \"I knew him not\" is misleading. It does not mean that John didn't recognize Jesus. Rather, he was pointing out that no one in the ordinary state of body-identified ego consciousness — or even John himself, through purely external sensory perception—could possibly fathom the spiritual consciousness of the Christ in Jesus. It was during Jesus' baptism, when both he and John were transfigured in the light of the Holy Ghost, that John witnessed that Jesus was in- deed a fully manifested \"Son of God.\" Such recognition could not be evidenced to an ordinary mind; but through the transparency of an uplifted consciousness, the full divinity of Jesus' consciousness as one with Christ Consciousness can be realized. John's reference to Jesus that \"he was before me\" again demon- strates John's humility in acknowledging, in their incarnations as John and Jesus, the reversal of their previous roles as Elijah and Elisha—it was Jesus in this present drama who demonstrated Christhood before John (\"before me\"). 112"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"John introduced Jesus the Savior with the epithet \"Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" A lamb is a symbol of in- nocence, meekness, and loyalty. Jesus was innocent, pure, humble, and true to God in every way. His was not the arrogant power of a tyran- nical crusader out to destroy evil by force. Rather he came to offer himself as a sacrifice (as lambs are sacrificed in the Orient) to exem- plify the supreme power of love. If God used His omnipotence to pun- ish man, it would be impossible for a mere mortal to exercise inde- pendent judgment and thus learn and grow by his own mistakes. The karmic law works whereby man punishes himself proportionate to his misdeeds, while at the same time God uses love to encourage discrim- inative right behavior and to awaken in the human spirit the higher soul qualities of God's image within the true Self. Jesus exemplified God's love in a rare expression of spiritual mag- nanimity: the willing oblation of his own life. By sacrificing himself for the spiritual welfare of others, a savior who is empowered by God to do so can expiate the sins of others. Jesus, a world savior, took on himself not only the karmic debt of his disciples but also the sin of the masses by allowing himself to be crucified. It would be folly to presume that anyone, even a Jesus, can take away an individual's sin unless the sinner himself cooperates to remove that karmic consequence. A master can take upon himself some of the burden of a disciple if that devotee makes a worthwhile spiritual ef- fort to improve himself. But most of all, a master serves in the highest way by example and teachings that inspire the errant children of God to free themselves from their bad habits and spiritual negligence. To demonstrate the Divine Compassion, Jesus came as the lamb of spirituality, ready to offer himself as a sacrifice before the temple of truth—an exemplar of the consummate power of love over evil, wis- dom over ignorance, forgiveness over vengefulness, light over darkness. Jesus' sacrifice was, primarily, to exemplify for all time the power of spiritual force over ignorance and brute force. He showed that the power of love could conquer the Roman Empire, which with all its might could not suppress his philosophy. His reign has outlasted that of all warrior conquerors, based on the divine edict: \"Love your enemies.\" In pointing to Jesus as one sent by God to be the savior of multi- tudes, John proclaims: \"Behold the gentleness of compassion and the meek but almighty power of love represented in Jesus, which will de- stroy ignorance and evil from the lives of those who will receive within 113"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"themselves the Christ incarnate in him.

Initiation by a guru is the interior consecration of the disciple into the spiritual path that leads from the domain of matter-consciousness into • » • the kingdom of Spirit. The true initiation, as has The three aspects of been shown, is baptism by Spirit: coming in contact spiritual initiation with a saintly person who can by a glance or a touch send the vibrating light of Spirit over the devotee to change and uplift the consciousness. This real baptism cleanses the con- sciousness of the initiate with the Holy Light of the spiritual eye and the sacred sound of Aum. Whosoever can see the life current of the spiritual eye changing and spiritualizing the brain cells and the very composition of the mind of the initiate is one who baptizes with the Holy Ghost. He sees the light of the spiritual eye and throws that Light of Spirit onto the consciousness of the devotee. When that vibratory power passes through the initiate, it cauterizes present bad habits and past karmic seeds lodged in the brain. By the consciousness of God which is within him, a great spiritual soul can transfer to others who are receptive ajj experience of some of his own God-consciousness. This spiritual baptism is threefold. First, when the teacher bestows initiation, he sees the Light himself as he baptizes the disciple. Second, when the teacher sends that Light into the initiate, which the devotee may or may not see himself, it remains a little while with its full vi- bratory power to effect a spiritual change in the devotee; but it is tem- porary. A master's blessings can for some time hold that Light within the disciple, but the devotee must also make the effort to retain it. Third, to keep the Light permanently, the devotee has to make it his own through conscientious endeavor in meditation and in following the spiritual guidance and practices, the sadhana , given by the master. The surest way to find God is to learn about Him from one who knows Him. To follow a master whose path has led him to God- realization is to reach assuredly the same Goal. The scriptures of India speak of the liberation of the soul in terms of a calibrated formula, which, providentially, seems to favor the \"spirit is weak\" syndrome in man. Of the total requirement to achieve salvation, it is said that 25% is the disciple's spiritual effort, 25% is 114"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"the blessing of the guru, and the remaining 50% is the grace of God.

He takes personal interest in the welfare of the devotee's soul and lays before him a path of spiritual discipline that leads as far as the God-seeker wishes to go. In the early years of my spiritual search I was blessed to have fre- quent association with saintly souls whose God-consciousness trans- ported my consciousness into supernal realms. But it was not until I met my own God-ordained guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar, and received initiation from him, that I understood fully the transforming power of the sacred guru-disciple tradition. Baptized in a radiance as of a thou- sand suns, my whole being was blissfully enwrapped in God's love and secured in the care of Guru's wisdom. The Kriya Yoga sadhana im- parted to me at that diksha was the \"pearl of great price\" with which all doors to the Divine Presence would be opened. A guru is not an ordinary spiritual teacher. One may have many teachers, but only one guru, who is the agent of salvation appointed by God in response to a devotee's demands for release from the bon- dage of matter. Ministers in churches and priests in temples are oftentimes chosen only by a set standard of their intellectual knowledge of the scriptures, or by virtue of sacerdotal authority ceremonially conferred on them by a formally higher ecclesiastical superior. No guru can be developed only by years of study in the intellectual factory of a theological seminary, which deems it has attained its ends when it confers B.D. or D.D. de- grees. Such titles can be won by men of good memory; but character, self-control, and the wisdom of soul intuition can be cultured only by knowledge and application of advanced methods of deep daily medi- tation that produce Self-realization and actual experience of God. Neither can one be a guru by self-choice. He must be ordained to serve and save others by a real guru, or else he must hear in reality the voice of God asking him to redeem others. As has been shown, this law was honored even by Jesus, who received his guru's blessing before be- 115"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"ginning his ministry—just to set the right example. Self-appointed gurus are much misguided by listening to the voice of their imaginative ego in their subconscious mind. Those who thus falsely anoint themselves as gu- rus, or exult in the veneration of followers who are encouraged to look on them as such, are not empowered by God nor their own spiritual at- tainment to grant salvation to anyone. It is admirable to lecture and teach good principles; but without possessing the qualifications of a real guru a teacher cannot redeem souls, nor should he presume to accept others as disciples until he himself has progressed far in his own Self-realization. True gurus train first their inner selves in the theologically ad- vanced school of intuition and God-communion in meditation. They spiritually baptize themselves in Spirit before they aspire to initiate oth- ers. They teach not for mundane gain or glory, but for the singular pur- pose of leading souls to God. A guru never seeks for himself the devo- tion and obedience of his disciples, but transfers that reverence to God. It is not necessary for a disciple to be in the company of the guru in order to receive his blessings. What is most important is to be spiri- tually in tune with the guru, for his help is transferred to the disciple primarily on the inner spiritual plane rather than through material means. If the discipje is uncarping, unconditionally reverential and lov- ing to the master, and faithful in following his precepts, his receptivity makes the task of the guru easier. Attunement links the help of the guru with the sincere striving of the disciple, even if the guru is no longer in- carnate on earth. My guru, Sri Yukteswarji, wrote: \"To keep company with the Guru is not only to be in his physical presence (as this is some- times impossible), but mainly means to keep him in our hearts and to be one with him in principle and to attune ourselves with him....by keeping his appearance and attributes fully in mind, and by reflecting on the same and affectionately following his instructions, lamblike.\"* Many who were born centuries after Christ have attained God- realization through devotion to Jesus, the Good Shepherd, whom they followed as their guru or savior. Jesus said, \"Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?\"f The secret of the saints is that they practiced what Jesus taught and exemplified; and by their single-hearted devotion they were able to attain ecstatic interiorization, as do adept yogis, which is necessary for communion with Christ. * The Holy Science, published by Self-Realization Fellowship. tLuke 6:46. 116"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"T here is a beautiful revelation of the way to that divine contact hid- den in the Biblical verses where John the Baptist describes himself: \"I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah\" (John 1:23).

The prin- ciples of yoga know no artificial boundaries of religious isms. Yoga is the universal science of divine union of the soul with Spirit, of man with his Maker. Yoga describes the definite way Spirit descends from Cosmic Consciousness into matter and individualized expression in all beings; and how, conversely, individualized consciousness ultimately must reascend to Spirit. Many are the pathways of religion and the modes of approaching God; but ultimately they all lead to one high- way of final ascension to union with Him. The way of liberation of the soul from its ties to mortal consciousness in the body is identical for all: through the same \"straight\" highway of the spine by which the soul descended from Spirit into the body and matter.* Man's true nature is the soul, a ray of Spirit. As God is ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-n^w Bliss, so the soul, by encasement in the body, is individualized ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss. The bodily covering of the soul is threefold in nature.

The physical body receives all its enlivening energy and powers from an inner radiant astral body of lifetrons.

And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away\" (Isaiah 35:8-10). fThe causal body, the idea-matrix for the astral and physical bodies, consists of 35 idea elements, 19 of which constitute the astral body and 16 of which correspond to the chemical elements of the physical body.

Burr at Yale University during the 1940s was studying the shape of energy fields\" — which he termed \"fields of life\" or \"L-fields\" — \"around living plants and animals. Some of Burr's work involved the shape of electrical fields surrounding salamanders. He found that the salamanders possessed an energy field roughly shaped like the adult animal. He also discovered that this field contained an electrical axis which was aligned with the brain and spinal cord. Burr wanted to find precisely when this electrical axis first originated in the animal's development. He began mapping the fields in progressively earlier stages of salamander embryogenesis. Burr discovered that the electrical axis originated in the unfertilized egg....Burr also experimented with the electrical fields around tiny seedlings. According to his research, the electrical field around a sprout was not the shape of the original seed. Instead the surrounding electrical field resem- bled the adult plant.\" In Blueprint for Immortality: The Electric Patterns of Life (Essex, England: Saffron Walden, 1972), Professor Burr describes his research: \"Most people who have taken high-school science will remember that if iron filings are scattered on a card held over a magnet they will arrange themselves in the pattern of the 'lines of force' of the mag- net's field. And if the filings are thrown away and fresh ones scattered on the card, the new filings will assume the same pattern as the old. \"Something like this—though infinitely more complicated—happens in the hu- man body. Its molecules and cells are constantly being torn apart and rebuilt with fresh material from the food we eat. But thanks to the controlling L-field, the new molecules and cells are rebuilt as before and arrange themselves in the same pattern as the old ones. \"Modern research with 'tagged' elements has revealed that the materials of our bodies and brains are renewed much more often than was previously realized.

As attention is the conductor of man's life currents and consciousness, persons who indulge the senses of touch, smell, taste, sound, and sight find the searchlights of their life force and con- sciousness concentrated on matter. But when, by self-mastery in meditation, the attention is focused steadily on the center of divine perception at the point between the eye- brows, the searchlights of life force and consciousness are reversed. Withdrawing from the senses, they reveal the light of the spiritual eye. As one switch throws light into the two headlights of an auto- mobile, so the astral center of superconsciousness in the medulla throws its current into the two physical eyes that behold the world of duality. But by deep concentration on the point between the two eyes, the light of the medulla flowing into the two eyes can be made to con- verge into the one single spiritual eye in the forehead.

A bent spine during meditation offers real re- sistance to the process of reversing the life currents to flow upward to- wards the spiritual eye. A bent spine throws the vertebrae out of align- ment and pinches the nerves, trapping the life force in its accustomed state of body consciousness and mental restlessness. The populace in Israel was looking for Christ in a physical body, so John the Baptist assured them of the coming of one in whom Christ protein in the body, for example, is 'turned over' every six months and, in some or- gans such as the liver, the protein is renewed much more frequently. When we meet a friend we have not seen for six months there is not one molecule in his face which was there when we las t saw him. But, thanks to his controlling L-field, the new molecules have fallen into the old, familiar pattern and we can recognize his face. Until modern instruments revealed the existence of the controlling L-fields, biologists were at a loss to explain how our bodies 'kept in shape' through ceaseless metabolism and changes of material.

John was emphasizing that just worshiping the body of Christ Jesus was not the way to know him. The Christ Consciousness embodied in Jesus could be realized only by awakening the astral centers of the spine, the straight way of ascension by which the metaphysical Christ Con- sciousness in the body of Jesus could be intuitionally perceived. The words of the prophet Isaiah, which were echoed by John the Baptist, show that both knew that the subjective Lord of Finite Vibra- tory Creation, or Christ Consciousness, could be welcomed into one's own consciousness only through the meditation-awakened straight highway of the spine. Isaiah, John, the yogis, all know that to receive Christ Consciousness more than a simple physical contact with a Christlike person is necessary. One must know how to meditate—how to switch off th e attention from the distractions of the senses, and how to keep the consciousness fixed on the altar of the spiritual eye where Christ Consciousness can be received in all its glory. Jesus himself and his disciples were products of the intuitive om- niscience of ecstatic meditation and devotion, not results of intellec- tual theological seminaries. Churches today have digressed from the path of Self-realization, personal experience of God and Christ. Congregations are generally sat- isfied with sermons, ceremonies, organizations, and • - • festive socials. The complete revival and restoration Scientific meditation of Christ-ianity can be effected only by less empha- lifts the practice of re- sis on theoretical sermons with their oft-repeated ligion beyond intellec- platitudes, and on external emotion-rousing, psycho- tual theory physical ceremonies, and by substituting instead quiet meditation and real inner communion. Rather than being passive members of a church, satisfied merely with listening to sermons, wor- shipers should engage more in the effort to cultivate perfect stillness in both body and mind. The peace of absolute physical and mental still- ness is the real temple wherein God most often visits His devotees. \"Be still, and know that I am God.\"* The word \"straight\" also signifies following the straight path of truth, through which alone the soul can reach God. It is very difficult * Psalms 46:10. 121"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"to choose the right course amid the varied religious opinions. John de- clared to the people the straight path out of their ignorance, and ex- horted them to follow it to receive the teachings of Jesus in attaining Christ Consciousness. People who wander from church to church seek- ing intellectual satisfaction seldom find God, for intellectual nourish- ment is necessary only to inspire one to \"drink\" God. When the intel- lect forgets to actually taste God, it is a detriment to Self-realization. Spiritual truth and wisdom are found not in any words of a priest or preacher, but in the \"wilderness\" of inner silence. The Sanskrit scrip- tures say: \"There are many sages with their scriptural and spiritual in- terpretations, apparently contradictory, but the real secret of religion is hidden in a cave.\"* True religion lies within oneself, in the cave of still- ness, in the cave of calm intuitive wisdom, in the cave of the spiritual eye. By concentrating on the point between the eyebrows and delving into the depths of quiet in the luminous spiritual eye, one can find an- swers to all the religious queries of the heart. \"The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost...shall teach you all things\" (John 14:26). By the right method of meditation on the Holy Ghost as the light of the spiritual eye and the holy sound of the cosmic vibration of Aum, any persevering devotee, by constant practice, can experience the blessings of the manifested vibratory presence of God. The Sacred Vi- bration, the Great Comforter, being imbued with the universal, re- flected God-consciousness, contains the all-encompassing bliss of God. On the day of Pentecost the disciples of Jesus were filled with the new wine of this Joy coming from the touch of Aum, the comforting Holy Vibration, and they could talk \"in diverse tongues.\" Aum, the Word, the cosmic intelligent Vibratory Sound, is the origin of all sounds and languages. One filled with the Holy Ghost—one who can hear, feel, and spread his consciousness in Aum —can understand and commu- nicate in the diverse tongues of inspirations of men, animals, and atoms. He truly communes with Nature; not as an experience of the senses, but as one united with the Voice of God through which the Creator guides the symbiosis of His beings in an underlying harmony. All human beings are born of the Creative Vibration of the Holy Ghost; but they are prodigal sons who have left the home of their parental Divine Consciousness an d have identified themselves with the finitely limited territory of the human body. The soul feels confine- *The Mahabharata, Vana Parva (312.117). 122"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"ment in the physical, astral, and ideational bodies. At the onset of spir- itual awakening, that Self begins to assert its connate desire for free- dom from delusion's constraints. The conscious mind should then be taught how to detach the soul consciousness from identification with these three bodies to reclaim its origin in the omnipresent Spirit. By a guru-given technique of meditation on Aum ( Om ), such as I have taught to Self-Realization Fellowship students,* the sacred Aum vibration of the Holy Ghost can be heard in medi- tation through the supersensory medium of intu- Meditation on Aum ition. First, the devotee realizes Aum as the mani- brings baptism in the fested cosmic energy in all matter. The earthly Holy Ghost and sounds of all atomic motion, including the sounds Christ Consciousness of the body—the heart , lungs, circulation, cellular activity—come from the cosmic sound of the creative vibratory ac- tivity of Aum . The sounds of the nine octaves perceptible to the hu- man ear, as well as all cosmic low or high vibrations that cannot be registered by the human ear, have their origin in Aum. So also, all forms of light—fire, sunlight, electricity, astral light—are expressions of the primal cosmic energy of Aum. This Holy Vibration working in the subtle spinal centers of the as- tral body, sending forth life force and consciousness into the physical body, manifests as wonderful astral sounds—each one characteristic of its particular center of activity. These astral sounds are likened to melodic strains of the humming of a bee, the tone of a flute, a stringed instrument such as a harp, a bell-like or gong sound, the soothing roar of a distant sea, and a cosmic symphony of all vibratory sound. The Self-Realization Fellowship technique of meditation on Aum teaches one to hear and locate these astral sounds. This aids the awakening of the divine consciousness locked in the spinal centers, opening them to \"make straight\" the way of ascension to God-realization. As the devotee concentrates on Aum, first by mentally chanting Aum, and then by actually hearing that sound, his mind is diverted from the physical sounds of matter outside his body to the circulatory and other sounds of the vibrating flesh. Then his consciousness is diverted from the vibrations of the physical body to the musical vibrations of the spinal centers of the astral body. His consciousness then expands from the vibrations of the astral body to the vibrations of consciousness in * Available in the Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons (see page 1575). 123"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"the causal body and in the omnipresence of the Holy Ghost. When the devotee's consciousness is able not only to hear the cosmic sound of Aum, but also to feel its actual presence in every unit of space, in all fi- nite vibrating matter, then the soul of the devotee becomes one with the Holy Ghost. His consciousness vibrates simultaneously in his body, in the sphere of the earth, the planets, the universes, and in every particle of matter, space, and astral manifestation. Through the expanding power of the Holy Ghost, the all-spreading Awra-vibrating sound heard in meditation, the consciousness then becomes immersed, or baptized, in the sacred stream of Christ Consciousness. These progressively higher states of realization are attained through deeper and longer meditation as guided by the guru. But from the very beginning, the blessings of contact with Aum become in- creasingly manifest. The uplifting vibrations of \"the Comforter\" bring profound inner peace and joy. The Creative Vibration vitalizes the individual life force in the body, which conduces to health and well-being, and can be con- sciously directed as healing power to those in need of divine aid.* Be- ing the source of intelligent creativity, the Aum vibration inspires one's own initiative, ingenuity, and will. Baptism in the vibration of the Holy Ghost loosens the hold of bad habits and wrong desires, and aids in the establishment of good habits and desires—ultimately transmuting desire itself into a single- hearted attraction to blessed contact with God. To know God is not the negation of desires, but rather complete fulfillment. Just as by feed- ing somebody else one's own hunger cannot be appeased, so the soul can never be satisfied by catering to the senses. The senses crave in- dulgence, greed, and temptations to excite and amuse them; the soul feels fulfilled only by the calmness, peace, and bliss bestowed by med- itation and the moderate use of the sensory instruments. Ambition for good things, noble achievements, and spiritual work, serving the many, should be instituted to displace selfishness * Paramahansa Yogananda daily prayed for and sent healing energy to all who had asked for his help , and taught his disciples a special technique of sending the healing power of Aum to aid others in overcoming physical, mental, and spiritual difficulties. This service is continued today by the Prayer Council at Self-Realization Fellowship International Headquarters, joined by the thousands of members of the SRF World- wide Prayer Circle in praying for those in need and for world peace.

Desire limits the consciousness to the object of desire. Love for all good things as expressions of God expands man's consciousness.

This golden, blue, and silver light contains all the walls of rays—electronic, atomic, and lifetronic —of Cosmic Vibration through which one has to penetrate before one can reach heaven.

Philosophy can play an intricate word-game with truth, but what each individual has to deal with in fact is the obstinate mindset of his present state of consciousness. It is better to know the wiles of evil and the ways to combat them than to be caught unaware in blithe denial. Knowledge only, and not assertion without realiza- tion, can produce final emancipation. Though it cannot be denied that God is the Source of all that ex- ists, and that evil is a part of His creation, it must also be acknowl- edged that what we call evil is relative. Certainly it is terrible that vi- olence, accidents, and diseases kill billions of people every century. But death itself is necessary to the renewal and progress of life. Also, earth is not meant to be \"heavenly\"; if it were, no one would want to leave the comfortable physical body and pleasurable world to go back to God. Misery, in one sense, is man's benefactor, because it drives him to seek sorrow-transcendence in God. Thus it is hard to fix a bound- ary line between good and evil, except in a relative sense. To God Himself nothing is evil, for nothing can diminish His immortal, eter- nally perfect Bliss. But for the myriad beings trapped in the crucible of mortal existence evil is all too real; and to say that God does not know their suffering as evil would imply that He is a very ignorant God! There are various causes that can be put forth to explain evil oc- currences in the world. Some people say that the responsibility for them lies neither with God nor with any objective Evil The subjective nature Power. They reject as medieval superstition the view of evil—arising from that Satan is an actual being, like a dragon who has man's thoughts and to be slain by the sword of the conquering knight; actions  and try to explain Satan away by saying that the ori- gin of evil is subjective, arising from psychological factors, from the thoughts and actions of man himself. This can per- haps be granted in the case of heinous acts perpetrated by villainous 134"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"souls who cause suffering for their fellow beings; but what about the pain of disease, injury, and premature death? According to the view that evil is subjective, even these sufferings result from man's erroneous choices and actions—his lack of harmony with universal laws. In this sense it is certainly true that evil in man's life is self- engendered: If a man hits a stone wall with his knuckles, the resulting undeniable evil of pain would not be created or willed by the wall, but would be the result of his ignorance in striking the naturally unyield- ing hardness of the stones. Likewise, it can be said that God is a stone wall of Eternal Goodness. His universe subsists on the workings of just and natural laws. Anyone foolish enough to misuse his intelligence to act against that goodness will inexorably produce the evil of pain and suffering—not because of any intent or wish of God, but because of pernicious ways of life colliding with the eternal good principles un- derlying all things in God. Man possesses the divinely given gift of free choice to tune in with God's goodness, peace, and immortality. Those who use their will contrarily and act out of tune with Him, breaking His laws, are bound to suffer from the recoil of their misdeeds, ac- cording to the law of cause and effect. A little boy endowed with reason may enjoy perfect health and protection under the strict discipline of his mother; but when he grows up, he says: \"Mother, I know I am safe in your care; but I wonder why you fostered my intelligence and gave me the power of free choice if you are always to decide how I am to behave? I want to make my own choices; I will find out for myself what is good or bad for me.\" The mother replies: \"Son, it is fitting for you to demand the right to use your free choice. When you were helpless and your reason had not yet budded forth, I nurtured you through the protection of ma- ternal love. Now your eyes of reason are opened; it is time for you to depend upon the guidance of your own judgment.\" Thus the youth ventures into the world unguarded, with only a semideveloped discrimination. He abuses health laws and becomes ill. He chooses wrong company and gets into a fight, resulting in a black eye and a broken leg. It is the Divine Mother* who tries to protect each baby through the instinctive love of parents. But there comes a time when the baby *The aspect of God that is active in creation; the shakti, or power, of the Transcen- dent Creator.

If guided rightly by discrimination, the maturing individual becomes happy; but if reason is misused, then an evil outcome is precipitated. From the foregoing analysis of evil, it would appear that the cause of evil is more subjective than objective, that much of it is due to the ignorance and wrong judgment of man, not to some malicious force in the universe. The power of habits presents an apt example: The con- sequent evils of physical overindulgence or indiscretion—ill health, being held in the grip of temptation—do not arise until man, by an act of erroneous judgment, forgets himself and by repeated transgres- sions allows the wrong indulgence to become a habit in the con- sciousness. All habits, good or bad, control and enslave the mind only after the will has allowed itself to be overcome by repeated good or evil actions born of good or evil judgment. Why, then, are some children born with special tendencies of self- control and some with tendencies of weakness, before they have had any opportunity to exercise their reason and free choice? Some intel- lectuals confidently assert that heredity is responsible for good or bad traits in a child. But why would an impartial God endow one child with a good heredity producing a good brain inclined only to good tendencies, and another child with a bad heredity and a dysfunctional brain inclined only to do evil under the compelling influence of evil physiological instincts? An answer is found in the law of reincarnation and its corollary of karma—the cosmic dispenser of justice through the law of cause and effect which governs the actions of all persons. According to this law, the soul attracts to itself a good or bad heredity, and a good or bad mentality, according to desires and habits formed in past earth- existences, which being unexpurgated are carried forward from the last incarnation into rebirth in one's present life. A person's good or bad judgment of all incarnations, working through the law of cause ing the motherly qualities of love and compassion. The Hindu scriptures teach that God is both immanent and transcendent, personal and impersonal. He may be sought as the Transcendent Absolute; but as the Bhagavad Gita xii:5 points out, \"Those whose goal is the Unmanifested increase the difficulties; arduous is the path to the Ab- solute for embodied beings. \" Easier for most devotees is to seek God as one of His manifest eternal qualities, such as love, wisdom, bliss, light; in the form of an ishta (de- ity); or as Father, Mother, or Friend.

Thus it may be said that evil in man's life arises from his own wrong judgment. While all of these facts support the contention that evil is subjec- tive—that man may be accused of misusing his reason and, by creat- ing inharmony with God's laws, of giving birth to ev il—this explanation does not adequately account for every aspect of evil inextricably bound into the myriad manifestations of creation. Millions of bacteria and virulent, invisible armies of germs move silently about the earth seeking, like devouring locusts, to destroy the crops of human lives. Numberless dis- eases infest plants and animals who have no free choice and consequently could not attract these evils due to prenatal bad karma. Why is there death by floods and cataclysms?

Why do men murder each other in war? Why do even the thoughts of wrong judgment and emotions of jealousy, revenge, greed, and self- ishness arise at all in the human mind? If man is made in the image of God, and God is good, then the logical deduction is that man could be- come nothing else but good.

All beings would go to heaven and become angels after they had successfully finished their earthly entertainment. Such a world is easy to fancy, for the soul is always whispering to man its native perfection, even while the ego engages him in gambling with the enticements of a distorted earthly duality. An ideal existence is not impossible, but it is for a different time and realm reserved for those who have graduated from the learning assignments of earth life. For the ordinary man in his present stage of evolution, a life without difficulties would be of little value. No lessons of growth would be learned, no transformations of inflexible natures into godly conscious- ness, no compelling incentives to seek and know one's Maker. Regardless, the time-worn, unresolved conundrum persists: Did evil have its origin in the plan of a good and perfect God? The Lord Himself answered prophet Isaiah: \"I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside Me: I girded thee (invested thee with thy powers and attributes), though thou hast not known Me....I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.\"* The illumined rishis of India similarly perceived: \"...Joy, sorrow, birth, death, fear, courage...these diverse states of be- ings spring from Me alone as modifications of My nature....I am the Source of everything; from Me all creation emerges.\"t Spirit alone is perfect. Everything in creation, being delimited, is imperfect. The very beginning of creation gave rise to the law of du- ality—light and darkness, good and evil—the law • • of relativity necessary to divide the One into the Dualities of good and many. By the storm of vibration, God's thoughts of evil are inherent in multiplicity brought forth the waves of manifesta- creation tion: His lila, or divine play. Spirit's desireless desire to enjoy Its Bliss as many selves was un- necessary to the complete and perfect Spirit, just as a father through no vital necessity may desire the joy in playing with his child. Spirit's desire was therefore an imperfect stirring in the perfect Quiescent Bliss, a thought vibration to accomplish something when that accom- plishment was not necessary . As introduced earlier, Spirit, being the only Substance existent, had nothing other than Itself with which to create. [See Discourse i.] * Isaiah 45:5, 7. t God Talks With Arjutia: The Bhagavad Gita x:4~5, 8. 139"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"So in Its infinite consciousness Spirit differentiated—in thought only — between Itself and creation evolved from Itself, just as the varied im- ages in a dream assume a semblance of reality in their relative exis- tence as separate thoughts made of the one mind-stuff of the dreamer's imagination. In order to give individuality and independence to Its thought im- ages, Spirit had to employ a cosmic deception, a universal mental magic. Spirit overspread and permeated Its creative desire with cosmic delusion, a grand magical measurer described in Hindu scriptures as maya (from the Sanskrit root ma, \"to measure\"). Delusion divides, measures out, the Undefined Infinite into finite forms and forces. The working of cosmic delusion on these individualizations is called avidya , individual illusion or ignorance, which imparts a specious re- ality to their existence as separate from Spirit.* Individualized selves possessing the instrumentalities of a human body and mind are gifted with the power of free choice and independent action. Even though God has created the universe out of delusion, He Himself is not deluded by it. He knows maya as naught but a modifi- cation of His one Consciousness. The colossal dramas of creation and dissolution of planets and galaxies; the birth, growth, and decline of empires and civilizations; the countless miniature plays of individual lives with their subplots of health and sickness, riches and poverty, life and death—all are happening in God as the One Dreamer-Creator, a chimerical perception of change within the Eternally Changeless. One part of the Infinite Being ever remains transcendent, beyond vibratory dualities: There He is the inactive Absolute—Spirit. When Spirit vi- brates Its consciousness with thoughts of diversity, It becomes imma- nent as the omnipresent Creator in the finite vibratory realm of infin- ity: There God is active as the creative Vibratory Holy Ghost with its immanent Christ Consciousness.

When this power goes forth from Ishvara (God the Father of Creation) as Intelligent Creative Cosmic Vibration, it takes on a dual nature. As Para-Prakriti (Pure Nature) it creates and expresses all good and beauty in harmony with the God-tuned imma- nent Kutastha Chaitanya (Christ Consciousness). Its divine nature is magnificently expressed in the causal and astral heavenly realms. But as the Vibratory Power descends into material manifestation, it be- comes conjointly a deviant Apara-Prakriti (Impure Nature), creating through the circumscriptive laws of gross matter and the uttermost density of delusion. ^T^hese two aspects of Prakriti correspond to the Christian desig- „L nations of Holy Ghost and Satan.

Satan (from the Hebrew, literally \"the adver- —— sary\") pulls outward from God into entanglement The origin of Satan, with the delusive world of matter, employing the the creative power that mayic cosmic delusion to diffuse, confuse, blind, rebelled against God and bind. Thus Satan is defined as an archangel that fell from heaven, a force fallen from the grace of attunement with the Holy Creative Vi- bration of God. Jesus said: \"I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven\" (Luke 10:18). The divine Cosmic Vibration with its creative light became a divided force (Para- and Apara-Prakriti). The satanic or apara aspect asserts its independence and turns from God and the heavenly realms to ply its wiles in the grossest regions of duality, con- trast, inversion, oppositional states, and mortality. Because it en- shrouds matter and engages man in the most deceptive confusion of mayic delusion, Jesus referred to this satanic force as a devil, a mur- derer, and a liar. \"The devil...was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it\" (John 8:44). Satan originated as the natural consequence of God's desireless desire to divide His Sea of Oneness into waves of finite creation—a power of independent will that would wield the laws of material cre- ation to manifest and sustain its existence. The plan of Spirit was that this conscious Cosmic Delusive Force should be endowed with inde- 141"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"pendence in order to use maya and avidya to create God-reflecting fi- nite objects out of Holy Ghost cosmic vibratory energy, in harmonious attunement with the divine Christ Intelligence present therein. Perfect gems in mines, perfect flowers, perfect animals, and hu- man soul-luminaries residing on perfect planets were thus created, brought forth as material manifestations from the heavenly astral and causal realms. That is why in the Christian Bible we find the ideal Adam and Eve communing with God, so naturally and simply in the abundant Garden of Eden. After a harmonious existence—a perfect expression of form, health habits, and modes of existence on the stage of time, without suffering, disease, cruel accidents, or painful prema- ture death—all created forms were to return to God. Just as rainbows come and go, or as motion-picture forms can be created for enter- tainment and electrically switched on or off at will, so all created things were to exist as pleasant, mutually entertaining pictures on the screen of space and time, and were to resolve into their pure essence in God at the end of their cycle, after the drama of that period was perfectly played. Thus originally all Cosmic Energy, being vibrated by the Holy Ghost and Christ Intelligence, was flowing Godward, creating perfect images from astral light turned inward to reveal God. The conscious Cosmic Delusive Force, with its independent power from God, saw that if the cosmic-energy manifestations of the Holy Ghost Vibration were to dissolve back into Spirit according to the divine plan, then its own separate existence would also cease. Without the Holy Vibration, there would be neither a reason for nor sustenance of the Cosmic Delusive Force. This thought frightened Satan; the sole purpose of his being— to keep these forms in manifestation—was threatened. So for his own purpose of self-perpetuation he rebelled against God, as an obstreper- ous general sometimes turns against his king, and started to misuse his cosmic powers. He manipulated the laws and principles of creation un- der his command to establish patterns of imperfection that would pre- clude their automatic resolution back into Spirit. Satan became as light- ning falling from heaven because he turned the light of cosmic energy away from its focus on God and concentrated it on gross matter. The heaven-revealing astral light became the bedimmed physical luminaries of sun, fire, electricity, which show only material substances.

Therefore, it can be said that except in the absolute sense that everything is made of the one Cosmic Consciousness of God, there is no evil in the All-Perfect God. Evil resides in the Adversarial Force that maintains its realm of influence by the gross obscuration of the true God-nature of all created beings. Philosophic sophistry could con- vincingly make the case that since the duty of Satan as an archangel was to sustain the existence of manifested forms, he fell from heaven just trying to do his job!

God made man immortal, to reign on earth as an immortal; Sa- tan's evils bound man with the consciousness of mortality. Man was to behold the drama of change with a changeless immortal mind; and after seeing change dancing on the stage of changelessness, he was to return to the bosom of Eternal Blessedness by consciously dematerial- izing his physical form.

The spinal cord is like an upturned tree, with man's hair as its roots, and afferent and efferent nerves as branches. The tree of the nervous system bears many enjoyable fruits, or sensations of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. In these, man may rightfully in- dulge; but he was forbidden the experience of sex, the 'apple' at the center of the body ('in the midst of the garden').* \"The 'serpent' represents the coiled-up spinal energy [at the base of the spine] that stimulates the sex nerves.

The all-creative powers of his will, focused at that spot, were lost to man when he began to \"till the ground\" of his physical nature. §The fall of man from his native state of divine consciousness under the influence of Satan is understood in Yoga to be the descent of his life energy and awareness from 145"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"W hen Eden, the state of divine consciousness, was lost to the original Adam and Eve, they became intensely identified with the gross physical form and its limitations.

Satan tempts humanity by his baits of greed, and promises of pleasure, and leads people to destruction and con- tinuous painful reincarnations. He keeps souls, like fish, in the pond of finitude and spawns in them the consciousness of mortal limitations and desires in order t o make them reincarnate on earth—again and again. As one desire is fulfilled, Satan insinuates into the consciousness new desires by ingenious temptations lest the soul escape his devilish earthly nets. In a way, Satan provided a means, witlessly acting as the tool of God, to ultimately free souls from their mortal attachments. Reincar- nation assures freedom, for it gives immortal souls ample time and op- portunities to divest themselve s of all false notions of earthly fulfill- ment, and to realize through wisdom their already perfect divine natures. With the expiration of desires and karmic consequences from wrong determinations, they will be liberated. It has to be conceded that Satan is exceedingly clever to be able to captivate immortals with material tawdry, after successfully mes- merizing them with forgetfulnes s of their endowment of divine trea- sure. Satan uses this forgetfulness to hold all created beings in their fi- nite state, identified with the physical body and consequent slavery to material attachment, instinct, and conscious and unconscious desires for finite experiences. Until man regains his lost Eden on earth, he re- mains an exile, constrained by the law of reincarnation to strive cease- lessly for the outworking of his human longings. S atan has a subtle strategy for propagating desires: the introduc- tion of the idea of pain, which is purely a mental phenomenon. The original humans had great self-control and a mind that was im- personally nonattached to th e body, and so did not feel pain when the —— body was injured. Originally, pain as a part of cre- Satan's strategies of ation was simply a heightened sense of awareness pain and sorrow, and to protect the fragile physical and mental instru- how man may defeat mentalities from injurious clashes with the objects them  and laws of gross matter. But by increasing man's attachment to the body and ego, and thereby his mental sensitiveness to their complaints, Satan made pain excruciat- ing. Every impingement of discomfort, physical or emotional, great or small, creates a desire for appeasement. Similarly with the affliction of sorrow imposed by Satan on the phenomenon of death: Death was to have been a conscious, happy 148"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"transition from the changeful body to Changeless Spirit. That was God's idea of death. Satan so influenced man's consciousness to desire lasting happiness in the physical body that death became a dreaded, painful parting from the mortal form, causing unconsciousness at the time of transition. Because of Satan's delusion, man fails to see the godly event that death was meant to be—a promotion, a liberation from toilsome, imperfect earth-life to perfect, everlasting freedom in God. Rather, the grief at being forced to depart the material play- ground engenders a Satan-devised desire to come back. Ultimately, however, Satan defeats his own purpose; for physical pain and sorrow are also prods that at last cause matter-weary souls to seek their preordained freedom in God. Emancipation is hastened by playing the living drama of a perfect life of health, abundance, and wisdom with a detached mental above- ness. Satan-engendered dualities of pain and sorrow are greatly lessened by a strong mind that does not exacerbate suffering by fear or nervous imagination. That is, if one can remove the consciousness of sickness and not fear illness if it does come; and not crave health while suffering from ill health, this helps one to remember one's own soul, the tran- scendent Self that has never undergone the fluctuations of either sick- ness or health, but has always been perfect.* If one can feel and know that he is a child of God, and as such possesses everything, even as his Father God does—whether he be poor or rich—he can be free. If one can believe in his soul-omniscience, even while endeavoring to add to his little store of knowledge, he can transcend the ignorance of delusion. All dualities belong to the domain of ignorance: fear of sickness and a desire for mortal health, fear of poverty and a desire for opu- lence, a feeling of inferiority from a lack of knowledge as well as a de- sire for a great intellect. Of course, if one is stricken with ill health, failure, or ignorance, this doesn't mean he should supinely continue in that state. He should rouse the perfection within him to express out- wardly as health, prosperity, and wisdom, but without acknowledging the pain of lack or the fear of failure. Man should know that his strug- gle for completeness is born of delusion; for he already has all he needs within his inner powerful Self. It is only because he mistakenly imag- * \"The Supreme Spirit, transcendent and existing in the body, is the detached Beholder, the Consenter, the Sustainer, the Experiencer, the Great Lord, and also the Highest Self\" (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita xm:22). 149"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"ines, while identifying himself with spiritually ignorant mortal com- pany, that he is lacking in these divine endowments. He needs only to realize the everlasting fullness of his soul treasure-house. The ignorant man stubbornly dreams about lack and failure, when he might instead claim his birthright of joy, health, and plenty as a son of the Ruler of the Universe. He is even now, in his transcen- dent Self, living in his perfect kingdom, yet in his mortal conscious- ness persistently dreaming Satan's evils.* God's awakening touch in meditation is the way to be free from pernicious delusions. Divine contact with the Perfect Fulfillment de- stroys utterly all seed s of earthly longings and attachments. The soul instantly recalls its inheritance of Eternal Bliss, which makes a mock- ery of all desires for exiguous earthly ways. G od in His omniscience must surely have anticipated the origin of evil in the outgoing powers of His creative archangel. But even though delusive duality was the only means by which God could organize a cosmic play in order to enjoy Himself through His many selves, He assured that no convolution of His design would be outside the embrace of His Goodness reflected ubiquitously Man's place in the in the Christ Consciousness.

He perceives the temporal world as reality, eternal substance—insofar as he is able to grasp the con- cept of eternity. He imagines the grossness of sensory experience to be the pure essence of feeling and perception. He fabricates his own standards of morality and behavior and calls them good, irrespective of their inharmony with eternal Divine Law. And he thinks that his ego, his mortal sense of being—with its inflated self-importance as the almighty doer—is the image of his soul as created by God.... \"Ordinary man is dumbfounded by the enticing propositions of illusory sense expe- riences, and clings to delusive material forms as though they were the reality and the cause and security of his existence.

Satan counteracts in every instance with deceptive, charmingly pleasant contrivances of temporary satisfaction to dupe gullible man into seeking permanent happiness in impermanent materiality. People succumb to Satan's offerings because he puts honey in his evil pleasures; they taste nice in the beginning but end in dire consequences. The Almighty could annihilate Satan in an instant. By divine fiat He could wholly subjugate the Satanic Force. Various world scriptures speak of partial dissolutions of the earth because of excessive evils. As described in Genesis, much of the earth during Noah's time was devas- tated by a flood. But God does not illogically use His omnipotence to arbitrarily destroy His self-perpetuating creation, for that would con- tradict His own laws and the independence of action given by Him to Satan, empowering that Force to use these principles of manifestation. Since God gave independence to man as well as to Satan, He can free souls only with their permission and cooperation. Satan has created such a delusive attachment to the instrumentality of a physical body that even if God were at this moment to offer liberation to the masses, I dare- say not many would be eager to depart this merry playground—to leave behind their accustomed bodily residence with its possessions and sen- sory opportunities. To most persons even the concept of an existence in heaven is of a familiarly similar, though far more glorious, sentient bod- ily form and habitation. The body-identified sense-oriented are rigidly unconvinced that it is worthwhile to forgo known pleasure for the ar- cane bliss of Spirit. So many learning experiences must be undergone be- fore man is ready to use his free will to choose God above all else. Earth, in the meantime, is the schoolhouse in which he must pass examinations in how to discriminate and choose between the soul-binding delusive patterns of Satan and the liberating patterns of God. Man rebelliously protests: If God knows that we are suffering, why does He, being almighty and eternally blessed, allow weak mortals to suffer from the temptations and scourge of evil? It should not be as- sumed that God is enjoying His eternal blessed state in selfish happiness; He is suffering the tragedies of man's existence, delayed evolution on earth, and belated return to Paradise through all-emancipating wisdom. His compassion is not elsewhere expressed more munificently than in His incarnate sons, divine saviors, through whom His silent Voice speaks audibly to man.

His message of God's love is that permanent happi- ness can be found only in God: \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt\" (Matthew 6:19). Possessing Christ Consciousness, Jesus realized fully the tug-of-war between the perfect, universally intelligent Holy Ghost Vibration mani- festing Divine Goodness and Satan's pull of imperfection toward the evil in finite creation. He exemplified the love of God the Father, and that Father's eagerness to alleviate man's suffering and ignorance, as God's power flowed through him to heal the maladies of body, mind, and spirit. He represented God's love for erring humanity in acts and sermons of forgiveness and compassion that showed how God is continuously trying to use the superior force of Divine Love expressed as parental, friendly, filial, and all-surrendering pure conjugal love to coax man to forsake his cooperation with Evil's forces of hate, anger, jealousy, lust, and selfishness. And he exhorted those he blessed to repent of their past wrong actions that had caused their suffering: \"Go and sin no more.\" Man cannot be held responsible for being tempted: Satan inter- jected into the perfect makeup of man's sentient being the potentials for terrible physical enticements that constantly urge him to transgress morally and spiritually. Satan thereby tries to keep human beings de- luded by greed, anger, fear, desire, attachment, and ignorance; so God uses the psychological counterparts of self-control, calmness, courage, satisfaction, unattached divine love, and wisdom to bring man to His Divine Kingdom. Though temptation is Satan's doing, man is respon- sible for not using his reason and will power to conquer evil by know- ing and following God's laws of happiness.

Recognizing the existence of Satan does not negate the conception of one God who alone is the Alpha and Omega in the cosmos. In essence, in real- ity, there is nothing but Spirit, the only Substance: ever -existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss. The evil of delusion exists only in form, not in the essence of the Spirit. As long as there is creation, a coalescence of finite phenomena in the Infinite Substance, formal delusion will produce the consciousness of a conception of imperfection apart from the Absolute Inimitability. In St. John 1:10-11 it is written: \"He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not.\"* Spirit, the Prime Cause and Substance of creation, pervades the creation It has made; but the world neither perceives nor understands this Divine Inherence. \"Made\" does not mean created as man builds a house. Rather, as water transforms itself into ice, so the Spirit, by the condensing power of will, material- ized Itself by cosmic delusion into a fabulous universe. \"He came unto his own, and his own received him not.\" That is, having manifested It- self as Its own creation, that creation did not \"receive,\" did not reflect, its true Spirit Essence. The illusory dichotomy falsely defined matter as a substance apart from Spirit, whereas nothing exists that is not Spirit, everlastingly indivisible. Spirit is perceived as the only Reality, the sole Eternal Substance, when one's consciousness enters the deep samadhi experience of divine union with Spirit. After attaining this realization, one is then qualified to say assuredly that there is neither a subjective nor objective Satan, but only the blissful Spirit. However, while the incarnate soul views its existence as a part of the dualities of creation, there must needs be ac- knowledgment that God and Satan are facts, even if the latter exists only in a delusive, relative nonreality. If one is dreaming, he cannot deny the resultant dream pain of the collision of his dream head with a dream-conceived wall. While dreaming the delusion of the universe, one cannot say tha t Satan or evil, or pain, or disease, and matter do not exist.

Jesus did not deny this Evil Force. His intuitive knowledge recog- nized this power as a conscious Satan who lured him with the patterns of evil arrayed side by side with the divine patterns of God. Address- ing this objectified Force, Jesus destroyed its binding effect with the power of wisdom in his command: \"Get thee behind me, Satan\" — which is to say: \"Let delusion be left behind my soul racing toward Spirit.\" It is folly to deny subjective or objective evil while one is still grap- pling with delusion. The urgent need is to be watchful and protect oneself from the destructive patterns of evil everywhere, as tempta- tions within and as imperfection and strife in Nature. One should never think it possible to best Satan at his own game. Just when one feels sure of invulnerability, the devil tricks his opponent with some ruse and the challenger loses. It is better not to enter into sport with his temptations. There are plenty of entertaining good games in God's playing fields in which to test one's mettle and prove oneself a worthy winner. One should rally the patterns of the Christ Consciousness- inspired goodness in one's conscience and reason, and in the presence of God as the harmony and beauty in all Nature.

The cosmic delusion of metaphysical Satan instigated psychological temptations of beastly passions, of cunning allurements for power and possessions, and of fierce mortal desires issuing from physical pain and hunger to entice him away from his transcendent wisdom-perceptions. The apostles relate that for forty days and nights in the wilderness solitudes Jesus was \"tempted of the devil.\" With God as his sole witness and ally, he fought off the Evil Force with fast- ing to conquer the delusions of body consciousness, prayer to strengthen the mind in faith and determinate will, and the ecstasy of meditation that reaffirmed the identity of his soul as an awakened son of God. A Jesus who was a ready-made, imported-from-heaven son of God, already complete and perfect, would have no temptations to overcome. The machinations of Satan, and Jesus' The human and divine victory, would then be nothing more than divine nature of Jesus acting. How could that accomplishment be a hu- man ideal? A God-manufactured spiritual being has no credit of being what one should become by self-effort, and is there- fore no exemplar for struggling, temptation-riddled human beings. The inspiriting truth is that Jesus was both human and divine: he was a liberated soul, one of the greatest that ever came on earth; and he was a human, who by spiritual labor of past incarnations of self- discipline, prayer, and meditation had reaped the plenteous spiritual harvest of God Consciousness. Through his accumulated develop- ment, he exteriorized the potential image of God Consciousness hid- den within him; he became a Christ, one endowed with Christ Con- sciousness.

During Jesus' forty days of fasting and self-denial, his consciousness remained on an exalted plane of spiritual duality: On the one side blessed by Spirit, and on the other cajoled by the Adversary. When he returned fully to incarnate consciousness, he was renewed in spirit, but felt the hunger of his mortal body deprived of its accustomed nourishment. As souls, individualized sparks of unconditioned Spirit, children of God are immortal, free from any dependence on materiality. The cells of flowers, plants, animals, and human beings were intended by God to live recharged by Cosmic Energy and not by cruelly feeding on one another. It is only when the soul is identified with the Satan- desecrated human body that man feels the hunger of dependence on nature's store. The Cosmic Delusive Force has led body-conscious man to believe that without physical sustenance his existence would be ter- minated. In turning to earth-products for nourishment (breath and \"bread\"), man remains earthbound, forgetful of his true nature that lives solely by the Cosmic Energy and will of God. Satan wanted Jesus to forget his divine state of unconditioned existence. He began to tempt the Christ Consciousness of Jesus by play- ing upon the primal need of the human body to satisfy its hunger. Satan worked through the mind of Jesus, expressing a tempting proposition: \"Why don't you use your divine power to change stones into bread?\" Jesus—being one with the Divine Intelligence that has vibrated It- self into solids, liquids, and gases, and is holding them in balance by magnetic, electrical, and thermal laws—had the power to manipulate those principles to convert stones into bread by changing their rate of electronic vibration. But he recognized Satan's delusively plausible sug- gestion as a ruse to encourage the mortal habit of catering to the psy- chology of physical hunger, which in that instance would have been a betrayal of the realization that as an immortal, he lived by God's In- finite Energy. This does not mean that after this experience Jesus foreswore human sustenance. He partook of simple foods, and of feasts prepared by loving hosts; but he did it as a God-man, and not as a deluded human subject to the body's habit of physical hunger. So Jesus answered the metaphysical Satan with a great vibratory force of thought within himself, refusing to misuse his divine powers: \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth 160"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"out of the mouth of God.\" Jesus quoted the scriptural truth, not the- oretically as do theologians, but from his own realization of the mys- tery and origin of life, experienced in his fast and intense meditation: \"I have found the divine way of living by God the Father through the Holy Ghost as the fountainhead of all life,\" he signified, \"and will not again acknowledge dependence on physical bread.\" Man is not sustained only by \"bread,\" the limited relative energies derived from the solids, liquids, and gases of the physical sources that nourish life, but primarily by \"every word\" (unit of — unlimited Cosmic Energy vibrating from the Holy Metaphysical meaning Ghost—the great Awn or Amen) descending into of \"mouth of God\" the human body through the \"mouth of God\" (medulla oblongata). To consciously experience this truth, as did Jesus, is to realize the eternal link between the human and divine, matter and consciousness—the irrevocable oneness of the Self with the Creator. The medulla oblongata at the base of the brain is the seat of life, formed from the seed cell, the original nucleus, entered by the soul at the time of conception. Like radio waves, which are unseen but can be drawn out of the ether by a receiving apparatus, vibrating life energy from the omnipresent cosmic source is continuously received through the subtle astral center in the medulla. It is stored in the dynamo of astral power in the brain, whence it flows out through the medulla— it \"proceedeth out of the mouth of God\"—and is distributed through- out all the cells of the body. If that beam of energy were taken away, the body would drop dead immediately. Man thinks he lives on \"bread\"—food, oxygen, and sunshine— but these are nothing but condensed Cosmic Energy. Radiant energy from the sun feeds plants; the plants are eaten by animals and humans; and in turn the plants eat them when they die. Directly or indirectly, solar energy is the primary physical source of life. When a person in- gests food, life energy in the body begins to work on digesting and me- tabolizing it, ultimately drawing the stored solar energy out of that food to supply the body. So the scientists say that the cells of the body operate by energy radiated from the sun, released through the chemi- cal reaction of oxidation. The very construction of protoplasm is made possible by this solar radiation, which gives off electric forces that enliven the cells. When man responds to the senses through per- ceptions and actions, he expends some of that energy; and when the body's supply is too depleted he feels weak.

The material agencies that support the body are only indirect sources of vitality and are dependent upon Cosmic Energy, the direct source of life.

Electricity from the generator recharges the automobile battery and restores its power to generate more electricity from its chemicals and distilled water; likewise, Cosmic Energy coming into the body through the medulla enables the body to convert food and gross ele- ments into life-giving energy. This same Cosmic Energy, in its univer- sal creative role, made solids, liquids, and gases what they are; when * \"What we eat is radiation; our food is so much quanta of energy,\" Dr. George W.

Someday scientists will discove r how man can live directly on solar energy. \"Chlorophyll is the only substance known in nature that somehow possesses the power to act as a 'sunlight trap,'\" William L. Laurence writes in The New York Times. \"It 'catches' the energy of sunlight and stores it in the plant....We obtain the energy we need for living from the solar energy stored in the plant-food we eat or in the flesh of the animals that ea t the plants.

The difference between materially active forms of energy (electricity, light, heat, magnetism) and life energy {prana) is that the former are merely mechanical forces while the latter, being lifetronic, possesses an inher- ent divine intelligence. In truth, the inner life energy is self-sufficient; it alone can sup- port the body. But through evolutionary generations of bad habits, it has been conditioned to complete dependence upon food—becoming encapsulated, as it were, in gross vibrations—and refuses to function properly, or even to remain in the body, without material sustenance. Man, as a \"food addict,\" has simply forgotten how to draw directly upon the bodily life force and its continuous supply of Cosmic Energy. When an opium addict is suddenly denied any access to the drug, he becomes sick or dies; similarly, when a person is addicted to Satan's delusive laws of the material conditions of life, which have become second nature to man, he must work off gradually such dependence by realizing his true spirit nature, or in ignorance he will die a mor- tal's death without those life supports. To live by the evolutionary standard of eating food is not a sin; but to believe only in physical means as sustaining life is delusion. Through vibratory power and the various forces of nature, it is ulti- mately God alone who sustains life, His power that digests food and changes it into bodily nourishment, tissue, and blood. It is right to give tacit appreciation and obedience to Nature and her ways, but the con- sciousness should remain unfettered by these material limitations. The seemingly solid body is itself a nonmaterial electromagnetic wave made up ultimately of underlying astral lifetrons, which in turn are made of Cosmic Consciousness. God has ingeniously condensed His consciousness into lifetrons, lifetrons into electrons and protons, these subatomic particles into atoms, and atoms into molecules and cells—all of which live by radiations from the Cosmic Source. An ac- tor on the movie screen seems so real; but he is nothing but radiation divided into light and shadow issuing from the projection booth. Man should realize the ethereal nature of his being—made of light and con- sciousness, divine and indestructible, projected on the screen of time and space by the creative Cosmic Beam of God. 163"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Man is a threefold being; his body is a battery within batteries.

The body, mind, and soul batteries are interre- lated. From the outside, the mind battery is charged by life energy gen- erated by bodily metabolism; and inwardly it is charged by the super- consciousness of the soul. Likewise, the soul battery is charged with a good mind, good life energy, and good chemical energy of the body from the outside; and inwardly the soul is charged by Cosmic Consciousness. A weak, dilapidated body weakens the mind; but a healthy body does not always mean a remarkable mind, unless it is charged with the superconsciousness of the soul. A diseased body discourages the mind and suppresses the expression of the soul, when the mind and soul are attached to the body. On the other hand, a strong soul, which reclaims its joy in meditation, makes the mind indomitably positive; such a powerful mentality in turn can influence a disease-stricken body to manifest healing and vitality. The more one daily meditates deeply, and feels his joy increasing, the more his soul battery will be recharged with wisdom poured out from God. Meditation, the company of saints and intelligent, mentally powerful people, good books, introspection, creative work in art, sci- ence, literature, and business—all further the development of a strong mind, receptive to the wisdom of the soul. Since the soul has descended into matter from Spirit and has made the imperfect body its playground, the perfection of Spirit and soul needs to be established in the mind in order to enable the erstwhile flesh-entangled soul to manifest within and through the body its Spirit nature. Its native immortality, diseaselessness, and immutable happi- ness must be evidenced in complete mastery of the mind over the body.

Every movement requires an act of will to empower it with energy. Merely to lift one's hand is to inject en- — ergy and consciousness into the entire system. When Will power draws one is unwilling to do a task, he is tired from the be- Cosmic Energy into ginning; but when he is willing, he is full of energy, the body One who does everything with willingness and in- terest finds that he is able to draw unceasingly from the reservoir of cosmic power. To remain apathetically passive and not use the will in a face-off with every duty and challenge in life—as some misguided dogmatists interpret Jesus' words: \"Not my will, but Thine, be done\" —is to shut off from the body the reinforcing free flow of divine cur- rents. It is when the will to live becomes paralyzed, by overpowering disease or other difficulties, that the death of the body ensues. By will power alone man can recharge his bodily cells, which are nothing but electrical globules. One who judiciously fasts for a long time will notice that he feels less and less need for food, that something else sustains the body. The currents of energy locked up in the brain and cells are drawn upon by the mind and will, which are capable of converting man's body from a \"wet battery\" to a \"dry battery.\" A wet battery is dependent on replenishment of its water supply to generate electricity.* A dry battery, however, is sustained by its own internal reservoir of energy recharged solely by electricity. By devel- oping his will power, man can gradually lessen his dependence on chemical atomic energy from gross food, and instead learn to sustain ing) and five senses of action (locomotion, exercise of manual skill, speech, elimina- tion, and procreation); and discrimination (buddhi). From these principles evolve the five life energies, the fivefold function of prana responsible for empowering the per- formance of the crystallizing, assimilating, eliminating, metabolizing, and circulatory activities of the body. Man is thus a highly complex aggregate of intelligent energies and consciousness, all of which derive from the soul and its source in the Cosmic Con- sciousness of God. *When Paramahansa Yogananda put forth this hypothetical metaphor, it was neces- sary to add water regularly to wet batteries to replace that which was lost in evapora- tion. The more recentl y developed sealed batteries, common to most users today, re- quire no such water replacement.

She told me that ever since her guru had initiated her into a technique that frees the body from dependence on physical food, she has been able to live en- tirely on Cosmic Energy. In all these years of noneating, she has never been sick or experienced any disease. Her nourishment is derived from the finer energies of the air and sunlight, and from the cosmic power that recharges the body through the medulla oblongata. I asked her the purpose of her having been taught to live without eating. \"To prove that man is Spirit,\" she replied. \"To demonstrate that by divine advancement he can gradually learn to live by the Eter- nal Light and not by food.\"f The atypical lives of saints such as Therese Neumann and Giri Bala are used by God to demonstrate man's essentially incorporeal nature. In higher evolutionary ages it will be the norm for food to consist pri- marily of oxygen, sunshine, and etheric energy.

His body survived without food, oxygen, or sunshine for forty days. When he was disinterred, he was pronounced dead; but to the amazement of his attendant English and French physicians, the sus- pended life in his body returned.* When the yogi puts himself in a trance of suspended animation, he halts decay in the bodily cells. While he is buried, the cold earth acts like a refrigerator, preserving the body from the destructive work of heat. The inner life force additionally creates a sort of coolness in all the cells, which helps to preserve them. In this state, the cells tem- porarily forget their bad habit of addiction to food, and live by the vi- bration of Cosmic Energy. Science postulates that each gram of flesh in the human body has enough energy in its electroprotonic constituents to run the electrical supply of the city of Chicago for two days. The life force in the ordi- nary human body is accustomed to deriving power from the chemical energy in food; nature's cumbersome procedures have blocked the process of living solely on the lifetronic energy stored in the electrons and protons of body cells. In the state of suspended animation, yogis know how to utilize this electroprotonic energy to keep the body cells electrified like trillions of dry batteries. All consciousness, energy, and forms evolve from and exist in God's immanent and transcendent Cosmic Consciousness. We exist only because our Creator allots infinitesimal segments of His Being to masquerade as a multitude of beings. The ordinary man thinks of him- self as a body whose faculties produce consciousness. Self-realized yo- gis, to the contrary, know that it is the consciousness and subcon- sciousness in the brain and spine that sustain and animate the body. They understand how to withdraw life and consciousness into the as- tral cerebrospinal centers and connect them with the source of all con- sciousness, God's Cosmic Consciousness. Just as ships can be controlled by a distant radio, so God sustains all thought processes and cells in the body by continually sending Cos- mic Consciousness and Cosmic Energy to them. Even if one is not con- scious of this Sustaining Power, no one can live without the inner in- * In Thirty-five Years in the East (London: H.

When consciousness departs from the spine and brain in the suspended body, death is instantaneous, and decay ensues. The suspended animation accomplishe d by yogis such as Sadhu Haridas is useful primarily for the purpose of demonstrating advanced psychophysiological laws. A suspended state of unknowingness is not necessarily spiritually beneficial. Any kind of suspended animation when one is unconscious outside and unconscious inside is only a men- tal chloroform and should be discarded. Certain teachers produce a state of suspended animation in animals or themselves by pressing glands. This produces a state of inner and outer unconsciousness which should be strictly avoided as metaphysically useless. In the spir- itual yoga of samadhi meditation, though the body may assume a trancelike suspension, the consciousness remains fully awake in one- ness with God in the bliss of conscious divine communion. In the state of divine ecstasy, the life force be- comes concentrated in the spiritual cerebrospinal centers and electrifies all of the trillions of cells of the body, not only preventing their decay but reju- venating them with a powerful elixir of Cosmic En- ergy. When the cells are electrified with this super- current, they cease their accustomed mutations of growth and decay. This is what is meant by ecstatic \"suspended animation.\" The body, being a cluster of atomic, cellular, circulatory, muscular, and astral lifetronic motions, depends usually * Consciousness as a factor in human sustenance is demonstrable in the phenomenon of sleep. The human mechanism must periodically be recharged by retiring into the subconsciousness in the state of sleep, wherein the consciousness and body cells are re- vivified by contact with the superconsciousness of the soul. The rejuvenating effects of sleep are due to man's temporary unawareness of the body and breath. The sleeping man becomes a yogi ; each night he unconsciously performs the yogic rite of releasing himself from bodily identification, and of merging the life force with healing currents in the main brain region and in the six subdynamos of his spinal centers. Unknowingly, the sleeper is thus recharged by the Cosmic Energy that sustains all life.

But the yogi in samadhi medita- tion consciously suspends the activity of change in the muscles, blood, nerve force, and all tissues, and supports the body by the changeless power of Cosmic Energy from Cosmic Consciousness. If one gently touches the spring of a fine watch, it will stop; and when the watch is shaken, it will run again. In the same way, when the body functions are stilled by quieting the restless activity of the mental processes, the life force and human consciousness cease their outward activity with the material world and temporarily suspend their slavery to oxygen, food, and sunshine; they learn to depend wholly upon the true body supporters, God's Cosmic Energ y and Cosmic Consciousness. To return to activity, the yogi stirs his will and consciousness in the spine and brain. When he turns on the switch of the will, the thoughts begin to stir. With the connecting of the mind to the sensory powers of perception and action, the life force restores complete ani- mation to the body. A Sadhu Haridas who can put the body into a subconscious trance state of suspended animation; a Therese Neumann or Giri Bala who can subsist on pure energy from the air, sunshine, and vibratory light of God; an avatar such as Mahavatar Babaji for whom breath, bodily atoms, life itself, are no more than manipulatable light and God-thoughts—all provide dramatic proof of man's potential to mas- ter the life forces of his erstwhile materially stubborn body. Jesus showed his mastery over the body by the manifestation of Cosmic Consciousness during his forty days of fasting and meditation. After attaining such a state, it makes no difference whether a master eats normally to remain in touch with his human nature, or whether he eats sparingly or not at all. Extreme examples are cited not as an objective toward which the average man or even the God-seeker should aspire, but to show that if such remarkable control of the physical being is possible, it is also possible for a person living a normal life to so spiritualize his body that he can experience the Divine Power as the real source of his life, and can consciously use that Power to help free himself from physical suffering and other grief-inflicting mortal limitations. Meditation is the method of realizing the connection between one's body-circumscribed life energy and the infinite Cosmic Energy of God, the connection between the conscious and subconscious states and the Cosmic Consciousness of God.

Jesus, Elijah, Kabir, and other prophets were past masters in the use of Kriya or a similar tech- nique, by which they could cause their bodies to materialize or dema- terialize at will—even as Jesus resurrected his crucified body; and as he witnessed, in his former incarnation as Elisha, his guru Elijah dissolve his body into fiery energy and ascend into heaven.* Deep samadhi meditation is possible only when all bodily func- tions are stilled.

To meditate when the stomach is empty is a good practice because the energy that runs the nervous system is not then as busy with bod- ily functions. Meditation after heavy meals sets up a tug-of-war be- tween the body consciousness and the soul's superconsciousness. With a full stomach, the heart, lungs, and digestive and nervous systems are all engaged in digesting food, burning carbon, and maintaining circu- lation to the lungs to rid the blood of carbon dioxide. This keeps the subconscious mind busy, which in turn injects its restlessness into the conscious mind. Such invasio n of the consciousness precludes inner God-communion. But when the inner activities of the body are still, the heart is calm. When the heart is calm, the life current is switched off from the senses, and the mind is freed from restless thoughts to concentrate wholly on God. People who habitually overeat and never fast harness the life force in their bodies to a relentless activity of burning carbon and cleansing venous blood, overworking the heart and keeping the five sense- telephones constantly active. Fasting in connection with meditation slows the activity in the muscles, heart, circulation, diaphragm, and lungs by denying carbon and chemicals to the blood, thus helping to *See Discourse z: \"...there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire...and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven\" (II Kings 2:11).

Metaphys- ically, fasting helps to open up the life-giving inner source of Cosmic Consciousness and Cosmic Energy.* Long fasting should never be undertaken without the guidance and direction of a competent preceptor. Long fasting (that is, for more than one day a week, or three days once a month or every forty-five days—taking sufficient fluids) is not necessary in order to demon- strate the vital sustenance of Divine Power. Nourish the body and spirit with meditation. The mind sets the tone for all the activities of the body. Thus, af- firmations are helpful: \"I live by the power of God and not by physi- cal means only.\" A state of such freedom is nearly inconceivable to the typical body-bound individual, who cannot even begin his day with- out first paying homage to his need for morning toast and coffee. But Jesus demonstrated the truth that man lives by Divine Power, and that by the proper effort he can become aware of his inherent connection with God Consciousness and Cosmic Energy. Meditation is the most effective way to spiritualize the body. Med- itative effort to make the body live on this higher plane is aided by right eating at all times. Even a spiritual man eating food injudiciously would find the body obstructing the practices that lead to spiritual re- alization. Dietetics is not delusion so long as the body itself asserts its existence in the realm of manifestation. Healthful food, pure oxygen through proper breathing, and sunshine are Nature's requirements for the upkeep of this body battery. * \"Recent Indo-German studies have revealed that fasting can prolong life span,\" re- ports an article in The Deccan Chronicle, Hyderabad, India, January 23, 1995. \"The experiments, carried out by the Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Experimental En- docrinology (Germany) noted that fasting conserved a lot of energy. This excess energy could be utilized for carrying out other functions of the human body or for keeping the body fit, thu s increasing longevity. \"During the experiments, which subjected rats to fasting, it was found that the turnover or replacement of internal lining cells, which requires a lot of energy, was completely stopped. There also was no physiological cell death, and intestinal cells be- came more efficient in absorbing nutrients, Dr. P. D.

There is a lot of truth in the adage that man digs his own grave with his knife and fork! Most kinds of meat (especially beef and pork) and other vibrationally gross foods overtax the life force, mak- ing it difficult to disengage its preoccupation with the senses and over- worked vital organs, and to reverse the current of life and conscious- ness toward God when one sits for devotional communion. One should choose a healthful balanced diet of natural foods rich in life force that are easily processed by the body—fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, some dairy products—and avoid foods in which the life force has been denatured or destroyed by improper processing or are otherwise unsuited for the human system.* Addi- tionally, fanaticism is to be avoided. A food fanatic, constantly ob- sessed with fastidious observance of health and dietary laws, will find his attachment to the body a real hindrance to spiritual realization. Eat rightly, never admitting dependence on food. Know that it is God's Cosmic Energy and Cosmic Consciousness that changes the food into the energy of life. The soul is above hunger and the desire for food. This does not mean that the spiritual aspirant should stop eating, but it does mean that he should eat properly and joyously to maintain the body-temple of God, and not just to satisfy sense craving. The sense of taste should not be debased with greed and indigestion from wrong eating and overeating; its purpose is to select and enjoy the right food to keep the body healthy and vibrant for the use of the soul. To eat only for the pleasure of taste produces greed, slavery, indigestion, disease, and pre- mature death. To eat for the maintenance of the body-temple produces self-control, long life, health, and happiness. Through fasting and meditation, Jesus realized fully that hunger is a delusion connected with the law of change in the body, and can be overcome—that one can live entirely by God's energy.

Great souls who change stones into attain the highest do not employ their powers for bread  their own benefit. Their unspectacular demeanor in personal affairs embraces the difficulties common to all human beings, whose struggles they have come on earth to share. The only power they use for themselves is their exceptional love and devotion for God. It is this supreme miracle with which they also seek to attract others to the Divine Presence. Miracles are held in esteem by earthbound mortals, who try to satisfy their own feelings of inadequacy by challenging God to prove Himself. But divine souls do not test the attention and love of God, because that is to doubt Him. If Jesus had invoked a miracle for the mere trifle of appeasing hunger, that would have been an assault on his faith in God and a denial of his reliance on God's all-protecting power. Jesus' triumph over this temptation was a severe defeat to Sa- tan, whose strongest delusion holding man in bondage is attachment to the mortal body consciousness. Satan saw in Jesus his nemesis that would snatch many souls from his domain, so he was not deterred in his efforts to prevent Jesus' ascendancy. Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto him, \"If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, 'He shall give His angels charge concerning thee': and 'in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone'\" Jesus said unto him, \"It is written again, 'Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.'\" Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high moun- tain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; and saith unto him, \"All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.\" 174"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Then saith Jesus unto him, \"Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, 'Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.'\" Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, an- gels came and ministered unto him (Matthew 4:5-11).* T here is an esoteric meaning to the above two metaphorical passages. The body and spirit of Jesus were tempted and taunted both sub- jectively and objectively by Satan. The Evil Force has many contrivances at his command. He does not always employ his eas- • • ily recognized objectified manifestations. Often his Symbolism of \"the best strategy is subtly to creep subjectively into the holy city\" and \"pinna- very thought processes and imagination of his would- cle of the temple\" be captive. In this psychological guise, Satan took hold of the mind of Jesus while he was on the very height of the temple of meditation situated in the \"holy city\" of his universal Christ Con- sciousness. The consciousness of Jesus was concentrated \"on a pinnacle\" of the cerebrospinal axis at the point between the eyebrows, in the heav- enly center of Christ perception. Satanic delusion wanted him to fall down to the lower region of the spine—the lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal plexuses—the plane of the senses with their bodily attachments. Although the consciousness of Jesus had reached the pinnacle of meditative intuitive experience of the Christ state, its residence in the body predisposed the mind of Jesus to be subject still to the temptation of delusion. Jesus' past delusive habit of identification with the body, finding constant defeat in his sacred consciousness, was roused by Sa- tan to make a culminative effort to dislodge the habit of his divine thinking. His memory of delusive mortal habits cast a tempting thought into his mind: \"Since I have regained in meditation my high state of di- vine Sonhood, it is safe for me to cast myself down into realms of bod- ily temptation. God will protect me through my guardian angels of spiritual conviction, intuitive experiences, and meditation-born wis- dom. Even if I fall into delusion, the angels of spiritual thoughts will lift me up again to my high estate of consciousness, and will prevent my foot of strong will power from dashing against the stone of misery- making spiritual error.\" *In his replies to the devil, Jesus is quoting Deuteronomy 6:16 and 6:13.

The consciousness must remain con- centrated in the truth of its transcendental identification with God, untouched by satanic temptations.\" All craving and desire in man should be transmuted and turned toward God, instead of being allowed to enshroud in delusion the God-image in man. Satanic temptation's delusive, compelling, con- flicting, happiness-expecting thought leads to misery-producing error. Divine temptation summons man to pursue happiness-making truth. Knowing this, Jesus snubbed the devil's temptation, and scorned its audacity to tempt the God in him. It is never wise to tempt the protecting grace of God merited by acquired virtues. Even advanced devotees have fallen into delusion by self-assured, presumptuous reliance on their righteous attainments as a safeguard against a lapse, even momentarily, in requisite right be- havior and discriminative judgment. \"Thou shalt not tempt the inner Divine Consciousness to prove Itself.\" It is for the devotee to remain always at one with the immutable Sheltering Presence. Again, the psychological Satan followed Jesus to his very high, mountainlike state of Self-realization; and in an instantaneous mental vision arrayed before him all the temporal power and glory of material possessions and position; and thus lured him with the thought: \"I will give you kingdoms of power and wealth.\" The psychologi- cal past delusive habit of pleasurable familiarity with the body, pressing its momentary opportunity to regain control of the wisdom-guided free choice and will of Jesus, made him feel that, having gained mastery over the laws of nature, it had the power to give him enjoyment of all glorified material things if only he would fall down to the plane of sensory grat- ifications from his high state of self-mastery and joy in Spirit. Jesus answered within his discriminative introspection: \"O ye senses of smell, taste, sight, touch, and hearing, you were made to be devoted to Spirit, and constantly to act and serve the soul in its con- Temptations of sen- sory and material gratifications versus self-mastery and spir- itual joy 176"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"tact with matter without interrupting its transcendent, conscious ex- perience of the joy of Spirit.\" The senses were given to serve man with perceptions of God incar- nate in matter, not for man to cater to their insatiable cravings—an in- novation of satanic delusion. As the servants of man, the God-created senses, guided with discrimination, produce self-control, long life, health, and happiness. Controlled by the temptations of Satan, the senses enslave man in the misery of body identification and soul forgetfulness. The Cosmic Intelligent Force, which has turned away from God, throws its searchlight of vibratory luminosity upon matter to extol it and captivate man with its shimmering tinsel glory. To use the soul's searchlight of attention for worshiping the spe- ciousness of changing, temporary-pleasure-yielding matter is to become mesmerized by the charm of Satan's sensory kingdom of finitude. To reverse the searchlight of attention and focus it upon the God- knowing soul in meditation is to behold and enjoy the changeless, ever- lasting, joy-giving Spirit. The great drama of cosmic existence honors man's free choice and power of reason. Man, made in the image of God, has the same lib- erty of free choice in his sphere as has God the Father. God can re- deem man only when in every way he chooses to —— act in accordance with divine laws of right living. Man's free choice and God is coaxing man with a limitless exhibition power of reason are of good happenings to influence him for his own his redemption highest welfare. Satan is tempting man with decep- tive contrivances that are pleasant-looking and promise happiness, but after a little evanescent pleasure give evil consequences instead. Man stands in the middle between God and Satan, each ready to pull him in whichever direction he wishes to go. Satan is on the left side with his kingdom of misery cloaked in ostentation, and God is on the right side with His kingdom of happiness bathed in eternal light. It is up to man to signal God or Satan as to which direction he wants to be pulled. Man is perfectly free to act, controlled neither by God nor Satan. Whenever he initiates good actions, or has a pure, en- nobling thought, that is the signal to God; and he is automatically pulled toward God, toward a paradise of Bliss hidden in the womb of eternal futurity. But as soon as man thinks or acts in accord with evil, he is automatically pulled toward Satan, toward entanglement in the realm of misery-making dualities. 177"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"When man succumbs to temptation, or is angry, or jealous, or selfish, or greedy, or revengeful, or restless, he has accepted Satan's in- vitation to come to his side. When man is master of himself—moder- ate, calm, understanding, unselfish, forgiving, practicing meditation— he is inviting God to help him. God is very anxious for all His children to get back to His king- dom, free from suffering and death and all other terrors and uncer- tainties of human life in which Satan keeps man constantly involved through bondage to the senses. Every time man is tempted to do wrong, he should remind himself that it is not his subjective mind alone that is tempting him, but also objective Satan. He should adamantly refuse to cooperate with the Evil One who would destroy him. That is why Jesus said, \"Get thee behind me, Satan\" (Luke 4:8) when that Evil Force showed him kingdoms of temporal glory, which could be his if he worshiped delusion. The wisdom of Jesus could not be swayed. If someone offered a man a million dollars, and someone else held before him a thousand dollars as an alternative, only a fool would prefer the paltry offering. Jesus spoke from his soul-realization: \"I have chosen imperishable Bliss; what care I for anything temporal?\" The deluded man muses how wonderful it would be if he were as rich as Henry Ford or Andrew Carnegie, but where are they now? Why desire things that must be abandoned at death? The great poet Saadi of Persia said: \"If thou dost conquer the world and bend all the people to thy will, what then? You will one day have to leave it all.\" As a result of the choice Jesus made, he has eternal life in God's Bliss. By emerging victorious from temptation, he is a shining exam- ple for all souls struggling to regain their divine sonhood. He showed the way: On the mountain peak of high meditation, Jesus lifted the veil of body consciousness, sense appearances, and matter, and identified himself with the \"only begotten Son,\" Christ Consciousness. It is then that a soul knows its divine status as a son of God. There was a time when I believed Satan was a symbolical force, a metaphysical delusion; but now I know and add my testimony to the testimony of Jesus Christ that Satan is responsible for all the creation of evil on earth and in the minds of men. I have consciously seen Sa- tan many times obstructing me by mysterious misfortunes, and by consciously taking materialized forms while I was receiving the grace of God. 178"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"On one occasion I was beholding the face of Christ, and just as he passed out of my vision I saw the evil force too as Satan. It was a terrific vision: Those tw o forces passed through my body, one of them the universal Christ-joy and In highest samadhi, peace, the other the great cosmic delusion. The Evil \"the devil\" of delusive Force didn't touch me, only tried to frighten me. As dualities departs from one goes into the Spirit he sees those two forces dis- man's consciousness tinctly; but when I reached the highest samadhi I found there is nothing else there but God. But before that realization is reached, that Cosmic Dichotomy will not yield its illusory reality as two forces, the power of evil and the power of Christ, the power of Satan and the power of God. When the Psychological Satan had finished tempting Jesus, the delusion of memories of mortal habit departed, for a time at least, giv- ing rise to the feeling of victory for the permanent habit of spiritual consciousness. The Gospel According to St. Luke notes: \"And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a sea- son.\"* The departing of Satan \"for a season\" signifies the transcen- dental state of fixed self-mastery, when the devotee rises above dual- ity and its compulsory struggle with evil. Every master who has attained the realization of the state of nirvikalpa samadhi feels the obsession of ignorance within him gone. With the disappearance of the mindset of ignorance that sees every- thing in terms of mortal consciousness, sublime changes occur within that advanced devotee. Under the influence of cosmic delusion, even sincerely aspiring devotees behold matter as matter, and see the dual- ities of good and evil and the relativity of consciousness, which reveals matter as different forms of solids, liquids, gaseous, and astral sub- stances. But when the influence of Satan is completely terminated, the liberated devotee finds only the presence of the omnipresent, ever- existing, ever-conscious, ever-new blessed Spirit. All evil, all discrep- ancies of nature, disappear as forgotten shadows from the conscious- ness of the illumined devotee. When Jesus in the wilderness was victorious in defeating the temptations of Satan, the mortal delusive habit disappeared, and the angels of Intuition, Calmness, Omniscience, and Self-realization ap- peared in the consciousness of Jesus to serve him with lasting Bliss. * Luke 4:13. 179"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"DISCOURSE 9 Jesnis IVieets His First Disciples Lahhi, \"Master\"; As Guru, One Who Is Master of Himself • True Gurus Draw Disciples Ly the Spiritual Magnetism of Their God-realization • Jesus Disciples Recognize Him as the Messiah, Incarnation of Christ Consciousness • Finding a True Gurus A God-Sent Guide on the Path to Self-realization • Unconditional Love, Loyalty, ant!

Still other saviors, such as Christ, serve the world both quan- titatively and qualitatively. The qualitative task requires the endeavor of the disciple and the blessing and guidance of the master in a mu- tual relationship sanctified by God. Students are those who follow the master more or less superficially according to their pick-and-choose inclination. But the disciple is one who accepts wholly, with open heart and mind. He does not have to be coaxed, but follows through his own will and determination. He remains steadfast, dedicated, and de- voted to the end, until he has found freedom in God. The Lord Christ and the Lord Krishna both had such disciples. God-ordained gurus feel intuitively the spiritual vibrations of their disciples, whether near or far; and when a guru mentally calls his dis- ciples, they come, drawn by their soul attunement with the teacher, the channel of divine grace appointed by God. In his supportive role of assisting the mission of Jesus, John the Bap- tist turned many of his own followers toward Jesus—in particular, those who had been disciples of Jesus in past lives. The first of these was An- drew, brother of Simon Peter; and the other unnamed person of the \"two\" with John the Baptist has been logically proposed as being John the Apostle himself, since his is the only Gospel that relates this episode. These two devotees, on the commendation of John the Baptist, and re- sponding to their own inner devotional attraction, followed Jesus to his residence, addressing him reverentially as Rabbi, or Master. The word rabbi is a Jewish title of respect which means \"my Mas- ter,\" a form of address recognizing one who is qualified to teach. Ap- - • plied to one's guru, Master is synonymous with the Rabbi, \"master\": as proper form of addressing the guru with the re- guru, one who is mas- spectful suffix of ji or deva: Guruji, Gurudeva, ter of himself Master. The word master may be traced etymolog- ically back through Latin, magnus , great; with magnus being akin to Sanskrit mahat (great; important, high, eminent: maharishi, a great knower of God). The widespread generic usage of master as a title (as also that of guru) to denote any ordinary teacher or mentor should not disrespectfully belie the proper usage: as an ap- pellation for a God-knowing, divinely endowed guru. From the cradle to the grave to ascension in Spirit, the whole of civilization is based o n the passing down of knowledge from the learned to the learning. The infant learns from his parents, the youth from his schoolteachers an d professors, the worker from his trained 227"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"supervisors, the artist or musician from his superiorly accomplished instructors. The level of attainment rises or falls with the aptitude of the \"student\" and the qualification of the \"mentor.\" In no other field is this as true as in spirituality. In India, where religious doctrines are melted in the crucible of testing experience to separate truth from dogma, the verdict is that the only sure way of finding God is to learn about Him from one who knows Him. The Hindu scriptures say, \"When a spiritually blind novitiate is led by a blind teacher, then both are misled\"—an admonition voiced similarly by Jesus.* God is The Master, ruler of the universe; and those who manifest their oneness with Him may also be honored as masters. A spiritual master is not a wielder of authority over others, but rather a master of himself, fully self-possessed and controlled in body, speech, and mind, with all his senses fully reined. He never allows himself to be compelled by temptation to do anything against his discrimination-guided will, un- like those who think that freedom, or free will, is to do whatever entices their minds. A master is he who knows in what lies the best interest of his true Self, the soul, and so never entertains evil in thought or deed. Self-mastery is the citadel of wisdom. When the title of Master is used in addressing a personage of this stature, it signifies reverence for him who knows truth offered by one who desires to have that knowl- edge conferred on himself by the guru. Andrew, after he and his companion had been with Jesus for a day, was so saturated with the spiritual magnetism emanating from Jesus that he understood who Jesus was, recogniz- ing him as the Christ. The Christ Consciousness cannot be intellectually inferred, but has to come through intuitional awareness. God-ordained gurus do not have to convert their inner circle of disciples by soapbox preaching; they communicate primarily by the silent emanation of the vibrations of their God-realization. My Master drew me that way when I first saw him, without introduction, in a busy market lane in Banaras. (I have written about my experiences with great masters and with my Guru in my memoirs, published un- * \"Fools dwelling in darkness, wise in their own conceit, and puffed up with vain knowl- edge, go round and round staggering to and fro, like blind men led by the blind\" (Mundaka Upanishad I.ii.8, translated by Max Muller, Sacred Books of the East, Volume 15, 1884). Jesus said: \"Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?\" (Luke 6:39). See commentary in Discourse 33. True gurus draw dis- ciples by the spiritual magnetism of their God-realization 228"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"der the title of Autobiography of a Yogi.*) The first contact between guru and disciple is usually sufficient to awaken memories of the ever- lasting bonding of that relationship. They feel a connection of oneness at first sight in their exchange of magnetism. The sum total of a person is expressed in his magnetism. His very being, in fact, has its origin in magnetism—in the creative ideational powers of man's causal body, the God-ideas that form man's astral and physical bodies and sustain the soul's incarnation. Through the medulla oblongata, Cosmic Consciousness and Cosmic Energy enter into the subtle astral cerebrospinal centers of life and consciousness, and thence into the physical body, as positive and negative currents, forming a se- ries of attracting magnets. Each individual is a bundle of these magnets, with attracting power according to their magnetic strength. Jesus was a Christ magnet empowering him to attract multitudes, as compared with the ordinary man who can attract very little. All the parts of the body that come in pairs—eyes, ears, tongue and the little uvula tongue, hands, feet, and so on—have their posi- tive and negative sides. They receive and radiate positive and negative lifetronic currents, each pair forming a magnet. The optical magnet can charm, enthrall, and strongly draw people; they will feel the mag- netism of the soul of that person through his eyes. Some highly devel- oped persons are able to spiritualize or heal others, even a whole au- dience, just by the magnetism of the eyes. The spiritual practice of \"laying on of hands\" to send healing rays into the body of a patient electrocutes the germs and other agents of dis- ease. There is tremendous power in the life force flowing through the hands, provided it is made strong by a pure, indomitable will. A will that refuses to be discouraged by anything, and that flows continually and energetically toward accomplishment of its object, becomes divinely empowered. The strong will of man guided by wisdom is Divine Will. As each person carries with him a telltale silent evidence of his own vibrations, individuals residing in the same house, sharing the same rooms, soon come to know each other, even if they verbally communicate very little, because of an exchange of the magnetic vi- brations of their consciousness, nature, vitality, and feelings. Each feels the silent emanation of the other's thoughts and life force, and the range and strength of his vital magnetism. * Published by Self-Realization Fellowship. 229"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Unbiased, spiritually sensitive souls can know people simply by looking into their eyes, or by merely coming in close proximity with them and feeling their radiating vibrations. Worried, calm, timid, brave, cruel, wise, or godly vibrations can be felt instantly even by people with little spiritual perception. Persons with ordinary perception are usually sensitive to others only when within near range of their magnetism. Great minds, how- ever, can feel another person from a distance, although receptivity is stronger if they have been closely associated for a while. Thus it was that Andrew's soul, after remaining for some hours with Jesus, felt un- questionably his Christ magnetism and could proclaim to his brother Simon: \"We have found the Messiah.\" In the words of Andrew we find the differentiation between the name Jesus and the title Christ (Messiah). Jesus (\"Isa,\" Lord of Cre- ation*) was his given family name, signifying a di- vine child. The title Christ was appended later Jesus' disciples recog- when he began his ministry and was recognized as nize him as the Mes- the one whose coming had been prophesied, in siah, incarnation of whom Divinity would be incarnate. Thus Christ Christ Consciousness signifies the Christ Consciousness, the reflection of God which became manifest in the consciousness of Jesus. The concept of Christ as a state of consciousness, as well as lin- guistic variants of the word itself, is very ancient, referring to the un- changeable Intelligence, the pure Reflected Consciousness of God, present in every atom of matter and every pore of finite creation—the Christ Consciousness, known from time immemorial by India's rishis as Kutastha Chaitanya. Jesus the Christ signifies that the body of Jesus was the vehicle in which was manifested the Christ Consciousness. The title Christ is more anciently found in India in the word Krishna. Perhaps the Christ title was first bestowed on Jesus during his sojourn in India. Some- times I purposely spell Krishna as Christna to show the correlation. Similarly, Yadava was the family name of the beloved Hindu avatar who lived in India centuries before Jesus,f and Krishna (Christna) was his spiritual epithet. Thus, the words Christ and Krishna are the spir- *See Discourse 5. fThe date of Sri Krishna's incarnation is uncertain.

Few were to understan d that the purpose of a Messiah, a Christ, would be to turn their soul's attention from the consciousness of attachment to little portions of the matter-world—country, society, family, possessions —to the omnipresence of Christ Consciousness. When souls, descending into form to experience the Lord's cosmic drama of maya-c reation, lose their identification with the universality of Christ Consciousness, they are diminished into limited egos entangled in mortal relationships, circum- scriptions, and national and social identities. Blind attachments lead to selfishness, quarrelsomeness, delusion of permanent possession, inhar- mony, worries; and on a national scale produce commercial greed, desire of wresting the possessions of others, and terrible wars. After accumulating a bewildering collage of adventurous and of- ten painful incarnations, the beleaguered soul cries, \"Enough!\" and a serious search for emancipation begins. One has to wonder how our Creator must feel that most of His truant children turn to Him only when in desperation, after being im- pelled by the scourge of sorrow. Nevertheless, whether through suf- fering, or wonderment, or discriminative reasoning, when they do be- gin to long for God and deliverance, and pray deeply to Him, God is touched and responds with loving help.

(He is often shown as dark blue to connote divinity. Blue is also the color of the Christ Consciousness when epit- omized in the spiritual eye as a circle of opal-blue light surrounding the star-opening to Cosmic Consciousness.) According to M. V. Sridatta Sarma (\"On the Advent of Sri Krishna\"), of the various other meanings given to the word Krishna, several are found in the Brahmavaivarta Purana. He states that according to one of these derivations, \"Krsna means the Universal Spirit. Krsi denotes a generic term, while na conveys the idea of the self, thus bringing forth the meaning 'Omniscient Spirit.'\" In this we find a parallel to the Christ Consciousness as the Intelligence of God omnipresent in creation, the Kutastha Chaitanya.

Discretion and caution are particularly necessary in accepting a guru, one to whom explicit loyalty and trust are given. One may have many teachers in the beginning of his search, but when one's heart and soul are confidently settled in a guru-disciple re- lationship ordained and blessed by God, the disciple has only one guru, and no other teachers thereafter.

The soul knows that it has found at last a true friend, coun- selor, and guide. The disciple strives therefore to reciprocate the guru's unconditional love, especially when tested, even as the faith and loy- alty of Jesus' disciples were often tried with nonunderstanding.

Such teachers want the student to see only as the teacher sees. Obedience to a true guru, however, does not produce any such spiritual blindness in the disciple. On the con- trary, the guru wants the disciple to keep his eyes of reason open, and in addition he helps to develop in the disciple another eye: the \"single eye\" of wisdom and intuition whereby he may act wisely out of his own free choice. A guru disciplines the disciple only until the latter can guide himself through his own unfolding soul wisdom. The God-sent guru has no selfish interest, only the highest inter- est of the disciple. Everyone needs a psychological mirror in order to see the blemishes that have become an accustomed and favored part of the acquired personality of one's second nature. The guru serves as this mirror. He holds up to the devotee a reflection of his perfect soul- image over which is superimposed the flaws of the ego that yet mar perfection. In ways both open and subtle the guru brings to the fore in the disciple lessons to be learned that perhaps for incarnations have lain shelved in the dusty corners of the consciousness. In an inevitable sooner-or-later choice the devotee accepts and learns or balks and avoids these admonitions.

Doomsday \"prophets\" find themselves embar- rassingly duped by their imagination and misreading of heavenly and scriptural signs. Only the rare true prophet who is in tune with the will of God can make sure and accurate predictions, such as the foreseeing of the coming of Jesus. Such God-given predictions are concerned little with temporal matters that blow in the winds of whimsical human actions and their effects. Their primary and loftier purpose is to influence the spiritual betterment of man with both encouraging and cautionary revelations. Thus, Moses and Isaiah and other prophets of the Old Testament who foretold the advent of Jesus were able, by intuitive foresight, to trace the law of cause and effect which governs the drama of human existence. They knew also the law of God that sends self-emancipated, Christlike souls onto the earth at different ages, when the masses, bur- dened with the sin of ignorance, are in dire need of divine light. And Nathanael said unto him, \"Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?\" Philip saith unto him, \"Come and see.\" Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, \"Be- hold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!\" (John 1:46-47). N athanael was a plainspoken, sincere man. He knew the back- ward, socially and politically insignificant status of Nazareth and expressed doubt that a savior would come forth from such an in- consequential place. Philip was practical, and without offering an ar- • gument sought instead to bring Nathanael into the Sincerity: a virtue of transmuting personal magnetism of Jesus. Philip virtues on the spiritual knew from the blessing he himself had received that path  Christ, by his very look and magnetic life force, could remove whatever stubborn impressions of skepticism had formed in the brain of Nathanael. The transforming power conveyed to one who comes reverently into the presence of a holy personage is referred to in the traditions of India as darshan, an experience that is a veritable purifying rite. 198"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Jesus gave Nathanael a soul-penetrating look, the vibration of which dispersed ages of ignorance; and like a shaft of light on a sen- sitive film, took an intuitive photograph of his disciple's life. Pleased with the image, Jesus said: \"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.\" Behold a soul that is free from satanic insincerity. Guilelessness means sincerity, the simplicity or natural state of one's true being, free from duplicity, dissembling, hypocrisy, and all other self-serving guises. It has no association with crudeness or rude hurtfulness in the name of being honest. Craftiness, the cunning to outwit others for selfish purposes or spite, is a demented use of intel- ligence. The quiet humility of guilelessness is the sapience that distin- guishes a truly spiritual personality. What magnetism it has! Sincerity is a virtue of virtues in the realm of spirituality. All other qualities a disciple may offer as the sum of his being at the feet of the guru must borrow a great measure of their worth from sincerity. Words and deeds are a sham without it. But a heart that is pure in its intention is the way to touch the heart of God. Nathanael saith unto him, \"Whence knowest thou me?\" Jesus answered and said unto him, \"Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.\" Nathanael answered and saith unto him, \"Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel\" (John 1:48-49).

Persons imbued with spiritual qualities have a refined as- tral nervous system, vibrantly luminous, while the astral nervous sys- tem of the materialist is bedimmed with life-sapping \"figs\" of sensory desires vibrating on its branches. Now Jesus may have seen with his divine vision the actual phys- ical form of Nathanael resting under a fig tree in a distantly placed scene. But it was the perception of Nathanael's soul and astral form that had attracted the consciousness of Jesus. With this penetrating in- sight, the Master recognized and drew to him yet another rediscovered disciple of lives past,f searching him out in the realm of astral mani- festation—remote to myopic physical eyes, but proximate to the vi- sion of the telescopic spiritual eye. Every soul is garbed with its own unique individuality. When a soul changes its fleshly garment from one incarnation to the next, don- ning a newly inherited racial and familial appearance, it is no longer recognizable to those who look only to physical features. But masters can peer behind the purely physical facade and with intuitive percep- tion recognize the soul's individuality, unchanged from one lifetime to another. There are even telltale indications in the eyes, facial features, and bodily characteristics that reveal certain similarities to the soul's garb in a former existence—signs that a master knows how to read. The eyes, especially, change very little, for they are the windows of the soul. Nathanael could feel the astral body of Jesus permeating his own being, suffusing his consciousness with vibratory blessings. With the enlightenment bestowed by that darshan, in which the disciple par- took of the omniscient consciousness of Jesus, Nathanael recognized in an instant: \"Thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.\" In awe, Nathanael spoke of the Master as preeminent in heaven and on earth: son of the Owner of the Universe, entitled also to the ter- * See God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita xv: 1-2. f Nathanael is commonly thought to be also known as Bartholomew, a disciple among the \"inner circle\" of Jesus' followers chosen as one of the twelve apostles. 200"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"restrial honorific of King of Israel—a diminutive kingdom situated on the little pill of earth embracing its place in the Infinite Kingdom of God.

Many people cling to their shadowy doubts even when an inner feeling urges belief in a truth; but when belief is transmuted into real- ization, mental wandering ceases. In the clear atmosphere of faith, re- alization continues to unfold. Jesus' words were said to encourage Nathanael: \"As you believe in me receiving my as- —— tral and thought vibrations, greater things than this Man's astral body as- you will be able to perceive; you shall see heaven cends at death and open and the angels of God ascending and de- descends at rebirth scending upon the son of man.\" \"Son of God\" refers to the soul, the individualized expression of the \"only begotten\" Christ Consciousness reflection of God om- nipresent in creation.

Jesus said to Nathanael that as he had already been able to intuit that grand other world that supports the three-dimensional sensory world, he would be able thereafter to develop further his divine sight: \"Through the opening of the spiritual eye you shall see the glories of the astral heaven, and the transmigration of luminous astral bodies as- cending out of death's dark abyss of discarded physical bodies into the light of the astral kingdom. Also you shall behold astral beings de- scending from the celestial spheres into the to-be-formed physical bod- ies of newly conceived babies.\" Birth and death—creation's most tan- talizing mystery revealed! At the end of each earthly sojourn the soul emerges from its fleshly prison, garbed in it s heavenly causal and astral coverings of con- sciousness and life energy—an \"angelic\" contrast to the corruptible physical form. Astral freedom is temporary for those whose karma compels eventual return to physical incarnation; but those who tran- scend the self-woven cause-effect nets of earthbound desire progress by continuing spiritual effort through ever higher spheres of the astral heaven and the even finer causal heaven, eventually earning enrollment in the Heavenly Host of perfected beings. Thus does each soul rise to its source in Spirit. Genesis in the Bible tells us of the universal becomings. In brief: \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void (pure consciousness, the creative thoughts of God that are the ideational causes of all beginnings).. ..And God said, 'Let there be light': and there was light (the basic building block of manifested forms—the structural essence of God's triune creation: the vibratory light of thoughtrons, lifetrons, atoms).... And God said, 'Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters (creative ele- ments), and let it divide the waters from the waters' (the subtle causal and astral elements from the gross physical elements). And God made the firmament (fine vibratory etheric space providing a background for gross manifestation and serving as a curtain to divide the physical universe from the overlying astral realm), and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament....And God called the firmament Heaven (the astral world secreted behind etheric space )....And God said, 'Let the waters (gross elements) under the heaven be gathered together into one place, 202"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"and let the dry land appear (materialization of the gross elements into a physical universe)'\" (Genesis 1:1-9). Heaven may be said to consist, overall, of three regions: where the Heavenly Father lives in vibrationless Infinity; where Christ Intelli- gence reigns—omnipresent in but transcendentally • - untouched by vibratory creation—and in which the What and where is heaven? angels and highest evolved saints reside; and the vi- bratory spheres of the ideational causal world and lifetronic astral world. These heavenly realms, vibratory and transcendent, are only figuratively \"above\" the gross vibrations of earth \"below\": They are in fact superimposed one on the other, with the finer screened from the denser manifestation through the medium and intervention of the \"firmament,\" vibratory etheric space, hiding the astral from the phys- ical manifestation, the causal from the astral, and the transcendent Christ and Cosmic Consciousness from the causal. Without this inte- gration—producing a physical instrumentality empowered by astral life, guided by individualized intelligence, all arising from conscious- ness—there could be no meaningful manifestation. So this earth and its beings seemingly floating in limitless space as the result of blind forces is not happenstance at all; it is highly organized. The physical cosmos is diminutive in relation to the enormously larger and grander astral cosmos, as is the astral universe in relation to the causal—both th e astral and causal heavens are permeated with the Christ Consciousness; and interlacing all is the Cosmic Con- sciousness of God, extending into the boundless infinity of blissful Spirit. No one can measure Eternity. Man has yet to plumb the immen- sity of even this limited physical cosmos; there are untold billions of stars in the heavens that still have not been seen. The Lord has Infini- tude as His space in which he dangles the intricately designed baubles of these physical, astral, and causal worlds, intriguingly reflecting as well as mysteriously hiding facets of His Immutable Being. Different cultures and sects conceive of heaven according to their racial, social, and environmental habits of thought: a happy hunting ground; a glorious realm of endless pleasures; a kingdom with streets of gold and winged angels making celestial music on harps; a nirvana in which consciousness is extinguished in an everlasting peace. Jesus said: \"In my Father's house are many mansions\" (John 14:2). These \"many mansions\" include comprehensively the Infinitude 203"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"of Spirit, the Christ Consciousness sphere, and the diverse higher and lower planes of the causal and astral realms. In general, however, the designation of heaven is relegated to the astral world, the immediate heaven relevant to beings on the physical plane. At death of the physical body, a soul garbed in its astral form as- cends to the astral heavenly level merited by the balance of that per- son's good and evil actions on earth. It is not by virtue of death that one becomes an exalted angel in heaven. Only those persons who be- come angelic in spiritual behavior and God-communion on earth are able to ascend to the higher regions. While persons of wicked deeds are attracted to astral nether regions and may experience something akin to periodic dreadful nightmares, the majority of souls awaken in a luminous land of incredible beauty, joy, and freedom, in an atmos- phere of love an d well-being.* The astral kingdom is a realm of rainbow-hued light. Astral land, seas, skies, gardens, beings, the manifestation of day and night—all —— are made of variegated vibrations of light. Astral The astral heaven of gardens of flowers, planted on the soil of the ether, light and beauty surpass human description. The blossoms glow like described  Chinese star shells, ever-changing but never fading, adapting themselves to the fancy of the astral be- ings. They disappear when not wanted and reappear with new colors and fragrance when desired again. Astral beings drink prismatic light from lifetronic fountains cas- cading from the bosom of ethereal mountains. Oceans heave with opalescent azure, green, silver, gold, red, yellow, and aquamarine. Diamond-bright waves dance in a perpetual rhythm of beauty. Astral beings use all their subtle senses as physical man uses them in the dreamland. The difference is that inhabitants of the astral heaven consciously and at will control their surroundings. The earth is so full of decay and destruction; in the astral world, havoc caused by any clash o f inharmonious vibrations could be remedied by mere willing. The astral kingdom is many times older and longer-lived than this earth. Every physical object, form, and force has an astral counterpart. This astral heaven is veritably the factory of life, the world of life force * A gloriously comprehensive description of the astral and causal worlds is given in Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 43.

Everything is vi- brating energy. Though beings and objects there have form and sub- stance and therefore seem solid, one manifestation can pass through another without collision or harm: just as with photographic tech- niques so many physically impossible things can be done in the movies. Colors on the earth-plane are crude imitations of their astral source. Lifetronic colors are beyond human conception, far more beautiful than any sunset or painting or rainbow or aurora borealis. The most exquisite colors in nature, if blended together in scenic por- trayal, still would not depict the beauty of the astral world; the mot- ley physical hues are such dense vibrations of their astral counterparts. In the delicacy of the astral land, neither dull skies nor blinding sun assaults the senses. The astral luminosity dims all physical light, yet is never harsh or glaring. The boundary of the earth is the cosmic sky. The boundary of the astral heaven is a deep circumventing nimbus, rainbow-like in the seven colors of the spectrum—diaphanous, translucent rays blended with infinite taste and beauty of the Father. Within this astral firma- ment are the \"pearly gates\" referred to in Revelation 21:21. These \"gates,\" of the luster of pearls, are the primary channels of ingress and egress between the vibratory spheres and the vibrationless realm of God, and for the movement of creative forces and souls between the astral and physical worlds. The pearly luster is the Lord's creative white light tinged with the blue of Christ Consciousness flowing into the vibratory sphere, where in the astral realm it is refracted into the multicolors of rainbow hues. Birth and death in the astral world are merely a change in con- sciousness. When the physical body dies, a being loses the conscious- ness of flesh and becomes aware of his subtle astral form in the astral world. At a karmically predetermined time that astral being loses con- sciousness of his astral form to undergo rebirth in the physical world. When the astrally garbed soul leaves the astral world, at the end of its astral life, it is attracted to parents and an environment on earth (or to similar inhabited planets in other island universes) which are suited to the working-out of that individual's store of good and bad karma. No one is born of a woman's body in the astral kingdom. There is only spiritual marriag e in that realm, without cohabitation.

A predominantly positive-charged thought of lifetronic energy produces a male child, a predominantly negative-charged thought of lifetronic energy produces a female child. The form of the child, as with most astral beings, resembles that of their recently discarded earth body, but without its decrepitude. The earth memories of astral beings gradually fade, but they meet and recognize many of their loved ones lost to them on earth — so many mothers, fathers, children, friends, spouses, of so many incar- nations; it becomes difficult to isolate special feelings for one over an- other. The soul rejoices to embrace them all in its consciousness of uni- versal love. Astral beings have all the faculties of perception and cognition to which man is accustomed in his physical body, but as instruments of in- tuition independent of the limitations of the imperfect mortal senses and rationalizing intelligence. The astral land is thus conspicuous for the absence of books, a distinctly material omnium-gatherum for storing and transmitting man's ideas and knowledge. Astral beings can concen- trate upon anything in the particular stratum to which they are assigned and know about its nature through the instantaneous knowledge- producing power of intuition. Though they need not depend on the te- dious methods of book-learning, advanced beings who wish to record their special thought vibrations have only to visualize those concepts, which are then immediately transformed into a permanent record of as- tral light vibrations. As there are both highly developed saints and also ordinary be- ings in the astral realms, they use their own degree of semi- or fully awakened intuition to complement their highly receptive astral intel- ligence. Only after a soul reunites with God is there no longer a need to read books or to concentrate upon anything in order to know it by intuition. The soul identified with Spirit already knows all and sees all. Advanced astral beings can traverse any plane or region of the vast astral heaven, traveling faster than the speed of light in a vehicular mass of luminous lifetrons. Ascending to the causal heaven of ideational con- sciousness, the causal being transcends time and distance altogether in the instancy of thought—with every experience, consciously willed, an exquisite throb in the tranquil essence of consciousness. 206"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"When Jesus told Nathanael that he would \"see heaven open, and angels ascending and descending on the Son of man,\" it was a prom- ise that man has a divine inheritance to reclaim the • - omniscience of spiritual perception, that heaven How to \"see heaven and its wonders can be realized in the here and open\" through the n0 w.     spiritual eye This son of man, this human body and con- sciousness, has become dissociated from its heavenly essence because of its identity with the physical world. But Jesus intimated that all those who tune their physical self with their spiritual Self can perceive the astral world and transcend the consciousness of physical limita- tions. If a radio is not properly tuned in, it cannot catch the songs and voice-information passing through the ether. If a television set is dys- functional, it cannot receive the vibrations of televised electronic im- ages. Analogously, the human body is tuned in with matter. That is why it doesn't perceive the presence of divine beings and all finer forces just behind the astral etheric firmament separating heaven and earth, and one's finer constituent lifetronic form within the gross man- ifestation of the physical body. Though paradise is not visible to the eyes of most mortals, never- theless it is real. There was a time when people would have dismissed with utter skepticism the idea of radio and television vibrations in the ether, but now millions hear and see them daily. Likewise, any devo- tee can tune in the celestial sights and sounds of the angelic realms through the soul's powers of super-audition and super-vision, when by meditation the inner television and heart- and mind-radio are freed from the static of restlessness and mortal desires.* * Since the divergence of science and religion in centuries past, scientists have typically greeted the idea of \"higher dimensions\" with skepticism. At the forefront of advanced physics today, however, is the theory of superstrings—a theory that not only allows for additional dimensions but requires them, writes Brian Greene, Ph.D., in The Ele- gant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate The- ory (New York: Vintage Books, zooo). Furthermore, reports Los Angeles Times science writer K. C. Cole, scientists ac- knowledge that cosmic forces as yet unnamed by physics may well exist in the other dimensions required by string theory. \"If so,\" she writes in The Hole in the Universe (New York: Harcourt, 2001), \"they could have far-reaching effects, and perhaps even explain some of physics' most difficult puzzles.\" String theorists explain that we don't detect the additional dimensions in the uni- verse because even though forces emerge from them, spatially they are tightly \"curled up\" to almost infinitesimal size.

(2) By overcoming the limitations of the physical eyes and penetrating the spiritual eye of omnipresent perception. Now as to the first supposition, imagine the chaos if the Lord were to remove the dividing firmament between earth and heaven. If heaven were bombarded by all the noises and discord of the earth, even the angels couldn't stand it! Heaven is heavenly because the Lord has made it a place of respite from mortal mania. Conversely, the physically circumscribed instrumentality of the ordinary man could not cope with the intrusion of a dimension it could neither enter nor control. God keeps man focused on the learning tools and lessons he is to master in this earthly schoolhouse. At the same time, the Lord has guarded the astral universe so that the cacophony of human be- ings on earth cannot disturb with the gross vibrations of their troubles the rapturous pleasures and meditations of astral beings. The door to heaven, through which one can enter the divine spheres consciously, and as a welcome visitor, is the spiritual eye in the Christ center in the forehead. The eye of mythological Cyclops is true in concept, but as a spiritual, not a malevolent, instrument of percep- tion. The third eye of the gods is a more accurate depiction: The aspect of God as Lord Shiva—God's power of dissolution for the renewal of fessor of materials science and engineering at Stanford University, maintain that higher dimensions remain invisible not because they are small but because they are \"inacces- sible to the physical sensory system, or to present-day instrumentation.\" A proposal that is all the more remarkable in that it comes from a Nobel Prize- winning physicist has been put forth by Professor Brian Josephson of Cambridge Uni- versity, renowned for key discoveries in subatomic quantum mechanics: \"Mystical ex- perience by self-development through meditation, etc., is not only the key to one's own development but also the key...to putting this attempt to synthesize science and religion on a solid foundation....If we follow this path of a synthesis of science with religion (us- ing meditation as an observational tool), what we are doing is using our own nervous systems as instruments to observe the domains in which God works. Ordinary scientific instruments like telescopes, galvanometers, and particle detectors are not going to be good in this context because they are designed to function in the material domain. Our nervous systems, on the other hand, are designed to allow us to interact not only with the material level of existence but also with the spiritual levels....All the different levels are open to exploration if we develop our nervous systems so that they tune in.

The eyes of saints in ecstatic communion are always upturned, locked in that center of divine perception. By the right method of meditation and devotion, with the eyes closed and concentrated on the spiritual eye, the devotee knocks at the gates of heaven.f When the eyes are focused and still, and the breath and mind are calm, a light begins to form in the forehead.

But by practice of the higher methods, such as Kriya Yoga, the consciousness is led inside the spir- itual eye, into another world of vaster dimensions.

In deep meditation, when the gaze of the two eyes is concentrated at the point between the eyebrows, the dual positive and negative currents flowing from the medulla into the two eyes reunite, and the med- itator beholds th e \"single \" or spiritual eye. Modern scientific evidence that our two eyes begin as a single structure is found in the research of molecular neurobiologist Yi Rao of the Washington University School of Medicine, reported in Discover, May 1997. Dr. Rao studied eye develop- ment in frog embryos and isolated the so-called \"Cyclops\" gene, which may control eye development. By the time the embryo is twenty-one hours old, the two dark spots that later form into the eyes are visible. Dr. Rao found that these two spots had orig- inated as a single band. His experiments demonstrated that if the brain does not sig- nal cells in this \"single band\" to shut down and allow two separate eyes to form (which happens in normal development), one-eyed tadpoles are the result.

Through the white light of the spiritual eye, the devotee enters Cosmic Consciousness; he ascends unto God the Father. Science itself confirms that with our limited senses we perceive only a certain range of vibrations of matter: We do not perceive it as its constituent dancing electrons, and the solid body as an electro- magnetic wave. In the spiritual eye, the veritable darkness of physical light disappears and the electronic and astral lifetronic nature of sub- stances is perceived through the sixth sense of intuition. The materi- ally formidable firmament between heaven and earth becomes only a diaphanous veil revealing astral scenes and beings. When I enter the sanctuary of meditation and peer through the portals of the spiritual eye, in a trice the lights of the material creation around me vanish and I am in that other world. The ordinary astral phenomena hold no in- terest for me, but it is the greatest joy to be in the presence of the an- gelic saints and of the Mother of the Universe. Angels are God-ordained heavenly beings who serve God's pur- poses throughout creation. They are either personified powers or qual- ities of God, or are fully liberated souls in whose beings the perfect spirit of God is encased. The latter, having overcome both material and heavenly desires and attachments, have merged in Spirit and then reemerged in bodies of pure energy—omnipotent, omniscient forces of the Divine Will. God's angels and exalted saints in the immanent-transcendent sphere of omnipresent Chris t Consciousness can move freely in any realm of Infinity. They can ascend to the region of The nature of angels, the Father; there the Self is dissolved in the unfath- and how to commune omable Blissful Spirit. Yet the impression of their in- with them  dividuality remains and can be reclaimed at will or at God's command. In the Christ Consciousness sphere they have individuality, but are in an ecstatic state. They dissolve their astral bodies there. When they descend into the vibratory region, they can be seen with astral bodies, which look just like a physical body, except made of a glow of light. That body has substance as a manifested form, but not gross solidity—just as dream images seem so solid, and yet are composed of the subtlety of astral light. By changing the vibra- tions of their super-electric forms, angels can make themselves large or small, visible or invisible at will, not only in the astral but also in the physical ether—as when angels appeared to laud the birth of Jesus.

It is not insurmountably difficult to see and commune with an- gels. But it requires deep concentration long enough so that all the dis- turbances of the min d drop away and the heart becomes perfectly at- tuned to the fine, heavenly vibrations. When the physical body and mind are restless, th e consciousness does not record the presence of angels and spiritual beings. One must know how to tune in with them in order to see the divine ones \"ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\" The heart, or center of feeling—the conscious awareness princi- ple in man, described in Yoga as chitta —is the receiver of perceptions, as the radio or television set receives sounds and images passing through the ether. The spiritual eye of intuition broadcasts those per- ceptions from omnipresence into the consciousness. Therefore, in a state of deep concentration attained in the practice of the scientific methods of yoga meditation, the feeling (the aggregate mind-stuff of intelligent consciousness) and the spiritual eye work together to tune in the finer vibrations of spiritual manifestation by refining and up- lifting the human consciousness, the son of man, to a receptive state. Neither the higher heavenly realms nor their exalted saints and angels can be contacted through such means as mediums or psychic demon- strations—which at utmost can reach only the ordinary or lower as- tral planes and their beings, or, more commonly, unreliable earth- bound entities.* In his words to Nathanael, Jesus spoke of this spiritualization of consciousness toward which the disciple was to aspire under the guid- ance of the Master; ultimately to see the highest heaven open and the physical body or son of man translated into a son of God. When the spiritual eye is opened and the consciousness embraces all creation in the Christ state, the devotee knows that his own true Self is an angelic being—an immortal immutable soul. He realizes that in the incarnate state it is the astral body that is the real body, the purveyor of life, sen- sory powers, consciousness — more tangible than the gross atomic form, and powerfully invulnerable to sickness, diseases, and troubles. * See Discourse 24. 211"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Satanic delusion transforms perfect soul-angels into mortal devils, or at the least into individuals forgetful of their divine status.

Devotion to parents is thus a part of devotion to God, which first and foremost is filial love for the Par- ent behind the familial caregivers, the Divine Father-Mother who has delegated parents to nurture the child.

Without this perceptive un- derstanding, these God-given relationships easily degenerate through the influence of cosmic delusion into limiting, unfulfilling attachments, with their sad partings and their separations at death. When the mother of Jesus made a request of him during the mar- riage feast at Cana, Jesus responded from his paramount loyalty to God: \"Woman, I cannot accede to your request just because you en- treat me as a loving mother. It is God only who can appoint the time and the means through which He will manifest His glory through me.\" Jesus meant no disrespect for his mother, and Mary understood. She told the servants, in an expression of faith in the Divine Will, to be at- tentive to whatever her son asked of them. Having felt intuitionally an inner divine guidance and permission, Jesus forthwith asked th e servants to fill six large pots with water, which he instantaneously changed into fine wine. All this he did before the eyes of his disciples in order that they might know that the water became wine through divine power and not through some sleight-of- hand or other trickery. The Gospel account distinctly implies that this first miracle of Jesus was not to accommodate his mother, or to display his supernat- ural abilities for the amazement of the wedding throng, none of whom were privy to what had occurred.

Systems theorist Ervin Laszlo reports in The Whispering Pond: A Personal Guide to the Emerging Vision of Science (Boston: Element Books, 1999): \"The fine-tuning of the physical universe to the parameters of life constitutes a series of coincidences—if that is what they are....in which even the slightest departure from the given values would spell the end of life, or, more exactly, create conditions under which life could never have evolved in the first place. If the neutron did not outweigh the proton in the nucleus of the atoms, the active lifetime of the Sun and other stars would be reduced to a few hundred years; if the electric charge of electrons and protons did not balance precisely, all configurations of matter would be unstable and the universe would con- sist of nothing more than radiation and a relatively uniform mixture of gases....If the strong force that binds the particles of a nucleus were merely a fraction weaker than it is, deuteron could not exist and stars such as the Sun could not shine. And if that force were slightly stronger than it is, the Sun and other active stars would inflate and perhaps explode....The values of the four universal forces [electromagnetism, gravity, and the nuclear strong and weak forces] were precisely such that life could evolve in the cosmos.\" Notes Professor Davies: \"Quite a list of 'lucky accidents' and 'coincidences' has been compiled....For a recent review see Cosmic Coincidences by John Gribbin and Martin Rees (New York: Bantam, 1989).\" Davies estimates that if—as some scientists maintain—there were no inherent guiding intelligence and cosmic evolution were gov- erned only by the chance operation of strictly mechanical laws, \"the time required to achieve the level of order we now meet in the universe purely by random processes is of the order o f at least 10 loSO years\" — inconceivably longer than the current age of the universe. Citing these calculations, Laszlo wryly observes: \"Serendipity of this magni- tude strains credibility,\" and concludes: \"Must we then face the possibility that the universe we witness is the result of purposeful design by an omnipotent master builder?\" (Publisher's Note) 217"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"delusion. As the Cosmic Lover of all souls, the Lord's one desire is that perchance man might use his free will to cast away the mercurial in- ducements of Satan and embrace the consummate fulfillment of Di- vine Love. If God revealed Himself as the Eminent Creator or spoke to the world as Indisputable Authority, human beings would in that instant lose their free choice; they could not refrain from rushing to His man- ifest glory. If He displayed His omnipotence in grandiose miracles, the awestricken masses would be attracted to God compulsively by these phenomena instead of choosing Him by their soul's spontaneous love. So even through the instrumentality of His saints God does not draw souls to Himself by using spiritual power that abrogates free choice. The maya-vitiated intellect of man seems nevertheless constrained to prefer some definite demonstrable proof of God's existence before turning to Him—in blind effrontery challenging his Creator again and again to prove Himself through \"signs and wonders.\" But if man does not take a hint from the evidence that every so-called natural mani- festation is itself a miracle expressing God's immanence, he is unlikely to get any other signs that he can better appreciate. It is easy to be- lieve when the senses are presented with comprehensible spiritual phe- nomena; no efforts to bring out the faith latent in the soul are then necessary. Jesus expressed this in his words to Thomas: \"Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.\" One who truly desires God has no inclination toward powers and miracles. It is the Lord's nature to reveal Himself silently and subtly — only rarely openly — unto devotees who crave naught else more than the Creator. At the proper time, before people who have the pos- sibility of spiritual awakening, He permits His saints to exhibit the ex- traordinary; but never to satisfy idle curiosity. Though Jesus had a unique role as a world savior that began in a dark, unenlightened age requiring open demonstration of God's power to make a permanent impression in the annals of time, he nevertheless often refused to of- fer spectacular signs and miracles to prove his divinity and God's pres- ence.* Jesus worked his miracles of healing, raising the dead, walking * See, for example, John 2:18-22.

First become like Jesus—drink the wine of his inspiration, the wine of God-consciousness, which placed him above worldly compulsions. Great masters throughout the ages have talked against the use of intoxicants. Their effects are very bad; they dull man's most precious endowment, his fine instruments of consciousness. One who indulges in drink finds all awareness of God obliterated. The temptation of drink, which provides a temporary euphoria, was created by the Sa- tanic force to divert man from seeking true bliss in God. The soul's need for refreshment in transcendence, which becomes degenerated under the influence of delusion, has induced every culture to develop its spurious forms of escape in inebriation, producing instead a perni- cious enslavement. God-consciousness is a thousand times more in- toxicating than drunkenness, an d elevates the spirit of man rather than degrading his potential. Jesus' disciples on the day of Pentecost were as if drunk; but with the wine of God-consciousness. One who is ine- briated with God needs no other palliative to ease whatever woes be- fall him. So the great ones enjoin man to sit quietly and go deep into meditation. After the resistin g restless thoughts have been stilled, the devotee finds his \"cup runneth over\" with an ecstatic divine elixir of joy. Jesus performed his first public miracle not to sanction intoxica- tion by the social use of wine, but to demonstrate to his disciples that behind every diversity of matter is the one Absolute Substance.

But to convert a substance made of certain elements (such as water) into one made of different elements (such as wine) requires atomic control. Jesus knew that underlying and controlling all atomic matter is the one uni- fying and balancing power of Divine Intelligence and Will—that all matter can be followe d back to its origin in consciousness if dissolved into its constituent parts . Jesus understood the metaphysical relation of matter to thought, and demonstrated that one form of matter could be changed into another form not only by chemical processes, but by the power of Universal Mind. By his oneness with the Divine Intelli- gence that permeates all creation, Jesus changed the arrangement of electrons and protons in the water and thus turned it into wine. According to modern scientists, there are more than a hundred dif- ferent elements of which material stuff is composed. Though possess- ing a multiplicity of properties and characteristics, all these elements can be resolved into electrons, protons, neutrons, and other subatomic building blocks; and subtle units of energy and light. Water and wine and all things else in material creation are made of the same particles, but in differing combinations and with different rates of vibration, thus constituting creation's endless variet y of substances and forms. The law of causation of all material manifestations can be traced to the activity of subatomic particles; but beyond that the operation of the law of cause and effect is lost sight of—scientists do not know why electrons and protons arrange themselves into different molecu- lar forms to create diverse kinds of matter. Herein nature submissively makes room for a Divine Intelligence, says the scientist, inasmuch as there must be some Power that directs the subtle electronic-protonic bricks to arrange themselves in different combinations, creating innu- merable substances in exceedingly complex configurations, including intelligent life-forms.

The vibrations of the creative thoughts of God differ from the vi- brations of matter in quality and quantity. Matter is a gross vibration evolved from the consciousness of God, and thought is the originating subtle vibration of Divine Consciousness—the active and activating vibratory power. Matter consists of relatively fixed vibrations of consciousness; but thought—the basic unit of God's creative activity—is moving and progressive consciousness, capable of unending transformations. Watching a child advance through the various stages of maturation, we can see the progress of changing thought within him. The child's thoughts are transformed into those of the youth, which in turn ma- ture into the thoughts of the adult; yet all these thoughts arise from the consciousness of the same person. Thoughts are subjective vibrations of consciousness. They are suf- ficiently differentiated to be classified, yet not as rigidly differentiated as objectified matter. Thoughts of fear, of joy, of hunger, of ambition —all these are different; yet they are interrelated inasmuch as they are all manifestations of the same consciousness. Every phase of thought touches other thoughts in an interchange of communication. Matter is vibration that gives the idea of the want of interrelation. Matter can be divided or classified in different ways without interre- lation; that is, each object has its own distinct fixity. You can divide a piece of cake and place it in two rooms without interrelation, but our thoughts of today and tomorrow are interrelated and are conscious of each other. The objectified consciousness of matter cannot think of it- self, or of its interrelation with other matter. It is fixed consciousness, instinct-bound. What is instinct-bound? Thought vibrations that gen- erate only one kind of consciousness. A glass before me, whenever I look at it, gives me the fixed con- sciousness of a glass only.

A natural stone producing the fixed con- sciousness of a stone can be modified, as when the stone is made into a cup. But human consciousness has its limitations; it understands the stone from which that cup is made to remain always stone. A person under hypnosis may be induced to dive onto the floor and make the motion s of swimming if the hypnotist has suggested that he see a pond spread out before him. Similarly, a process of cosmic hypnosis impinges on man the ordinary consciousness of matter, mak- ing him perceive water as fluid, solid things as impenetrable, air as an invisible current, fire as light and heat. It is cosmic delusion that gives the idea of fixed, differentiated fi- nite substances and objects with definite unchanging properties. The universal creative force, or maya, conjures apparent limitations in the Unlimited; it makes the vibrationless Infinite Substance appear as fi- nite things through vibration, motion, the process of change. In the ul- timate sense nothing in this universe is finite, except the various phases of change that materiality undergoes. Waves on the ocean are finite because they appear temporarily and then dissipate—again temporarily, until they rise again. When the ocean is thrown int o waves, and the waves disappear on the bosom of the ocean, would anyone say that the water in the waves has been lost? No. It resolved into its source. Only the particular surging form that the water assumed has disappeared. When water passes into steam, the collected steam can be con- densed into water again. Though its form and characteristics change as the water passes through various physical processes, in its elemen- tal composition it remains the same. Thus with all matter: Whirling particles, metamorphosing ener- gies, come together and part in an unending vibratory dance of change, producing for a span of time objects and substances that have the appearance of being finite, of being separate from other things, of having a beginning and end. Yet all matter in its underlying essence is unlimited and unchangeable: Its changing phases are impermanent, but the Power that vibrates into change is permanent. Deluded by maya or metaphysical Satan, the human thought-process cognizes only changing phenomena, not the underlying divine Noumena.* * Similar views are now espoused by visionaries of modern science.

Bohm offers an altogether new view of reality....'un- broken wholeness in flowing movement.' What is remarkable about Bohm's hypothe- sis is that it is also consistent with spiritual wisdom down through the ages.\" In quantum physics, the notion of matter being composed of definite particles has now been superseded by the discovery of an all-pervading \"field\" of powerful invisi- ble forces. This discovery, writes K. C. Cole in The Hole in the Universe: How Scien- tists Peered Over the Edge of Emptiness and Found Everything (New York: Harcourt, 2001), showed that \"particles of matter were in themselves rather irrelevant; they were only the spigots through which various forces flowed. A solid object, if you like, was something like a fountain composed of intersecting cascades of water, all flowing from tiny pointlike orifices. The 'real' stuff of matter was the flowing water, or forces.\" \"The concept of field,\" Cole explains, \"was a huge revolution in thought that re- mains completely unknown to most laypeople....[But] Einstein called the 'change in conception of reality' fro m particles and empty space to fields 'the most profound and fruitful one that has come to physics since Newton.'...Matter, in this view, is simply a place where some o f the field happens to be concentrated. Matter condenses out of field like water droplets condense out of water vapor in a steamy bathroom. Particles of matter are concentrations of field that travel through the field like ripples in a rope or a wave in water. The essential 'stuff'—that is to say, the rope or the water—does not travel from place to place. Only the kink travels.... \"This view of matter explains, among other things, why every electron in the uni- verse is exactly the same as every other electron, every top quark the same as every other top quark . A particle doesn't really exist in its own right. It is only a particular manifestation of a field. And globally speaking, the field is everywhere the same.\" Professor N. C. Panda, Ph.D., sums up the implications in Maya in Physics (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1991): \"Science has discarded the concept of pluralism and has accepted field or space as one and a single continuous entity as the basis of the ap- pearance of the multifarious world. This basic entity is one and continuous; it is the source of the heterogenous manifestation of the universe. The one gives rise to many; the invisible gives rise to multifarious invisible-cum-visible ones; the formless gives rise to pluralities of forms .

Inwardly, Jesus did not succumb to anger. Great sons of God possess the qualities and attributes of the ever tranquil Spirit. By their perfected self-control and divine union, they have mastered every nuance of spiritual discipline. Such masters participate fully and empathetically in the events of man, yet maintain a transcendental soul freedom from the delusions of anger, greed, or any other form of slavery to the senses.

The meekness of divine personalities is very strong in the infinite power behind their gentleness. They may use this power in a forceful dramatization to admonish those who are stubbornly irresponsive to gentler vibrations. Even as a loving father may resort to firm discipline to deter his child from harmful actions, so Jesus put on a show of spir- itual ire to dissuade these grown-up children of God from ignorant acts of desecration, the effects of which would surely be spiritually harmful to themselves a s well as to the sanctity of the temple of God. Divinely guided actions may command extraordinary means to right a wrong; but they are never activated by wanton rage. The Bha- gavad Gita, the revered Hindu Bible, teaches that anger is an evil en- veloping one in a delusion that obscures discriminative intelligence, with consequent annihilation of proper behavior/ If Jesus had been motivated by a real spate of anger, he might have used his divine powers to destroy utterly these desecrators. With his littl e bundle of cords he could not have seriously hurt anyone. In fact, it was not the whip but the vibration of colossal spiritual force ex- pressing through his personality that routed the merchants and money changers. The spirit of God was with him, a power that was irre- sistible, causing a throng of able-bodied men to flee before the in- tensely persuasive vibration of a single paragon of meekness. Spirituality abhors spinelessness. One should always have the moral courage and backbone to show strength when the occasion calls for it. This is well illustrated by an old Hindu story. Once upon a time, a vicious cobra lived on a rocky hill on the out- skirts of a village. This serpent extremely resented any noise around his dwelling, and did not hesitate to attack any of - - the village children who disturbed him by playing Meekness does not mean thereabout. Numerous fatalities resulted. The vil- to become a doormat lagers tried their utmost to kill the venomous rep- tile, but met with no success. Finally, they went in a body to a holy hermit who lived nearby, and asked him to use his spiritual powers to stop the death-dealing wor k of the serpent. * \"Anger breeds delusion; delusion breeds loss of memory (of the Self). Loss of right memory causes decay of the discriminating faculty. From decay of discrimination, an- nihilation (of spiritual life) follows\" (God Talks With Arjurta: The Bhagavad Gita 11:63). 229"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Touched by the earnest prayers of the villagers, the hermit proceeded to the dwelling place of the cobra, and by the magnetic vibration of his love coaxed the creature to come forth. The master told the snake it was wrong to kill innocent children, and instructed him never to bite again, but to practice loving his enemies. Under the saint's uplifting influence, the serpent humbly promised to reform and practice nonviolence. Soon thereafter, the hermit left the village for a year-long pil- grimage. Upon his return, as he was passing the hill he thought: \"Let me see how my friend the serpent is behaving.\" Approaching the hole where the serpent dwelt, he was startled to find the hapless reptile ly- ing outside, half dead with several festering wounds on his back. The hermit said: \"Hello, Mr. Serpent, what is all this?\" The serpent dolefully whispered: \"Master, this is the result of practicing your teach- ings! When I came out of my hole in quest of food, minding my own business, at first the children fled at the sight of me. But before long the boys noticed my docility, and began to throw stones at me. When they found that I would run away rather than attack them, they made a sport of trying to stone me to death each time I came out in search of suste- nance to appease my hunger. Master, I dodged many times, but also got badly hurt many times, and now I am lying here with these terrible wounds in my back because I have been trying to love my enemies.\" The saint gently caressed the cobra, instantly healing his hurts. Then he lovingly corrected him, saying: \"Little fool, I told you not to bite, but why didn't you hiss!\" Although meekness is a virtue to be cultivated, one should not abandon common sense nor become a doormat for others to tread over with their misconduct. When provoked or unfairly attacked, one should show noninjurious strength in support of one's just convictions. But even a pseudodisplay of anger should not be attempted by anyone who has the tendency to lose his temper and self-control in violent behavior. Jesus \"hissed\" at the merchants and money changers because he was not willing that the house of God be demeaned by worldly vi- brations of selling and individual profit. His words and actions signi- fied to the people: \"Remove this crass commerciality from God's tem- ple, for materialistic vibrations quite obscure the subtle presence of the Lord. In the temple of God the singular thought should be to possess, not worldly profit, but the imperishable treasure of the Infinite.\" The subtle law of magnetism is that each object or person or ac- tion radiates a characteristic vibration that engenders specific thoughts 230"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"in the consciousness of one who enters its sphere of influence. The vi- bration of a candle or oil lamp in the temple induces thoughts of un- ruffled peace or of the illumination of wisdom—light being the first manifestation of Spirit—whereas any form of commerciality involv- ing worldly goods stirs restlessness and sensory desires. There may be no negative vibration attached to the unobtrusive selling of scripture or other God-reminding books in the temple when offered as a service to devotees, provided the proceeds are used to support the house of worship and its spiritual good works. The selling of other merchan- dise in the house of God, and marketing goods for individual profit, set up derogatory vibrations contrary to the purpose and spiritual con- sciousness of the holy place. \"The zeal of Thine house hath eaten me up.\" The disciples cor- roborated the words of Jesus with this scriptural saying. The fervor to worship God inspired by a sanctuary dedicated to the Supreme Being should be all-consuming, uncontested by material zeal or vibrations that would swallow up the spiritual vibration of God's presence.* The subjective admonition to be drawn from this action of Jesus in the temple is that the sincere worshiper of God must reverentially observe the law of devoted concentration. To give superficial attention to one's prayers, while enter- Driving restless taining in the background of the mind thoughts of thoughts from the one's life enterprises—getting and having, planning temple of concentrated and doing—is to take the name of God in vain. The prayer manifesting power of concentration comes from centering the mind upon one thing at a time. \"Buying and selling\" — the unending \"busy-ness\" of material life—should be carried on in the marketplace of one's duties; whereas it is distractingly intrusive in the temple of prayer—just as an altar and preaching in a shop would be an unwelcome imposition on the legitimate conduct of commerce. Halfhearted, unconcentrated mental rambling during the time of prayer brings neither a response from God nor the focused power of attention necessary for material success. Though God tries to respond to the earnest prayers of His chil- dren, His voice resonating in intuition-felt peace is wholly distorted by restlessness-producing transactions between the senses and the outer world, and by the aroused attention-demanding associated thoughts. *The disciples were quoting Psalms 69:9. 231"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"The Lord recedes humbly into a remote silence when the temple of His devotee's concentration becomes a noisy marketplace desecrated by these mercenaries of material consciousness.

Great masters cannot be coerced to flaunt miracles just for effect, even when seemingly expedient, and regardless of consequences. An astonishing story is found in chronicles of the life of Tegh Bahadur, a great master in medieval India and revered ninth successive guru of the Sikh lineage. The saint was renowned for the numerous miraculous healings he had performed. Word of these wonders reached the emperor — a tyrannical ruler who brooked no opposition. He had the guru forcibly brought to court with the purpose of converting him to Islam; or oth- erwise to show his miraculous powers. Even when threatened to per- form or die, Tegh Bahadur remained immovable. Finally, after being forced to witness the barbaric torture and death of several of his disciples, the guru sent word to the emperor that he would compl y with the royal demand for a miracle. With a string he tied around his neck a slip of paper, declaring that this \"charm\" would protect him by miraculously deflecting the execu- tioner's sword. The emperor's swordsman was invited to put this claim to the test the n and there. Before the horrified eyes of the onlookers, the saint's severed head fell to the floor, the \"charmed\" paper falling loose on the marble.

Devo- tees who with humility seek from the guru the disclosure of his God- realization will see things much more wonderful than a display of phe- nomenal powers—as Jesus' disciple s saw, and as I saw in my Master. Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover; in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man (John 2:23-25). J esus was little impressed by the growing popular acclaim accorded him as a result of his miracles. He knew that in the fickle emotion- alism of the masses there was scant durable response capable of up- holding his teachings or adding one whit to his divine credentials. He therefore did not count on man's testimony as a criterion of success. The preaching of his gospel was impelled solely by God's infinite force. Fame is at best a fair-weather friend whose loyalty easily chills at an unfavorable change in the winds of public opinion. The best of one's intentions, if lacking in the stability of wisdom, is woefully sub- ject to the mutating distortions of erroneous judgment. A master well knows, without prejudice, the nature of man. He can instantly ascertain the salient features of any person's consciousness just by looking at him.

Ri- vals at court, wishing to harm him further, accused him of having worldly desires be- cause he gazed constantly at the emperor's harem, which lay to the west of the prison. When confronted with this charge, the Guru allegedly replied: 'Emperor, I was not gaz- ing at your queen's apartments. I was looking in the direction of the Europeans who are coming from beyond the western seas to destroy your empire.'

Knowledge of a person's character may be sought through various means. The different schools of psy- chology are able to identify specific personality types and their prominent traits. Other methods of ap- praising character have been advanced at various times—such as phrenology (study of the structure of the head), phys- iognomy (deducing a person's nature through analysis of facial and bod- ily features), and pathognomy (the study of man's feelings and emotions through the outward signs of his facial expressions and bodily move- ments, and through study of his emotional reactions to diverse incidents in his life). But these various methods are liable to bring about wrong conclusions. Socrates' physical unattractiveness caused some people to think him evil, yet he was an advanced soul. Conversely, sometimes an appealingly beautiful and fair-spoken man or woman is at heart a treach- erous human being. It is not the appearance or outer demeanor or renown that is the true index of a person's nature, but what he is within. A master responds not to the words of people but to their thoughts, not to any psychological inference but to actual perception of their inner self. Intellectual analysis or the deductions of reason are dependent upon data furnished by the fallible sensory instruments. Intuition is direct knowledge of truth, independent of unreliable sensory data and the in- tellections of the lower mind. Intuitive perception is deeper than telepa- thy: Even with telepathic awareness of another person's thoughts and feel- ings, it is possible to misjudge them. A master, however, knows people through apperception of their consciousness, by being one with their life. Perceiving the limited spiritual capacity of the newly converted throngs in Jerusalem, Jesus did not entrust himself to them, nor speak the full measure of his realization to their nonunderstanding minds.* His unconditional love and blessings embraced all equally, even while he sought from among the masses genuinely sincere seekers, such as Nicodemus in the verses that follow. * \"And great multitudes were gathered together unto him....And he spake many things unto them in parables....And the disciples came, and said unto him, 'Why speakest thou unto them in parables?' He answered and said unto them, 'Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given'\" (Matthew 13:2-3, 10-11; see Discourse 37).

It takes many lifetimes of physical, mental, and spiritual evolution to work out all karmic entanglements that block soul intuition, the pure knowing without which one cannot \"see the kingdom of God.\" The principal import of Jesus' words to Nicodemus goes beyond an implied reference to reincarnation. This is clear from Nicodemus' request for further explanation of how an adult could reach God's kingdom: Must he reenter his mother's womb and be reborn?!

Talmudists thought that God had created a limited number of Jewish souls that would come back as long as there were Jews....However , on the day of resurrection they would all be purified and rise in the bodies of the righteous in the Promised Land.\" \"The fact that reincarnation is part of Jewish tradition comes as a surprise to many people,\" writes Yaakov Astor in Soul Searching: Seeking Scientific Foundation for the Jewish Tradition of an Afterlife (Southfield, Michigan: Targum Press, 2003). \"Never- theless, it's mentioned in numerous places throughout the classical texts of Jewish mys- ticism....The Zohar and related literature are filled with references to reincarnation.... The Bahir, attributed to the first-century sage, Nechuniah ben Hakanah, used reincar- nation to address the classic question of theodicy—why bad things happen to good people and vice versa:...'This is because the [latter] righteous person did bad in a pre- vious [life], and is now experiencing the consequences.'\" That the concept of reincarnation was known to the Jews is evidenced in several New Testament passages, as when the \"priests and Levites\" ask John the Baptist, \"Art thou Elijah?\" (John 1:21, Discourse 6); and when Jesus' disciples tell him, \"Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the proph- ets\" (Matthew 16:14; se e Discourse 45).

But Jesus did not men- tion a re birth involving water.* \"Water\" here means protoplasm; the body is made u p mostly of water and begins its earthly existence in the amniotic fluid of the mother's womb. Though the soul has to go through the natural process of birth that God has established through His biological laws, physical birth is not enough for man to be fit to see or enter into the kingdom of God. The ordinary consciousness is tied to the flesh, and through the two physical eyes man can see only into the diminutive playhouse of this earth and its encircling starry sky. Through the small outer win- dows of the five senses, body-bound souls perceive nothing of the won- ders beyond limited matter. When a person is high aloft in an airplane he sees no boundaries, only the limitlessness of space and free skies. But if he is caged in a room, surrounded by windowless walls, he loses the vision of vastness. Similarly, when man's soul is sent out of the infinity of Spirit into a sensory-circumscribed mortal body, hi s outer experiences are confined to the limitations of matter. So Jesus alluded to the fact, as expressed by modern scientists, that we can see and know only as much as the limited instrumentality of the senses and reason allow. Just as by a two- inch telescope the details of the distant stars cannot be seen, so Jesus was saying that man cannot see or know anything about the heavenly kingdom of God through the unaugmented power of his mind and senses.

Jesus points out that after man's soul becomes incarnate—born of water; or protoplasm—he should transcend the mortal impositions of the body by self-development. Through awakening the \"sixth sense,\" intu- ition, and opening the spiritual eye, his illumined consciousness can en- ter into the kingdom of God. In this second birth the body remains the same; but the soul's consciousness, instead of being tied to the material plane, is free to roam in the boundless, eternally joyous empire of Spirit. God intended His human children to live on earth with an awak- ened perception of the Spirit informing all creation, and thus to enjoy His dream-drama as a cosmic entertainment. Alone among living crea- tures, the human body was equipped, as a special creation of God, with the instruments and capacities necessary to express fully the soul's di- vine potentials.* But through the delusion of Satan, man ignores his higher endowments and remains attached to the limited fleshly form and its mortality. As individualized souls, Spirit progressively unfolds Its power of knowing through the successive stages of evolution: as unconscious re- sponse in minerals, as feeling in plant life, as instinctive sentient knowledge in animals, as intellect, reason, and undeveloped intro- spective intuition in man, and as pure intuition in the superman. It is said that after eight million lives traveling the successive steps of upward evolution like a prodigal son through the cycles of incar- nations, at last the soul arrives in a human birth. Originally, human beings were pure sons of God. Nobody knows the divine conscious- ness enjoyed by Adam and Eve except the saints. Ever since the Fall, man's misuse of his independence, he has lost that consciousness by associative equivalence of himself with the fleshly ego and its mortal desires. Not altogether uncommon are persons more like instinct- motivated animals than intellectually responsive human beings. They are so materially minded that when you talk about food or sex or money they understand and reflexively respond, like Pavlov's famous salivating dog. But try to engage them in a meaningful philosophical exchange about God or the mystery of life, and their uncomprehend- ing reaction is as though their conversationalist were crazy. *See Discourse 7, pages 144-45. 246"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"The spiritual man is trying to free himself from the materiality that is the cause of his prodigal wandering in the maze of incarnations, but the ordinary man does not want more than a betterment of his earthly existence.

The person who wor- ships reason only and is not conscious of the availability of his power of intuition—by which alone he can know himself as soul—remains little more than a rational animal, out of touch with the spiritual her- itage that is his birthright. \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit\" (John y.6). ^T^hese words of Jesus rest upon the truth that both consciousness iL and matter are perpetual and self-perpetuating—they continue to propagate as long as Spirit maintains Its creation.  *  The Transcendental Absolute has a dual mani- Matter and conscious- festation: subjective and objective, Spirit and Na- ness: the perpetual ture, noumena and phenomena.

Man apprehends the phenomena of objective nature (more or less, according to their subtlety) with his senses and reasoning intellect. The noumenon behind the phenomenon — consciousness as the causal essence of man and creation—is beyond the grasp of human intelli- gence. Human intelligence can give knowledge only of phenomena; noumena must be known through intuition, the power by which con- sciousness apprehends itself. The ordinary man therefore cognizes the natural universe around him but not the immanent Spirit, and cog- nizes himself as so many pounds of flesh rather than as pure con- sciousness indwelling as the soul. Thus man is born of both flesh and consciousness, and flesh has become predominant. The body born of flesh has the limitations of the flesh, whereas the soul, born of the Spirit, has potentially limitless powers. By meditation, man's consciousness is transferred from the body to the soul, and through the soul's power of intuition he experi- ences himself not as a mortal body (a phenomenon of objective na- ture), but as immortal indwelling consciousness, one with the noume- nal Divine Essence.* * Man's angelic astral body of light and life energy, which possesses an invisible coun- terpart for all the physical organs and which interfaces with the fleshly body through the brain and the intricate physical and astral pathways of life energy, helps to explain the so-called \"phantom limb phenomenon,\" known to persons who lose a limb through accident or surgery. Thoug h physically missing, that limb may remain intact in the as- tral body, causing amputees to feel sensations and movements in the missing limb ex- actly as if i t were still part of the body. \"For nearly 70 percent of them their missing arms, hands, legs, or feet continue to experience all-too-real feelings of pressure, pain, warmth, cold, tingling, or other sensations,\" according to The Mind and the Brain by Jeffrey M. Schwartz, M.D., and Sharon Begley (New York: HarperCollins, 2002). In Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind (New York: HarperCollins, 1998), Professor V. S. Ramachandran, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Center for Brain and Cognition at the University of California at San Diego, describes the complex neurological mechanism behind this phenomenon. His research has re- vealed how amazingly lifelike are the sensations and kinesthetic reality maintained by the brains of those with phantom body parts. These experiments, he says, \"have helped us understand what is going on in the brains of patients with phantoms....But there's a deeper message here: Your own body is a phantom, one that your brain has tem- porarily constructed purely for convenience.... \"For your entire life, you've been walking around assuming that your 'self' is an- chored to a single body that remains stable and permanent at least until death.

J esus was describing a metaphysical law of noumena (substance, or cause) and phenomena (the appearances of substances, or effect) when he compared the Spirit, and the souls emerg- - ing from It, with the invisible wind, and its presence \"The wind bloweth declared by its sound. Just as the source of the wind where it listeth.... \" is hidden but the wind is made known by its sound, so the Spirit-substance is invisible, hidden beyond the reach of human senses; and the incarnate souls born of the Spirit are the visible phe- nomena. By the sound, the invisible wind is known. By the presence of intelligent souls, the invisible Spirit is declared. Jesus was stating that, as it is difficult to find the source of the wind, so it is difficult to find the Spirit-Source from which all things come. There is a parallel quotation in the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita (11:28): \"The beginning of all creatures is veiled, the middle is mani- fested, and the end again is imperceptible.\" All beings come from the ocean of Spirit and dissolve again in the ocean of Spirit. Everything emerges from the Invisible, to play upon this earth for a little while, and then enters the invisible state again at the end of life. Only the middle of life we behold; the beginning and end are hidden from sight in the subtler spiritual realms. To illustrate: Think of a huge chain out in the ocean. If you lift the middle of the chain above the surface of the water, you can see a few of its links, but the ends are still unseen in the depths. So the outer manifestations of life are perceptible to man's sensory mind, but their origin and ultimate destiny are unknown to man in ordinary to think about it, let alone question it.

Man remains firmly convinced that he is essentially a body, even though he daily receives proof to the contrary. Every night in sleep, \"the little death,\" he discards his identification with the physical form and is reborn as invisible consciousness. Why is it that man is compelled to sleep? Because sleep is a reminder of what is beyond the state of sleep— the state of th e soul.* Mortal existence could not be borne without at least subconscious contact with the soul, which is provided by sleep. At nighttime man dumps the body into the subconscious and becomes an angel; in the daytime he becomes once more a devil, divorced from Spirit by the desires and sensations of the body. By Kriya Yoga meditation he can be a god in the daytime, like Christ and the Great Ones. He goes be- yond the subconscious to the superconscious, and dissolves the con- sciousness of the body in the ecstasy of God. One who can do this is born again. He knows his soul as a waft of the invisible wind of Spirit—soar- ing free in the unbounded heavens, entrapped no longer in a whirling dust devil traipsing heedlessly over the toilsome tracks of matter. This earth is a habitat of trouble and suffering, but the kingdom of God that is behind this material plane is an abode of freedom and bliss. The soul of the awakening man has followed a hard-earned way —many incarnations of upward evolution—in order to arrive at the human state and the possibility to reclaim his lost divinity. Yet how many human births have been wasted in preoccupation with food and money and gratification of the body and egoistic emotions! Each per- son should ask himself how he is using the precious moments of this present birth.

When one is very desirous to know Truth, God sends a master through whose devotion and realization He plants His love in that person's heart. Human birth is given by one's parents; but the spiritual birth is given by the God-ordained guru. In the Vedic tradition of ancient In- dia, the newly born child is called kayastha, which means \"body iden- tified.\" The two physical eyes, which look into alluring matter, are be- queathed by the physical parents; but at the time of initiation, spiritual baptism, the spiritual eye is opened by the guru. Through the help of the guru, the initiate learns to use this telescopic eye to see Spirit, and then becomes dwija, \"twice-born\"—the same metaphysical terminol- ogy used by Jesus—and begins his progress toward the state of be- coming a Brahmin, one who knows Brahman or Spirit.* The matter-bound soul, lifted into the Spirit by God-contact, is born a second time, in Spirit. Alas, even in India this initiation from body consciousness to spiritual consciousness has become just a for- mality, a caste ceremony performed on young Brahmin boys by ordi- nary priests—tantamount to th e symbolic ritual of baptism with wa- ter. But Jesus, like great Hindu masters of ancient and modern times, conferred the actual baptism of Spirit—\"with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.\" A true guru is one who can change the disciple's brain cells by the spiritual current flowing from God through his enlightened consciousness. All will feel that change who are in tune—who medi- tate sincerely and deeply and, as in the practice of Kriya Yoga, learn to send the divine current into the brain cells. The soul is bound to the body by cords o f karma, woven by lifetimes of material desires, be- havior, and habits.

Belief alone will not give the soul a permanent place in heaven after death; it is necessary to have communion with God now. Human beings are made angels on earth, not in heaven. At death, wherever one leaves off in his progress, he will have to start in again in a new incarnation. After sleep one is the same as before sleep; after death one is the same as before death. That is why Christ and the Masters say it is necessary to become saintly before the sleep of death. It cannot be done by filling the mind with mortal attachments and useless diversions. One who is engrossed in storing up treasure on earth is not busy with God; one who is in- tent on God does not want many fillers in his life. It is by freeing one- self from earthly desires that one gains entry into the kingdom of God. The Lord patiently waits for one hundred percent of man's devotion; for those who diligently seek Him every day, and who fulfill His com- mandments through godly behavior, He opens the door to the king- dom of His presence.

Jesus, with his intuition, had full realization of the noumena supporting the workings of the cosmos and its diversity of life, so he said authoritatively: \"We do know.\" Jesus was attuned to the grand scheme of manifestation behind all space, behind earthly vision. To belligerent minds he could not speak openly of his omnipresent perceptions — even the truths he did tell brought crucifixion! He said to Nicodemus: \"If I tell you about mat- ters pertaining to human souls who are visibly present on earth, and how they can enter into the kingdom of God, and you believe not, then how can you believe me if I tell you about happenings in the heavenly realms, which are completely hidden from the ordinary human gaze?\" Though Jesus regretted, with accommodating patience, that Nicodemus doubted the intuitional revelations of the Christ state, he went on to tell his visitor the way in which he—and any other seeker of truth—could experience these truths for himself. So many doubt heaven because they do not see it. Yet they do not doubt the breeze simply because it is unseen. It is known by its sound and sensation on the skin and the motion in the leaves and other ob- jects.

So not only Jesus but all of God's children have \"come down from heaven.\" Just as the little threads of flame percolating through the holes of a gas burner are part of the one flame under the burner plate, so also the one flame o f Spirit underlying all creation appears as a separate soul-flame in every individual being. When the burner is turned off, the many individual jets retire into the one central flame. The separate threads of fire had first to come out of the primary flame before they could go back into it. This illustrates what Jesus said about souls as- cending to heaven, having descended from heaven. No human body has ascended into heaven, the etheric essence of which does not accommodate corporeal forms; but all souls can and will enter the supernal realms when, through death or through spiri- tual transcendence, they cast off physical consciousness and know themselves as angelic beings garbed in thought and light. We are all made in the image of God, beings of immortal con- sciousness cloaked in diaphanou s heavenly light—a heritage buried beneath the cloddish flesh. That heritage we can only acknowledge by meditation. There is no other way—not by reading books, not by philosophical study, but by devotion and continuous prayer and sci- entific meditation that uplifts the consciousness to God.

Or, at the behest of the Divine Father, they may voluntarily return to earth in a new incarnation to usher souls from the realm of delusion into the kingdom of God. While Jesus, in his God-ordained incarnation, was effectually en- gaged in his Heavenly Father's work in the world, he could in truth pro- claim: \"I am i n heaven.\" This is the highest ecstasy of God-consciousness, defined by yogis as nirvikalpa samadhi, an ecstatic state \"without differ- ence\" between external consciousness and interior God-union. In savikalpa samadhi, \"with difference,\" a less exalted state, one is not con- scious of the outer world; the body enters an inert trance while the awareness is immersed in interior conscious oneness with God. The most advanced masters can be fully conscious of God and not show any signs of the body being transfixed; the devotee drinks God and simultaneously is conscious and fully active in his external environment—if he so chooses. This declaration of Jesus offers great encour- agement to every soul: Although man is beset with the perplexities that accompany residence in a physical body, God has provided him with the po- tential to remain in heavenly consciousness regard- less of outer circumstances. An inebriate takes his drunkenness with him no matter where he goes. One who is sick is all the time preoccupied with his sickness.

Schimberg describes several occasions on which this Christian saint has appeared before, and conversed with, distant persons needing her help.

And the one who is conscious of God enjoys that supreme Bliss whether he is active in the outer world or absorbed in inner communion. When one is engrossed in watching a convincingly played scene of tragedy in a motion picture, it may so impinge itself on the con- sciousness and emotions that it begins to feel real. But when one is troubled by a particular scene of cruelty, such as the catastrophic de- struction of human life in a burning city, if the viewer looks up from the picture to the beam of light from the projector and analyzes its re- lation to the figures and events on the screen, the seemingly real ma- terial nature of everything being shown—buildings, landscapes, the misery of human beings—is seen as nothing but light. Likewise, the materially engrossed individual beholds his ever- changing surroundings, birth, death, marriage, acquisition and loss, as material facts. But the individual who awakens into the consciousness of God through constant ecstasy, or union with God, begins to see a light trembling in all creation. He perceives that the different forms of matter—solids, liquids, gaseous substances—as well as human life and thought, are nothing but the diverse vibrations of that all-pervading, quivering light of God. By further development one can actually per- ceive God as the Almighty Creator dreaming this Cosmic Dream. While watching a movie, one person might concentrate on the pic- tures, while another might keep his attention on the projection beam that causes their \"materialization\" on the screen. The moviegoing experience of these two individuals would be quite different—one becoming im- mersed in the story, forgetful of the beam; and the other seeing only rays of light without an y pictures. But there is a third possibility: a person sit- ting in the motion-picture house enjoying the pictures on the screen, while remembering their source by keeping a part of his attention on the pictureless beam. A person concentratin g on matter will see only material objects, and a person absorbed in God's light in the initial state of ecstasy (savikalpa samadhi) beholds only God. But one who has advanced to the highest state of consciousness, nirvikalpa samadhi, sees the great pictureless light of Cosmic Energy coming from God, and simulta- neously beholds on the vast screen of space the motion picture of the universe produced by God's Creative Light.

Again and again in the Gospels, Jesus emphasizes that what he attained, all may attain. His next re- mark to Nicodemus shows how. Jesus said that each son of man, each bodily consciousness, must be lifted from the plane of the senses to the astral kingdom by reversing the matter- bent outflowing of the life force to ascension through the serpent-like coiled passage at the base of the spine—the son of man is lifted up when this serpen- tine force is uplifted, \"as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness.\"* We must reascend, jus t as Moses, in the spiritual wilderness of silence in which all his desires were no more, lifted his soul from body con- * Reference is to Exodus 4:2-4. When in the wilderness God spoke to Moses out of the burning bush, Moses asked of God some sign of spiritual authority by which he could be recognized as sent by God to accomplish the tasks to which God had ap- pointed him. \"And the Lord said unto him, 'What is that in thine hand?' And he said, 'A rod.' And He said, 'Cast it on the ground.' And he cast it on the ground, and it be- came a serpent....And the Lord said unto Moses, 'Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail.' And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand.\" The \"rod\" is th e spine, in which reside the subtle astral centers of life and con- sciousness that are the dynamos not only of all physical vitalities, but of all divine pow- ers and spiritual perception s when awakened by the lifting of the fiery serpent of life force at the base, \"tail,\" of the spine. The metaphors of the \"serpent\" and \"rod\" are variously repeated in the story of Moses, in keeping with scriptural tradition of linking historical events with esoteric symbology. The rod, or staff, of Moses was the medium through which he demonstrated miraculous powers according to the will of God in carrying out his special dispensation to free the Israelites from thralldom in Egypt—such as the oft- cited parting of the Red Sea; and the saving of the people, in the wilderness, from death by fiery serpents create d by their misdeeds, to counteract which the Lord directed Moses: \"Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and...every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live\" (Numbers 21:6-8). Spiritual death results from the mis- use of the animating fiery life force; spiritual life is the blessing bestowed when the life force an d consciousness are uplifted to the highest center of divine consciousness in the body at the top of the spinal \"pole\" in the cerebrum, where God dwells as the soul. A similar analogy exists in the scriptures of India, citing the serpentine life force at the base of the spine, as described in this Discourse, and the spine itself referred to as meru-danda. Mt. Meru is the loftiest of mythological mountains; and danda, \"a rod, a staff,\" is representative of the spine with its spiritual centers, the crest of which is re- ferred to as the holy Meru, the highest center of divine consciousness. Many yogis honor this symbology by keeping among their sparse ascetic accoutrements a danda, staff, in recognition of the spine as the symbolic scepter of the soul's sovereign power over the kingdom of the body. \"Lifting up the ser- pent\": kundalini force at the base of the spine 263"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"sciousness into God-consciousness through the same path by which it had descended. As explained earlier, man's physical, astral, and causal bodies are tied together and work as one by a knotting of life force and con- sciousness in the seven cerebrospinal centers. In descending order, the final tie is a coiled knot at the base of the spine, preventing the ascen- sion of consciousness into the heavenly astral kingdom. Unless one knows how to open this knot of astral and physical power, the life and consciousness remain attracted to the mortal realm, emanating out- ward into the body and sensory consciousness. Most energy moves through space in a spiral form—a ubiquitous motif in the macrocosmic and microscopic architecture of the uni- verse. Beginning with galactic nebulae—the cosmic birth-cradle of all matter—energy flows in coiled or circular or vortex-like patterns. The theme is repeated in the orbital dance of electrons around their atomic nucleus, and (as cited in Hindu scriptures of ancient origin) of planets and suns and stellar systems spinning through space around a grand center of the universe. Many galaxies are spiral-shaped; and countless other phenomena in nature—plants, animals, the winds and storms— similarly evidence the invisible whorls of energy underlying their shape and structure.* Such is the \"serpent force\" ( kundalirti) in the micro- * In 1953, scientists discovered that DNA, the basic molecule of life, is also constructed in a helical shape. The deep-seeing Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci (1170- 1250) perceived that countles s patterns in nature conform to a spiral shape mathe- matically expressed as a logarithm deriving from the so-called Fibonacci numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, etc.), where each number is the sum of the two preceding in the series. This exact spiral appears in such seemingly disparate manifestations as the pattern of petals in sunflower blossoms and of leaves in pineapples, artichokes, and many trees; the progressive volume of chambers in a nautilus seashell; the light-years- wide sweep of spiral galaxies. Philosophers down the centuries have inferred the intelligence of a Divine Archi- tect from the fact that the further one progresses in the Fibonacci series, the closer the terms come to expressing \"the golden mean\" or \"golden ratio\" (1:1.618033989) and its derivative \"golden rectangle\" and \"golden spiral\"—a \"sacred geometry\" observ- able throughout nature. In Atomic Vortex Theorem of Energy Motion, quantum physi- cist Derek Bond discusses the theory that all energy expresses in a vortex pattern: \"This is evidenced to us constantly from the largest things, such as our spiral galaxies and the very curve o f space-time itself, to the very smallest as evidenced by the miniature atomic vortices created b y atomic particles. The vortical flow in particles' atomic path vortices, as imaged by the CERN 3.7 meter bubble chamber, when measured, is in ac- cordance with ratio of 1:1.618033989.

When the soul, in its subtle sheaths of causal and astral bodies, enters physical incarnation at the time of conception, the entire body grows from the seed cell formed from the united sperm and ovum, be- ginning with the first vestiges of the medulla oblongata, brain, and spinal cord. From its original seat in the medulla, the intelligent life energy of the astral body flows downward—activating the specialized powers in the astral cerebrospinal chakras that create and give life to the phys- ical spine, nervous system, and all other bodily organs. When the work of the primal life force in creating the body is complete, it comes to rest in a coiled passage in the lowest, or coccygeal, center. The coiled configuration in this astral center gives to the life energy therein the terminology of kundalini or serpent force (from Sanskrit kundala, \"coiled\"). Its creative work completed, the concentration of life force in this center is said to be \"sleeping\" kundalini, for as it emanates out- ward into the body, continuously enlivening the physical region of the senses—of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, and of the earth- bound physical creative force of sex—it causes the consciousness to become strongly identified with the delusive dreams of the senses and their domain of activity and desires. Moses, Jesus, the Hindu yogis, all knew the secret of scientific spiritual life. They unanimously demonstrated that every person who is yet physically minded must master the art of lifting up the serpent force from sensory body consciousness in order to accomplish the first retracing of the inward steps toward Spirit. Any saint of an y religion who has attained God-consciousness has, in effect, withdrawn his consciousness and life force from the sense regions up through the spinal passage and plexuses to the cen- tion infinitely. Many spiral galaxies' arms and these atomic particle paths make a per- fect match with the 'golden ratio' and prove that these particles are traveling in infi- nite flows.\" The golden ratio is considered to be the basis of harmony and beauty of form in classical art, architecture, and design — identified as such by (among many others) Pythagoras, Plato, Leonardo d a Vinci, and the builders of the Great Pyramids at Giza.

When one is sitting quietly and calmly, he has partially stilled the life force flowing out into the nerves, releasing it from the muscles; for the moment his body is relaxed. But his peace is Yoga: science of easily disturbed by any noise or other sensation that switching off the reaches him, because the life energy that continues senses and entering to flow outward through the coiled path keeps the super consciousness senses operative. In sleep, the astral life forces are withdrawn not only from the muscles but also from the sensory instruments. Every night each man accomplishes a physical withdrawal of the life force, albeit in an unconscious way; the energy and consciousness in the body retire to the region of the heart, spine, and brain, giving man the rejuvenating peace of subconscious contact with the divine dy- namo of all his powers, the soul. Why does man feel joy in sleep? Be- cause when he is in the stage of deep, dreamless sleep, unconscious of the body, physical limitations are forgotten and the mind momentar- ily taps a higher consciousness. The yogi knows the scientific art of withdrawing consciously from his sensory nerves, so that no outer disturbance of sight, sound, touch, taste, or smell can gain entry into the inner sanctum of his peace-saturated meditation. Soldiers posted for days on the front lines are able to fall asleep despite the constant roar of battle, because of the body's mechanism of unconsciously withdrawing the energy from the ears and other sensory organs. The yogi reasons that this can be done consciously. By knowledge and practice of the definite laws and scientific techniques of concentration, yogis switch off the senses at will—going beyond subconscious slumber into blissful supercon- scious interiorization. Though the soul is given periods of freedom from body con- sciousness at regular intervals in its existence—for a few hours each night, and for a longer respite between physical incarnations during the sleep of death—the unenlightened man inevitably finds that his unful- filled earthly yearnings stir him once again to the consciousness of the body. When he has sufficiently recovered from his sensory fatigue, the sleeping man's wants cause him to return to wakefulness, just as un- fulfilled urges for earthly experiences impel man's reembodiment after a temporary rest in the astral realm between physical incarnations. 266"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"The state of subconsciousness, experienced in sleep, thus affords man only partial transcendence. So long as the life force and con- sciousness remain tied to the body by the activities of heart, lungs, and other vital organs, man cannot enter superconsciousness. The yogi, in the ecstasy of deep meditation, completely switches off the life force and consciousness from the physical body, refocusing on supercon- scious perception of the soul's invisible heavenly nature of Bliss. Re- peated and prolonged sojourns into the sublimity of ecstasy satisfies the devotee's every desire and frees him from earth-binding compul- sions with their cycles of reincarnation. Whoever cynically thinks that seeking spiritual progress in medi- tation is a waste of time should reflect on the consummate benefits of being able to lift the consciousness into the elevated states of super- consciousness. In sleep all the dualities and miseries of physical exis- tence are forgotten; indeed , the whole world vanishes into the invisible vastness of subconscious peace. If one learns to produce that mental freedom consciously and at will in samadhi, then when afflicted by suf- fering or confronted by death he is able to transfer his consciousness to the boundless inner kingdom of bliss, which is secreted behind the wakeful and subconscious minds even as the misery-quelling subcon- sciousness of sleep is hidden behind the conscious mind. Every human being has learned to enter subconsciousness in sleep; and everyone can likewise master the art of superconscious ecstasy, with its infinitely more enjoyable and restorative experience than can be gleaned from sleep. That higher state bestows the constant aware- ness that matter is the frozen imaginings of God, as in sleep our dreams and nightmares are our own ephemeral thought-creations, condensed or \"frozen\" into visual experiences through the objectify- ing power of our imagination. A dreaming person does not know that a nightmare is unreal until he wakes up. So also, only by awakening in Spirit—oneness with God in samadhi —can man disperse the cos- mic dream from the screen of his individualized consciousness. Ascension in Spirit is not easy, because when one is conscious of the body he is in the grip of his second nature of insistent moods and habits. Without timidity, one must vanquish the desires of the body. A body-bound \"son of man\" cannot ascend to heavenly freedom just by talking about it; he has to know how to open the coiled knot of kun- dalini force at the base of the spine in order to transcend the confine- ment of the fleshly prison. 267"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Every time one meditates deeply, he automatically helps to reverse the life force and consciousness from matter to God. If the current in the astral knot at the base of the spine is not lifted up by good living, good thoughts, meditation, then materialistic thoughts, worldly thoughts, base thoughts, are emphasized in one's life. With every good act man performs he is \"ascending to heaven\"—his mind becoming more focused at the Christ Center of heavenly perception; with every evil act he is descending into matter, his attention captivated by the phantoms of delusion. The true meaning of kundalini awakening is little understood. Ig- norant teachers often associate kundalini with sex force and enshroud it in mystery to frighten neophytes about the danger Common fallacies of awakening this sacred serpentine power. To con- about kundalini fuse the awakening of kundalini with the arousal of awakening  sex consciousness is an extremely ridiculous and wholly corrupt conception. On the contrary, in kun- dalini awakening the yogi's life force is withdrawn from the sensory nerves, particularly those associated with sex, giving him absolute mas- tery over sensory and sexual temptations.* To think that this kundalini force can be easily awakened or roused by accident is another fallacy. Awakening the kundalini force is exceedingly difficult and cannot be done accidentally. It takes years of concerted meditation under the guidance of a competent guru be- fore one can dream of releasing the heavenly astral body from its bondage to physical confinement by awakening the kundalini. One who is able to awaken the kundalini fast approaches the state of Christhood. Ascension through that coiled pathway opens the spiri- tual eye of spherical vision, revealing the whole universe surrounding the body, supported by the vibratory light of heavenly powers. The senses of sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell are like five searchlights revealing matter. As the life energy pours outward through those sensory beams, man is attracted by beautiful faces or captivating sounds or enticing scents, flavors, and tactual sensations. It is natural; but what is natural to the body-bound consciousness is unnatural to the soul.

Does this Bible passage mean that all who do Jesus never meant that not accept or believe in Jesus as their Savior will be he was the only savior condemned? This is a dogmatic concept of con- for all time  demnation. What Jesus meant was that whoever does not realize himself as one with the universal Christ Consciousness is condemned to live and think as a struggling mortal, delimited by sensor y boundaries, because he has essentially disunited himself from the Eternal Principle of life. Jesus never referred to his Son-of-man consciousness, or to his body, as the only savior throughout all time. Abraham and many oth- ers were saved even before Jesus was born. It is a metaphysical error to speak of the historical person of Jesus as the only savior. It is the Christ Intelligence that is the universal redeemer. As the sole reflection Basilides, Theodotus, Valentinus, and Ptolemaeus, similarly express an understanding of the \"only begotten Son\" as a cosmic principle in creation—the divine Nous (Greek for intelligence, mind, or thought)—rather than as the person of Jesus. The celebrated church father Origen quotes from the writings of Theodotus that \"the only begotten Son is Nous\" (Excerpta ex Theodoto 6.3). I n Gnosis: A Selection of Gnostic Texts (Ox- ford, England: Clarendon Press, 1972), German scholar Werner Foerster quotes Ire- naeus as saying: \"Basilides presents Nous originating first from the unoriginate Fa- ther.\" Valentinus, a teacher greatly respected by the Christian congregation in Rome around A.D. 140, held similar views, according to Foerster, believing that \"in the Pro- logue to the Gospel of John, the 'Only-begotten' takes the place of Nous.\" At the Council of Nicaea (A.D. 325), however, and at the later Council of Con- stantinople (A.D. 381) the church proclaimed as official doctrine that Jesus himself was, in the words of the Nicene Creed, \"the only begotten Son of God, begotten from the Father before all ages, light from light, true God from true God, begotten not made, homoousios ['of one substance'] with the Father.\" After the Council of Constantino- ple, writes Timothy D. Barnes in Athanasius and Constantius: Theology and Politics in the Constantinian Empire (Harvard University Press, 1993), \"the emperor enshrined its decisions in law, and he subjected Christians who did not accept the creed of Nicaea and its watchword homoousios to legal disabilities. As has long been recognized, these events marked the transition from one distinctive epoch in the history of the Christian church and the Roma n Empire to another.\" From that point on, explains Richard E. Rubenstein in When Jesus Became God: The Struggle to Define Christianity During the Last Days of Rome (New York: Harcourt, 1999), the official teaching of the church was that to not accept Jesus as God was to reject God Himself. Through the centuries, this view had enormous and often tragic implications for the relationship between Christians and Jews (and later, Muslims, who regarded Jesus as a divine prophet but not as part of the Godhead), as well as for the non-Christian peoples in the lands later conquered and colonized b y European nations.

Jesus said: \"When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he.\"t He realized that his physical body was to remain on the earth plane for only a little while, so he made clear to those for whom he was the savior that when his body (son of man) was gone from the earth, people would still be able to find God and salvation by be- lieving in and knowing the omnipresent only begotten Son of God. Jesus emphasized that whosoever would believe in his spirit as the Infinite Christ incarnate in him would discover the path to eternal life through the meditative science of interiorized ascension of the consciousness. \"That whosoever believeth in him should not perish.\" The forms of nature change, but the Infinite Intelligence immanent in nature is ever unchanged by the mutations of delusion.

Instead, centuries of misinterpretation have instigated wars of intolerant ha- tred, torturous inquisitions, and divisive condemnations. * See Discourse 70: \"I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Fa- ther except by me\" (John 14:6). tjohn 8:28 (see Discourse 51). t \"The heavens shall be rolled back, and the earth unfurled before your eyes.

The Lord's purpose in reflecting His Intelligence in creation, making a structured cosmos possible, was not to de- vise a jailhouse of finitude where souls are confined as willy-nilly participants in the danse macabre of suffering and destruction, but to make Himself ac- cessible as an impelling Force to urge the world from ignorance-darkened material manifestation to an illumined spiri- tual manifestation. It is true that the vibratory creative manifestation of the Universal Intelligence has originated the myriad attractions of the cosmic playhouse through which man is constantly bemused to move away from the Spirit to material life, to turn away from the Uni- versal Love to the infatuations of human life. Still, perception of the Absolute beyond creation is intimately close through the intermediary of Its reflected Intelligence in creation. Through this contact, the devo- tee realizes that God sent the Christ Intelligence (His only begotten Son) to produce not a torture chamber but a colossal cosmic motion picture, whose scenes and actors would entertain for a time and ultimately re- turn to the Bliss of Spirit. In the light of that understanding, regardless of one's circumstances in this relative world, one feels his connection with the Universal Spirit and apprehends the vast Intelligence of the Absolute working in all the relativities of Nature. Anyone who believes in and concentrates on that Intelligence—Christ—instead of Its prod- ucts—the external creation—finds redemption. To think that the Lord condemns nonbelievers as sinners is in- congruous. Since the Lord Himself dwells in all beings, condemnation would be utterly self-defeating. God never punishes man for not be- lieving in Him; man punishes himself. If one does not believe in the dynamo and cuts the wires that connect his home to that source, he forfeits the advantages of that electrical power. Likewise, to disavow the Intelligence that is omnipresent in all creation is to deny the con- sciousness its link with the Source of divine wisdom and love that em- powers the process of ascension in Spirit. Recognition of the immanence of God can begin as simply as ex- panding one's love in an ever-widening circle.

The waves on the surface of the ocean constantly change as they sport with the wind and tidal elements, but their oceanic essence re- mains constant.

This is what Jesus meant by \"condemned\": Body-bound man creates his own condemna- tion by isolating himself from God. To be saved he must reestablish his realization of inseparable unity with the Divine Immanence. \"In waking, eating, working, dreaming, sleeping, Serving, meditating, chanting, divinely loving, My soul constantly hums, unheard by any: God! God! God!\"* In this way one remains continually aware of his connection with the changeless Divine Intelligence—the Absolute Goodness underlying the provocative riddles of creation.f \"He that believeth on him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is condemned already.\" This highlights also the role of \"belief\" in the condemnation or noncondemnation of man. Persons who do not understand the immanence of the Absolute in the relative world tend to become ei- ther skeptical or dogmatic, because in both cases re- ligion is a matter of blind beliefs. Unable to recon- cile the idea of a good God with the seeming evils in creation, the skeptic rejects religious belief as stubbornly as the dog- matist clings to it. The truths taught by Jesus went far beyond blind belief, which waxes and wanes under the influence of the paradoxical pronounce- ments of priest and cynic. Belief is an initial stage of spiritual progress necessary to receive the concept of God. But that concept has to be transposed into conviction, into experience. Belief is the precursor of conviction; one has to believe a thing in order to investigate equitably about it. But if one is satisfied only with belief, it becomes dogma— * From Songs of the Soul by Paramahansa Yogananda (published by Self-Realization Fellowship). t \"Seemingly eclipsed by My own Yoga-Maya (the delusion born of the triple qualities in Nature), I am unseen by men. The bewildered world knows not Me, the Unborn, the Deathless\" (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita vii:2 5). \"He sees truly who perceives the Supreme Lord present equally in all creatures, the Imperishable amidst the perishing....When a man beholds all separate beings as exis- tent in the One that has expanded Itself into the many, he then merges with Brahman\" (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita xni:z7, 30).

What is necessary is to grow, in the soil of belief, the harvest of direct expe- rience and contact of God. That indisputable realization, not mere be- lief, is what saves people. If someone says to me, \"I believe in God,\" I will ask him, \"Why do you believe? How do you know there is a God?\" If the reply is based on supposition or secondhand knowledge, I will say that he does not truly believe. To hold a conviction one must have some data to support it; otherwise it is mere dogma, and is easy prey for skepticism. If I were to point to a piano and proclaim that it is an elephant, the reason of an intelligent person would revolt against this absurdity. Likewise when dogmas about God are propagated without the validation of experience or realization, sooner or later when tested with a contrary experience reason will assail with speculation the truth about those ideas. As the scorching rays of the sun of analytical inquiry get hotter and hotter, frail unsubstantiated beliefs wilt and wither away, leaving a wasteland of doubt, agnosticism, or atheism. Transcending mere philosophy, scien- tific meditation attunes the consciousness to the highest mighty truth; with every step the devotee moves toward actual realization and avoids bewildered wandering. To persevere in efforts to verify and experience beliefs through intuitional realization, which can be attained by yoga methods, is to build a real spiritual life that is proof against doubt. Belief is a powerful force if it leads to the desire and determina- tion to experience Christ. This is what Jesus meant when he urged people to \"believe in the name of the only begotten Son of God\": Through meditation, withdraw the consciousness and life energy from the senses and matter to intuit the Aum, the Word or all-pervading Cosmic Vibratory Energy that is the \"name\" or active manifestation of the immanent Christ Consciousness.* One can assert incessantly an intellectual belief in Jesus Christ; but if he never actually experiences the Cosmic Christ, as both omnipresent and incarnate in Jesus, the spiritual practicality of his belief is insufficient to save him. No one can be saved just by repeatedly uttering the Lord's name or praising Him in crescendos of hallelujahs. Not in blind belief in the name of Jesus or the adoration of his personality can the liberating power of his teachings be received. The real worship of Christ is the *See Discourse i, commentary on John 1:12: \"As many as received him, to them gave he power to becom e the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.\" 279"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"divine communion of Christ-perception in the wall-less temple of ex- panded consciousness. God would not reflect His \"only begotten Son\" in the world to act like an implacable detective to track down unbelievers for pun- ishment. The redeeming Christ Intelligence, abiding in the bosom of every soul regardless of its bodily accumulation of sins or virtues, waits with infinite patience for each one to awaken in meditation from delusion-drugged sleep to receive the grace of salvation. The person who believes in this Christ Intelligence, and who cultivates with spiritual action the desire to seek salvation through ascension in this reflected consciousness of God, no longer has to wander blindly along the delusive path of error. By measured steps he moves surely toward the redeeming Infinite Grace. But the unbeliever who scorns the thought of this Savior, the only way of salvation, condemns him- self to body-bound ignorance and its consequences, until he awakens spiritually. \"And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God\" (John 3:19-21). HPhe all-pervading light of God, imbued with the universal Christ A Intelligence, silently emanates divine love and wisdom to guide all beings back to the Infinite Consciousness. The soul, being a mi- crocosm of Spirit, is an ever present light in man to lead him through discriminative intelligence and the intuitive voice of conscience; but all too often the rationalization of desireful habits and whims refuses to follow. Tempted by the Satan of cosmic delusion, man chooses actions that obliterate the light of discriminative inner guidance. The origin of sin and its resultant physical, mental, and spiritual suffering therefore lies in the fact that the soul's divine intelligence and discrimination are suppressed by man's misuse of his God-given free choice.

Succumbing to desires that keep their consciousness concentrated on and confined in the material world—the \"dark- ness\" or gross portion of cosmic creation in which the illumining Divine Presence is heavily obscured by the shadows of m^yd-delusion—benighted souls, humanly identified with mortal egos, repeatedly indulge their erroneous ways of living, which then become firmly entrenched in the brain as bad habits of mortal behavior. When Jesus said that men love darkness rather than light, he was referring to the fact that material habits keep millions away from God. He did not mean that all men love darkness—only those who make no effort to resist the temptations of Satan, taking instead the easy way of rolling down the hill of bad habits and thus becoming inured to the darkness of worldly consciousness. Because they shut out the voice of Christ Consciousness whispering in their personal conscience, they shun the infinitely more tempting experience of joy to be had through the good habits urged by the guiding wisdom-light in their souls. Material temptation promises happiness from gratification of a desire, but giving in to temptation will bring misery, the annihilation of happiness. People who succumb to the allurement of evil often do not realize this until the habit of yielding is established. Those who form bad habits before being exposed to the superior joy of good habits prefer—instead of the slightest effort at self-improvement—to endure the consequences of wrong indulgence because of the prospect of even a little temporary satisfaction. Eventually they become so adapted to surrendering automatically to the instigations of bad habits, despite the inevitable repercussions, that the very thought of forsaking such traitorous pleasure is rejected outright. They balk at the mere suggestion that a little self-control of lust and greed might be beneficial—erroneously believing that they would be unhappy, even tormented, if denied their indulgences. Restless worldly people, habituated to continuous activity, feel suffocated at the thought of the deliberate stillness of meditation. They disregard the soul-comfort offered in God-communion, convinced that they are far more at ease in catering to their second-nature tendencies —no matter how potentially destructive—of worry, nervousness, use- To \"love darkness rather than light\": the soul-obscuring power of bad habits 281"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"less talk, and material desires, rather than endeavoring to experience an as-yet-unfamiliar joy of God-contact. The first priority of most per- sons, after awakening each morning, is a hasty breakfast followed by a headlong rush into their routine of busyness. To precede the day's activities by allocating time to cultivating God-centered inner peace and happiness through the spiritual habit of meditation is altogether foreign to them. Accustomed to the darkness of worldly ignorance, they abhor the Christ light eternally present in their souls. Their per- verse habit of worldly attachment can be overcome only by a stronger attachment to divine peace and bliss resulting from nurturing the op- posite good habit of daily meditation. Thus Jesus' emphasis that by the light of soul awakening, the mortal habit of preferring the delusive darkness of materiality can be dispelled from man's consciousness. With repeated acts of will power to meditate regularly and deeply, one attains the supremely satisfying Bliss-contact of God and can recall that joy to his consciousness any- time, anywhere. In contrasting men of darkness and men of light, Jesus cited the universal psychological error committed by the habit-enslaved: They avoid all thoughts of the greater fulfillments of mind and body await- ing them in the practice of good habits, because they fear that in giv- ing up their imagined pleasures of the flesh they will suffer the pangs of deprivation. Just as the owl loves the nighttime and hides away dur- ing the day, so persons governed by dark habits shun the light of self- improvement. Persons who by meditation have formed the habit of peacefulness gravitate naturally toward the company of high-minded and saintly souls, just as materially restless individuals prefer worldly associates. People of bad habits seek bad company and avoid those who are vir- tuous; but this is foolish, because if they mix openheartedly with those who have good habits they will find an automatic mechanism at work that causes their evil compulsion to leave them. The right company provides the essential impetus for improving oneself. To imitate the good is to engage in good actions; good actions form good habits; and good habits will dislodge bad habits. But somehow evil people feel rebuked in the company of the good, though the really good never scold persons for their past bad behavior if they are seriously trying to reform themselves.

The one good thing about bad habits, however, is that they seldom keep their promises. They are eventually found out to be inveterate liars. That is why souls cannot forever be deceived or enslaved. Though people of bad habits initially recoil from the thought of better living, after they have had enough of evil ways and reach the point of satiety, and have suffered enough from the consequences, they turn for relief toward the wisdom- light of God, despite any entrenched bad habits that must yet be van- quished. If they continually practice ways of living in harmony with Truth, then in that light they come to realize the joy and inner peace brought by self-control and good habits. \"But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.\" Truth is a very slippery term; Christ himself refused to define it when inter- rogated by Pilate.\"\" Absolute standards cannot al- The inner voice that ways be applied in this relative world.

Those who have a trained sensitivity can detect wrong by the inner disturbance of uneasiness it engenders. Virtue is known by the vibration of harmony it creates within. Always the light of God is there, guiding through dis- criminative wisdom and through calm feeling. If one does not disturb feeling by emotion, or discriminative intelligence by rationalized wrong behavior, he will be aided by that inner voice. To follow the light of in- ner wisdom-guidance is the way to true happiness, the way to be al- ways of God, the way to disengage oneself from the coercive influence of bad habits that usurp man's decision-making power.

As a God-ordained savior, Jesus had begun to attract masses of souls with the magnetism of his divine love and power. The fact that Jesus was drawing larger crowds than the theretofore acclaimed John the Baptist became part of a dispute between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purification.

But as applicable to liberated souls who return to earth at God's behest, John's words mean that each is in- dividually invested by God with those powers and characteristics that would best serve his divine commission and support the delusive real- ism of the cosmic drama by making real, in the relative sense, the ex- periences they undergo in their incarnate portrayals. So here John is re- ferring specifically to the will of God that designated significant differences between himself, who came in this incarnation as an ordi- nary saint, and Jesus, who incarnated as a world savior. Advanced souls, those who are able partially or fully to manifest the Divine as a result of promoting their own spiritual evolution through incarnations of endeavor, are sent by God to help in the ac- complishment of His divine plan on earth. Saints and prophets who come to earth to aid in the upliftment of souls, but who are not fully liberated or have no world mission to perform, may be called partial incarnations (khanda avatars). Those liberated masters in whom God openly manifests as a world savior, or who have a divine dispensation to facilitate the redemption of the masses, may be called full incarna- tions of God ( puma avatars). Jesus Christ, Bhagavan Krishna, Maha- vatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Swami Sri Yukteswar, and many oth- ers down the ages have been full manifestations of God. John the Baptist, though liberated in his previous incarnation as Elijah, was sent on earth as John in a more humble but distinctive role: to bear wit- ness of a world savior; to declare the special divine dispensation of the coming of Jesus. It is providential that masters who come on earth with a public mission be declared, or properly introduced, so that people may rec- ognize their importance and attentively receive their spiritual services. As it takes an expert gemologist to rightly declare the value of a gem, so preeminent incarnations, divinely humble and never trumpeting their own greatness, can be identified only by qualified souls. Thus was John sent to testify to the God-given credentials of Jesus, so that people might readily know him and embrace his wisdom. John's analogy of Jesus as the divine Bridegroom is a symbolism that appears in several passages in the New Testament.\"\" Similarly, one of the epithets applied to Bhagavan Krishna, the Christ of India, is \"E.g., Matthew 9:15; 25:1. 288"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Madhava: Ma, Prakriti, or Primordial Mother Nature; dhava, hus- band.

To manifest creation, Spirit causes a vibration of duality, dividing Its One Being into the transcendent inactive Creator and His active Creative Power: God the Father and Cosmic Mother Nature. Spirit and Nature, subject and object, positive and negative, attraction and repulsion—it is duality that makes possible the birth of the many out of the One. In His active objectifying Creative Vibration (Holy Ghost or Maha-Prakriti), God Himself is subjectively present in an un- changed, unaffected reflection, th e Universal Spirit in creation: Ku- tastha Chaitanya, Krishna or Christ Consciousness. That immanent guiding Intelligence—the subjective consciousness or soul of the uni- verse—empowers the structuring of the omnipotent Vibratory Force into myriad objective manifestations; in the womb of Mother Nature, Spirit thus gives birth to creation.* Jesus was called the Bridegroom because his consciousness was one with the omnipresent positive consciousness of Spirit united with the negative vibration of Cosmic Nature, the Bride, that engenders the vast universe. The positive universal consciousness flows toward Spirit, counterbalancing the outward flow of negative matter-projecting Cos- mic Energy or Nature. It is by becoming one with the Christ Intelligence that a man of realization can see Spirit and Nature together—behold- ing the Imperishable amidst the perishing, and realizing the endless per- mutations of life, change, and death as the ecstatic dance of Spirit and Nature on the stag e of infinite space and time. \"Whatever exists—every being, every object; the animate, the inanimate—understand that to be born from the union of Kshetra and Kshetrajna (Nature and Spirit).

Jesus had reached this state; he was a complete manifestation of God—the Bridegroom, universal Spirit wedded to universal Nature. When John spoke of his rejoicing in the Bridegroom's voice, he was referring to the Cosmic Sound of Aum (Amen), the active vibration that is the voice or \"witness\" of the inherent Christ In- \" Voice of the Bride- telligence.f That voice of Cosmic Vibration can be groom\": cosmic sound heard through practice of a specific Self-Realization of Aum  Fellowship method of yoga meditation.£ John had heard the Cosmic Sound and perceived the Christ Intelligence in it, but it was on Jesus that he focused attention as the one who had penetrated beyond the Cosmic Sound and Nature vibra- tion into the pure realm of Christ Intelligence contained within them. John contrasted himself as having had glimpses of the omnipresent wis- dom of Christ, whereas the infinite consciousness of Jesus actually felt itself as the Christ in every unit of vibrating space in all creation. The advancing yogi first listens to the Cosmic Sound within his body, and then becomes able to hear it in any part of creation. Next, he feels the Christ Intelligence in the sound in his own body, and then he feels the Christ Intelligence throughout creation. John refers to himself as \"the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him...this my joy therefore is fulfilled.\" He had heard the Cosmic Sound and in- directly felt the presence of Christ Intelligence in it. He rejoiced at being in the company of Jesus who as the divine Bridegroom, one with the Spirit as the positive reflection of omnipresent Christ Consciousness, had won as his Bride the Universal Spirit manifesting as Universal Na- ture. He who perceive s Spirit as both transcendental and immanent is one with Spirit as the Bride, God's consciousness omnipresent in and as * God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita xui:z6-zj. t \"These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the cre- ation of God\" (Revelation 3:14). {See page 1575. 290"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"Cosmic Mother Nature (Maha-Prakriti), as well as one with Spirit as transcendent consciousness in creation as Christ Consciousness and be- yond manifestation as Cosmic Consciousness, the Absolute. In his reference to Jesus, John extols Christ-illumined souls, those whose consciousness is not actuated by downward-pulling earthly de- sires but by the uplifting Cosmic Consciousness from above: \"He that cometh from above.\" Body-bound souls, being identified with earthly things, focus their attention exclusively matterward: \"He that is of the earth is earthly.\" Spiritually awakened souls, attuned with and guided by Cosmic Consciousness, are thus said to \"come from heaven\" and are \"above\" all others; they have ascended higher on the ladder of evolution and enjoy the transcendent awareness of the supernal heav- enly kingdom within. John further points out that divine souls do not speak from book knowledge or from intellectual imagination that fancies its own re- alisms and absolutes; they speak only the truth that they hear, per- ceive, and see through the all-knowing power of soul intuition. No mortal man, who depends on the testimony of his limited senses, can grasp the depth and magnitude of truth perceived by persons of Self- realization; but uplifted souls who develop their intuition by medita- tion can not only comprehend the truth declared by prophets, but prove it to themselves. Through their own experience, they authenti- cate with the unchallengeable \"seal\" of intuitional conviction the seer's ecstatic proclamation that God is the only true Eternal Substance, and that all phenomena of Nature are but waves of Spirit playing on the Infinite Bosom. The words of guidance of a true messenger of God come forth only according to what God speaks through him.

Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, \"How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria?\" for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. Jesus answered and said unto her, \"If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee,'Give me to drink'; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee liv- ing water\" (John 4:5-10). HPhe meeting of Jesus with the woman of Samaria was not a chance -I. encounter, but a divinely devised guru-disciple reunion. The Sa- maritan woman was a morally lost disciple of a previous incarnation whom Jesus wanted to redeem. As with many great masters, Jesus had among his following a num- ber of disciples from past lives. The guru-disciple covenant they had es- tablished in previous lifetimes drew them together again by the unseen magnetism of divine law. These were not only the twelve who had qual- ified themselves in past incarnations to be among the inner circle of Jesus' disciples; others there were as well. Jesus recognized those disciples who were continuing the relationship they had begun with him in a former 295"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"life as distinguished from those who were coming to him for the first time for enlightenment. However, even a close associate or past-life disciple of a great master may not be a perfected devotee, as was The redemption of a demonstrated in the ignominious betrayal of Jesus by fallen past-life disciple his disciple Judas. It is for the sake of the unredeemed that the guru must come back to earth: By taking hu- man incarnation or by appearing in vision to guide and bless those who are in tune—or sometimes even by using the instrumentality of another qualified master—the God-ordained savior continues to help his disci- ples when their own efforts permit him to do so, until all are finally lib- erated. No matter what their degree of advancement, disciples once ac- cepted by a true guru hold a secure place in that relationship as they gradually progress, and ofttime s falter, incarnation after incarnation. The woman of Samaria was one such disciple. It appears that dur- ing his trip from Judea to Galilee Jesus purposely planned this meet- ing, waiting alone at Jacob's well where the woman would be likely to encounter him while the disciples went into the city to obtain food. Contrary to the prevailing attitude at that time, that Samaritans were shunned by the Jews as \"low-caste,\" Jesus engaged the woman in conversation and asked her to draw water for Jesus shunned the evils him. The Samaritan's astonishment at Jesus' request of racial prejudice and to her highlights the differentiation observed by the caste consciousness people in the time of Jesus between the Jews and the Samaritans; the Jews being considered of a higher religion and race as compared to the Samaritans,* even as the Brahmins in India are held by an artificial standard to be high-caste and spiritually superior to the lower castes of society. Christ did not see people in terms of their race, creed, or social position. He saw the Divine in all. It is ego consciousness that preju- dicially discriminates among God's children, creating boundaries of exclusivity. Thus the ordinary human being relates to and identifies with his family first; then his neighbors, or persons of his own caste * Sychar (or Shechem), where Jesus' encounter with the woman of Samaria took place, was located about twenty-five miles north of Jerusalem, at the foot of Mt. Gerizim. Samaria, the district between Judea and Galilee, was home to a people of mixed ancestry. Centuries earlier, when Palestine was conquered by the Assyrians, the Jewish population of that area intermarried with foreigners who were sent to colonize the land, and who adopted some of the Jewish religious beliefs. The Samaritans were the descendants of this cultural med- ley. Being of mixe d race, they were viewed with contempt by most full-blooded Jews. 296"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"or social position, or members of his own religion; then his race; and finally his nation. There his consciousness stops—his ego imprisoned in concentric barriers, cribbed in an isolated corner of its insular world, cut off from the universality that Jesus and the great ones lived by: \"God hath made of one blood all nations.\"* In India, rigidified caste consciousness has been productive of many evils.f In America and other lands, bigotry based on color and national origin has created injustice, hatred, and racial conflict. And throughout the world, blind assertion of the superiority of one religion over all oth- ers has perpetuated misunderstanding, fear, and hostility. The Christian missionary calls the Hindus heathen; with equal disdain the Brahmin priests of India permit no Westerners to defile with their presence the holy temples of Hinduism—though all love the same one God. So long as any form of arrogant, intolerant consciousness will re- main, war and great miseries will continue to visit the earth. The most powerful ammunition for the guns of war, and the cause of so many other forms of mass destruction and suffering, are selfishness and the limiting race consciousness of egoistic human beings. The Heavenly Fa- ther is the progenitor of every race; His children are duty-bound to love their whole family of nations. Any country that goes against that prin- ciple of love for humankind will not long prosper, for lack of interna- tional harmony and mutual cooperation puts a nation in conflict not only with its neighbors but with Divine Law, the Organizing Principle of the cosmos. Through evolutionary coaxings of the Christ Intelligence, with Its cosmic heartbeat of coalescent love, God is trying to bring unity in the universe. Those who are in tune with this cosmic beneficence, as was Jesus, have love and understanding that embraces the totality of hu- manity, setting the standard for all of God's children to follow. *Acts 17:26. t Caste demarcations developed in India in a higher age of Vedic wisdom as a natural form of social organization that honored and gave place to each individual according to qualifications and th e capacity to serve society as a whole. Those whose innate qual- ities made them fit to be spiritual teachers or clergy were called Brahmins; others, whose nature suited the duties of soldiers and rulers, were called Kshatriyas; those inclined to business were known as Vaishyas; and persons whose chief contribution to society lay in manual labor belonge d to the fourth caste, that of Sudras. As the spiritual under- standing of humanity declined , caste divisions began to be based not on individual merit but on heredity. Thus evolved the manifold injustices and evil divisiveness that Mahatma Gandhi and other saints of India down the centuries worked tirelessly to abolish.

Thus, despite the woman of Samaria's expectation that Jesus would shun her as a racial outcast, he asked her to share with him the water she drew from the well, a gesture of friendliness through which she could be- come acquainted with him. Having perceived that as a fallen disciple of past lives she had the potential to be resurrected spiritually, Jesus had cre- ated this opportunity, during the absence of his other disciples, so that without disturbance he could give to her the everlasting elixir of divine awakening. When he said, \"If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee,\" Jesus was hinting to the woman that God had blessed her in previous incarnations with the greatest of all gifts, a divine savior (guru) who had followed her to this life to redeem her. Jesus sought to stir her dormant memory of the past; thus he intimated that if she but knew that it was her God-given guru who was asking for the drink, she would hasten to ask him for the living water of God's contact, without which no human being can quench his spiritual thirst. * The woman saith unto him, \"Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living wa- ter? Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle Jesus answered and said unto her, \"Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: But whosoever drinketh of the wa- ter that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life\" (John 4:11-15). HPhe woman of Samaria, steeped in ignorance, could not yet un- JL derstand the oblique reference of Jesus to \"living water,\" hence her foolish question: \"[Since] thou hast nothing to draw with...from whence then hast thou that living water?\" * \"O Lord, the hope of Israel, all that forsake Thee shall be ashamed, and they that de- part from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters\" (Jeremiah 17:13).

His yearnings will remain with him even after death, a latent thirst that will impe l him to reincarnate again and yet again in search of satisfaction. But whosoever drinks of the fountain of eternal bliss in God will find the thirst of every desire of all his incarnations quenched forever. Souls who discover the everlasting Well of Bliss within themselves are never thirsty for the evanescent satisfactions of a mortal existence and its material desires. The worldly man, on the other hand, having lost his soul contact with God-Bliss, tries to satisfy himself with pleasures of the senses— a foolish expectation. Millions of people die of broken hearts, having tried vainly to \"lay up for themselves upon earth\" a treasure of last- ing happiness garnered from material things, when joy inexhaustible in God awaits the seeker in the temple of meditation. Thus did the Lord speak to Prophet Jeremiah: \"For My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken Me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.\"* Gratifying the body and ego with material experiences and pos- sessions can never compensat e man for his lost infinite soul-happiness. Indeed, the materialist's quest achieves the opposite of what he in- tended, making him susceptible instead to every form of sorrow and suffering inherent in the cosmic scheme of dualities. Mortal desires promise happiness, but give sorrow instead. \"Be- cause sense pleasures sprin g from outward contacts, and have begin- ning and end (are ephemeral), they are begetters only of misery.

That is why it can never remain contented for long with the tem- porary pleasures of the senses. If one has lost a diamond, he will not satisfy himself by replacing it with bits of broken glass that he finds shining in the sunlight. The glitter of sense pleasures, no matter how alluring, soon yields disappointment, satiety, and disgust. \"The thirst of incarnations is slaked by whosoever will drink the effervescent waters of the well of Divine Bliss in the soul, springing up into everlasting life\"—this is the wisdom Jesus sought to convey to the woman at the well. The woman saith unto him, \"Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.\" Jesus saith unto her, \"Go, call thy husband, and come hither.\" The woman answered and said, \"I have no husband.\" Jesus said unto her, \"Thou hast well said, T have no hus- band': for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.\" The woman saith unto him, \"Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet\" (John 4:15-19). A flicker of receptivity stirred in the woman. So Jesus tested the character of this fallen disciple, the degree of her degradation. He asked her to call her husband; and when she said that she had no husband, he was pleased with her truthfulness in tacitly admitting that —— the man with whom she was presently coupled was Sincere cooperation not a lawful spouse. Jesus then revealed that he with one's guru can knew of her promiscuous behavior in having had save even the worst five such illicit relationships. Rather than lying to sinner  defend herself, she recognized Jesus as a divine prophet who alone could have known her secret. In this moment of spiritual submission, Jesus saw the genuine quality of her sincerity. Her immorality lay like a clay crust over her pure, truth- loving soul, hiding it only temporarily. Insincerity, prevarication, and treachery toward a guru-preceptor are devastating sins, for these are deliberate, willful transgressions and, as such, are worse evils than flesh transgressions, which are to a con- siderable extent due to instinctive compulsion. 300"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Some persons, owing to immoral behavior in a past life, are born with a compelling inclination that overrules almost all sense of shame, church threats, conscience, social discomfiture, or efforts toward self- control. Sincerity in recognizing and acknowledging their faults, and in following the advice of their spiritual doctor, will give these indi- viduals mental and moral strength that will remedy the malady. The disciple who is insincere toward his guru in attempting to hide or rationalize his moral disease shuts out the healing help of the master. Hypocritical evasion causes the moral transgression in the error -stricken disciple to spread tenaciously within him. To hide moral disease from the spiritual doctor is dangerous to spiritual health, just as concealing physical symptoms of disease from a medical doctor im- perils bodily health. In any case, the guru is not deceived, no matter how cunning the evasive disciple. The master can perceive the inmost character of a dis- ciple exactly and immediately. Masters rarely, if ever, make errors in discerning the qualities of those who come to them. Even when a guru accepts a disciple who later exhibits evil or treacherous tendencies, it is not because the master was unknowing. Jesus had his Judas; why did he accept such a follower? There was a karmic connection, in that Ju- das had been hi s disciple in a previous life. When a guru sees the soul of a disciple fallen in ignorance, his God-given duty and heartfelt con- cern leave no choice but to help. Every soul can be rescued, no matter how entangled in error, if the mind makes a genuine commitment to cooperate spiritually. The gur u provides repeated opportunities for the disciple to make this breakthrough from ignorance. Though one's sins be as deep as the ocean, still he can be saved if he is sincere and loyal to his master, linking himself with the channel that draws him to God.

Subconscious thoughts are those that re- main below the conscious mind, hidden behind its closed doors. By con- sciously projecting one's subconscious mind into the subconscious mind of another person, one can know the tabloid thought-experiences clos- eted there. This is possible when by the right method of concentration one can delve into his own subconscious mind and feel the experiences stored there without being intruded upon or influenced by the thoughts of the conscious mind. In the third and more advanced way, a master whose mind has plumbed the depths of meditation and who has gained control of his all-seeing eye of intuition can transfer his consciousness to the region of soul bliss of the superconscious mind. The superconsciousness hides behind the restlessness of conscious life and the fanciful dream state and memories of subconscious life, and knows everything, not by rea- son or sense perception, but by God-given intuition, the direct all- knowing power of the soul. This intuitive power can be developed by learning the step-by-step methods of scientific deepest meditation that lead to Self-realization. With fully developed superconscious intuition, one can instantly feel all that is going on in the consciousness of another individual, all that is hidden in his subconscious mind, and all the prenatal experi- ences of former incarnations that are stored permanently in his super- consciousness. Jesus had this usable, controlled power of intuition; he knew at once everything that lay in the conscious, subconscious, and superconscious minds of the woman of Samaria. Jesus openly manifested his omniscience by revealing to his fallen former disciple his knowledge of her moral indiscretions. A master very seldom tries to attract new followers by a mental miracle other than by the expression of the love of God, but everything is right in its own place. This display of a miracle was not performed by Jesus in order to satisfy the mental curiosity of a stranger, but to lift a fallen disciple. The woman of Samaria witnessed this omniscient power of Jesus because she confessed to a master; and the master, out of com- passion, let her know that her privacy was in safe hands. With her ve- racity, she had passed his test of true discipleship. And the salutary ef- fect of the miracle was that the woman of Samaria was spiritually awakened to the realization that she was in the presence of a prophet of God. 302"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"DISCOURSE 18 ^Worsliip God in Spirit and in TrutHi\" Tine 'Woman of Samaria, Part II Ceremonial Worslhijp Versus Actual Communion ^Vith God • Where Is the IBest Temple for Worshiping God? • Salvation Comes to All Who Have Made Sufficient Spiritual Effort • Definitions of \"God and \"Spirit' • Worshiping ' in Spirit and in Truth • Personal Attributes and Manifestations of God • The Higl ler State of G od-realization; Oneness of the S oul With opint \"To truly worship God is to worship Him as transcendent Spirit in Nature and beyond Nature....It is then that the devotee finds eman- cipation by becoming one with the Spirit.\""},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"• *.! /     V      ur fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say; that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.\" Jesus saith unto her, \"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.

H aving recognized Jesus as a prophet of God, the woman of Samaria sought from him spiritual guidance on the disputed ques- tion as to which was the right place to worship: Jerusalem, as the Jews believed; or the mountain nearby, which was sacred to her forefathers.* In reply, Jesus set aside both the mountain and Jerusalem and spoke of Self-realization, the inner Jerusalem,f where true devotees of God, having ascended the sacred mountain of meditation, worship Him in the temple of actual Spirit-to-soul communion. *The woman was referring to Mount Gerizim, adjacent to the well at Sychar (Shechem) where she met Jesus. Abraham (Genesis 12:7) and Jacob (Genesis 33:20) set up altars at Shechem. Joshua 8:33 recounts how on Gerizim God's blessings were pro- claimed on the Israelites, as promised by Moses in Deuteronomy 28:1-68. The Samar- itans held that Abraham offered up Isaac on Gerizim. Later, the mountain became es- pecially significant to the Samaritans, for when the Jews who returned to their homeland after the Babylonian Exile would not accept the help of the mixed-race Samaritans in the building of the Second Temple of Jerusalem, the Samaritans built their own temple on Mount Gerizim, which—until its destruction in 129 B.C.—was the center of their worship even as Jerusalem was for the Jews. t \"Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God\" (Revelation 3:12). 305"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"Jesus declared that the mass of religious believers take part in cere- monies or rituals but never know the Object of their worship. It is those who have God-consciousness, who commune with Ceremonial worship God, that can truly speak of worshiping God. Cere- versus actual com- monial worship—whether it be of diverse images munion with God venerated by different cultures down the ages, or cus- tomized prayers, chants, or hymns, or symbolic rites —without inner communion rarely uplifts the consciousness of the wor- shiper beyond vague concepts of Divinity to actual perception of God. This is why Jesus said, \"You know not what you worship.\" If a person is deeply sincere and devout, no matter what words are used to addres s God or what concept of the Divine informs those words, God will answer. But most people do not worship with the conviction, born of experience, that God is real and that He is listen- ing to their prayers; that He is just behind their thoughts, just behind the words of their prayers, just behind the love with which they love Him. If they would pray with heart and mind indivisibly concentrated on that indwelling Presence, they would know the One they worship. The reason that God remains unknown to millions who worship Him in temples and churches, and in holy cities and places of pilgrimage, is that the physical instruments of knowledge can apprehend only the products of the Creator; Divinity Itself is perceived by the supramental faculty of intuition, the soul's God-given power of knowing truth. When mental restlessness is stilled and the consciousness is interiorized, in touch with the soul, the God-revealing intuitive faculty is awakened. The tabernacle of deep meditation, the temple of soul intuition, is where the devotee is first introduced to God. To one who finds Him within, God is no longer an unknown mystery concealed by His various material manifestations. Thus in answer to the woman's inquiry as to the best outer place for worship, Jesus spoke instead of the difference between the theological priestly conditions of worship and the saintly way of wor- shiping God in actual communion with Him \"in spirit and in truth.\" A magnificent, multimillion-dollar temple might Where is the best draw an aristocratic congregation of worshipers, im- temple for worshiping pressed with the comfort of cushioned velvet seats, God?  ornamental architecture, and elaborate services.

He is easily coaxed, however, onto the altar of med- itation by those who establish the temple of God within themselves. \"The most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, 'Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool: what house will ye build Me?' saith the Lord: or 'What is the place of My rest? Hath not My hand made all these things?'\"* In my early years of traveling and lecturing throughout the West, I was often struck by the contrast between the practice of religion as I learned it from God-knowing sages in India and the customary West- ern approach. God once showed me an illustrative vision: In one place, there stood an immense temple, resplendent with marble decorations and a skyscraper golden dome, comfortably seat- ing a congregation of ten thousand. Its walls echoed with organ mu- sic and a glorious choir chanting hymns to God. It was all impressive and enjoyable, and I appreciated and admired it. Then God showed me sitting in meditation under a tree, beneath a canopy of free skies, with only a few true souls; His light was pass- ing through all of us. God asked me which I would prefer, the magnif- icent church without Him or the tree-temple with Him. Without ques- tion, I chose to be under the tree enwrapped in God. He laughed, however, when I countered that some big buildings would be necessary for His work and that He could be in them as well as under the tree. God is in the temple, and He is under the tree. But He is perceived only in interiorized meditation when the inner sanctuary door of si- lence opens. Neither pomp nor penury opens that door. It swings open wide, as if on magical hinges, when the high vibration of the wor- shiper's soul turns the key. Quiet mountaintops and holy places sanctified by the presence of masters are fit places of worship, yet in themselves are of marginal ben- efit to restless materially minded people. Worldly people have built tem- ples on hilltops and lived in places of pilgrimage, only to find that their inner environment is still a den of matter worship of sense-bound thoughts. That is why Jesus emphasized that true worship of God is not conditioned by location or found in the imaginary communion of mere outer silence, but takes place in the inner contact of spiritual perception. Devotees who by meditation interiorize the outgoing conscious- ness, withdrawing their attention from identification with the mortal *Acts 7:48-50 (quoting Isaiah 66:1-2). 307"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"body and material Nature, discover through direct experience what God is. They alone know what it means truly to worship Him; they alone have found the way to attain salvation. When Jesus said that \"salvation is of the Jews,\" he was not refer- ring to the Jews as a nation, but to the exalted class or caste of spiri- —  tually developed souls. In India the highest caste, the Salvation comes to all Brahmins, originally designated those who knew who have made suffi- God (Brahma) . Hereditary membership in that caste cient spiritual effort is not a guarantee of such realization; only those who have made sufficien t spiritual effort and have become knowers of God can rightfully lay claim to the title of Brah- min; and for them liberation is assured. So Jesus' statement that salva- tion is of the Jews did not exclude the rest of mankind. He meant that salvation is for the spiritually exalted—the position, socially speaking, generally accorded to the Jews, who were held to represent the highest standard of spirituality in that place and time.* Jesus said: \"God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must wor- ship Him in spirit and in truth.\" The terms God and Spirit, theosophically speaking, are mutually exclusive, but are semantically interchangeable in common usage where no distinction is required. Spirit signifies the unmanifested Absolute. In Definitions of \"God\" the darkless dark and lightless light of eternal in- and \"Spirit\"  finity—void of even the slightest ripple of thought or vibratory activity to manifest creation; where even the categories of space, time, and dimension are nonexistent— there abides only ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss that is Spirit. \"Where no su n or moon or fire shines, that is My Supreme Abode, \"t God implies the transcendental Creator, beyond creation but ex- isting in relation to the manifestation that evolves from Him. When relative creation is dissolved again into its Creator, then God becomes Spirit, the unmanifested Absolute.^ * In the verses cited in the next Discourse, Jesus showed his willingness to remain with the Samaritans for two days, during which his presence and teaching so uplifted them that they acknowledged him as \"Savior of the world\"—not just for one race or religion. |G od Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita xv:6.

He is all things in creation; but the manifestations of creation are not God. His Spirit nature never changes, though a portion of that Consciousness is garbed in a delusive medley of diversification.

Jesus said that so long as a devotee's consciousness is limited to manifested creation and its inherent delusion of separate things, he has not yet attained the ultimate enlightenment. He remains in delusion, his consciousness absorbed i n ever-changing phenomena. Though God is manifest everywhere, His essence is secreted behind the veil of Na- ture's phenomena. The devotee has to lift that illusory veil and see God first as transcendent in His creation. After that realization, the devo- tee can realize God as transcendent beyond manifestation. Unless the devotee is able to perceive the Father of Creation as the unmanifested Absolute Spirit—pure, ever-conscious Bliss, without delusion's shadows of imperfect creation—he does not know Truth, the noumenal Substance of all phenomena. As Absolute Spirit is reflected as God's guiding Intelligence in macrocosmic creation, so is Spirit reflected in the microcosm of the body as the soul, the individualized image of Spirit in man. The true worshiper, he who actually communes with God, who experiences His presence in meditative realization, knows the truth that his soul and God the Creator are reflections of Spirit. This knowing involves another theosophical nuance. God, the Fa- ther of manifestation, can be known by the soul either by perception of or oneness with any of His manifested attributes. Spirit, the Un- manifested Absolute, can be known only by oneness with Spirit.

In the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord promises: \"In Personal attributes whatever way people are devoted to Me, in that and manifestations of measure I manifest Myself to them. All men, in God  every manner (of seeking Me), pursue a path to Me\" (iv:ii). The unmanifested Spirit as God makes His presence known to the devotee by manifesting some attribute of Divinity commensurate with the devotee's expectation. Jesus taught his followers to think of God as Father. In India it is more common to speak of God as Divine Mother. Saints of various persuasions have successfully communed with God by similarly idealizing other human relations — such as Friend or Beloved. It makes no difference. When I feel the gravity of wisdom, I speak of God as the Father. When I feel unbounded, un- conditional love I call God Divine Mother. When I feel God as the nearest of the near, supporter and confidant, I call Him Friend. Thus, it is a misnomer to refer to God always as \"He.\" It is equally appropriate to call God \"She.\" But in the ultimate, God is Spirit, nei- ther masculine nor feminine. Spirit is above any human correlation. Similarly, the soul is neither male nor female, though karmic inclina- tions cause it to incarnate either with the body of a man or a woman. Any personalized communion with God or worship of a concep- tualized aspect or attribute of Divinity maintains the duality of wor- — shiper and Worshiped, the ecstatic relationship The higher state of sometimes preferred by saints. But the even higher God-realization: one- state referred t o by Jesus, beyond dualistic devo- ness of the soul with tion, is Oneness with the Object of worship, and Spirit  specifically, the ultimate union: oneness of the soul with Spirit. God as Spirit, the Absolute, beyond form, qualities, manifestations, cannot be perceived, but only experi- enced by the supreme realization of Spirit and soul union. This ecstasy, a supernal Bliss that no human tongue can tell or rational thought conceive, is described simpl y by India's rishis: \"He who knows, he knows; naught else knows.\" God, being in truth the unmanifested Absolute, wants all His true devotees to know that they are emanations of that Spirit, and as such, to reunite with their immortal, ever conscious, pure Bliss-Essence.

The link between the manifest and the Unmanifest is the Holy Ghost, the Holy Vibration of Aum; and the way to cross this bridge is by communion with that Holy Ghost Vibration. In spiritual ecstasy the meditator perceives the individual vibra- tion of his life and all lives as informed from the cosmic Holy Ghost, inherent in which is God's reflected Christ Intelligence, which in turn uplifts the consciousness into the transcendental Spirit. Therefore, to truly worship God is to worship Him as transcen- dent Spirit in Nature and beyond Nature, to worship the Substance and Its presence in the delusive phenomena evolved from It, to wor- ship the ocean of God with its delusive waves of creation\"\"—and then to realize God solely as Spirit, the only existing substance, Truth, Bliss, without any delusive manifestation. The persevering devotee advances in the realization that God is Spirit, the Unmanifested Absolute, and understands the truth about Him as being the ever-existent, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss without the delusion of a material cosmos. It is then that the devotee finds emancipation by becoming one with the Spirit. It is only by worship- ing God and His presence in Nature, and then by worshiping God as unmanifested Spirit, by Spirit-and-soul union, that the devotee reaches the final state of emancipation, from which there is no fall.

God wanted to declare the glory of Jesus through the woman of Samaria, who, having been spiritually healed by him of her entrenched immoral tendencies, was to serve as a \"test case\" demonstrating to others the miracle of soul healing. To remove the ignorance that eclipses man's divine nature is the most important of all forms of healing; that is the blessing Jesus would impart to all who attuned themselves with the Christ in him. Jesus reinforced the glimmer of understanding in the woman by declaring the truth about himself. His purpose was to deepen her re- ceptivity to the all-healing Christ Consciousness in him. Jesus saw her alone because, considerate as he was, he wanted to avoid causing em- barrassment to the woman by revealing before his other disciples his prophetic knowledge of her moral indiscretions. God has given to each human being the privacy of thought in which to fight his inner battles in secret instead of before others' cu- riosity and prying, prompting their sarcasm and condemnation. If there were not invisible walls between our mental processes and those of others, we would have no peace; and we would lose, to a large de- gree, our independence of thought and determination and thus the right to receive our own knocks and score our own victories. One may get inkling s of the thoughts of others from the expres- sions of their faces and eyes. This makes the mystery of life all the more challenging and interesting; for many times their thoughts are read correctly. Yet people frequently jump to conclusions about the feelings and motives of others and make horrible blunders. One's mis- takes in such psychological reading should teach a prudent caution and prevent overconfidence in the sufficiency of one's \"intuitions\"; that misguided surety often arises prematurely from one or two cor- rect hunches about the thoughts of others. Even a master does not intrude with his intuitive perception into the mind of another if his help is unwelcome. He leaves the touch-me- not temperament to its own devices of conscience and karma. But Jesus found no such exclusion from the consciousness of his Samari- tan disciple. The disciples traveling with Jesus, lacking his ability to discern the inner quality of souls, were surprised to see him flouting convention by his warm demeanor toward a common woman of Samaria. Yet the pure vibrations of their newfound Master quelled any expression of criticism.

Breakfasts were likely to be light and were carried to the fields or other places of work and eaten at mid-morning or midday. Sup- pers, by contrast, were substantial. Vegetables, eggs, cheese, bread, butter, wine, nuts, and fruit might all be served, and perhaps chicken or wild fowl.

At such times, the Divine Satiety in a master laughs at the delu- sive \"necessity\" of supplying the body with the insipid grossness of ma- terial sustenance. Jesus felt his life coming directly from God—as he had said before: \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of th e mouth of God.\"* Every moment he was conscious of that connection. He knew himself as a soul; the only \"meat\" it needed for nourishment was the blessedness and eternal wisdom of God.

No lapse tially a physical being into identification with accustomed mortal habits is too trite to warrant correction. The untangling of delusion's net is achieved one knot at a time. Jesus wanted the disciples, first and foremost, to think of the body as an instrument for doing the will of God, even as he was demonstrating by his example that the sole purpose for his life on earth was to finish whatever work God wished him to do. The secondary concern is to care for the body only as nec- essary to maintain it as a fit instrument. Ordinary food temporarily nourishes the perishable body and gives it a passing pleasure arising from the sense of taste. But even if a person were to sate himself with any and all food he desired, still his hunger would burn; man cannot appease the hunger of the soul by sat- isfying the desires o f the body. Jesus was telling his disciples that al- though they had brought food for his human body—the token need for which he did not deny—his real Self tasted the ever-satisfying, eter- nally nourishing manna of Divine Wisdom and celestial ever-new Bliss. The disciples had been drawn to Jesus that they might learn how to nourish their souls. So Jesus spoke to them of the supremely sus- taining \"meat\" of wisdom. When man is not guided by wisdom, ma- terial food does not even sustain the body: By wrong dietary choices or overeating people may forfeit their physical health and comfort. * Matthew 4:4 (see Discourse 8). 318"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"Jesus ana tlie W oman © £ Samaria There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, \"Give me to drink.\"...

In spiritual homes in India, the first thought in the morning is of drinking the nectar of peace from the bowl of deep contemplation; and at night, before retir- ing, they sit quietly in meditation to hear the voice of Divine Peace singing softly, inviting them to rest on the bosom of Divine Peace. As long as one is identified with the body, he is tempted to seek happiness in fulfilling its desires and appetites. He dreams of being a millionaire, of having a luxurious home, expensive cars, and the best meals money can buy. However, even a cursory observation of those who have these things dispels their illusory sufficiency. Material sur- feit attracts swarming pests of worry, restlessness, boredom, psycho- logical and spiritual dissatisfaction. Upon wakening in the morning, and at night before going to sleep, and at mealtime, people should rid their consciousness of the material pestilence with the thought of God. Seeking in deep meditation to become attuned to God's will en- ables one to be in the world but not of the world. To remain unat- tached, like the dewdrop on the lotus leaf, is to be really happy, ready to slip the consciousness into God. As a dewdrop cannot slide on blotting paper, so the mind of the Become attuned to average person cannot readily slide into thoughts of God's will: in the God if it is absorbed in an inner environment of world but not of the earthly desires or an outer environment of materi- world ally minded companions. The way to remain spiritually free and nonattached is to realize that this earth belongs solely to God. All of man's so-called posses- sions are loaned to him only that he may play a role in this colossal drama of life. None of the props belongs to man, not even his body, which is but a temporary costume that must be surrendered when his particular part in the drama is over and God calls him behind the cur- tain of death. Until man's histrionics are finished, happiness lies in per- fecting his performance, without personal attachment, according to the promptings of the Divine Director. The will of God is to plan for every actor the best finale; in that lies the true joy of living. Thus Jesus said that as food is the pleasurable sustenance that man depends on for life, so the relish that supported the vitality of his life consisted in doing the will of God—cheerfully, willingly, not like 319"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"a puppet. Cheerful cooperation with God's will is the secret of a dy- namic existence, charging body and mind with divine life. Man is made of the blissful consciousness of God, and lives by that Con- sciousness. The more cheerful a person is, the more his positive thoughts draw vitality into his body cells from the abundance of Di- vine Consciousness. One who allows the episodes of life to make his mind habitually cross and moody finds his bodily energies depressed accordingly, no matter how much or what type of food he eats. That is why Jesus emphasized to his disciples that the consciousness of man should not be predominantly on a material diet, but on the nourish- ment of divine wisdom. That wisdom which feeds man's body with vi- tality, his mind with invulnerability, and his soul with celestial bliss is to do the will of God. As prophets are sent on earth to fill a world need according to the Lord's cosmic plan, Jesus knew the stupendous mission he had to per- form, and the possible consequences that could come to him as a re- sult of his actions. Yet he was sustained in the peace and joy of his commitment \"to do the will of Him that sent me.\" \"To finish His work\" signifies finishing, in the short span that was left to him, the God-given task that was his part to carry out during his incarnation as Jesus—not the completion of the work of redemption, which God and His avatars have to carry on throughout eternity.

If one is disgruntled with his designated role and rejects the scenes that are karmically necessary to him, attempting instead a part more appealing to his desires, he disrupts the cosmic harmony and spoils the better drama God's love and laws had scripted for him.

They have to reappear on 320"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"stage incarnation after incarnation until they become perfected thes- pians in the Lord's cosmic entertainment. Heeding Divine Direction, they ennoble the drama and earn liberation. It is easy to do what one wants to do, but difficult to do what one should do. How may one even know the will of God as to what one should do? So many have told me that they are divinely guided; but I know they are not, because I see they have not even communed with God. So how could they be guided by Him? I try to warn them; but when they are immovably fixed in the delusion that they know God's will, I have then to remain silent and watch the ego make a mess of their determinations. It is often a sad spectacle. Of course, through prayer and meditation and faith one does get some inner spiritual sense of direction. No one should be without this attunement. But to be consciously guided by God, rather than by the manipulative rationalizations of one's desires or whims or habits, is another matter, of deeper realization. For most people, the will of God is best understood through a God-sent guru. Guru is one who knows God, and who shows the way to Him. To follow a divine manifesta- tion is the sure way to God-realization. One who knows God becomes the speaking voice of the silent God. Attunement with the wisdom- guided will of a true guru teaches one how to guide his will according to God's will. Those who follow the voice of their own ego, ascribing to it a halo of divine guidance, find out too late that no amount of de- luded rationalization will relieve one of the karmic responsibility of wrong actions. To be led by an ego-bound will is to stumble into painful delusive entanglements. Do not remain entangled! Be free! The will of God is to free every soul. Man's part is to cooperate with that purpose by living in harmony with God's laws as defined by a God-realized guru. Man thereby learns his destined purpose and un- derstands what God wants him to do with his life. Acting accordingly, he \"finishes God's work\" that is his unique assignment on the stage of incarnation. With Christ, he ingests the \"meat\" of wisdom and be- comes an instrument in fulfilling the Divine Will. \"Say not ye, 'There are yet four months, and then cometh har- vest' ?

And herein is that saying true, 'One soweth, and another reapeth.' I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours\" (John 4:35-3 8). M ortal life is governed by the law of karma: \"As you sow, so shall you reap.\" In this passage, however, Jesus used the para- ble of the sower, the laborer, the harvesting time, and the harvest to il- lustrate that the immortal soul of man, a reflection of transcendent Spirit, is above creation's cause-and-effect subjugation. To one who is identified with his assumed mortal nature, the karmic law metes out wisdom and happiness only according to one's earned merit. One who is identified with Spirit reaps without measure the infinite wealth of Divinity. Thus did Jesus elucidate the superior law of the Divine Harvest: In ordinary farming there is a great deal of labor, and the harvest comes in —— about four months after planting; but Jesus said that The soul needs noth- reaping divine abundance is not a matter of laboring, ing but to remember waiting, and finally acquiring the spiritual harvest. the divine wealth it al- The soul need acquire nothing. As a child of God, it ready possesses needs only to remember what it already possesses in latent form: its infinite wisdom-inheritance from the Divine Father. The moment man's consciousness transcends body iden- tification into Self-realization, the soul's contact with God becomes manifest, its God-essence revealed from beneath the wisdom-seared veil of ignorance.* Human wisdom has to be cultivated gradually through the instru- mentality of the senses and rational intelligence; but the measureless harvest of divine wisdom can be reaped instantaneously through the medium of intuition, developed by meditation. Jesus exhorted his fol- lowers, \"Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields,\" for all one has to do is to lift the consciousness from the plain of material vibrations to the ever-ready harvest of wisdom, glistening on the pure white fields of Cosmic Consciousness. The two physical eyes see only material Nature. * \"As enkindled flame converts firewood into ashes, so does the fire of wisdom con- sume to ashes all karma. Verily, nothing else in this world is as sanctifying as wisdom\" (God Talks With Arjurta: The Bhagavad Gita ^37-38). 322"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"Raising the gaze and consciousness in deep meditation to the third eye of spiritual perception, the aspirant beholds in the starry white light of soul realization the wisdom- and bliss-abundance that is his divine birthright—long forgotten, never lost, and instantly reclaimable. As the darkness of closed eyes is dispelled immediately when one opens his eyes, so the instant one opens his eye of wisdom, the gloom of ignorance is banished and he beholds himself as a perfect soul in the light of God. This is a great consolation, for to reach perfection through the karmic consequential process of trial and error seems a near impossibility, requiring countless incarnations. Man must labor to acquire prosperity, wisdom, and happiness; a Self-realized child of God, reclaiming his divine inheritance, already possesses everything. So much effort is required to reap a harvest of material worth— a relative waste of time when one must inevitably lose, sooner or later, all that has been acquired. Jesus points out that it is far better to make the effort to know what one already possesses as a divine child. The soul that has cast off its mortality claims its birthright and enjoys throughout eternity the harvest of Bliss in God. Material habits and indolence cause many otherwise spiritually inclined persons to say: \"Well, it takes prodigious effort to be spiri- tual.\" I say: \"No.\" The only effort we have to make is to forget our unspiritual mortal consciousness; as soon as that is done, we know we are gods. \"He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal.\" He who reaps soul knowledge through meditation re- ceives the wages of Divine Wisdom, and gathers the resultant fruits of immortal, ever new Bliss. \"That both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice to- gether\" signifies that God, as the Sower of Wisdom in souls, is pleased when He finds that His true children reap the harvest grown by Him, and not the harvest of evil sown and reaped by mortal ignorance. \"One soweth and another reapeth\" can be interpreted on two lev- els of meaning: first, as relating to the harvest in man's soul; and sec- ond, as relating to man's influence on his fellow beings in the world. Primarily, Jesus' words signify that God is the Sower, the sole Source, of wisdom, and that His children have only to reap what He has already grown for them in their souls. God sent human beings on earth to reap the soul harvest of wisdom and bliss, for which no hu- man effort was made. In the world, just forgetting that one lives in poverty does not make one rich; one has to work to acquire material 323"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"wealth. But as God's children, the moment in deep meditation that they forget their self-created mortal consciousness, they immediately become divine, spiritually enriched with their endowment from God. \"Other men laboured and ye are entered into their labours\" means that worldly persons labor for perishable material acquisitions and for unfulfilling and unrealistic goals; God's devotees should not foolishly imitate them. For all people to become in this lifetime as rich as a Henry Ford would be impossible, because of the limitations of earthly existence. But every human being has the potential to become Christlike in one life by proper meditation, because all are already sons of God, mad e in His image. By meditation and calmness, man opens his agelong closed eyes of wisdom. The light of awakening ac- tualizes his latent potentials, and he finds himself one with the Owner of the entire cosmos. The fruits of one's spiritual awakening are a blessing not only on one's own life, but on the world at large. This is the second meaning of •  \"one soweth and another reapeth\": a reference to Human life is affected mass karma. Every person sows good or bad actions by mass karma as well in the soil of his life, and not only does he himself as individual karma reap the karmic harvest of those actions, but he makes others reap them as well. If a person writes a degrading novel, all who read it reap the evil effects of the author's thoughts. The law of cause and effect operates in even subtler ways as well. The actions of each individual leave electromagnetic etchings in his brain, influencing his future actions; and they also leave vibrational traces in the ether, which register in and influence the minds of others. In Mysore I visited a sandalwood factory; each piece and shaving of sandalwood contributes t o the atmosphere of the whole place, and anyone who enters enjoys the wonderful fragrance. Similarly, when I come to our Self-Realization Fellowship temples, there are so many good souls earnestly seeking God that I feel the spiritual vibration em- anating from their collective goodness. Conversely, a gathering of per- sons given to drinking and rowdyism would produce a strong nega- tive atmosphere. The overall quality and character of any community, any civiliza- tion, is produced by mass karma, the accumulated effects of actions left in the ether by the populace in general. Each individual is respon- sible for contributing to the mass karma, which in turn influences every individual. 324"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"The person who keeps himself cleansed of all wrong vibrations produces a powerful uplifting effect on his contemporaries. One moon gives more luster than all the stars; so a mooned soul — one who purely reflects the light of God—can influence the masses much more than the masses influence each other. Thus, individual effort can be even more important than mass karma. One who in every way tries to uplift himself, harmonizing body, mind, and soul with the Divine, cre- ates positive karma not only in his own life, but in his family, neigh- borhood, country, and world. Hence it is not justified to say, \"Thou- sands of people are misbehaving, so what does it matter if I am, too?\" No! The goodness of one soul may effectively neutralize the mass karma of millions. Such was the accomplishment of Mahatma Gandhi: he brought freedom to 400 million people by his spiritual influence. He was scoffed at and spent many years in prison, but still he went on. Ultimately, his spirit of righteousness triumphed, and he became instrumental in free- ing India by peaceful means. His life stands as a monumental example of the practical application of Christ's doctrines. Because one individual sowed goodness, millions reaped that goodness and freedom. Each drop of water contributes to the existence of the ocean. So even if one's life seems no more than a droplet in the sea of humanity, that life can have a significant influence. One who makes himself god- like automatically uplifts countless others on the divine path. One who makes himself evil demotes others from the spiritual plane by a nega- tive effect on their potential weaknesses. He who has reformed him- self has reformed thousands; for what one sows in the ether, by the vi- brations of his thoughts and character, others will surely reap.

They convey the value of their services principally through personal example, not merely through elo- quent promises or easily dispensed advice.

Jesus knew that worldly mental- ities have difficulty accepting their personal access to the Merciful Om- nipotence. Thus, when asked by the nobleman to heal his son who was dying at Capernaum, Jesus observed wryly: \"Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.\" It was a gentle rebuke: \"You are loath to believe in God's message of salvation sent through me unless He first demonstrates His presence in me by a display of miracles that benefits primarily your temporal needs.\" God should not have to prove Himself through miracles to earn the love and trust of His children. Each one, through his own free will and perfect accord, should make a voluntary choice of the heart to love God and to seek to know Him. In the wis- dom of a master, one should recognize the Divine Presence and be in- spired toward God-realization without the impetus of supernatural demonstrations. Nevertheless, seeing that the nobleman's faith was sin- cere, Jesus sympathetically told him: \"Go thy way; thy son liveth.\" These few words, supported neither by persuasive eloquence nor obvious evidence, were yet sufficient to satisfy the nobleman; he could sense the divine vibration of healing power in Jesus.

God's will created all things through con- densation of His invisible ideations into the light of life energy and thence into atomic matter. God- realized souls who are in tune with the Divine Will can instantaneously produce any desired changes in matter, including the human body, by concentrated thought, which acts on and restructures the subtle energy matrix underlying each material form. As the energy in man's body can be directed by his will to initiate or influence the movement of any bodily part or function, so also, by omnipresent Divine Will, any vibratory movement effecting atomic changes can be initiated in any body, in any thing, and at any place, no matter how far distant/ The creative vibratory though t of sickness was firmly fixed in the consciousness of the nobleman and his son, but Jesus thought differently, * Scientific exploration of the body's underlying energy template is described on page 119 n. \"Scientists in the Soviet Union have been researching the electromagnetic radia- tion (called 'bioplasma') given off by the human body,\" reports Marilyn Ferguson in The Brain Revolution (New York: Bantam, 1973). \"They have charted the effects of differ- ent stimuli on that radiation.

Using these non- human subjects, explain Schlit z and Braud, the distant healing hypothesis has been put to the test by measuring biological changes in a range of target systems \"while ruling out suggestion or self-regulation as counter-explanations\" (\"Distant Intentionality and Heal- ing: Assessing the Evidence,\" in Alternative Therapies, Vol. 3., No. 6, November 1997). \"Experiments with people showed that prayer positively affected high blood pres- sure, wounds, heart attacks , headaches, and anxiety,\" Dr. Dossey reports. \"Remark- ably the effects of prayer did not depend on whether the praying person was in the presence of the organism being prayed for, or whether he or she was far away; healing could take place either on site or at a distance.\" (Publisher's Note) A master can heal the body by restructuring its underlying energy matrix 333"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"and so the son recovered. Jesus was able to displace the dream of sick- ness in the son by a dream of health. A divinely strong mind, implanting a thought of health and perfection in another person, can dissolve a stub- born thought of illness and cause a surge of restorative healing energy. Ultimately, all disease can be found to have psychological roots, with every thought, in turn, being an ideation of consciousness. Thought is thus the brain, the architect, of the cells and units of life force in every particle of bodily tissue, influencing the functions of the underlying in- telligent lifetrons. Hence, disease thoughts can upset the entire govern- ment of the life force in the cells; if strong enough or chronic enough, such thoughts manifest as bodily disease. Conversely, a strong thought of health can correct any disorder in the cellular system. Concentrated human thought touches Divine Thought; it is that which can heal, not unfocused fanciful thought or imagination. To ef- —  fectively move Divine Thought, one must be con- How concentration of scious of the relation of thought, life force, and the human thought and physical body. Rather than merely asserting the delu- will acts on the cells sive, unreal nature of the body and its diseases, it is of the body better to say: \"The body is not what it appears to be.\" It does exist, though only as the frozen thought and energy of God. Instead of intellectualizing the delusive nature of the body, one should make the effort to realize how thought condenses into energy, and energy int o flesh and blood and tissue. Neither fanatic fancy nor dogmatic belief bestows this realization; it comes by tuning in with God through some technique of awakening His consciousness in the soul. In this state of enlightenment, one fully realizes that the physical body and the entire cosmos are but frozen dreams of the Creator; and that our consciousness, an individualization of His consciousness, is the perceiver of and participator in His creative activity. Flowing water di- rected over an iceberg sculpts the berg into a new shape, either melting it partially or adding to its substance by becoming frozen itself. Like- wise, a powerful mind and will can make consciousness interact with frozen consciousness to manipulate it for good or for ill. The life force in the body has the absolute power to construct or de- stroy the body. But the life force can only perform according to the will of the bodily owner. Most persons do not know that their will can be trained to command the body to bring about miraculous changes in it; hence the wonder-working life energy remains disobedient most of the time to their conscious directives. Neither can the life force be mobilized 334"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"by a will that has become paralyzed by persistent physical or mental in- firmity. When one's will is debilitated by disease, it can be stimulated by the strong will of a mighty healer; the will of the healer and the renewed will of the patient awaken the life force to perform the desired healing. Most persons who are ineffectual in trying to heal themselves have allowed their thoughts of health to be weakened by the mental habit of chronic thoughts of sickness. If for fifty years a person has enjoyed health, he thinks he can never be sick. If he suddenly finds himself phys- ically ill, he thinks at first he will get well; but if the disease persists for six months, he becomes convinced that he will never get well. It is a re- grettable psychological error to allow oneself to be manipulated by neg- ative thoughts. One should visualize the conviction of one's healthful experiences to strengthen one's health consciousness and thereby dis- lodge any die-hard conviction of disease. If the strong mind of a healer can revive the will of the patient who has become paralyzed with the consciousness of sickness, then the patient can change his thought and energy, and thus heal himself. No one can heal us except through the cooperation of the hidde n power of our own thoughts. A God-realized master can produce healing in an unresponsive person, but it is much more difficult; and only a master would be aware of the karmic cir- cumstances that would make such a healing possible. The power of thought in the healing of disease sets into motion a whole metaphysical process cooperative with the laws of creation that bring matter into manifestation. A dynamic thought of healing begins with modulation of the consciousness, of the thoughtrons of the su- perconscious mind, activating th e lifetronic energy, the prana or life force in the body, to make changes in the subatomic electrons, and in the atoms, molecules, and cells. Any wave of consciousness thus sent forth to accomplish a purpose in the manifested realm traverses the whole spectrum of natural laws requisite to fulfilling its goal. Not in the least confounding to the orderly working of the intelligent princi- ples of creation, the entire complex healing process can be effected in- stantaneously when so willed by divine fiat of a master in tune with God's mind; or, according to the wisdom of karmic conditions or other purposes, a healing may take place over a circumstantial period of time. The slower progression of the physical healing is simply catch- ing up with the spiritual healing that has already taken place.

In many cases, he transmitted the healing life force by direct touch. Others he cured by rousing their faith in the power of God emanating through him, thereby stimulating and reinforcing the dor- mant life energy within them. In the case of the nobleman's son in Ca- pernaum, he utilized the dynamic vibratory power of the spoken word. Vibratory healing consists in creating and consciously directing vibrations of life energy to individuals afflicted with disease or other maladies. This may be done internally by mentally projecting energy charged with will power, or externally by the vibrations of chants, in- tonations of the human voice, and enlivening words, phrases, and af- firmations impregnated with superconsciousness. As all creation consists of varying rates of vibration, sound has very great power. When one says softly, \"Oh,\" a little vibration goes through the speaker and into the ether surrounding him. But if a big cannon is fired, its sound will pass through those in proximity and their whole body will be shaken and windows will be shattered. Intelligently spoken words are not merely sounds of communication, but vibrations of consciousness and energy. Their potency is determined not only by the physical force with which they are uttered, but even more by the magnitude of the thought- and energy-vibrations behind them. A spoken word is composed of three vibrations—mental vibra- tion, astral or energy vibration, and flesh vibration. Thus the vibra- tory sound of an utterance such as \"Thou art peace\" has behind it: (i) the vibration of thought that initiates the act of will, the original cause of vibrations of energy and flesh that result in the word \"peace\" be- ing uttered; (2) the vibration of life energy sent by the will from the brain through the nerves to the vocal cords and tongue to allow the word \"peace\" to be spoken; and (3) the physical movement of the vo- cal cords that produce the sound, and the vibratory effect on the phys- ical body and its environs created when the word \"peace\" is voiced. Vibration means motion, which keeps all manifestations—mate- rial, mental, or spiritual — in an elastic state, subject to change. All 336"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"phenomena—solids, liquids, gases; sound, X-rays, visible light; life en- ergy, emotions, intelligence—are grosser or finer vibrating variations of the one Cosmic Vibration of the Creator. The grosser vibrations of matter are relatively fixed, within a circumscribed range. The mind of a matter-bound individual, attuned to the crimped vibrations of the material sphere, also remains relatively fixed. It vibrates with limited power. But potentially the mind has infinite elastic power; no matter how much you stretch it, it will not break. By spiritual techniques that develop concentration and will power and expand the consciousness, the matter-habituated mind is released from those constraints to vi- brate at a finer rate, in tune with the astral and causal vibrations of God's creative activity and ultimately with the Creator Himself. One who knows how to use mind power can do anything. The words of ordinary persons have limited effectiveness to cre- ate changes in vibratory matter because of the enfeebled mind power that projects them. But any imaginable transformation is possible to one who connects his utterances with the omnipotent vibration of God —He whose Word made the light, stars, stones, trees, human beings; He who is sustaining the incredible activity of the innumerable worlds moving in a purposeful order through space.* When behind the spoken word is the word of God, the vibration of God (when one not only says the word God, but feels God as that word), the vibration of the voice goes forth with infinite power. When Jesus said, \"Thy son liveth,\" it was a divine command. Behind his words were the consciousness and perception of God, impregnating his utterance with God's almighty healing power. God's omnipotence omnipresent in creation is insulated in space. The vibratory etheric firmament separates the material realms of cre- ation from the subtler realms, where the divine creative forces are not obscured by gross matter. The mind of a spiritually advanced person pierces the etheric insulation and contacts the higher vibratory forces emanating from God in the astral and causal worlds of all becomings. In the presence of God-realized saints, when they are acting as conduits of the Divine Power, God is not insulated. Even a little men- * \"The infinite potencies of sound derive from the Creative Word, Aum, the cosmic vi- bratory power behind all atomic energies.

This is why so many crowds were mag- netically drawn to Jesus and were healed by that contact. The healing of the nobleman's son did not even require direct con- tact with Jesus.

Songs broadcast at any given moment from Los An- geles reach New York with no perceptible delay, because the sound is car- ried by electromagnetic radio waves moving at the speed of light. If ra- dioed sound waves can be carried with such speed, then sound vibrations impregnated with healing soul force and transmitted through the Divine Omnipresence in the ether can reach their goal with perfect instancy. All vibrations of sound let loose in the ether produce some mo- mentary mental effect upon the hearer; but the vibrations of words sat- urated with soul force remain long in the ether, ever ready to work for the benefit of the recipient. This principle is operative in the effective- ness of prayers offered on behalf of others.

Frequently a medical condi- tion possessed by one personality will mysteriously vanish when another personality takes over....By changing personalities , a multiple who is drunk can instantly become sober. Different personalities also respond differently to different drugs. Dr. Bennett Braun records a case where 5 milligrams of diazepam, a tranquilizer, sedated one per- sonality, while 100 milligrams had little or no effect on another....Speech pathologist Christy Ludlow has found that the voice pattern for each of a multiple's personalities is different, a feat that requires such a deep physiological change that even the most accomplished actor cannot alter his voice enough to disguise his voice pattern. One multiple, admitted to a hospital for diabetes, baffled her doctors by showing no symp- toms while one of her nondiabetic personalities was in control.

In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, \"Wilt thou be made whole?\" The impotent man answered him, \"Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.\" Jesus saith unto him, \"Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.\" And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the Sabbath. The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, \"It is the Sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.\" He answered them, \"He that made me whole, the same said unto me, 'Take up thy bed, and walk.'\" Then asked they him, \"What man is that which said unto thee, 'Take up thy bed, and walk'?\" And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. * It is not known precisely where this story of the healing at the pool of Bethesda fits into the sequence of events recounted in the other three Gospels, which are silent abou t the period from Jesus' forty days in the wilderness un- til the beginning of his preaching the Gospel in Galilee (related in Discourse 22).

N ot wishing to express amazement at the healing performed by Jesus, for that would be an acknowledgment of his superiority, skeptical observers displayed instead a sham zeal for the laws of the Sabbath day. Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, \"Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee\" (John 5:14). J esus was warning the healed man that his sickness had been the re- sult of his own prenatal actions from past incarnations as well as postnatal evil behavior of his present life; and lest he succumb again, he should not persist in his sinful ways. Jesus was pointing out the impor- tance of freeing one's power of independent action from the influence of the tendencies of past wrong actions.

The remedy is that a chronic physical, moral, or mental sickness can be healed in one of two ways: either by direct di- vine intervention of one of God's intermediaries, and cooperation with his advice; or by adopting the counteracting good actions that will de- stroy, or at least minimize, the effects of past wrong actions.

It is only in the Gospel According to St. John that Jesus' antagonists are referred to collectively as \"the Jews.\" Many historians, pointing out that Jesus and his disciples were themselves born into the Jewish tradition, maintain that pe- jorative references to \"the Jews\" entered the accounts of Jesus' life decades after the fact, 348"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"But Jesus answered them, \"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.\" Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the Sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God (John 5:15-18). he critics of Jesus mechanically followed the letter of the rules in observing the Sabbath and their other ethics of living, whereas Jesus followed the spirituality of rules, often ignoring superficiality and man-made formality. The spirit of the Sabbath consists in setting aside material and social engagements and remaining in an inner wor- shipful state of devotion with the consciousness focused on God. In cessation of material activity without spiritual communion, it is pos- sible to be conscious, not of God, but of little more than the idleness of the body. In the name of God, Jesus could perform a material act on the Sabbath day without its being in the least material. To him every day was a Sabbath, lived in wisdom and God-consciousness.

In the womb of the Holy Ghost, with its myriad manifestations, was born the Christ Intelligence of God the Father. Since God differentiated Himself into God the Father beyond creation and God the Son in all creation, He respected all the differences that He created through the Christ-imbued Holy Ghost Cosmic Vibration. So, God the Father beyond creation, being ever new Bliss and Love, caused the same ever new Bliss and Love to be re- flected in the Son or Christ Intelligence present in all vibratory cre- ation. This is what is meant by the \"Father loveth the Son.\" The Son is thus God's love in creation—a magnetic power of harmony and in- telligence working to evolve all manifestations to ever higher levels of perfection. The Father showing all things to the Son denotes that God the Fa- ther's Intelligence beyond creation reveals all His qualities in His re- flection as the Christ Intelligence in creation. Hence as Omnipresent God knows everything, so also a true son who can feel the omnipres- ence of God likewise participates in His omniscience. Revelation of greater works to the Son signifies that all things have their origin in God the Father of creation and proceed toward mani- festation through the Son, or Christ Intelligence. As a Self-realized mas- ter advances toward complete liberation and mergence in God, he per- ceives more and more of the endless manifestations of God's power in eternally progressive creation, in which there will always be greater works throughout eternity—more wonderful than all those revealed up to any given time.

Therefore He is the real Dharma. With- out God no creature can exist. The highest dharma or duty of every human being is to find out, by realization, that he is sustained by God. \"Dharma, therefore, is the cosmic law that runs the mechanism of the universe; and after accomplishing the primary God-uniting yoga-dharma (religious duties), man should perform secondarily his duties to the cosmic laws of nature.... \"Man should perform virtuous dharma, for by obedience to righteous duty he can free himself from th e law of cause and effect governing all actions.

And what of those highly spiritual souls whose bodies are not buried but were cremated and the ashes scattered in the winds and seas? *The traditional Christian belief that the Resurrection on the last day will be heralded by the angel Gabriel blowing his trumpet is not specifically mentioned in the Bible. In various New Testament passages, the Resurrection is said to be heralded by an (un- named) angel sounding a celestial trumpet or by the voice of Christ (as in the verses explained in this Discourse), or both. For example, in Matthew 24:30-31, speaking of \"the end of the world,\" Jesus says: \"He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet....\" Saint Paul wrote that at the time of the Resurrection \"the trumpet shall sound\" (1 Corinthians 15:52), and also of the Lord's coming \"with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God...\" (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).

This \"voice,\" or Gabriel's trumpet, signals the transition, governed by cosmic law, from one vibratory state of existence to another.* * As explained on page 356, man need not wait for death to be uplifted by the \"voice\" of Cosmic Vibration of Aum or Amen (Holy Ghost): Through scientific techniques of meditation he may commune with the Holy Ghost vibration of Aum or Amen, expe- riencing the celestial consciousness spoken of by Saint John in the Book of Revelation: \"I was in the Spirit (spiritual consciousness) on the Lord's day (the day of con- tacting the divine realm s of truth) and heard behind me (in the subtle center of spiri- tual consciousness in the medulla oblongata, 'behind' or in the back of the head) a great voice, as o f a trumpet (the great, blissful sound of Aum).... \"After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, 'Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter'\" (Revelation 1:10; 4:1). 359"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"The slipping of the lifetronic astral body from the atomic physi- cal body at death causes the hum of released lifetronic energy. This —-— sound, resonating with the uplifting Cosmic Sound, True meaning of every person, virtuous or sinful, automatically \"Gabriel's trumpet\" hears with his subtle astral senses during the tran- sition from the physical to the astral world. \"All that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth\" refers to another transition of consciousness effected by \"Gabriel's trumpet\" or the divine voice of Cosmic Vibration. \"Graves\" signifies a temporary after-death state of mental stupor or unconscious sleep which most souls, except those who are advanced, undergo when they depart from the physical body. A comparison may be made with the state of sleep. The wakeful consciousness of man nightly rests in the subconsciousness of sleep, during which man is not aware of the body and his sleep state. The astral body and the causal body semiretire from the muscles and sense organs and rest in the internal organs and the spine and subconscious mind. At the moment of awakening, the life force vibrates outward with many sounds and resurrects the sleeping astral body and mind of man into the state of conscious wakefulness. Similarly, in the after-death state there is a period of unconscious rejuvenating sleep, referred to metaphorically by Jesus as a grave, in which souls are \"entombed\" within their resting astral and causal bodies. The time of this death sleep is different for various people, ac- cording to their individual qualities and good or bad karma—even as people of various habits sleep for long or short periods. Just as the vibrating life force resurrects the consciousness of the sleeper into the wakeful state, so the energy voice of the Holy Cosmic Vibration, the great Amen or Aum sound, lifts souls of good or bad karma, with their astral and causal bodies, from the \"tomb\" of after- death oblivion to awareness of the spiritual environment of the astral heaven, or to reincarnation in a karmically attracted good or bad en- vironment of earthly life. \"For the hour is coming,\" that is, it is imminent with the physi- cal death of each man that he shall hear the sound of Cosmic Vibra- tion (the trumpet of Gabriel) and shall forsake the unconscious sleep of the after-death state. Those who have stored up effects of good ac- tions will be resurrected into conscious awareness of life in the glori- ous astral realm—for a karmically predetermined time—and then be reincarnated into a spiritual earth life. Those who have stored up evil 360"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"in their past lives may experience in their astral bodies the dark astral realms of distressing or nightmarish dreams; eventually, by the damna- tion of the karmic law of reaping what one has —— sown, they will be led by the Cosmic Vibration to Explanation of the real reincarnate in new physical bodies with their same after-death resurrection evil tendencies impinged on the brain, and the ef- fects of their past wrong actions. In sleep the first thing that is forgotten is the body. In death, like- wise, the first thing that is forgotten is the physical body. In sleep, however, there is still a link between the body and the soul, so in wakefulness the person becomes conscious again of the same forgot- ten body. In death the soul's connection with the physical form is per- manently severed: After the sleep of death is finished, a soul awakens not in the same body but in a different body. In the exceptional case of Jesus Christ, though death separated his soul from his physical body, he rebuilt his same broken body by an act of divine will with the Holy Ghost cosmic energy and housed his soul therein again. Thus the word resurrection, \"to rise again\" after death, means reincarnation, which may occur from the physical to the astral, or from the astral to the physical; or for supremely advanced souls, from the physical to the spiritual, from which place souls are never forced to leave again. \"Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the tem- ple of my God, and he shall go no more out.\"* In the astral, souls have luminous bodies of lifetronic energy. In the physical world, souls condense the lifetronic energy of their astral bodies into the grosser atomic structure of the physical body. In the spiritual realm, souls dissolve their delusive bodily forms and dreams of a little body into the consciousness of the Infinite, either as tenu- ously individualized souls in the causal realm or in complete mergence in Spirit. Ordinary souls have to reincarnate repeatedly from the phys- ical to the astral, then back to the physical, until they become devel- oped enough to resurrect from the physical to the astral and then to the all-liberating spiritual realm. No matter where the soul is, it receives a chance to use its reason consciously, or subconsciously, or superconsciously (if its actions are very good), in the causal, astral, or physical world. God-given reason and free choice can never be withdrawn, even if temporarily con- * Revelation 3:12. 361"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"strained by karmic effects of one's evil actions. Souls must be reborn countless times until they have full opportunity to use their free choice to disengage themselves from the woesome bondage to matter, and thereby return to God. As a saint once said to God, \"Thou hast made us for Thyself, and our hearts are restless until they rest in Thee.\"* To this I will add: \"un- til they deserve —by ou r free-will efforts to rise above all restless de- sires that divert us matterward—to rest in Thee.\" Only during nocturnal sleep or -iuring the big sleep of death may a soul rest for a while from external stimuli and the ceaseless activating force of desire; but though its bodily instruments sleep, the ever con- scious soul keeps stirring all the time. If one sleeps peacefully or fretfully, then, on waking, one feels peaceful or worried, as the case may be. So, in deathly sleep, man's deep consciousness keeps stirring—the life and intelligence is continuously invigorating itself. After he has had sufficient respite from external stimuli, his unfulfilled desires begin to revive, increasing in strength until they cause him to reawaken—either in an astral environment or in a new physical incarnation, depending on his karma and the inclination of his desires. Any stir of intelligence during life or death is vibratory change, the motion of which creates sound — as all vibration is manifested from the Holy Cosmic Vibration and all sound from its sound of Amen or Aum. The great uplifting vibratory change instilled by Cos- mic Law at the karmically appointed time of death to release physi- cally captive souls into the freedom of the diseaseless, accidentless, painless astral sphere is one meaning of the \"resurrection after Gabriel blows his trumpet.\" Gabriel's trumpet sounds again after a soul's pre- allotted time in the astral world: The Cosmic Intelligent Vibration, \"his voice,\" leads that soul—encased in an astral body wherein its past good and bad karmic tendencies are stored — to enter into a newly built protoplasmic home of a united sperm and ovum cell, which then develops into the embryo and a new physical body.f This * The Confessions of Saint Augustine, Book One. f Though current scientific theory does not include the idea of past-life tendencies being conveyed via a soul's astral body into a new physical body at the time of reincarnation, scientists admit that they do not fully comprehend the mechanism by which specific phys- ical, psychological, and emotional traits are inborn in each unique human being.

Like attracts like. One's karmic pattern draws him to incarnate in an advantaged or disadvantaged, good or evil, body and mentality, as blending the characteristic genetic traits of both parents into a new combination when they conceive a child. \"This, however, is not free from difficulties,\" writes systems theo- rist Ervin Laszlo in The Whispering Pond: A Personal Guide to the Emerging Vision of Science (Boston: Element Books, 1999). He reports that Nobel-winning biologist Fran- cois Jacob says that the development of embryos is in fact very little understood, and that much of it is, in Jacob's words, \"a complete mystery.\" Lynne McTaggart elaborates in The Field: The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe (New York: HarperCollins, 2002): \"The modern scientific view is that DNA somehow manages to build the body and spearhead all its dynamic activities just by selectively turning off and on certain segments, or genes, whose nucleotides, or genetic instructions, select certain RNA molecules, which in turn select from a large alphabet of amino acids the genetic 'words' which create specific proteins. These proteins sup- posedly are able to both build the body and to switch on and off all the chemical processes inside the cell which ultimately control the running of the body.\" Where this explanation leaves a gap, McTaggart reports, \"is in explaining exactly how DNA knows when to orchestrate this.... \"When a fertilized egg starts to multiply and produce daughter cells, each begins adopting a structure and function according to its eventual role in the body. Although every daughter contains the same chromosomes with the same genetic information, cer- tain types of cells immediately 'know' to use different genetic information to behave differently from others....Furthermore, somehow these genes know how many of each type of cell must be produced in the right place....At the moment, scientists shrug their shoulders as to how this might all be accomplished, particularly at such a rapid pace.\" Laszlo continues: \"For example, while the molecular anatomy of a human hand is understood in some detail, almost nothing is known about how the human organism instructs itself to build a hand. It appears that the organism can both build, and to some extent rebuild, its damaged parts with great precision. For example, when a fin- ger of the human hand is amputated above the first joint and the wound is not sealed surgically with skin, the tip of the finger can be regenerated. Astonishingly enough, the regrown fingertip is complete down to the finest detail, reproducing even the individ- ual's unique fingerprints.\" Fingerprints, known to biologists and criminologists alike as mathematically unique to one individual, are apparently not produced by genetic instructions from DNA, since it has been thoroughly documented that even identical twins—who share the exact same DNA—have different fingerprints. What this suggests, according to sci- entists like Harold S. Burr, is that the growth and maintenance of the body depends on some organizing template of subtle intelligent energy that possesses characteristics unique to each individual and that guides the development and functioning of each physical body.

Thus they who have done good come forth resurrected into a higher life of better circumstances; and they who have done evil come forth on earth \"unto the resurrection of damnation,\" to face and work out the consequences of their misdeeds, in a new life and opportunity to learn and change their ways. The Cosmic Law and Cosmic Holy Ghost Vibration are only guides to help both good and bad to their respective new-life destinations, Nature's secretive way of working to carry out God's creative plan in a wondrous, mysterious dignity. The law of resurrection, or reincarnation, thus teaches man that he must never give up, even if old, discouraged, or at death's door. He should try every minute of his existence to improve himself, knowing that life continues after death into the better land of the astral plane, and thence into new encouraging surroundings on the physical plane. At last he will wake up to Gabriel's trumpet call of ultimate wisdom in the spiritual kingdom, from which there is no forced return to earth. Even as Jesus by overcoming mortal consciousness attained supreme power over life and death, so every man, by the right method of deep meditation, can learn consciously to lift the soul from body conscious- ness into the presence of God. When the last trumpet sounds for that soul, death will hold no mystery. The prodigal soul is taken back from its wanderings in matter to its ever-blessed spiritual home in God.* * \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I shew you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, bu t we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mor- tal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the say- ing that is written, 'Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?' The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ\" (I Corinthians 15:50-57). Saint Paul thus describes the \"trumpet\" of Cosmic Vibration, which resurrects man's consciousness at the end of each earthly incarnation from mortal confinement to the greater freedom after death. Ultimately, \"at the last trumpet,\" the soul is raised to liberation in God through the Christ Consciousness inherent in the Holy Ghost Vi- bration, \"the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ,\" after repeated incarnations of spiritual advancement have destroyed all \"corruption,\" mortal consciousness and de- sires, and their resultant karma.

But no matter how much sin man has acquired, though he be the greatest of sinners, sinning for many incarnations, still he cannot be judged and damned forever. A finite cause cannot have an infinite effect. Nor should a good man rest on the laurels of past good actions; they must be dutifully and continually compounded. That is why Jesus clearly says, \"I can of mine own self do noth- ing: as I hear, I judge.\" That is, the Christ Intelligence acts according to the vibrations of the cosmic law of God that governs our lives. The words of Jesus are a strong exhortation to put one's life in order, in accord with the cosmic law, the divine will of God, lest by wrong living one create a physical and mental hell of suffering even greater than the imaginary judgment of an after-death hellfire. Far bet- ter that by good living man create within himself the sweetness of a portable heaven. Only when man attains the final good, or God, does he escape the inescapable judgment of the mortal law of action into the immortal Divine Transcendence. \"If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.

Among these are divine predictions made through the prophets' intu- itive foreknowledge about the coming Messiah, such as are discussed here and in other Discourses.

Thus scholars propose that the Gospel writers cited some Old Testament passages as being \"fulfilled\" not as prophecy, but simply that the principle, truth, or figure of speech it voiced is a parallel—or otherwise also applicable—to pres- ent circumstances. Historians point out that early Christians saw Jesus' entire life as a \"fulfillment of the scriptures\"—the consummation of the Law and historical destiny revealed in the sacred writings; thus it was important to the Gospel authors to provide the community of believer s with links between events that actually occurred in the life of Jesus and familiar passages from the holy texts.

When Jesus reached Galilee he felt the divine vibrations of the cosmic cycle prepared for his coming, and he put the love of his heart and the dy- namism of his sou l into giving God to all. At this auspicious time, Jesus was filled wit h the Holy Ghost, having been baptized in Spirit by John the Baptist; thus when he began his mission in Galilee it was \"in the power of the Spirit.\" Jesus knew about the declaration of the prophet Isaiah, and that he had been thus divinely guided to follow his foretold dispensation into Galilee to preach the gospel.* As prophesied by Isaiah, the people who abode in the darkness of ignorance in that land beheld in the advent of Jesus the all-revealing light of Christ-wisdom. Just as • • aeons of darkness lodged in a mountain cave are dis- Dispelling the dark- lodged by a single lighted match, so the vibrations of ness of ignorance by a people's gathered ignorance of ages can be dis- the light of Christ- pelled by a saint who bears the illumining torch of wisdom God's wisdom. Among those persons who sit in the darkness of ignorance, many love it and d o not wish to be displaced from its complacent familiar- ity. But others there are who become conscious of the stolid gloom of unknowing and earnestly long for freedom from its torpidity. Through the gathering of knowledge and arousal of subconscious memories in the soul, seekers of wisdom receive glimpses of their lost experience of God's light and increasingly abhor their fallen state. So, in Galilee, those people who realized their abject darkness, those who were in- wardly clamoring for light, were receptive to the wisdom vibrations of Jesus. Lord Krishna, in the Bhagavad Gita, speaks of this earth as the aggregate of delusive mysteries and as the ocean of affliction.f Isaiah speaks of worldly people as sitting \"in the region and shadow of death,\" the constantly changing temporal events of this earth.

The influence of this cosmic dream is such that persons behold with fre- netic attachment life and shadowy death and all concomitant duali- ties; but when they awaken in wisdom, they behold all seeming con- tradictions harmonized in the Oneness of God's Light. The very presence of Jesus and his luminous wisdom relieved many of their delusive inner gloom. Again, the Hindu scriptures cite an apt metaphor: Saints, in their nonattachment, are considered by ordinary men to reside in a dark- ness of material poverty, while actually they live in the light of opu- lent Eternal Wisdom; whereas most persons bask in an imagined light of prosperity in material possessions, while they are in truth enveloped in a thick darkness of spiritual ignorance.\"' Jesus knew he was empowered by heaven to give spiritual light to man. In that power of Spirit, he preached the gospel: the \"good message\" or enlightening revelation of God's pronouncements — commandments and laws for attaining the kingdom of heaven and its happiness. He preached trut h as he perceived it through his own God- realization: \"The kingdom of God is at hand.\" Many people look for heaven at some point in space beyond the clouds, far away from the noxious, sinful vapors of the earth. Jesus' —— words \"at hand\" signify the nearness of heaven, The kingdom of which lies just behind the darkness of closed eyes, heaven is to be found within the consciousness of man; and that with within the conscious- ease, people could find God through the mediation ness of man Jesus was offering to them. In deep meditation, when one shuts out the land of finitude and mat- ter, the realm of Eternity, the vast heavenly kingdom of God's om- niscience, is found t o lie tier upon tier in endless vistas before the in- ner vision. Therefore, the first commandment Jesus gave to the people was \"Repent ye,\" signifying the withdrawal of the principal attention from *The Bhagavad Gita says: \"That which is night to all creatures is (luminous) wake- fulness to the ma n of self-mastery. And what is wakefulness to ordinary men, that is night to the divinely perceptive sage.\" The meaning is: \"While creatures slumber in delusion's gloom, the X-ray eyes of the seer are open to wisdom's light.

Every soul, upon spiritually awakening, should repent of its folly of expecting permanent happiness from fleeting sense plea- sures. The poor taste for sorrow-producing evil should be displaced by the superior inclinations for joy-producing good. People are foolish to look for Paradise in earthly things. How could changeless, perfect happiness be wrung out of imperfect earth surroundings, a motley perplexity of events of sorrow and joy, disease and health? Earth conditions, being born of delusion, will always be more or less defective. Heaven on earth is found only within by the contact of the illuminating Immutable Wisdom perceived in medita- tion. Jesus' spiritual persuasion made people open their closed eyes of soul wisdom to dispel their self-created darkness: The Fountain of Light springs forth from the cleft soil of dark delusion. If man repents of his excessive attention given to the finite cos- mos, and regularly devotes time to deep meditation, he will find the heavenly land of infinity within him. The wise man repents because he sees the frivolity of worldly life and knows the miseries resulting from the contact of matter , not only in himself but in empathetic feeling for all beings.

First, one must believe in God's message as sent through Hi s saints and avatars, as in the gospel preached by Jesus, and repent of the folly of matter attachment.

When Jesus said to \"believe the gospel,\" he meant more than a casual mental acceptance of his message.

If a man is thirsty and is advised to quench his thirst with the water from a nearby good well, he must believe in that advice suffi- ciently to make the effort to go to the well and drink from it. Similarly, Jesus emphasizes that truth-seeking souls must not only repent of the foolishness of following unsatisfying material ways of living, and believe in the truths experienced by him through God; they must also act accordingly that they might realize those truths for themselves. To be an orthodox unquestioning believer in any spiritual doctrine, without the scrutiny of experimentation to prove it to oneself, is to be ossified with dogmatism. Jesus did not ask the people merely to believe in his message, but to keep faith in his divine revelations with the as- surance that by believin g in, and hence concentrating upon, the gospel, they would surely and ultimately experience within themselves the truths in those revelations. Belief is wasted on false doctrines; but truth poured out to man through the authority of God-realized saints is wor- thy of belief and sure to produce divine realization. Even on the authority of the fame of scriptural text, one cannot judge what it teaches, for various are the meanings and consequent distortions drawn from holy writ, some of which defy the laws of both reason and wisdom. Also, who can deny what errors might have come down through the centuries in the form of mistranslations or mistakes made by scribes? The Bible and the Vedas may well be inspired texts that came from heaven , but the ultimate test of truth is one's own re- alization, direct experience received through the medium of the soul's omniscient intuition.

The man washing the tail was sure all were wrong, for the elephant was a rope leading high up toward heaven! Then the driver said, \"Friends, you are all right and you are all wrong.\" Because each blind man had been washing a part of the elephant, they were all partly right; but they were also wrong because the part was not the whole. The purpose of religion, of life itself, is to find God. Man will not be able to rest until he reaches that Goal, because all the forces of the universe will seem to conspire to entrap him in his karma until he heeds the gospel of repentance and realizes that \"the kingdom of God is at hand\"—within himself in the here and now. * See yoga in glossary. Among the world's spiritual teachings, yoga offers the most pre- cise and scientific descriptions and psychophysiological techniques pertaining to the as- cent of the soul to God. However, the same basic experiences of ascension, presented in less specific terminology or cloaked in metaphor, are to be found in the experiences and writings of God-realized saints of every religion. Evelyn Underhill, in Mysticism (Part i, Chapter 4), wrote: \"It is one of the many indirect testimonies to the objective reality of mysticism that the stages of this road, the psychology of th e spiritual ascent, as described to us by different schools of con- templatives, always present practically the same sequence of states. The 'school for saints' has never found it necessary to bring its curriculum up to date. \"The psychologist finds little difficulty, for instance, in reconciling the 'Degrees of Orison' described by St. Teresa—Recollection, Quiet, Union, Ecstasy, Rapt, the 'Pain of God,' and the Spiritual Marriage of the soul—with the four forms of contempla- tion enumerated by Hugh of St. Victor, or the Sufi's 'Seven Stages' of the soul's ascent to God, which begi n in adoration and end in spiritual marriage.

As the fame of Jesus spread with his ministry, the time had come for him to call those select disciples into service who would not just be among his followers, but would give their all to help fulfill his work on earth. The opportune occasion came at the Sea of Galilee. As he stood at the water's edge, throngs pressed upon Jesus to hear his gospel and receive his blessing. He boarded a fishing boat, moored on land belonging to Simon (Peter) and his brother Andrew, and asked Simon to move the vessel a little offshore, from which vantage place he taught the people. Afterward, he instructed Simon: \"Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.\" Simon obeyed, even while he protested the futility in that no fishes had been hauled aboard though they had labored all night.

Jesus thought as a Hindu mas- ter would think, when in calling his disciples to become fishers of men he sought to instill in their minds the imagery: \"O Beloved God, as I pass by the sea of my consciousness, I behold my ego catching the small bony fishes of material objects—name, fame, coins of good for- tune. Bless me so that I may see, instead, in the sea of my unruffled desire-free consciousness, the way to make a far more worthy catch with the net of devotional God-given wisdom—the large fishes of di- vine truth-seeking souls. May I learn how to cast the net of truth over soul-fishes roaming in the fetid waters of delusion, to release them in the immortalizing sea o f God-wisdom.\" Wise men consider this world an ocean of delusion in which hu- man fish are constantly chased by the sharks of the senses. Satan then casts upon these piscine mortals his colossal dragnet of entangling de- sires, and is pulling his catch to the shores of destruction.

To furnish food to the hungry is good, to give inner strength to the mentally weak so that they can fend for themselves is even more important, and to impart all-freeing wisdom to the soul-bewildered is of supreme consequence. Material or mental help is only transitory consolation for human embroilments; Heaven is the permanent pana- cea for all human afflictions. The givers of food and mental power enrich themselves tem- porarily by the goodwill of those benefited; but the givers of soul nour- ishment benefit themselves throughout eternity, as also the receivers of the divine manna. The effect of food and mental power more or less wears off in time unless constantly replenished, but the marks of soul wisdom impinged upon the inner being can seldom be erased. That is why Jesus began to call qualified disciples from their natural labors to assist him in drawing souls from the waters of delusion into the ever- living wisdom of God's oceanic presence. To be a good fisherman, one must learn the tools and skills of the trade. In order to become a spiritual fisherman, one must become adept in the art of spiritual fishing. To give salvation to others with- out having it oneself is impossible. No matter how well-meaning, a person can give only what he has, nothing else. In order to give spiri- tual power, one must first acquire that power himself. Just as a gift of food presupposes its possession by the giver, so also, wisdom can only be conferred upon others by those who possess it. Enlightenment can be imparted only by one who himself reflects that inner light. Jesus knew this requisite, that anyone willing to be a fisher of souls must intensely spiritualize himself first. He voiced this quite plainly in the Sermon on the Mount: \"Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.\" A fisher of men must save himself from the ocean of ignorance by sincerely offering himself unto God with constant effort and vigilance. The Heavenly Father wants to see His fishers of men escape from Sa- tan's nets of delusion and destruction so that they can help other en- trapped souls. To seek one's own salvation and then not use it to ben- efit others is extreme selfishness. But to seek salvation for oneself so that ultimate freedom may be shared with others is divine. 386"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"In the first stage of spiritual progress, a clear line of demarcation must be established between good and evil in order that the latter may be superseded by the former.

On the other side, disquietude, sorrow, sense pleasure, revengefulness, temp- tation, selfishness, inflame bad habits that lead to bondage and trou- ble. It is nature's quixotic teasing of man that strenuous self-control produces ultimate happiness, and the effortlessness of momentarily pleasurable indulgence brings eventual unhappiness. Evil, once established within man, is made so attractive that he easily inclines toward evil actions, evil habits, and evil tendencies. Dis- criminating souls who have compared the results of evil experiences with the outcome of righteous behavior have inevitably concluded that evil, though ever so appealing in the beginning, is really a loathsome harbinger of acute suffering, while virtue, though initially difficult to pursue, is the ambassador of invariable ultimate good. Hysterical moralists decry evil as an ugly, vile abomination to be summarily discarded. But when some of their followers taste the in- toxicating comfort of temptation, it seems neither ugly nor vile; they dismiss the fear of evil consequences and embrace the freely given mo- mentary pleasure. Long afterward—or sometimes in the resounding crash of instancy—the mask of attractiveness falls off, and the satanic nature of evil appears with its consequential ravages. It is not enough to preach against evil, for its deceptive cunning will counteract every argument. Man needs to be convinced of the eventual, everlasting blessings of virtue. It is better for teachers to tell the truth—that evil is very attractive and enjoyable in the beginning, like poisoned honey, sweet to taste; but it is deathly bitter once swal- lowed. Good may be troublesome and therefore unpalatable for a time, but only until its subtle effects stir the soul to exude the incred- ible sweetness it draws from the nectarine sea of the inner Elysium. It is far better to abhor the trouble-producing instant gratification of evil for the lasting happiness earned through the urge and labor of virtu- ous actions. This is the ultimate realization the clear thinker comes to as to why good is preferable to evil. 387"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Indulging in evil is a cultivated habit. The first time a person smokes, it burns his nose, throat, and lungs; but after some time the habit takes over and he enjoys a smoke and becomes very uncomfort- able without it. If the inveterate smoker later accurately analyzes the effect of smoking on his health and mind and tries to forsake the habit, he is hard put and often unsuccessful in doing so. Evil has a gripping affect. But so have virtuous ways. When evil arrives first and firmly establishes itself in a person's life, it takes advantage of its priority and deludes its host with the con- sciousness of its supreme attractiveness. This blinds that person to the superior offerings of goodness and virtue. Many people are thus so steeped in error that they enter the grave without ever realizing their deluded state. Their evolution is delayed as they carry their progres- sion in evil into the next life, or several lives, until through the in- evitable effects of their wrongdoings they come to a rude awakening. So, before evil mesmerizes one's mind with false expectations, the power of goodness should be cultured to become the in-charge of one's life. God is the goal of man's existence. To find Him and share Him with others is the tremendous work He has placed before every man. As Jesus called his disciples to be fishers of souls by becoming teach- ers of his gospel, so God has charged everyone to perfect themselves in His love and wisdom and help bring others back to Him through unspoken sermons of their spiritual example. When one's whole being is with God, others will be drawn to Him by the silent eloquence of that divine magnetism. The question arises: Why did Jesus call Simon (as also several of his other unlettered disciples) to be a teacher when he had not under- gone even rudimentary instruction in spiritual Soul magnetism more teachings? Those who became apostles were cer- important than ora- tainly not chosen on the basis of academic creden- torical ability  tials.

Jesus could see Simon's spiritual attainments in the astral mark- ing in his brain, so on that certification he recognized and chose Simon to be foremost among his missionaries.

I did not want to add to the world's surfeited roster of orators who are silver-tongued and lead-minded. Spiritual elo- quence is less a matter of articulation than of soul magnetism born of virtuous living and meditative inner communion with God. Spreading the word of God should not be used as a medium for glorifying one's ego and indulging its penchant for recognition. Until I feel a disciple is true from the past, I would not ask him to teach. If a devotee has good karma and sincere willingness to listen, it does not take much to train him. Attunement is the —— most important requisite. All great masters have Qualifications and chosen their disciples according to that, notwith- requirements for spir- standing the Judases in whom latent egotistical ten- itual teachers dencies awake to snatch away their spirituality. Hu- mility, love for God and doing everything with the thought of God, forgetting self, are the fundamental criteria characterizing a true ser- vant of God's word. Additionally, I would include the following re- quirements and practices, principles that Jesus also, in one form or an- other, instilled in his apostles during the time they spent in his company absorbing his spirit and ideals: A spiritual teacher should have Self-realization, or at least be sin- cerely striving for that God-attunement and subversion of the ego. He should have an appreciative, respectful, comparative knowl- edge of religions, while being grounded in truth, free from hidebound dogma. He should know the difference between true religion and cus- tom, discriminating between universal spirituality and denominational observances. In order to transmit truth effectively, one must be inspired by the inner perception of truth. The highest type of spiritual teacher spends much time in the divine communion of prayer and meditation — preferably, every morning, noon, and night. This is the way to be able to arrive at the truth in any given situation. He should believe in and be well versed in the truths he wants to teach, and then strive to realize those truths in himself. The intuitional teacher is the most qualified. The intuitive power of the soul, once awakened by meditation, does not have to depend on reason; it knows. A teacher should always meditate before instructing others, a practice more valuable than gleaning ideas from books or dialogues with other people. 389"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"He must keep his mind on God that he might in the highest way be able to convey thoughts of God to others.

Once he be- gins to take money for his service to God's work, it becomes merely a job; his mind will be on making a living and wanting more money, not upon the Christlike ideal of serving without thought of remuneration. That is why I have never allowed paying teachers of Self-Realization Fellowship. I am concentrating on monastic teachers who renounce all for God's work. They must be free to give unselfishly of themselves. That is the way I was trained, and that is what I believe. God's work and those who serve it will be supported by God through the good- will offerings of those who are benefited, as well as through the pro- ceeds from spiritual goods and services that spread the work. A spiritual teacher should never try to compete with others; he should stick to his goal and teach loyalty to that purpose. He should never allow himself to be controlled by those who would compromise his ideals for financial or organizational favors given.

A first-century synagogue that most scholars believe to be \"almost certainly\" the one in which Jesus preached, as described in this verse, was discovered by archaeolog- ical excavation in Capernaum in the 1960s, according to Jeffrey L. Sheler in Is the Bible True? (New York: HarperCollins, 1999). This synagogue was the scene of at least one divine healing by Jesus, as told in Luke 4:33-37 (see Discourse 24). Sheler also re- ports that additional excavation in Capernaum, at the site of a Byzantine church dat- ing from about A.D. 400, uncovered a deeper stratum of evidence that indicated the building had originally been a house built about sixty years before Jesus' birth and ren- ovated a few decades after his passing. Some researchers believe this to have been the family residence of the Apostle Peter—where Jesus was known to have spent time dur- ing the early part of his ministry—since the walls of the ancient structure found un- der the Byzantine churc h had extensive early Christian graffiti, \"including at least two references to Peter,\" and since reports from pilgrims visiting Capernaum in the fourth century mention visiting Peter's house, \"which they said had been turned into a church.\" (Publisher's Note) 391"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"Teachers who know nothing about God offer to their audiences secondhand ideas gleaned from hours spent poring over books and scriptures.

But those who espouse God only from the pulpit, having lit- tle or nothing to do with Him otherwise, are of the ilk characterized by Jesus as \"hypocrites.\" They hardly ever pray; they read, and they preach what they have read. People in their congregation, for the most part, let their unlived sermons pass through one ear and out the other. That is the great import of this verse depicting Jesus in the syna- gogue. He did not preach like the scribes, with empty words. When he spoke, his words were filled with the Word, the Cosmic Energy, of God. His doctrine was replete with the conviction of realization, born of his Christ stature and Cosmic Consciousness, vibrating with the authority of God's wisdom. His sermons bore the seal of God's assurance. Is this not a hint to all ministers of the gospel? It is not enough to commit to memory the words of the scriptures, or to receive a Doctor of Divinity degree. One must digest truth and then preach with the power and conviction of the soul. When God speaks through a soul, mountains of delusion are removed from the minds of listeners. Face-to-face realization of truth gives one intuitive experience, true vision and understanding. Such wisdom gives power; it is the energy that moves the Cosmic Factory, producing control over all things. That power declares the absolute authority of infallible truth. Jesus spoke not with the fanaticism or rote of the scribes, but with the authority of Self-realization of God and a knowledge of all His mysteries. When one has been a devotee for years, living virtuously and med- itating upon God, and thereby succeeds in pleasing Him, then He chooses that soul to bring others back to His kingdom. These ad- vanced souls are saturated with the spirit, intelligence, and power of God; anyone physically, mentally, or spiritually sick, coming in con- tact with them, receives God's healing blessing.

Jesus, with his perfect integrity and divine knowledge, would not have referred to such cases as possession by evil spirits if they had instead been psychological, as in hysteria or lunacy. In modern times many people scoff at the idea of anybody being possessed by an unclea n devil. They dismiss such assertions as a myth or superstition—and no doubt there are many quasi-superstitious out- growths in beliefs and practices. In the olden days of superstition and candle light, devils seemed to be plentiful; but now, in the electrical age, the evil spir- its appear to be scared away. However, psychiatrists can tell of the many cases of mental obsessions by fixed ideas, little knowing that some patients may in- deed be suffering from actual possession by unclean spirits. Real cases of possession may be misdiagnosed as brain-derangement, or as a state of hallucination, or as spells of hysteria.

Whil e preaching in the synagogue (a place where people usually go for their souls to be healed by the salve of inspiring sermons), Jesus encountered a man possessed by an unclean devil.

Tramp souls, having lost their own physical-body vehicle to which they were inordi- nately attached, are on the watch for such unattended conveyances. Unclean devils, cited in the cases of possession that Jesus exor- cised, are those astral beings among tramp souls who on earth were murderers, robbers, and other criminals, drunkards and licentious per- sons, and especially vicious and treacherous beings, who did not cleanse themselves of their evil propensities before death. Even the greatest sinner, if he cleans his subconscious mind and memory by con- tacting the superconsciousness in meditation before death, does not carry his unpurged wickedness into a sphere beyond death. But those persons who leave their physical bodies in a state of sin, as also those who ruthlessly and foolishly commit suicide, are considered unclean souls in the astral world. They roam in the lower astral spheres, im- prisoned in their astral and causal bodies, finding no rest, and either hating to be reborn on the earth or grieving for the loss of their phys- ical incarnation. These forlorn souls have to wander about in the ether until some of the karmic effects of their bad actions are worn out through the operation of the divine law. The devilish spirits among them are very unscrupulous, even as they were during earth life. Satan, the Cosmic Evil Intelligence, has his satellites in disrep- utable persons who have lost in the moral and spiritual battle, work- ing through these decadent beings not only on earth while they are liv- ing but also in their afterlife astral existence.

As a good boy turned to evil ways can be called a devil, so the dis- incarnate astral consciousness of a person gone wrong becomes devilish in its behavior. Such wicked beings pass through many strange experi- ences in the afterlife. As people of calm disposition usually have deep soothing sleep, so good souls, when they sleep the sleep of death, expe- rience a wondrously refreshing peace and uplifting dream visions before reincarnating to continue working out their earthly karma. But as rest- less and excitable persons often experience nightmares during sleep, so also when people of evil-disturbed disposition die, they experience dur- ing the great death sleep, according to the law of cause and effect, only horrible astral nightmares, reflections of their own accumulated evil. As a man may sleep a few hours or three hours or twelve hours or may have sleeping sickness, so some souls after death remain in the state of unconscious sleep for a little while or a long time, according to their karma in earthly life. Souls with good karma are able to be awake in the astral land after their sleep of death. Those who have practiced many virtues enjoy the results of their good karma on heav- enly astral planets where the limitations of earth life are non-existent. Most souls, neither categorically virtuous nor evil, after sleeping the sleep of peaceful unconscious death, with occasional experiences of as- tral wakefulness, wake up in the womb of their new earthly mother.

But they can never infest brains occupied with intelligent thinking, or people with strong will power or vibrations of spiritual perception. That is why one should never make the mind negative, or blank, in or- der to open oneself to messages from disincarnate spirits. This presents an ideal opportunity for possession by low-type tramp souls seeking human vehicles for expression and experience.* The minds of spiritually advanced persons cannot be occupied by devilish souls; but these devotees can invoke the presence of and com- munion with saintly souls by use of the proper technique of astral in- tuition. One must learn the right technique from one's guru. Divine saints do not appear through mediums and seances; they respond only when they are invited by the urge of the devotion of advanced devo- tees. Such devotees can see or talk to saints in vision. When they de- velop even further, they can see with open eyes the materialized form of saints and can talk to them or touch them, even as the advanced disciples of Jesus were able by their devotion to see and touch Jesus Christ in flesh after his resurrection. So the idea of devils possessing weak-brained, thought-unoccupied persons cannot be discarded as superstition. But a strong personality fully occupies his brain, thereby shutting out the invasion of tramp souls. Devotees who are sincerely seeking God, and who practice scien- tific methods of prayer and meditation, need never fear such beings; for no harm from negative spirits can come to one whose thoughts are on God.

There is a distinct difference between the condition of a person acting under the influence of possession by a tramp soul or unclean devil, and that of one acting under a hypnotic spell or the obsession of a subconscious idea, or autosuggestion. Men and women under the influence of hypnosis or strong obsession of the subconscious mind can be made to act in either a noble or a devilish way. Real possession consists of the actual presence in one's body of a soul that has cast off its own physical garment and in its astral form is partially, completely, or spasmodically incapacitating the rational faculties of the possessed. One human body ordinaril y cannot house another being along with its own self (except in the case of a mother carrying a child). But spir- itual experts are able to distinguish true cases of spirit possession, be- cause by their psychic powers they are able to behold, within the per- son possessed, the astral body of the invisible visitor side by side with the astral body of the host. The only way a layman is able to deduce a case of spirit possession is by analyzing the different states of parox- ysm and wild behavior to which a possessed person is subject. The evil-spirit-possessed person usually displays unusual physical strength, bloodshot eyes, uncanny expression, and general lack of normal be- havior. This bestial irrationality is variously displayed and described in the instances of spirit possession exorcised by Jesus. Like attracts like, so the possessed man in the synagogue, by the attraction of his own sinful vibration, drew unto himself an unclean spirit. Jesus, possessing the universal Christ Con- sciousness, could feel exactly what was going on within the body of the bedeviled man. And the un- clean spirit, through the intuition of its astral body, could feel the power of Jesus. (Astral-bodied souls perceive through the sixth sense of intuition; but they can use it to perform the functions of vision, audition, smell, taste, touch, and so forth.) The unclean, wicked spirit kept the mind of the possessed man in a state of suspension, neutrality, and sub-hypnosis of obsession, so that its victim's instruments of consciousness—senses, brain, and body—could be used without interference.

The unclean spirit saw Jesus through the eyes of the possessed man, and used his voice to cry loudly: \"Let us alone; do not deny us our freedom of expression, be it good or evil.\" The possessive spirit, itself obsessed with satanic evil, recognized in Jesus the opposing force of godly good: \"I know thee...the Holy One of God.\" The spirit rightly feared that Jesus, with his Christ Con- sciousness having control over all life, would put an end to the unau- thorized, forced occupation of the possessed man's mind. It knew that the omnipresent Christ Consciousness in Jesus was the Lord of cre- ation. Astral beings, whether clean or unclean, know that it is the Christ Intelligence and not Satan's maya that has ultimate power over the inner world, even though Satan tries to exert his influence in the astral world to the same degree he succeeds on earth. But heaven is not a comfortable place for a fallen archangel. Jesus did not want the unclean devil, in its irritated state, to do harm to the brain of the obsessed man. If possession by unclean dev- ils or disembodied souls continues for long, great mischief is done to the brain, mind, and sense organs of the possessed individual, posing a threat of the advent of permanent insanity. By his life-controlling will power, Jesus spoke: \" Hold thy peace and come out of him.\" That is, stop the devilish work of wrecking possessed brains; hold on to the in- ner peace of the soul, hidden behind the dark barrier of self-created past evil propensities, and restore again your right behavior by com- ing out of the body you have forcibly and unethically occupied. It requires strong concentration and divine will power to dislodge an evil spirit. If one has dynamic spiritual force, the entity can be thrown out by constantly looking into the eyes of a stricken individual, using steady, silent will power continuously, inwardly commanding the evil spirit to leave . The entity will depart provided the will of the healer to drive the evil force out is stronger than the latter's will to remain. By the repeated whisper of \"Aum\" in the right ear of a possessed in- dividual, the evil spirit is bound to leave. Tramp souls, having wandered out of the dark lower astral regions, cannot stand the high vibration of spiritual thoughts and consciousness. The utterance of holy names and words, especially Aum, Aum, Aum, into the ear of possessed individuals usually brings forth a quick, frightened reply from the individual like: \"I am going; don't utter that holy word,\" which indicates spirit possession. 402"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"Jesus, drawing power from the Cosmic Aum Vibration, com- manded, with his i4«m-impregnated voice, the devil to come out of the body of the afflicted individual.

One cannot dismiss this problematic conflict by ra- tionalizing that Satan is a mere delusion.

Millions of harmful bacteria and a melange of evil diseases, evil thoughts, evil passions, are all potentially implanted by the evil force into the mind and body of man. Though man is essentially made in the image of God, when his mortal vulnerability succumbs to obses- sion by the latent satanic forces in him of greed, selfishness, anger, or any of the evil tendencies, these overcloud the purity of the human soul. God's light is present in every being as the soul with its godly re- flections of divine forces and qualities; Satan is also present in every being as ignorance with distinct reflections of himself as evil forces or spirits. Thus, each individual is influenced both by the soul and its good qualities and by Satan and his evil qualities. So the truth is that the direct creator of evil—as concerns the rel- ative existence and experience of man — is this Satanic Force, the archangel that turned away from God and misused his God-given power in order to create evil as a counterpart of all the good that God has created. Thus we find in each man opposite qualities—good cre- ated by God, evil created by Satan; love created by God, hate created by Satan; kindness created by God, selfishness created by Satan; in- toxication of divine ecstasy created by God, and intoxication of evil gratifications created by Satan.* When a person is beset with an evil obsession, physically, men- tally, or spiritually — such as chronic disease; insidious emotions, habits, or desires; spiritual ignorance—it is the manifestation of a spirit reflection of Satan, a devil, that needs to be cast out as decidedly * In yogic terms, the Bhagavad Gita explains the good and evil forces in man as a war between two contending armies, one led by the powers of the divine discrimination of the soul and the other by the materialistic mind and its baser instincts of the delusion- influenced senses.

Vice takes the cloak of virtue and fools the gatekeeper of reason, and thus enters the forbidden sanctum of virtue. Each soul is independent and free to act according to the good influences of God and soulful qualities, or to act under the influence of Satan's evil qual- ities and Satan's reflections, the devils which obsess the being of man. While good and evil actions can be freely chosen, after one has acted he has no free choice as to consequences. If he acts in a good way he must receive a good result and if he acts in an evil way he must receive an evil result. The cohort reflections of Satan in each man constantly urge him to do wrong through the lure of temptations that appeal to his prenatal karmic tendencies and present habits. God tries to influ- ence a being through conscience and soul peace found in meditation. As a free agent, man must choose either to act under the influence of God's direction or Satan's evil incitements. When one acts according to the influence of conscience or good qualities, he creates good tendencies and good habits which automat- ically draw him toward God. Whenever an individual acts evilly un- der the influence of evil habits or evil qualities, then automatically he is drawn toward Satan, ignorance, and satanic ways. This explanation of good and evil is to point out that man is not responsible for being tempted to do evil under the influence of anger, greed, or fear, or other evils, implanted in him by Satan, but he is re- sponsible if he choose s to act according to the temp- How satanic tenden- tations of the evil forces. Such temptations appear in cies become obses- man as evil impulses and inner promptings to do sions in the human wrong. When the evil forces are successful, obsessed mind  man feels compelled to act out those urges. Human beings thus succumb to evil not only through the influence of their prenatal or postnatal tendencies and bad habits, but also because they are consciously pushed by the satanic en- tities residing in the brain. When the evil entity of an obsession is dis- lodged from the brain by higher meditations, self-controlled right ac- tions, and the help of one's guru, then a soul really becomes free. Jesus healed Mary Magdalene from seven devils, visitations of the evil forces.* Great masters, like Jesus, can transmit their light of spiritual- ity into the mind of a person obsessed with an evil intent and thereby dislodge the specific evil force causing the affliction. *Luke 8:2. and Mark 16:9. 406"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"If a man sits in a room full of light, beholding beautiful objects, to him light exists. If another man sits in the same room with eyes closed, to him darkness exists—albeit self-created. Similarly, there are two kinds of people in this world. One kind have their spiritual eyes of wisdom open; they see God and His goodness existing everywhere, in everything. The secon d kind have their spiritual eyes closed; they experience creation as rife with Satan and his evils. Man is responsible for harboring the darkness of evil if he does not cultivate the true perception of wisdom. Devotees are those souls who obey the wishes of God to keep their eyes of wisdom open and focused only on good; and deluded persons are those who heed the voice of evil and keep their eyes of spirituality closed, thus courting the darkness of misery, sickness, and the whole host of Satan's evils. God is alluring His devotees by all good things to come unto Him; and Satan, by the allurement of false promises of happiness, is coax- ing people deeper into his pit of ignorance and misery. Man should consider the whisperings of his conscience and good tendencies as the call of God within him. Conversely, he should recognize and resist the promptings of evil thoughts and urges as the lure of Satan. If man continuously listens responsively to the whisperings of his conscience and nascent virtues and gets used to better ways of living, he ultimately discovers the eternal good within the God-image of his soul, and through this Self-realization becomes liberated. Because Sa- tan breaks his promises to give lasting happiness to his followers, they will all finally turn away from him to God.

Thus, he knew the metaphysical art of casting out those devils, as did his specially or- 407"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"dained apostles. The art is known to all masters, who then teach other souls how to be free forever from the innate influences of evil entities, by consciously establishing within themselves the preemi- nence of God. Great masters can heal the ignorance in truth-seeking devotees by contact with the Christ Consciousness and transmitting to them that spiritual power. I have seen how my guru, Swami Sri Yuktes- warji, cast out devils from obsessed beings and healed so-called in- curable sicknesses and preached through his exemplary living. Mas- ters who are entirely free from evil show others thereby how to be likewise free. By the contact of God through advanced concentration and med- itation, as with the Self-Realization techniques, and by spiritually de- veloping oneself with the help of the guru, devotees can actually dis- lodge the originator of evil, Satan and his obsessing entities, from within the sacred sanctum of their body temple. Illumined saints have declared how the spirit entity of evil takes shape and leaves the body permanently, after highest spiritual attain- ment. When the evil entity departs, the cleansed consciousness of the devotee becomes not only absolutely impervious to evil but cannot see evil in anything anymore. He sees God alone everywhere.* In summary, the lesson to be drawn from the dramatic demon- strations of Jesus in casting out devils is not that one should concen- trate on and fear possession by tramp souls (a rare actuality) or ob- sessions by Satan's evil entities (innate in the human psyche). Rather, one should have a working knowledge of and healthy respect for the ever-present delusive satanic power and thereby keep oneself wholly immune to evil influences. Listen to the voice of God echoing in your good thoughts. These are strong intimations from God and His angelic spirits to guide and help you. Satan also is exerting his influence with his own kind of con- trary mental instigations. Every time a bad thought or impulse comes, cast out that devilish entity; then Satan cannot do anything to you. Why remain a mortal captive, oscillating between good and evil? Es- cape into the heart of Spirit where Satan and his horde will be unable to reach you. *See Discourse 8, page 179. 408"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"DISCOURSE 25 Healing the Sick Tke Three Types of Afflictions to Which Mian Is Subject • Methods of Healing the Soul of Ignorance • Cure of Psychological Diseases antl Bat!

To free man from bodily ailments constitutes physical healing. The mind is susceptible to infection by mental bacteria of fear, worries, melancholia, psychological nervousness, anger, greed, insa- tiable sensual temptations, selfishness, jealousy, and morbid tenden- cies, all of which produce mental discomforts and agonies. The heal- ing of psychological diseases is called mental healing. The soul is haunted by the disease of ignorance born of cosmic delusion, which causes man to forget his perfect divine nature and concentrate on his imperfect human nature. Ignorance creates inhar- mony between mind and body, soul and mind; and in addition engen- ders every other form of trouble. Physical pain does not bring mental suffering if the mind is strong; martyrs whose minds are firmly fixed in devotion to God have main- tained their inner serenity even while being burned at the stake. But mental suffering usually brings with it its companion of physical suf- fering; and when the soul cedes the expression of its powers to igno- rance, body and mind are automatically subject to physical and men- tal ailments, for it is the disease of ignorance that produces in man the consciousness of the body and the body-identified mind. Realized souls, who have healed themselves of ignorance, behold the body as a dream of God, frozen mind of Divinity. When the eye of wisdom is opened by meditation, the gloom of mortal ignorance and physical and mental agonies is dispelled by God's light reflected in the soul. Jesus knew the causal relation between mind and body, and between soul and God. That is how he was able to control the atomic structure of cells and harmonize psychological agitations, and thus restore any ailing body or mind.

An article in The Wall Street Journal (January 10, 2003) by its science writer Sharon Begley discussed new evidence that \"alterations in brain wiring... could be induced by meditation.\" She reported research conducted by neuroscientist Dr. Richard Davidson at the University of Wisconsin, which focused on various forms of Buddhist meditation: \"After eight weeks, and again 16 weeks later, EEG measure- ments showed that activity in the frontal cortices of the meditators had shifted: There were now more neuronal firings in left than right regions nestled just behind the fore- head.

Autosuggestion, which is used in most forms of psychological healing, can revive the disease-paralyzed will—which then sends energy into the brain, effecting the removal of the destruc- tive pattern lodged in the brain cells. Mental bad habits will also yield their hold by association with persons who have good mental habits. The timid should associate with the brave, the sensual with those possessing self-control, the restless with those who have meditative habits. Exercise of will power trans- lated into won't power, and staying away from the bad company and environment that feed a specific bad mental habit, can starve the life out of compulsions to behave wrongly. Because the ailments of the body have psychological roots, and be- cause the body itself is condensed thought, bodily afflictions can be treated in two ways: by physical methods and by mental methods. The different processes of physical Physical and mental healing stimulate to a greater or lesser degree the life methods of healing force, which effects the cure. Medical procedures, the body medicinal drugs, herbal treatment, the various tech- niques of mental and spiritual therapy—all are valid methods of heal- ing, effective to the degree that they harmonize and restore the proper flow of life energy in the body, which is the direct cause of healing. One physical means of treating disease consists of judicious fast- ing to purify the body of toxins and to rejuvenate the life force.

But while I speak of the power of medicine derived from the God- created elements of nature, I must add that medicine in itself has not that power of healing possessed by the mind if one knows how to use that mental power. Those who put all their confidence in medicine weaken their minds and find that they have to live by dependence on medicine, just as some people I have known seem absolutely depend- ent on periodic operations (though in certain cases operations are nec- essary to remove diseased tissue to prevent it from affecting healthy tissue). But whatever mode of treatment one adopts, the mind in large measure may still determine the outcome, positive or negative. Doubt, depression, pessimistic thoughts, lack of will, weaken the flow of heal- ing life energies; the conscious direction of the mind's powers by pos- itive thoughts, prayers, affirmations, visualization, will, cheerfulness, stimulates the natural healing processes of the body with the vital life force necessary to aid in restoring health. People should learn to draw more on the all-healing power of the mind, along with observance of healthful habits: proper eating, exercise, fresh air and sunshine, hy- giene, physical and mental relaxation, and conscious recharging of the life force. The primary medicine of the future will be rays, the vibratory na- ture of which is more compatible with the molecular atomic nature of the human body. Healing rays can reach into the atomic disorder of cells in chronic diseases.

Most mental healers use methods of auto- suggestion and reason to stimulate the imagination and will in their patients. The roused will and imagination in turn awaken the patient's torpid life force, which then cauterizes disease-making bacteria and other such physical causes, and brings about healing. Most persons have no idea of the tremendous power of the mind; and concomitantly, that nothing can heal one if his life energy fails him. From a microscopic cell this body was made; everything in its physical structure has been created by this energy and mind. Those supreme companionate forces of healing are right within every being, empowered by the soul. One should never ignore any mode of healing that operates any measure of divine law. But one should remember that the exercise of mental power is mor e effective than physical methods of healing alone; and it is bes t by faith and meditation to call into operation the un- failing, unlimited power of God for healing not only the body and mind but for awakening the potential omnipotence of the soul. We are told that on the occasion at Capernaum cited in the above Bible verses, Jesus exercised that power to heal the many who came to him. This was possible because they came with recipiency and faith. The spirit of Jesus had control over cosmic en- How a master trans- ergy. The faith of the sick allowed Jesus to send the mits the unlimited all-healing energy out of his body to reinforce their healing power of weakened life force. The energy in the body of Jesus God  and the energy in the bodies of the persons healed both came from the cosmic energy of God. Jesus commanded his will to connect the cosmic energy with the energy in his brain and send it down through his hands in ever-flowing, potent rays to the body of the afflicted person. Healing by sending energy through the hands, \"He laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them,\" is based on the healer's abil- ity to connect with and consciously direct the cosmic energy of God. The body lives in an omnipresent sea of this vibratory power. This en- ergy sustains life and recharges the vitality of the body as it becomes depleted by physical and mental activity. The life of the body depends primarily upon the cosmic energy that flows in automatically through the mouth of the medulla, or is consciously drawn in by the tuning power of the human will. The energy derived directly from the cosmic ether, and energy derived indirectly from food and oxygen, becomes 462"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"concentrated in the main cerebral dynamo of power in the head, whence it is poured into the entire body through the six sub-dynamos of the subtle centers in the spine. The supreme center in the brain and the six centers i n the cerebrospinal axis send energy through the nerves to all the vital and sensory and motor parts of the body. So, from each body part—as the eyes, hands, feet, heart, navel, nose, mouth, and every projection from the body—there emanates current. The nerve current radiating from the eyes, hands, and feet is stronger than from other parts. The right side of the body is a positive pole and the left side is a negative pole. The positive right side is stronger than the negativ e left. Though the power of these poles can sometimes be transposed in the physical sense, as is indicated in cases of left-handed people, the conformation of the \"physiology\" in the as- tral body remains the same. The power of the life force transmitted outwardly for healing oth- ers is proportionate to the power of the will of the healer. Masters, such as Jesus, who have infinite control of their will, can radiate the all- creative healing ray of life through any organ, but especially through the hands, feet, or eyes. Simply laying the positive and negative poles of one's hands on another person produces some exchange of magnetism from the energy therein , but does not convey the potency necessary to heal. It is the consciously generated and directed power of the life force flowing through the hands that causes healing by employing the life- force activity, which creates , integrates, disintegrates, crystallizes, me- tabolizes, and produces and sustains the complex body of differentiated cells. This life force is intelligent but diminished and out of one's con- trol in bodies governed by weak, ego-identified minds. In persons who have identified themselves with their souls, the intelligent creative life force in its full potential is controlled by the wisdom of the soul. One who knows his soul knows how to work miracles through the life force, the master of life and death, by sending it through the hands in healing rays to burn out disease in any  *  stricken person.    The various means The verses cited above, as well as other ac- used by Jesus to heal counts in the Gospels, relate that Jesus used various by cosmic energy outward means of transmitting the cosmic energy: laying on of hands, divinely charged words of healing, transmission of energy by will through the ether, powerful thoughts broadcast to the one in need. 463"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"Absent healing typically involves the principle of autosuggestion.

If the healer has a strong will and imaging power and the per- son to be healed has faith in the healer's ability to awaken his will and imagination, then the patient will be quickly healed through his own reanimated life force. The time element in healing arises when either the healer is deficient in his healing power or the person to be healed is not properly receptive to the healer's healing vibrations, because of lack of faith, karmic restrictions, or persistence in bad habits of thought and action whose negative vibrations counteract the positive healing vibrations.

The powerful energy transmitted by a Christlike soul into the brain of a psychologically diseased individual has a similarly direct effect in burning out bad karma and entrenched harmful mental tendencies. God -realized gurus thereby free their receptive disciples from habits of ignorance that have hounded them for many incarnations. When Jesus healed a person who was possessed, he did it by two ways. First, his consciousness being in tune with the Christ Intelligence in all creation, he used the Christ Will, which governs the astral forces and entities, to compel the unclean spirit to leave the body of the dis- eased individual. Second, he used his will power to send the cosmic energy into the brain of the possessed individual and destroy there the obsessions caused by the unclean spirit, as well as the karmic and habit patterns that made the person prone to possession.

And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak.\" Since all things of the astral world are hidden according to the will of God, concealing the dynamics of the mysterious workings of material creation, Jesus did not want himself to be revealed except in the natural human way by the declaration of his works in fulfill- ment of the words of the prophets. In even a cursory review of the science of various forms of heal- ing, it is evident that the basis of every formula is the vibratory power of the life force supported by the receptivity of the • • person to be healed. Positive-minded confidence in Choosing the appro- the effectiveness of the remedy stimulates the heal- priate mode of heal- ing life force. Therefore , methods of mental or ing for individual physical healing should be administered to people circumstances according to their mental inclinations and mental habits. Jesus said, \"Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's\" —that is, in adaptation , those who believe in medical healing, let them go to the medical doctors; those who believe in healing by the meth- ods of osteopaths o r homeopaths or other \"natural\" remedies, let them use such methods; those who believe in mental healers, let them go to the mental healers. But above all, no matter what one's health practices, the most important belief must be in the unlimited healing power of God and the intercession of masters who are one with God. 465"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"Jesus, being in touch with God and His all-healing, all-creative Cosmic Energy, could change the atomic structure of any diseased part of the body into a healthy atomic configuration. Ordinary healers who have no such command over the creative forces would be wise not to take onto themselves the full responsibility of handling cases of severe illness that would prudently benefit from the expertise of the material science of medical doctors. Such medical intervention should not be thought of as a negation, but rather an enhancement, of the effective- ness of continually applied mental and spiritual methods of promot- ing healing. Those more malleable conditions that have a psychologi- cal basis—such as nervous or emotional disorders, mild obsessions, bad habits—as well as common physical ailments that merely require an arousal or reinforcement of weakened life force, most readily re- spond to the healer's and patient's use of suggestion, divine will force, and invocation of God's power. God created the physical laws of sci- ence as well as the underlying subtler divine laws. Belief in and appli- cation of one does not necessarily contradict the other so long as one's faith inheres in the Creator Himself. Only God has unlimited power of healing. Man's power may fail, but God's power can never fail. Yet even though our Father does not want to see us suffer from disease, He cannot heal us until we open the gates of our willingness to be healed: By misusing our God-given free choice, we shut God out of our lives; by using it properly, we al- low Him to become manifest within us. To be sure of God's healing power, one must know Him, one must feel Him deeply, in meditation daily. He is not some unfeeling Cosmic Power that one can switch on and off at one's convenience or need—with expectation of instant blessings in times of dark distress, but to which one can remain blithely oblivious in the bright contentment of good fortune. One who does not feel the need for God in the most trifling as well as signifi- cant happenings in one's life has yet to realize the indispensable con- nection between man and his Maker. To misuse free choice in actions that cause forgetfulness of Him is the uttermost woeful affliction of ignorance. So, if one by deep devotion and meditation constantly tunes him- self with God and with unflinching faith goes on asking the Father's help in spite of the invasion of undesirable doubts or contrary evi- dence, he will certainly find the desired result. But often one who lacks the concentration to tune in with the seeming intangibility of God can 466"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"find quicker healing by tuning in with those saints and masters who are already united to God. As they give all their devotion to God, so also God gives to them His unlimited power for healing of body, mind, and soul. Devotees who seek to be healed of ignorance, the root cause of all maladies, should adhere steadfastly to faith in their true God- sent guru and his guidance and intercession on their behalf. Jesus used only the divine power of healing; and he gave to God all the credit for those miraculous cures, for he did not feel within himself the \"I\" or ego-consciousness born of the identifica-  • • tion of the sou l with the physical body. Even when Egotism: a pitfall to Jesus said, \"I say unto you, arise\"—become healed be avoided in practice —he spoke not of the \"I\" of the ego, but of the un- of spiritual healing limited God-consciousness with which his soul was united. Unless the soul divests itself of the \"I am\" ego-consciousness, by the divine intuitional consciousness of interiorized meditation, one re- mains ineptly disunited from Spirit. When an ordinary person says, \"I will do this,\" the \"I\" refers to his body-identified ego-consciousness. He cannot differentiate himself from his physical form, and hardly feels the deeper consciousness of his soul. But when Jesus referred to the \"I\" within him, he always meant his soul-consciousness united with God- consciousness. No matter how effective one's powers of healing, they are limited as compared to the infinite healing power of God. Hence, instead of merely commanding one's own healing powers, one should set himself apart from the ego and invoke the unlimited divine power of God to flow through himself as a clear channel. In the practice of healing one- self or others, one should be sure of divine communion, and then com- pletely absorb oneself in God preceding the attempted performance of every healing. A divine healing can take place only when the healer serves as a perfect medium through which God's omnipotence can flow without obstruction. Egotism and loud declaration, and self-laudation, such as, \"I healed her,\" or \"God is working through me,\" should be strictly avoided both in speech and mind. Let the all-knowing God de- clare His power in the self-evident healing. Even a sincere devotee, if not truly one with God by Self-realization, can have traces of ego hiding in him undetected when he puts himself for- ward as a healing instrument and says to the sick, \"Be healed by God's power.\" But the superman, having transcended all separating egotism in actual God-union, speaks from perfect humility even when he declares, 467"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"\"I say unto thee, arise and be healed.\" Here \"I\" signifies the \"God alone\" which the realized saint feels within himself. The words of Isaiah's prophecy about Jesus cite an important ex- pression of grace in divine healing: \"Himself took our infirmities, and —— bare our sicknesses.\" Powerful healers, such as How masters take on Jesus, can only wipe away the effects of evil karma the bad karma of suf- in an individual according to the principles in- fering individuals volved in the workings of the law of cause and ef- fect. If anyone, through wrong eating, for example, is carrying a load of poison in his body, he can take a counteracting medicine to create a new cause with an effect that can destroy the vir- ulence in the system. So Jesus, with his powerful consciousness, could by various means counteract the adverse effects of past wrongs ac- quired by and accumulated in erring persons. But no one, not even a Jesus, can break the law of cause and effect created by God. Nature's judgments must be compensated in kind or by a fair exchange. Cer- tain mechanics of the law of karma can be manipulated by the wis- dom of a master, and also by corrective or palliative measures taken by the afflicted — such as prayer, intense love for God, faith, yoga meditation, conscious direction of the life force by will power—to minimize or nullify adverse effects of past wrong actions. In extreme cases of deep-seated karma; or in response to the devotional faith and receptivity of a supplicant; or to hasten the spiritual evolution of a dis- ciple, a master can take onto himself a karmic condition of a devotee, or a portion of it, and work out the effects on his own body. Thus Jesus could stop the impending result of an evil action by as- trally taking the consequences of that action upon himself, thereby sparing the person guilty of the transgression. To illustrate the princi- ple in simple terms, suppose a frail man named John angered a more robust acquaintance, who then raised his hand to beat John; but I sud- denly came between John and the well-directed blow, sparing John the hurt. I, being stronger, might be affected to a far lesser degree, or not at all, by the fistic display. So, also, when wrong actions have condemned a person to suffer, according to the law of cause and effect, a powerful soul such as Jesus could deflect the havoc and work it out by spending its force within himself. Some saints have been known to take into their own bodies the actual diseases of afflicted persons, and thus cause the sufferers to be re- lieved. This does not mean that one has to suffer in order to cure by spir- 468"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"itual law. Only extraordinary Christlike healers and masters know the sacred method by which they can take on the physical, mental, or spir- itual sufferings of others and work them out in their own bodies. The purpose of a world savior or guru is to heal humanity of its threefold ills. Their bodily instrument having already fulfilled its purpose of ex- pressing God-realization is then used for the sake of redeeming others by whatever means are most advantageous for the devotee. This is why it is said of Jesus that he gave himself as a ransom for many. He took upon himself the sins of his disciples, and many other souls, and let his body be crucified. He had the power to save himself by prayer to God: \"...and He shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels. But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?\"* Especially by his taking on the consequences of his disciples' karma through his sacrifice, they were highly spiritualized to be able to receive the Holy Ghost that later descended on them, bap- tizing them with the divine consciousness and attunement to carry on and spread the mission of Jesus. Whether in the body or in omnipresent Spirit, the redeeming grace of a world savior or God-realized guru re- mains the same, obliging every humble entreaty of a receptive heart. No matter what one's ailment or blessing of cure, the only way all undesirable karma can be permanently destroyed is by God-contact. The body is impermanent; even though it be granted a pardon from sickness, it must in its full season perish. The mind is pliant and can by a strong will be inured to many of the assaults of its environment; yet it too remains susceptible to the fallibilities of delusion. The ultimate healing that must be sought is freedom from the contagious disease of spiritual ignorance, the enervation of soul-expression, which is at the root of all other ills. If one removes by meditation and God-contact the disease of ignorance constraining the soul, then automatically mental and physical karmic compulsions lose their hold as well. In the king- dom of God-consciousness, the authoritative power of karmic law— which operates only as a corrective guiding force in the presence of delusion—serves no further purpose and is dissolved in Wisdom. Thus did Jesus admonish: \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God (destroy delu- sion) and all else (the consummation of all man's prayers, including for healing of the body, mind, and soul) will be added unto you (as your divine birthright as a child of God).\" * Matthew 26:53-54. 469"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. And Si- mon and they that were with him followed after him. And when they had found him, they said unto him, \"All men seek for thee \" (Mark 1:35-37). * ^ ven great masters seek times of solitude to renew themselves in JI ^/ Spirit. Though the omnipotence of the soul cannot be diminished, the bodily instrument of Jesus was heavily taxed by the multitudes— just as an electrical machine shows fatigue if run nonstop though its power from the dynamo is not lessened. The crowds drew from Jesus healing energy and spiritual strength; and as he moved among them he was in a sea of the vibrations of their worries and human emotions. He became one with them in their pains and sorrows as he uplifted them. So we see from the Gospels it was his wont to withdraw periodically into solitude and prayer—to leave behind for the moment the trou- blesome realm of transgressions and consequences and enter the tran- scendent inner blissful kingdom of God-communion. In this present account, Jesus arose before the morning brought upon him the press of his responsibilities, and sought out a solitary place for prayer. This is the way people in general Making time for God should learn to outwit the demands that would in silence and solitude steal all of one's attention from prayer and medita- tion. There is a time to be given to everything need- ful. People regularly eat their meals at certain hours each day to nour- ish the perishable body. They work many hours daily to make money to maintain themselves and others who are dependent upon them. In childhood, the \"working\" hours are spent in schooling to nourish the mind and prepare it for assuming life's responsibilities, ^ix to eight hours are passed in the restorative oblivion of sleep. What precious moments of the day survive unclaimed should be wisely apportioned. The right mental education should give each individual at least the common sense to know what methods to adopt in order to perform uniformly all the physical, mental, and spiritual duties calculated to bring real happiness. That mind-set is fruitless which makes an indi- *Cf. parallel reference in Luke 4:42. 470"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"vidual one-sided, either materially, intellectually, or spiritually. The performance of one duty should not starve out other important duties. One-sidedness is a sure formula for unhappiness. It will create a painful paucity in other aspects of one's threefold nature. God is often the last to receive attention on one's daily agenda: \"As soon as I get time, I will meditate.\" Where does that time go? Yet anyone who performs the highest duty of knowing God is automati- cally guided in accordance with God's will in the performance of the roster of other lesser duties. It is disastrous to seek prosperity at the cost of health or to seek health while entirely neglecting to strive to be successful and prosperous. But since God is the source of all power, it is right to seek Him first, for, with God, health and prosperity are added; but with the acquirement of health and prosperity alone, God is not attained. So the commitment of ardent renunciants to seek God first by forsaking material goals is the consummate life; for God, once attained, enriches one with imperishable life and eternal opulence. Whatever be one's vocation in life, one needs to feel his connection with God. The cultivation of a spiritual life requires solitary places for divine communion. God can be felt easily in inspiring scenic surround- ings free from noise. Man's mind is usually busy with the sensations of sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste. Sound is the most distracting sen- sation. The sight of material objects or material activities also snares man's attention. But by closing the eyes, one can quickly get rid of the sight sensation, whereas freedom from sound sensations can best be at- tained by being in a quiet place. The novice devotee who attempts to meditate in noisy surroundings finds his time of \"silence\" entirely taken up in battling the restless thoughts the noises arouse. In a quiet atmos- phere, one can go deep into the silence without any preliminary skirmish with the sensations of sounds. However, if a person makes a super ef- fort of will, he can concentrate in spite of such distraction. In noisy places there are also people to interrupt one's meditative endeavors. The vibrations of their restless thoughts and activities pass through the body of the meditating individual and keep his energy rushing toward the senses instead of being released to flow toward God. While it is very helpful to the beginner to meditate on quiet oc- casions and in solitary places, this does not mean that one should not meditate unless one has a chance to travel to a place of solitude. A room in one's home where nobody will disturb the meditation period is all that is really necessary. One should repair to that room and cre- 471"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"ate his own inner quietness by deep meditation on the Infinite. Once God is contacted, no outward disturbance can bother the soul. There is a proper time and proper place for performing one's dif- ferent duties. Just as sleep takes place at night in a quiet bedroom, as business is carried on during working hours in an atmosphere of busi- ness, and as intellectual studies are carried on in scheduled times in the halls of learning or in a quiet library, so, there should be a proper time and place for meditation, or God-communion. Whatever be one's sanctuary of solitude, he will find it especially beneficial to pray and meditate any time during the following periods: from the earliest hour of dawn, from 5 to 8 a.m.; noontime from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.; evening from 5 to 8 p.m.; and nighttime from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. The masters of India have taught that the hours surrounding the transitional times of dawn, noon, sunset, and midnight of each solar day are conducive to the cultivation of spiritual development. The magnetic cosmic laws of attraction and repulsion that affect the body are more harmo- niously equilibrated during the above four periods. This helps a med- itating individual to interiorize himself in divine communion. To med- itate in the quietness of the early mornings and at night is to meditate in a solitary place. During those times, most people are asleep, and the city, or one's surroundings, are quiet. The results of peace realized from meditation are easily obtained due to less noise and wrong vi- brations of restless people. On holidays and in leisure moments, instead of wasting time with senseless diversions and worldly people, the devotee-seeker enjoys time with God—taking a refreshing walk to a quiet lonely place to medi- tate, for example. Jesus lived in a temperate climate, conducive to his choice of outdoor solitude in nature during the early morning hours. When the disciples found Jesus in his solitude, they called him forth: \"All men seek for thee.\" Just as the fragrance of flowers draws the bees, so souls such as Jesus who are fragrant with Gpd automati- cally draw spiritually thirsty souls unto themselves. And he said unto them, \"Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.\" And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils (Mark 1:38-39). 472"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"Parallel reference: And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all man- ner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.

Those who seek appeasement in material things find that their thirst of desires is never slaked, nor is their hunger ever satisfied in the acquirement of possessions. The urge in every man to fill an inner emptiness is the soul's desire for God. It can only be alleviated by re- alizing one's immortality and imperishable state of divinity in God- union. When man foolishly tries to quench his soul thirst with the sub- stitutes of sense happiness, he gropes from one evanescent pleasure to another, ultimately rejecting them all as inadequate.

It is an intrinsic quality of the Divine Nature. The life story of Jesus is replete with accounts of mercy sublimely manifest in his ac- tions and personality. In perfected divine sons of God, we see revealed the hidden transcendent Father as He is. The God of Jesus the merciful ex- Moses is depicted as a God of wrath (though I do not pressed the true na- believe Moses, who spoke to God \"face to face, as a ture of God  man speaketh unto his friend,\"* ever thought of God as the vengeful tyrant portrayed in the Old Testa- ment). But the God of Jesus was so gentle. It was that gentleness and mercy of the Father that Jesus expressed when, instead of judging and destroying the enemies who would crucify him, he asked of the Father to forgive them, \"for they know not what they do.\" With the patient heart of God, Jesus looked upon humanity as little children who did not un- derstand. If a wee child picks up a knife and strikes you, you do not want to kill that child in retaliation. It does not realize what it has done. When one looks upon humanit y as a loving father looks after his children, and is ready to suffer for them that they might receive a little of the sunshine and power of his spirit, then one becomes Christlike: God in action. The wise alone can be really merciful, for with divine insight they perceive even wrongdoers a s souls—God's children who deserve sym- pathy, forgiveness, help, and guidance when they go astray. Mercy im- plies the capacity for being helpful; only developed or qualified souls are capable of being practically and mercifully useful.

Pure reason and pure feeling are both intuitive; but when rea- son is circumscribed by the intellectuality of the sense-bound mind, and feeling devolves into egoistic emotion, these instrumentalities of the soul produce distorted perceptions. Restoration of the lost clarity of divine sight is the purport of this Beatitude. The blessedness known to the perfectly pure of heart is none other than that referred to in St. John's Gospel: \"But as many as received him, to the m gave he power to become the sons of God.\" To every devotee who receives and reflects the omnipresent Light Divine, or Christ Consciousness, through a purified transparency of heart and mind, God gives power to reclaim the bliss of divine sonhood, even as did Jesus. Transparency to Truth is cultivated by freeing the consciousness, the heart's feeling and the mind's reason, from the dualistic influences of attraction and aversion. Reality cannot be accurately reflected in a consciousness ruffled by likes and dislikes, with their restless passions and desires, and the roiling emotions they engender—anger, jealousy, greed, moody sensitivity. But when chitta —human knowing and feel- ing—is calmed by meditation, the ordinarily agitated ego gives way to the blessed calmness of soul perception.f * See Chapter 3, Sutras 23-32 in The Holy Science by Swami Sri Yukteswar (published by Self-Realization Fellowship). f'The man of self-control, roaming among material objects with subjugated senses, and devoid of attraction and repulsion, attains an unshakable inner calmness\" (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita 11:64). 481"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"Purity of the intellect gives one the power of correct reasoning, but purity of the heart gives one the contact of God. Intellectuality is a quality of the power of reason, and wisdom is the liberating quality of the soul. When reason is purified by calm discrimination it metamor- phoses into wisdom. Pure wisdom and the divine understanding of a pure heart are the two sides of the same faculty. Indeed, the purity of heart, or feeling, referred to by Jesus depends on the guidance of all ac- tion by discriminative wisdom—the adjusting of human attitudes and behavior by the sacred soul qualities of love, mercy, service, self-control, self-discipline, conscience, and intuition. The pure-eyed vision of wis- dom must be combined with the untainted feeling of the heart. Wisdom reveals the righteous path, and the cleansed heart desires and loves to follow that path. All wisdom-revealed soul qualities must be followed wholeheartedly (not merely intellectually or theoretically). Ordinary man's occluded vision cognizes the gross shells of matter but is blind to the all-pervading Spirit. By the perfect blending of pure discrimination and pure feeling, the penetrating eye of all-revealing intu- ition is opened, and the devotee gains the true perception of God as pres- ent in one's soul and omnipresent in all beings—the Divine Indweller whose nature is a harmonic blend of infinite wisdom and infinite love. \"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the chil- dren of God\" (Matthew 5:9). ^\"T^hey are the real peacemakers who generate peace from their de- iL votional practice of daily meditation.

Anyone who, 482"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"forsaking national greed and selfishness, works to create peace amidst warring nations, is establishing God in the heart of those nations. The initiators and facilitators of peace manifest the unifying Christ-love that identifies a soul as a child of God. \"Son of God\" consciousness makes one feel love for all beings. Those who are God's true children cannot feel any difference between an Indian, American, or any other nationality or race. For a little while immortal souls are garbed in white, black, brown, red, or olive-colored bodies. Are people looked upon as variously foreign when they wear dif- ferent colored clothes? No matter what one's nationality or the color of his body, all of God's children are souls. The Father recognizes no man- made designations; He loves all, and His children must learn to live in that same consciousness. When man confines his identity to his clannish human nature, it gives rise to unending evils and the specter of war. Human beings have been given potentially limitless power, to prove that they are indeed the children of God. In such technologies as the atomic bomb we see that unless man uses his powers rightly, he will destroy himself. The Lord could incinerate this earth in a second if He lost patience with His erring children, but He doesn't. And as He would never misuse His omnipotence, so we, being made in His image, must also behave like gods and conquer hearts with the power of love, or humanity as we know it will surely perish. Man's power to make war is increasing; so must his ability to make peace. The best deterrent against the threat of war is brotherhood, the realization that as God's children we are one family. Anyone who stirs up strife among brother nations under the guise of patriotism is a traitor to his divine family—a faithless child of God. Anyone who keeps family members, neighbors, or friends fighting through fostering falsehoods and gossip, or who is in any way a maker of disturbance, is a desecrator of God's temple of harmony. Christ and the great ones have given the recipe for peace within and among individuals and nations. How long man has lived in the darkness of misunderstanding and ignorance of those ideals. The true Christ-method of living can banish human conflicts and the horror of war and bring about peace and understanding on earth; all prejudices and enmities must fall away. That is the challenge placed before those who would be the peacemakers of God. 483"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"\"Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 5:10).

A devotee of righteousness will not bend earned by those who to social pressure to drink just because he happens live and die in right to be at a gathering where cocktails are served, even behavior when others mock him for nonparticipation in their pleasure. Moral rectitude brings short-term ridicule but long-term re- joicing, for persistence in self-control yields bliss and perfection. An eternal kingdom of heavenly joy, to enjoy in this life and the beyond, is earned by those who live and die in right behavior. Worldly people who prefer sensory indulgences to God-contact are truly the foolish ones, because by ignoring what is right, and there- fore good for them, they will have to reap the consequences. The righ- teous devotee pursues that which is beneficial for him in the highest sense. One who relinquishes the desultory ways of the world and cheerfully stands the scorn of shortsighted friends for his idealism demonstrates that he is fit for the unending bliss of God. The above verse also offers encouragement to those who are per- secuted and tortured by sensory temptations and bad habits when they have resolved to cling to moral ideals and spiritual practices. They are righteous indeed, following the right way of self-control and medita- tion, which will in time defeat temptations and win the kingdom of eternal joy for the victorious. No matter how powerful temptations are, or how strong bad habits, they can be resisted with the wisdom-guided power of self- control and by holding to the conviction that no matter what pleasure is promised by temptation, it will always give sorrow in the end. The ir- resolute inevitably become hypocrites, justifying wrong behavior while succumbing to the wiles of temptation. The honey of God, though sealed in mystery, is what the soul truly craves. Those who meditate with undaunted patience and persistence break the mystery seal, and unin- hibitedly imbibe the heavenly nectar of immortality. Heaven is that state of transcendental, omnipresent joy where no sorrows ever dare to tread. By steadfast righteousness, the devotee will 484"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"ultimately reach that beatific bliss from which there is no fall. Vacil- lating devotees, not fixed in meditation, can slip from this supernal happiness; but those who are resolute gain that blessedness perma- nently. The kingdom of Cosmic Consciousness is owned by the King of Heavenly Bliss, and by the elevated souls who are merged in Him. Hence it is said of devotees who unite their ego with God, becoming one with the King of the Universe: \"Theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\" \"Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. \"Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you\" (Matthew y.11-12). Parallel reference: \"Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake. \"Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your re- ward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets\" (Luke 6:22-23, Sermon on the Plain). T I ^he foregoing verses do not require one to conscript a band of re- vilers to make one fit for the kingdom of heaven. In spite of one's best efforts for good in the world and in oneself, the barbs of persecutors will never be absent, as Jesus well knew. The ornery nature of the ego makes the undisciplined man uncomfortable and Be steadfast and even- mean-spirited toward those who are morally or spir- minded in the face itually different from himself. The goadings of satanic of worldly  divisive delusion keep the self-appointed critic ever misunderstanding scanning for reasons to malign others. Jesus encour- aged his followers not to be dismayed or intimidated if in trying to live spiritually they find that materially minded persons do not understand. Those wh o can pass through the test of scorn cheerfully, and without yielding to wrong ways in order to \"fit in,\" will gain the happiness that results from clinging to virtuous bliss-yielding habits. 485"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"It should be considered no great loss when the reproachers and haters and defamers \"shall separate you from their company.\" Actu- ally, persons who are thus shunned are blessed that by such ostracism their souls are kept away from the bad influence of the company of nonunderstanding, misbehaving persons. The spiritually dedicated should never become despondent, no matter how people speak evil against them or vilify their good name in declarations of wrongdoing. Blessed are those whose name is deni- grated for not cooperating with worldly or evil ways, for their names shall be engraved in the silently admiring heart of God. The Bhagavad Gita similarly expresses the Lord's regard for such devotees: \"He who is tranquil before friend and foe alike, and in en- countering adoration and insult, and during the experiences of warmth and chill and of pleasure and suffering; who has relinquished attachment, regarding blame and praise in the same light; who is quiet and easily contented, not attached to domesticity, and of calm dispo- sition and devotional—that person is dear to Me.\"* One must follow what one knows to be right, in spite of criticism. Everyone should honestly, without egotistical bias, analyze himself; and if he is right, he should hold to his joy-producing righteous actions un- influenced by either praise or blame. But if one is wrong, he should be glad of the opportunity to correct himself and thus remove one more obstacle to lasting happiness. Even unjust criticism will make the disci- ple purer than ever and enthuse him all the more to follow the ways of inner peace instead of yielding to temptations urged by bad company. It is in the company of God that one remains blessed. One has to find time for Him in the peace of meditation. Why waste all of one's leisure hours in frequenting the movies or watching television, or in other idle pastimes? In cultivating and adhering to divine habits, the devotee finds true impetus to rejoice in his inner contentment and in knowing he will ultimately inherit the kingdom of eternal fulfillment. The devotee who is denounced for holding to spiritual ways should not flatter himself that being persecuted for God's sake means he is doing the Lord some great favor. \"To be persecuted for my sake\" or \"for the Son of man's sake,\" signifies being chastised for holding to those practices the devotee has undertaken at the behest of his Christ- like guru for the sake of acquiring attunement with God. * God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita XII:I8-I9. 486"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"Jesus spoke to his disciples and followers as their God-sent guru or savior: \"Blessed are you when for following the Son of man (the Christlike guru-preceptor, the representative of God) you are criticized and belittled for preferring to walk in the light of his God-tuned wis- dom instead of stumbling with the masses along worldly paths of dark- ness and ignorance.\" To be hated, ostracized, reproached, or cast out is in itself no cause for blessing if one is morally or spiritually degenerate; but when despite persecution the devotee clings to truth as manifested in the life and teachings of a Christlike guru, then he will be free in everlasting blessed- ness. \"Rejoice ye in that day, and feel the uplifting holy vibration of ever new joy; for behold, those who will toil and labor and accept pain to follow the divine way will be rewarded in heaven with eternal bliss. \"Those who persecute you are a continuity of the successive gen- erations of those who persecuted the prophets. Think to what great evil those forefathers came, and consider what reward in heaven the prophets received from God for bearing the persecution from ignorant persons for His name's sake. Holding on to spiritual principles, even if one has to lose his body as did the martyrs of yore, brings the reward of divine inheritance of God's kingdom of Everlasting Exultation.\" \"Great is your reward in heaven\" signifies the state of eternal bliss felt in stabilizing the divine contact of God experienced in meditation: —— One who performs elevating good actions on earth Finding the \"reward\" will, according to the law of karma, reap the fruits of heaven even while of those deeds either in the inner heaven on earth on earth  while living, or in the supernal heavenly realms af- ter death.

Advanced souls, those who by meditation are able to experience the ever-newly joyous state of Self-realization, and who can remain constantly in that inner heavenly bliss where God dwells , carry with them a portable heaven wherever they go. The astral sun of the spiritual eye begins to reveal to their consciousness the astral heaven wherein reside, in graduated spheres, virtuous souls and saints, liberated beings and angels.

The way of ef- fective prayer, he taught, is to banish diffidence and speak to God with joy- ous expectancy as to a devoted father or mother. For every human being, the Lord feels a love unconditional and eternal, surpassing even the sweet- est human parental solicitude.

Only those souls who can keep their consciousness fixed in the spiritual eye during earthly existence, even during trials and persecu- tions, will in this life or the afterlife enter the blissful states of the higher regions of heaven where the most extraordinary advanced souls dwell in the delightful proximity of God's all-freeing presence. Though Jesus cites especially the great reward accruing to ad- vanced souls, even a lesser measure of blissful God-communion will bring a commensurate heavenly reward. Those who make some prog- ress and then compromise their spiritual ideals or give up meditating, because they feel inwardly persecuted by the effort required or are out- wardly discouraged by worldly influences or by the criticism of rela- tives, neighbors, or so-called friends, lose the contact of heavenly bliss. But those who are divinely stalwart not only retain the bliss they ac- quire by meditation but are doubly rewarded, finding their stability giv- ing rise to ever greater fulfillment. This is the psychological heavenly reward resulting from applying the law of habit: Anyone who becomes fixed in inner bliss by meditation will be rewarded with ever-increasing joy that will remain with him even when he leaves this earthly plane. The heavenly state of meditative bliss felt in this life is a foretaste of the ever new joy felt in the immortalized soul in the after-death state. The soul carries that joy into the sublime as- tral regions of celestial beauty, where lifetronic Celestial bliss and blossoms unfold their rainbow petals in the garden beauty of the astral of ether, and where the climate, atmosphere, food, realm and inhabitants are made of different vibrations of multihued light—a kingdom of refined manifestations more in har- mony with the essence of the soul than are the crudities of the earth. Righteous people who resist temptation on earth, but who do not totally free themselves from delusion, are rewarded after death with a rejuvenating rest in this astral heaven among the many half-angels and half-redeemed souls who carry on a life that is exceedingly superior to *See Discourse 10. 490"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"that on earth. There they enjoy the results of their good astral karma for a karmically predetermined span; after which time, their remain- ing earthly karma pulls them back into reincarnation in a physical body. Their \"great reward\" in the astral heaven enables them to man- ifest desired conditions at will, dealing entirely with vibrations and en- ergy, not with the fixed properties of solids, liquids, and gaseous sub- stances encountered during the earthly sojourn. In the astral heaven, all furnishings, properties, climatic conditions, and transportation are subject to the astral beings' will power, which can materialize, manip- ulate, and dematerialize the lifetronic substance of that finer world ac- cording to preference. Completely redeemed souls harbor no mortal desires in their hearts when they leave the shores of the earth. These souls become permanently fixed as pillars in the mansion of Cosmic Consciousness, and never again reincarnate on the earth plane,* unless they do so willingly in order to bring earthbound souls back to God. Such are God's prophets: souls who are anchored in Truth and re- turn to earth at the command of God to lead others to spiritual ways -  by their exemplary conduct and message of salva- ge godly traits ex- tion. The spiritual state of a prophet or savior is one tolled by Jesus as the of complete union with God, which qualifies him to way to beatitude declare God in the mysterious spiritual way. They are usually extraordinary reformers who show to mankind extraordinary spiritual examples. They demonstrate the power and superior influence of love over hate, wisdom over igno- rance, even if it means martyrdom. They refuse to give up their truths no matter the degree of physical or mental persecution, dishonor, or false accusations; and just as steadfastly, they refuse to hate their per- secutors or to us e the expediency of revenge to quell their enemies. They demonstrate and retain the restraint and forbearance of God's all- forgiving love, being themselve s sheltered in that Infinite Grace. In all the great ones—those who come on earth to show to hu- manity the way to everlasting blessedness or bliss consciousness—are found the godly traits extolled by Jesus as the way to beatitude. In the Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna enumerates comprehensively these requi- site soul qualities that distinguish the divine man: * \"Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out\" (Revelatio n 3:12). 491"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"(The sage is marked by) humility, lack of hypocrisy, harmlessness, forgivingness, uprightness, service to the guru, purity of mind and body, steadfastness, self-control; Indifference to sense objects, absence of egotism, understand- ing of the pain and evils (inherent in mortal life): birth, illness, old age, and death; Nonattachment, nonidentification of the Self with such as one's children, wife, and home; constant equal-mindedness in de- sirable and undesirable circumstances; Unswerving devotion to Me by the yoga of nonseparativeness, resort to solitary places, avoidance of the company of worldly men; Perseverance in Self-knowledge; and meditative perception of the object of all learning—the true essence or meaning therein.

It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. \"Ye are the light of the world\" (Matthew 5:13-14). J esus' metaphorical comparison of his disciples to the salt of the earth was particularly appropriate in his time when salt was con- sidered a valuable item. Oriental people who had to travel in the extreme heat of the desert used to carry large pieces of rock salt, which they licked in order to lessen their thirst due to dehydration. If anyone shared that life-giving salt with another, it was said that the latter had \"eaten his salt,\" or shared his highest confidence. It was to acquire this all-important commodity that the first trading routes were established in ancient civilizations. In * Bhagavad Gita xni:7-ii. See God Talks With Arjuna for extensive commentary. Spiritual persons are \"the salt of the earth \" and \"light of the world\" 492"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"some areas a measure of salt was valued as fair trade for an equal weight of gold. Roman legionnaires were allotted a salarium, or dis- bursement of salt—from which comes the modern term \"salary.\" In addition to its life-saving qualities, salt gives pleasurable flavor to food; without it, meals would be tasteless to most human beings. So, just as salt is an important commodity worldwide, similarly, man himself is the \"salt of the earth,\" for among all creatures the human being has the highest capacity for doing good to others. Jesus says that if salt loses its savor, it is useless for seasoning, nor can its quality be revived; it must therefore be thrown away. Similarly, if human beings, who are made in the image of God, desecrate that image through ignorant living, they lose the essential soul qualities and thus cease to be the most serviceable beings on earth. Persons who live unspiritual lives allow themselves to be trodden under foot by use- lessness and death. \"Ye are the light of the world\" signifies that human beings make this earth luminously meaningful by their presence. If the stars and the moon shone on this earth and the bleak mountains kept themselves decorated with silver peaks, they would nevertheless be in perpetual oblivion if no man lived to appreciate them. If blossoms with their al- luring fragrance tarried and then faded without the gaze of souls ever entering their petal-doors, who would know the mystic beauty of flowers? Not the hard-hearted mountains nor the brainless skies nor burgeoning flora, but only souls, by the light of their consciousness, reveal the wondrous presence of Nature and God. Without the light of human consciousness, the star- and moon-decked night, and the ocean, the scenery, and the sun-decked day, would live in the womb of dark aeons. Hence, man is the light of the world. No other living creature, only human consciousness, is endowed with the all-revealing lamp of a potentially limitless intelligence. \"A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.

J ust as lighted candles are not meant to be covered by bushel bas- kets but put on candlesticks to shed their light, so also, souls are lighted with the inherent presence of God, not to be enshrouded by ig- norance, uselessness, materiality, and death, but that they may, with the illumination of wisdom and goodness, enlighten spiritually dark- ened lives. Evil eclipses the light of the soul. As the flame of a candle is extinguished by lack of oxygen, so a soul loses its outer radiance without the vitality of goodness. Good persons should not hide their enlivened soul qualities, as expressed in Gray's \"Elegy\": \"Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, and waste its sweetness on the desert air.\" They ought to engage in good actions among men, so that hu- man darkness may be illumined. No saint likes to perform miracles or display his divine powers to prove himself to disbelievers; no true devotee likes flattery or acclaim for his goodness. But when the candle of wisdom has been lighted within the devotee, he doesn't secret it in the back of his mind nor hide it under the bushel of indifference. He sets it on the candlestick of open and sincere living, that truth-seekers may see and profit by that light. Awakened souls shine with the light of God; they make the invis- ible light of His goodness visible in their hearts and actions. Their en- lightenment declares the presence of God and serves as a spiritual bea- con to guide other s out of the paths of darkness.

From the voices of the prophets issue proclamations of the eternal truths, which are changeless, creedless, and universally appli- cable in all epochs; and also codes of conduct needed in a particular age or set of circumstances, an adaptation of the eternal verities to the specifics of human need. But the passage of time, the expediency of in- terpretation, and worldly ignorance in general causes a degeneration of holy truths. Their priceless gold is amalgamated into an alloy of partially observed religious principles tempered with the rationaliza- tions of human weakness. Throughout history there have been times when the priesthood has sunk to virtual merchandising of religion on the one hand, and enshrouding it in autocratic theological mystery on the other hand, in order to secure a hierarchical authority over the ar- bitrary trends of the masses. Great prophets expose those pseudoreligious distortions, often with the effect of arousing acrimonious response from the entrenched priestly classes, who condemn the actions of true reformers as irreli- gious, unscriptural, even blasphemous. To forestall such resistance from the temple hierarchy, and to warn his followers not to be swayed by false accusations, Jesus clearly emphasized: \"I have not come to de- stroy the universal laws of righteousness, nor the ever true teachings of the prophets, but to revive and fulfill them.\" As the Christ Intelligence is the Eternal Principle governing all cre- ated manifestations, timeless, too, are the precepts of spiritual living declared by the Christ in Jesus, extending from the Biblical generations into the unseen future: \"Heaven and earth shall pass away,\" he pro- claimed, \"but my words shall not pass away.\"* The eternal principles behind their adaptations should never be dragged down or compro- mised in order that society might feel more comfortable with them.

That underlying Essence, which links all things in a cosmic unity, is Truth, Reality, God reflected in creation as the Christ Intelligence. The Truth of creation, its essential divinity or goodness, erstwhile hidden by maya's macabre masquerade, is revealed by those who, like Jesus, manifest the Christ Consciousness and Its righteousness. The universal laws ( dharma ) that uphold the objective manifesta- tion of creation emanate from that all-governing Divine Intelligence. Thus Jesus declared: \"I tell you that it would be easier for the incon- ceivably vast causal, astral, and physical universes, 'heaven and earth,' to dissolve into nothingness than for even the tiniest portion of the di- vine law to fail to prove its reality.\" \"Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.\" Earth and heaven alike are cos- mic motion pictures, projected by the beam of God's intelligent vibra- tory energy. The earth is a grosser movie of material life played on the screen of human consciousness, and heaven is a subtler picture of as- tral existence played on the screen of soul consciousness. Jesus knew that all heavenly and earthly manifestations have one purpose: to make visible the Invisible Perfection through the active expression of the divine laws of righteousness. Jesus emphasized that until the laws of righteousness in all their details are fulfilled, as intended by God in His cosmic plan and declared by His true devotees, heaven and earth, with their congested limitations, will go on existing. The gross and subtle spheres of creation are battlegrounds where the perfect laws of God war with the patterns of imperfection introduced by Satan.

T he kingdom of heaven referred to in this context is the state of Cosmic Consciousness, in which all dualities are abolished and the One Loving King, God the Father, reigns on the throne of Infinity.

The degree of comple- tion of that purifying process is a measure of the greatness of a saint— that is, how near he is to absolute liberation in Cosmic Consciousness.

The foremost in the kingdom of God automatically obey the greatest and the least laws of the life divine; because they are one with Cosmic Consciousness, their actions are in effortless accord with truth. But whosoever does not live the life of righteousness in all its details, acting from less-than-perfect attune- ment with truth as commanded from within by the voice of conscience and intuition, shall not be as highly regarded, according to the stan- dards of God-known souls. Saints who observe the highest and the least laws of truth—who teach them vocally and especially by the example of their lives—are considered of high degree by those who live in the supreme Spirit- domain of Cosmic Consciousness. Those who do not completely prac- tice spiritual doctrines, yet try to teach others the path of salvation, are accordingly deemed inferior to those saints who show people the Godward path through their daily lives in which the minutest laws of truth are flawlessly demonstrated. Even if saintly persons have con- tacted God, but disregard the less mandatory truths, they are called the least when viewed from the highest standards of righteousness. Whether intentional or unwitting, the breaking of any divine law by an otherwise good person teaches the weak-minded that dereliction of righteous duty is acceptable behavior. Jesus emphasized the difference between the superficial righteous- ness of the scribes and Pharisees who practiced religion by rote, and the true righteousness of a God-tuned life. Jesus saw that even good reli- gious men of the temple who thought and spoke a great deal about holy scripture, and who were punctilious in performing their duties and prescribed sacerdotal ceremonies, nevertheless lacked inner realization of the underlying truths of their vocational practices; their righteous- ness was only skin-deep, touching little on the consciousness within. Thinking about truth is good if it increases the desire to follow the laws of truth. Thinking or talking about truth but neglecting to apply its laws in one's actions and behavior is productive not of righ- teousness but of hypocrisy—a double life of thinking or speaking one way, but acting another. Unless one harnesses his good thoughts to the corresponding noble activities, his lofty philosophizing tends to de- velop an ineffectual, even vainglorious, familiarity with ideas about truth, which breeds neglect of their actual application—a know-it-all, do-nothing attitude.

Jesus therefore spoke of the necessity of developing the con- sciousness of doing right and living truth, shorn of superficiality. The absolute of righteousness is complete identification with all truth. Harmony with all truth, and not just its part, is only possible through meditation and samadhi, or ecstasy, in which the devotee, the act of meditation, and God as the object of contemplation become one. Millions of people do not even think about religion; and of those who do, the majority are satisfied with religious worship one hour a week or reading a few spiritual books or practicing a few religious cer- emonies. They never go deeper; they never attempt by scientific med- itation to commune with the infinitely loving Father about whom they hear or read. Thi s is the palpable reason so few attain Christhood and entry into God's Kingdom of Cosmic Consciousness, the domain of the humbly reigning Royal Spirit. Desire-propelled human beings are like uncontrolled barges rushing down the floodstream of worldly life, headed over the rocky falls of crushing experiences into the oblivion of death. The boats of wisdom-guided lives steer out of the powerful current of social con- vention and customs and reach the shores of all-redeeming content- ment in God. This was a great truth that Jesus urged all to heed: \"If you want to enter the kingdom of God, your righteousness must exceed the or- dinariness of theoretical religious beliefs and living; it must transform your consciousness and whole being. Unless you follow the real way of actual God-communion in interiorized worship in deep meditation, your righteousness shall in no wise qualify you to enter the highest state of Cosmic Consciousness, the heavenly bliss from which you can never fall again.\" \"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, 'Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judg- ment': But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, 'Raca,' shall be in danger of 462"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"the council: but whosoever shall say, 'Thou fool,' shall be in dan- ger of hell fire\" (Matthew 5:21-22). H aving spoken in general of the eternal laws governing God's creation, and of how their observance is necessary for attain- ing the kingdom of heaven, Jesus illustrates (in verses 21-48) specific adaptations of those laws—ways of fulfilling their spirit of natural righteousness. He speaks first of the ancient commandment: \"Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.\"* Those who destroy heaven-created human beings —— misuse their reason and God-given independence The spiritual dangers and will be judged accordingly by the inscrutable of violence and anger karmic law of cause-and-effect justice. Murderers not only counter the universal law of divine creation, but they deprive their victims of the lawful opportunity to work out independently their own karma—a preclusion of that individual's progress in his present lifetime. God creates mortal life; to kill is to obstruct the highest di- vine wish of emancipating immortal souls through purification in the self-created karmic fires of mortal trials, whence they emerge trans- formed by freewill initiated acts of wisdom. Jesus pointed out that in the light of natural righteousness, evil lies not only in murderous actions, but in angry thoughts and emo- tions that give rise to such actions. Jesus, who taught love even for one's enemies, warned against being angry \"without cause\" — and then went on to say that man should not indulge in hostility and scorn toward his brothers under any circumstances, lest he place himself in \"danger of the judgment\" of \"the council\"; and of \"hell fire.\" Wrath obliterates discrimination and prevents the mind from discerning the right course during a momentous issue. Anyone who is angry with his brother through the misunderstanding of facts or an emotionally per- ceived personal grievance is one who is angry without reason. Anger, arising either from an actual cause or from an imaginary perception, may create sufficient provocation in a person to impel him to violence. In cases of extreme anger, people may mentally wish their enemies dead. Sometimes they voice their ire: \"I could shoot that man!\" Though it may not be meant literally, it is still very bad. The * See Exodus 20:13. 463"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"thought and talk of death to another are mental chemicals that can potentially explode into violent activity. The thought of killing pre- cedes the physical act in a preconditioned response awaiting provoca- tion. No willful killing is possible without being triggered by thought. So, to fulfill the law \"Thou shalt not kill,\" Jesus said, not only the act but all thoughts, speech, and actions relative to killing must be strictly avoided. He spoke in consonance with the sages of India who honor the scriptural injunction of ahimsa, inner and outer nonviolence. Once my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, watched me raise my hand to kill a mosquito that was siphoning my blood. But I suddenly changed my mind, remembering the decree of nonviolence. Master said: \"Why don't you finish the job?\" In astonishment, I replied: \"Why, Master? Do you advocate killing?\" To that he responded: \"No, but you have killed the mosquito in your mind and thus have already committed the sin.\" My Guru did not mean that whenever anybody has an impulse to kill, he should do so; he was making the point that one should not feel the desire to kill at all. Of course, it is better to suppress the desire to kill than to commit the actual act; but the greater achievement is to re- main free from evil thoughts, which are the basic cause of evil actions.* Thought, the forerunner of outer action, is itself action on a sub- tler plane. In that sense, according to the law of karma or action, righteousness and sin lie in one's thoughts and motives as well as in his external behavior. One man commits murder and is hanged for it; *In Autobiography of a Yogi I recorded the following discussion I had with my Guru about Patanjali's Yoga Sutras 11:35: \"In the presence of a man perfected in ahimsa (non- violence), enmity [in any creature] does not arise.\" Sri Yukteswar said: \"By ahimsa Patanjali meant removal of the desire to kill....This world is inconve- niently arranged for a literal practice of ahimsa. Man may be compelled to extermi- nate harmful creatures. He is not under a similar compulsion to feel anger or animos- ity. All forms of life have an equal right to the air of maya. The saint who uncovers the secret of creation will be in harmony with Nature's countless bewildering expressions. All men may understand this truth by overcoming the passion for destruction.\" I then asked: \"Guruji, should one offer himself a sacrifice rather than kill a wild beast?\" \"No, man's body is precious. It has the highest evolutionary value because of unique brain and spinal centers. These enable the advanced devotee fully to grasp and express the loftiest aspects of divinity. No lower form is so equipped. It is true that a man incurs the debt of a minor sin if he is forced to kill an animal or any other living thing. But the holy shastras teach that wanton loss of a human body is a serious trans- gression against the karmic law.\" 464"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"another man kills many human beings on the battlefield in defense of his country and is given a medal. It is the inner motive that differenti- ates the two. Human moralists judge outer appearances, believing in absolute rules; but Divine Law, the true arbiter of virtue and vice in this world of relativity , judges man's inner being. However, one's mo- tives must be wisdom-pure. I remember the opportunistic students in my classes who found this opening in the door of right behavior a convenient exit: \"My motive justified my actions.\" My response, with gratitude to the author for a succinct rebuttal, was to quote: \"The road to Hades is paved with good intentions.\" The law of cause and effect bestows good or bad fruits of actions according to a person's good or bad activities. Every action—mental or physical—produces a result in the form of a tendency, which is lodged in the mind as a karmic seed. This mental-tendency seed germinates into action when the conditions of environment provide the necessary \"wa- tering.\" A good mental seed produces good action and a bad seed re- sults in evil performance. One should be very careful how he acts, for the power of leftover corresponding tendencies makes actions repeat themselves—becoming more deeply integrated into one's nature with each repetition. It is all right when good actions are repeated, but dis- astrous when evil actions insinuate themselves against the will of the performer. Every wrong action brings calamity from \"the judgment\" — from the result proceeding from the law of cause and effect. One can measure one's emotional self-control by testing it on those nearest and dearest to him. If he can neutralize his impulses to become angry (or to vent any other acrid emotion) in response to provocations, then he is developing himself in the spirit of the law as admonished by Jesus. To control the external expression of anger while seething within creates an inner vibratory heat that cooks one's brain like a slowly baked potato. Lahiri Mahasaya gave those methods of meditation by which one can instead roast the seeds of wrong impulses. Scientific meditation harmonizes the whole being, creating an inner calmness of self-mastery. Jesus makes another point in these verses: Words are very potent vibratory actions, affecting favorably or adversely the one who utters them and also the one to whom they are directed. To express contempt to any individual (\"say to his brother, 'Raca'\"*) is spiritually libelous * Raca: a derogatory term in Aramaic (literally, \"I spit on you\") conveying extreme contempt. 465"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"against that individual's soul, which is ever perfect regardless of how loathsome his egoistic expression.

It would be a humbling, if not horrific, experience if one had to face an archival reading of the shames in all of his past incarnations. The merciful God has forgiven so much in every man who is consciously struggling toward the light of wisdom; it is the awakening nobility of the soul that likewise feels patience rather than contempt for others whose actions show no such awakening. Further, anyone who calls another a \"fool\"* shall himself suffer from the fire of ignorance. Ignorance is hell, as it engenders all man- ner of evils and burns away wisdom. True knowledge and wisdom are the source of salvation from the miseries of the human condition. To inhibit the potential unfoldment of anyone's soul wisdom by a strong suggestion of ineptness is to do them a great wrong. Negating anyone's will and branding the subconscious mind with defeatist thoughts of inferior abilities is reprehensible. To foster in anyone an attitude of surrender to ignorance sets in motion the lawful principle that to pull down another human being is a sin that puts oneself \"in danger of hell fire\"—the fire of ignorance that consumes one's own spiritual merit in the act of willfully demoralizing, humiliating, or denigrating an- other person.

The concept of eternal damnation in hellfire, as in or- thodox interpretations, is no t supported in this verse or elsewhere in the New Testa- ment. The word used for \"hell\" in the original Greek of the Gospel is Gehenna, from Hebrew Ge Hinnom, the valley of Hinnom southwest of Jerusalem, where children were formerly burned as living sacrifices to the Ammonite god Moloch (II Chronicles 28:3; Jeremiah 7:31-32). I n Jesus' time, according to Biblical historians, the valley was used as a dump for the filth of the city, where continual fires were kept to consume it — \"a place,\" according to commentator John Gill, \"whose fire was never quenched; and in which they burned the bones of any thing that was unclean, and dead carcasses, and other pollutions.\" The name was thus commonly used by the Jews to denote the after-death realm of punishment. Encyclopaedia Britannica states about Gehenna: \"Mentioned several times in the New Testament (e.g., Matthew, Mark, Luke, and James) as a place in which fire will destroy the wicked, it also is noted in the Talmud, a compendium of Jewish law, lore, and commentary, as a place of purification, after which one is released from further torture.\" 466"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"ing tongues of fire in a hell at some point of space to burn the disem- bodied souls of sinners, rife with bad karma.

No one can re- ally present to God a gift from the bounty of His creation, because all things belong to Him; but to give unto God the gifts that are given by Him shows an appreciative heart. Most of all, God loves the gifts of love, peace, and devotion offered in the temple of one's own heart or through the temples of the hearts of others. Therefore, Jesus stressed that one's heart must be made pure if one's gift to God is to be a worthy offering. Ill will toward an estranged brother is a defilement of the inner temple of harmony. To \"agree with thine adversary\" does not mean to condone or cooperate with his evil, but to cleanse oneself of malice and rancor. To seek reconciliation in forgiveness of wrongs is to please God in the forgiver and the forgiven. Inharmony, resulting from enmity, is the judge and the officer which casts one into the prison of inner disturbance. Verily, no one *Cf.

And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell\" (Matthew y.zj-30).* J esus said that not only is the physical act of adultery sinful, but that, according to spiritual law, a lustful gaze involves the com- mitting of adultery in the mind.

But the Divine Law condemns mental adultery also, because without its advent, physical adultery would not be enacted. The Hindu scriptures speak of the following ways of committing adultery (equally applicable to women as well as men): 1. To think lustfully of a woman, without the woman being pres- ent before the physical eyes. 2. To talk about a woman with lustful desire. 3. To touch a woman with lustful desire. 4. To gaze upon a woman with lustful desire. 5. To hold private intimate talks with a woman with the ultimate hope of physical union. 6. The act of physical union without the consecration of marriage. \"Sin\" requires a complex definition. It is not a transgression against an arbitrary code of behavior decreed by a whimsical God. The Creator made man a spiritual being, a soul endowed with an in- dividualization of His own divine nature. He gave to the soul, evolved from its own Self, the instruments of a body and a mind with which to perceive and interact with the objects of a mjyj-manifested uni- verse. The soul's mental and physical instruments come into being and are held in existence by specific lawful processes of God's creative power. If man lives in perfect harmony with the machinations of these principles, he remains a spiritual being in charge of his body and mind. Sin is that which compromises that perfect self-mastery. It has its au- tomatic negative effect to the degree of the influence of delusion within it—involving no condemnation of an irate God. Man's free-will ac- tions simply harmonize and strengthen the expressed essence of his soul perfection, or weaken and degrade it into mortal enslavement. Thus, how many ways there are to sin against natural law no liv- ing mortal knows. The category of sex is a particularly puzzling one. Unless the sex urge were given to man from within, by the process of evolution after the fall from Eden,* he would not feel the desire. Since physical union is the law of propagation of the species, it should be treated with that regard. Animals cannot commit adultery, even though they are indis- criminate from the human standpoint, because their sexual engage- ments merely obey the nature-impelled instinct to procreate their species. They do not indulge in self-created sex thoughts. * See Discourse 7. 469"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"Man, being endowed with reason and free will, commits sin by adding his lascivious, insatiable, lustful thoughts to the instinct of pro- creation. According to spiritual law, therefore, to use the sexual in- stinct solely to gratify sensual desire is considered sinful, detrimental to man's godly image. A married man also commits sin, as pointed out by Jesus, if he thinks lustfully of his wife, whose feminine nature should be respectfully loved and regarded as God's motherly aspect. Healthful hunger can be appeased by using the sense of taste to select the right foods, but greed for food can never be satisfied and compounds its ill effects by choosing an unhealthful diet. Similarly, physical union for procreation is as nature intends, but indulgence is never appeased, and is destructive to health and the nervous system, disturbing the entire mental, neural, and spiritual faculties. The mind is single-tracked when it becomes fixated on an impulse. Once it gets used to sex habits, it is very difficult to make it move in the elevating channels of meditation. Sex-addicted persons are very nervous and restless; their minds wander constantly on the plane of the senses, making it difficult to concentrate upon the inner peace that leads the con- sciousness to the all-intoxicating, ever new bliss of God-communion. The vital essence lost in physical union contains untold atomic units of lifetronic intelligence and energy; the loss of this power, due to indiscriminate excesses, is extremely harmful to spiritual develop- ment. It exacerbates the outflow of life force through the lowest sub- tle center at the base of the spine, concentrating the consciousness on identification with the body and external sensory perceptions. When one is habituated to this state, no ascension of consciousness to the higher centers of spiritual realization and God-communion is possible. People who live on the sex plane with its momentary allurement and physical excitation cannot even imagine, much less desire to achieve, the incomparable bliss of Spirit in interiorized meditation. Yogis en- hance their great spiritual power and realization by a natural, not sup- pressed, conservation of the vital essence, transmuting it into divine vibrations in meditation that awaken the higher centers in the spine with their exalted states of consciousness. Speaking figuratively of how even looking at the opposite sex with impure thoughts arouses lust, Jesus said that it is better to lose an eye than that the whole bodily instrument be desecrated by evil — it is better to forgo illicit sensory indulgence than to lose the infinite unending joys of the soul's communion with Spirit. 470"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"Christ used a dramatic metaphor to emphasize that if the mind becomes enslaved by desires arising from any sensory perception (\"eye\") or sensory action (\"hand\") it profanes the divine soul-image within man, leaving him oblivious of God.

Without knowing Him, life becomes a \"hell\" of in- security with unforeseen disasters and grievous troubles. It is better that man's misuse of the senses and his wrong actions \"should perish\" than to allow his passions to annihilate his entire happiness in Spirit. How thoughtlessly people give up the kingdom of immortal bliss for their material desires for name, fame, lustful gratification, posses- sion, money. Christ decried that shortsighted investment of one's life; it is more \"profitable for thee\" to cast off whatsoever casts the hap- piness of one's true being into a \"hell\" of delusive soul-oblivion. \"It hath been said, 'Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement': But I say unto you, that whoso- ever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery\" (Matthew 5:31-32).

The sin lies in marrying the wrong person, actuated by social cus- tom or physical instinct. One should get married only when one finds soul unity with a proper mate. And the two thus united in holy vows should remain together, steadfastly loyal to one another. Proper mar- riage nurtures real love, union on a higher plane, and sublimates the uncontrolled lusts of living on the sex plane. People who marry and divorce time and again never give the seeds of divine love a chance to grow on the soil of faithful commitment. The minds of such persons, being concentrated upon sex and physical attraction, remain spiritually fallow.

In making a sacred promise to God one may not resort to evasive or outright falsehoods, or thereafter break that oath, without consequence. It had thus become a custom among the Jewish population that in mundane or trivial matters swearing was done in reference to specific creations of God rather than in direct appeal to God Himself, presuming thereby no absolute obligation. Jesus was a bold voice on behalf of the spirit of the laws that gov- ern man's behavior. Hypocritical skirting of those principles may avoid •  present consequences, but the evil effects engen- Why Jesus spoke dered in the consciousness will inevitably have their against the swearing day of retribution. So Jesus was not advising of oaths  against oaths taken in the proper circumstance for the proper reason, and the solemnity that should be accorded them, but rather against the flippant avowal of an insincere intent. He points out the impossibility of performing actions outside *Cf. Matthew 19:9 and Luke 16:18, Discourse 62, for further commentary on Jesus' teaching about marriage and divorce. 472"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"of God's presence. A person is, in principle, no less beholden if he swears in the name of heaven or earth, for heaven is God's transcen- dental realm of blissful retirement where He rests on His throne of In- finity, hidden behind the walls of space and light rays. The earth is the footstool of God; that is, it is a place where God as the Creator works with His \"feet\" of motion and activity. Neither should one swear by Jerusalem or any holy city or place which has had the sacred mani- festation of the Royal God through the presence, worship, and real- ization of His saints. Neither should one swear by the head because it is the holy sanctuary of the soul. From the practice of swearing frivolously to enhance one's self- perceived eminence, there has devolved the crude commonality of swear- ing merely to punctuate one's statements. Such swearing is the result of overworked emotion. During the mental obliteration of clear thinking caused by emotion, as in a heated argument, or anger, or a strong im- pulse to stress a point, one is apt to speak untruth or to make a violent false assertion. To add to impulsive untruthful statements, or even self- serving factual assertions, the sacred name of God, or by implication any- thing in which He is manifested, is to drag down that which is holy to support something that is wrong or egocentric or trifling. Coarse swearing reveals weakness of character, absence of fine- ness, and lack of reverence. It makes one cheap and also cheapens the atmosphere around him, undermining respect for things sacred and af- fecting the sanctity and seriousness of good souls in his company. Swearing exposes one's mental deficiency in having to resort to emo- tional exclamations instead of using the clarity of reason to prove a point. A true statement firmly asserted does not need to be supported or emphasized by swearing, which rather desecrates and denigrates and may fasten upon one the habit of prevarication, exaggeration, and misrepresentation. Swearing fosters profane language, an impulsive and overbearing nature, and hasty and impatient assertions. In con- versation and argument, it is best to use \"yea, yea,\" or \"nay, nay,\" calmly or emphatically administered, as the occasion demands; that is, to be restrained, concise, and truthful. A person of devious tempera- ment is unreliable, feeling no constraints regardless of any avowal; an upright person is always sincere and honest with or without the com- mandment of a sworn oath. 473"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"\"Ye have heard that it hath been said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth': But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. \"And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. \"Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would bor- row of thee turn not thou away\" (Matthew 5:38-4 2). Parallel reference: \"And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also. \"Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again\" (Luke 6:29-30, Ser- mon on the Plain). HPhe Mosaic law of \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth\" was 1L to serve not only as a punishment, but also as a deterrent to other would-be criminals by making the punishment match the crime.\"\" A lit- eral reading may have been justified in the time when people, in the words of Moses, \"have corrupted themselves...they are a perverse and crooked generation....neither is there any understanding in them. O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!\"t Spiritual laws are eternally true, but their application as inscribed in judgments governing a society may in different climes and ages require more or less modification according to the nature of the en- vironment in which they are enacted. Though no social system can sur- vive without an orderly code of justice to restrain wrongdoers and up- hold a standard of human dignity, laws best fulfill their purpose when they protect the innocent and encourage reformation of the guilty. The \"eye for an eye\" law serves only the purpose of punishment for the sake of revenge. It does not teach right actions to the wrong- doer, but may well make him more hateful. To wreak vengeance does \"•Exodus 21:24, Leviticus 24:19, Deuteronomy 19:21. tDeuteronomy 32:5, 28-29. 474"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"not stop the recurrence of an evil act; rather, it is more likely to foster evil thoughts and further acts of retaliation. Therefore, Jesus again, as in the principle of nonkilling, speaks of the ideal of noninjury ( ahimsa) to any human being—in word, thought, speech, or action. It enjoins freedom from the desire —— for revenge and not resisting evil with evil methods. Applying the principle Jesus advises man to conquer evil by the infinitely of nonviolence powerful virtue of forgiveness and love. He speaks (ahimsa) figuratively of turning the other cheek to illustrate the influence of goodness over inimical behavior. If anybody vents his anger with a slap and receives a slap in return, it only increases his anger and desire to deliver stronger blows—and maybe a kick or a bullet! A calm response, on the other hand, is quite disconcerting and disarming. With a resentful second blow his physical wrath is quite likely to be spent. Wrath is increased by wrath as fire increases by fire, but as fire is extinguished by water, so also, wrath is subdued by kindliness.* One whose immunity of calmness and love can resist the hatred from an angry brother thereby prevents that virus of disquieting emo- tion from entering withi n himself. The ideal of nonretaliation does not justify supine surrender to wrongdoing or tacit approval of evil. To turn the other cheek is not calculated to make a person into a mental or moral weakling, or to suggest enduring an abusive or violent personal relationship, but to in- still the strength of self-control gained by overcoming the impulse to act under the influence of revenge. It is an easy reflex to retaliate, but it requires great mental strength not to strike back. It takes a highly principled person of strong spiritual character to resist evil with virtue. Otherwise, it would seem ridiculous to allow a second blow after re- ceiving one hard knock. Even if the aggressor does not admit it, he will be inwardly overpowered by the person of noble behavior and will know in his heart that that person was in the right. While it is better to have courage to fight an enemy than to \"for- give\" him and run away through fear, if one can courageously face down an erring brothe r with love, that is to possess a mighty spiritual power—the transforming, healing power of divine love. A person per- fected in nonviolence lets no one steal his inner peace. When by spir- itual example and adamant determination he can maintain his ideal * \"A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger\" (Proverbs 15:1). 475"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"personality in spite of any robbers of disquietude, he becomes a tow- ering example of truth in the eyes of others. When assailed by someone, it is hard to give love. The best way, while talcing commonsense steps to remedy the situation, is to pray to God to change the heart of that person. Never ask God to punish any- one. It is surprising how sincere prayer will change the attitude of an antagonist. If that person becomes penitent, the giver of love has won that heart. The early Christians were considered fools for their nonviolent re- sistance against Roman tyranny, but the kingdom of Jesus' teachings en- dured and flourished while the Roman empire deteriorated into oblivion. A spiritual man of high order feels no grievous loss when he is parted from any of his material possessions, for whatever reason—be —— it from court judgments or for someone in need. The soul qualities of His heartfelt generosity of spirit gives with an open openhearted generosity hand. The spiritual man sees God not only in his and sympathy for all own body but in the bodies of others. In oneness with God, he sees himself as the Self of all, and finds equal enjoyment whether he himself dons his \"cloak\" or takes it off from his one body and puts it on another one of his bodies. What- ever the divine person does for another, he feels by such action that he has in a nonattached way done this for himself, only in another body —just as one transfers a ring from one finger to another. Giving away one's \"cloak\" as well as one's \"coat\" may seem like very unpractical advice in the modern world. No doubt, one must use discrimination. Abnegation of one's own material needs can best be completely practiced only by saints or by people living under ideal conditions. One is under no spiritual compulsion to give his home away to an unscrupulous defrauder; instead, he is compelled to de- mand lawful justice from those who are unjust to him. It would be ludicrous to offer a thief or a blackmailer more than was demanded, or for a victim to suggest to a kidnapper who has taken him forty miles away from his home, he would be willing to go forty miles further! The spiritual ideal in these words of Jesus is to be selflessly generous and openhearted, and willing to go that extra mile in helping others. One should practice the virtue of giving to deserving people what one can afford to give without causing himself or those dependent upon him for their needs an enforced hardship. One should not \"rob 476"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"Peter to pay Paul.\" It is not spiritual to starve one's family in order to be a philanthropist. Mahatma Gandhi convinced his family of the virtue of sacrifice and then gave away all of his possessions without saving even any bonds or stocks for the security of his wife and chil- dren. Such action is admirable if the sacrifice is performed with the willing agreement of the other persons concerned. Gandhi had a mis- sion to fulfill, which would be best accomplished by identifying him- self materially as well as spiritually with the downtrodden masses. Practical sympathy toward those in need dispels the darkness of separation between souls and is the light by which one can see all hearts tied together with the singular golden cord of divine love. God throbs in all hearts, suffering in the afflicted, rejoicing in those that are whole. The same spirit of nonattachment should accompany the sharing of one's goods with would-be borrowers. It shows compassion to lend to needy people, but let not that virtue be negated by anger if the money is not returned. It is better not to lend at all than to become upset or ugly because the debtor is unable to pay back what he owes. Practical advice would be to lend only what one can afford to give away and forget all about it. Conscientious persons will make good on what they owe when and as they are able, and unscrupulous per- sons will not honor their debt even if they can afford to. To lend money with the assurance of a returned favor, or the gain of a favorable interest, is ordinary business. But to lend to the needy who may or may not be able to repay—to help others without the de- sire for material reward; to give something without the hope of get- ting something better in return — is divine. Those who give of their material goods with the presumption of compensation receive tempo- rary material things or advantages only; those who give with an open heart, just for the pleasure of giving pleasure to others, receive their repayment with a dividend of divine love. There is nothing wrong in expecting the return of what one lends to others, not only for tending to one's own needs but for further shar- ing with others. But those things that one can spare, and that have been given to others to use, should not be demanded back simply to assert one's right of ownership. Possessiveness shows meanness of heart. It is delusion for one to think that his material possessions be- long to him exclusively and in perpetuity. Man owns nothing on this earth; he is only given the use of things from its cosmic store.

If through some good actions a person has been fortunate enough to qualify for a generous loan from God of money, property, and possessions, that person should adopt the noble ideal of helping other children of God by openhanded assistance. Thus the spirit of Jesus' admonition: \"Give something, within your power, to whomever asks of you. By always exercising the soul quality of sympathy, your heart will expand to become as the heart of God, who does everything for all. Cultivate the consciousness that whatsoever you possess belongs to God, and as such is common property to be used in serving all His children. When God sees that you are unselfish with what He has given to you, He gives you more, that your liberal capacity to share might be enlarged as an extension of His own beneficent Hand.\" \"Ye have heard that it hath been said, 'Thou shalt love thy neigh- bour, and hate thine enemy.' But I say unto you, love your ene- mies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust\" (Matthew 5:43-45). Parallel reference: \"But I say unto you which hear, love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.... \"But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for He is kind unto the unthank- ful and to the evil\" (Luke 6:27-28, 35, Sermon on the Plain). ove and forgiveness form the nucleus of the Christ teachings. Far more than just a noble ideal, the principle of love is verily the manifestation of God in His creation. The universe endures by a play between good and evil. The effect of evil, delusion, is to divide and ob- scure and cause inharmony. Love is the attracting power of Spirit that 478"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"unites and harmonizes. The vibratory force of God's love, consciously directed by man, neutralizes the power of evil. Hate, anger, revenge, are offspring of the evil force and thus serve to re- inforce the evil vibration.   Christlike ideal of love The millenniums of resistance of evil by retali- and forgiveness to- ation in kind have never succeeded in eradicating ward enemies as well the scourge of enmity from man's heart. God could as friends instantly destroy evildoers; but instead, He uses love to coax created beings back to Him. In the simple words, \"Love your enemies,\" Jesus urged man to cooperate with God in this divine plan of redemption: to lov e one's neighbors, and to have a place in one's love for enemies as well. A wise man beholds in the circumference of his cos- mic love a galaxy of friends and also those who consider themselves to be his enemies. Naughty or good, all people are equally God's children. Those who, under the influence of passion, think antagonistically toward others, forget that all human beings are made in the image of God and are brothers. Hatred and anger becloud the divine image in vengeful persons, and delusion makes them lose the consciousness of their inner divinity. Why give hate for hate and thus imitate the vileness of ignorance? One must cultivate the consciousness of justice and love by knowing how to separate the God-image in the soul of a person from the evil in his ego expression. Just as the subtle vibratory ether is pres- ent in dark places and in the sunlight also, so one learns to recognize God in those who love him and also in those who hate him. To see God equally in friend and enemy is a testimony to one's spiritual realization. One who extends his love to friends and enemies alike ultimately beholds the presence of the One Love everywhere—in flowers, animals, and especially in the souls of God's human children. In order to see this omnipresence of God, the devotee must behold Him not only through the open portal of friendship, but must tear away the dark screen of hate and behold His erstwhile hidden presence even in the heart of enemies. It is not necessary to mix with one's enemies. It is often better to love them from a distance, unless by acts of kindly association one's love can affect a change in those persons. If one does happen to come in contact with enemies, he should remember that it is his spiritual duty to do so in love, because God is in them trying to straighten out the crookedness in their hearts. If one talks love as a matter of diplomacy to win over an enemy, but harbors enmity in his heart, that insincerity will not work for very 479"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"long. The human heart is intuitive; it is not easy to deceive its intuitive perception. The heart must absolutely give up all manner of hatred be- cause ill will, no matter how expertly controlled outwardly, travels through the ether into the heart of the person on which it is focused. Thinking love while talking love will surely mollify and change one's enemies, even if they do not immediately recognize or admit it. Love is a divine cleanser and a lastingly effective way of winning one's en- emies. Hatred may temporarily suppress and put down an enemy, but he will still remain an enemy. The poison of hate increases by hatred and can be counteracted and neutralized only by the chemical of love. Inimical persons burn themselves with hatred and anger, con- suming their inner peace. One who returns their enmity likewise burns up his own inner equanimity, his peace which offers to his entire life absolute protection from the devastation wrought by human miseries. So to hate anyone is against one's own interest. Without any expression or feeling of malice or sarcasm, a wronged person should just say within himself: \"I forgive you.\" It is such a heal- ing, elevating experience. That mental expression of love also travels through the ether into the heart of a wrongdoer. It is one of the most effective ways to change an enemy. To hate an enemy is to make him stronger, whereas his enmity is weakened by kindness until he may fi- nally realize his fault. Thus, Jesus says: \"Bless them that curse you\"—that is, wish good for those who wish evil for you. If, as often as anyone wishes evil on a person, that person responds by wishing good in return, the assailant cannot long retain his evil attitude against that well-wisher. It is ordi- nary to think that by retaliation hateful curses can be stopped; but even if the enemy is weak and outwardly cowed down, his hatred will grow all the more, just waiting for the next opportunity to ignite it. A curse for a curse cannot stop an enemy's hatred, but to love and bless a malicious scorner is to place before him a good example that may serve to change his attitude. Action speaks louder than words. Thus Jesus says, \"Do good to them that hate you.\" Not only should one mentally love a detractor, but actually do good to him. With no trace of a \"holier-than-thou\" attitude, sincere gestures of goodwill are reminders of the relation of divine brotherhood that is the unifying principle among all human beings. God is ever merciful, solely because He considers all souls as His children, placing no conditional demands on them in return.

And your wisdom shall be great, for God's di- vine love shall grow within you; and by that you shall know you are not delimited mortals, but the children of the Highest.\" Even if one can in no way approach those who hate him in order to do good to them in some tangible expression, it is always possible to follow Jesus' counsel to \"pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you.\" Pray to the omnipresent God that He bless them with freedom from their hatred. If one cannot take away the hatred from his enemies by example and loving-kindness, God can do so, for His omnipresence is in their heart and mind. By praying for one's an- tagonists, one not only uses his own loving attitude but reinforces that with God's power to heal the error-stricken. If prayer is sincere and strong, God will be moved to help change an enemy if the interven- tion of His grace is the best course for all concerned. If one's prayer to change his enemy's attitude is not fulfilled, then the supplicant must know that God wants him to pass the test of un- conditional love, even in the throes of persecution from his enemy's lies, hateful talk, and evil actions. In His own time God can and will remedy all inharmonious conditions. One should continue to pray to God that one's enemies may be forgiven and spared from suffering the otherwise inevitable results arising from their evil actions. That is the divine way to pray. God recognizes the spiritual nobility in trying to rescue brothers fallen into the pit of malicious behavior, and rewards with divine wisdom and love those souls who respond to them with Christlike understanding and actions. Anyone who wants to know God must learn to love, as He does, His virtuous and sinful children alike. The Heavenly Father knocks with His love at the heart-doors of the vicious as well as the virtuous. The virtuous man, with his ears of wisdom, hears God's summons and opens eagerly the doors of devotion that God might enter; vicious per- sons, their consciousness raucous with error, are insensible to the Di- vine Visitation. God's infinite love, undeterred, keeps knocking just the same until that wondrous moment in the soul's evolution when at last the closed mental doors will open.

That gift is deemed rajasic [fostering worldly consciousness] which is offered with reluctance or in the thought of receiving a return or of gaining merit.

Some people are so limited to their physical form and its sensations that they are little, if ever, aware of the feelings of others. Unselfishness and generosity make a person cognizant of the souls of others and the tremors of their consciousness. To serve others — by identifying their necessities as one's own and providing whatever one can in the way of material needs, psychological succor, or spiri- tual enlightenment — is wondrously expansive, uniting one's con- sciousness with the lives and hearts of others. During the bestowal of gifts, the devotee should feel that he is serving the Indwelling Lord in the body-temples of others. Whatever God-gifted bounty he has received should be shared with God's needy children as an offering to the Father of all. Thus is God served as the extended Self in the selves of others. It is the silent giver, presenting gifts to his brethren in secret, who receives the heavenly reward of feeling God's omnipresence in other hearts. Anyone who gives alms or words of wisdom to another and brags about it destroys the sanctity of his charitable act. To boast, \"I gave...\" or \"I helped to redeem...\" is not sanctity but sanctimony. A person who broadcasts his \"piety\" may receive material reward by gaining some indiscriminate admirers and some followers, but glori- fying oneself will keep away wise friends and the all-wise God. The Heavenly Law does not give the reward of revelation to braggarts; the prating ego hears nothing of truth. The braggadocio, with his desire for publicity, reaps some benefi- cial results from the good done to others by his bestowal of gifts; he is at least better than the miser. But the prideful giver remains limited in egotism, satisfied with its evanescent reward of the insincere ap- plause of man. He thus denies himself the reward of Heaven, blessed expansion of self in the hearts of others. But gifts given in quiet hu- mility joyously unite the heart of the giver with the hearts of the ben- efited, and with the omnipresence of the spirit of God. The Lord is the supreme philanthropist, Bestower of all things on His mortal children—and to His good children He has even given Himself. Those liberated sons of God, one with the Infinite Giver, like- wise offer whatever is available to make Him happy in the bodies of others. Everyone should embrace that example, sharing each day their kindness and at least something of their earthly good fortune with worthy, needy persons; and, on a broader scale, supporting the needs of worthy, divine causes, which benefit many. 490"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"Most people are willing to offer advice and sympathy; but when it comes to sharing their hard-earned money with others, they feel compelled to be \"tightwads\" with closed purse strings, believing only in family happiness—\"us four and no more.\" A person of means who is worried about losing a hundred thousand dollars on the stock mar- ket may not stop to think of the many people who possess little or nothing at all. Some people never hesitate when it comes to buying a yacht or a new luxury car, but are miserly when it comes to giving to a legitimate needy cause. There they economize and feel righteous when donating a token sum. As one lovingly, naturally, joyously, remorselessly gives the best gifts to himself, without seeking publicity, so should one give to oth- ers without ostentation. Giving freely and quietly to others, one finds the divine law of supply secretly working in his life: When attachment to God is more than to God-given possessions, automatically a chan- nel is opened through which His abundance flows. When giving to others with the right hand, or the right spirit, let not the left hand, or egotism, be conscious of it. Those who think of themselves as generous givers are not equal to those who give so openhandedly that they are hardly aware of their benevolence. If one has concern for others as he regards himself, the Spirit will reward him with the perception of Omnipresence—God's all-pervasive love and bliss sent openly into his heart. \"And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the cor- ners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward. \"But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in se- cret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly\" (Matthew 6:5-6). ^\"T^rue prayer is an expression of the soul, an urge from the soul.

This is the tendency of many otherwise sincere spiritual people—to show off their love for God, rather than strive to touch the heart of God alone. Unless there is si- multaneously an increasing intensity of zeal and love for God, pray- ing aloud to be heard by others can be spiritually corruptive. No mat- ter how wonderful it is within, spiritual realization loses something of its intensity when it is expressed outwardly. When a devotee's prayer comes from deep within, so that the words are tipsy with love for God, then others around him consciously enjoy his contact with God and drink of the contagion of love for Him. But if the devotee is not very strong, those in his presence may steal away that love from him. They begin to praise him who seems so devout; and if he feels flattered that because he has inspired others, therefore he must be great, then he becomes weakened—his love is stolen from his heart, and pride takes its place. Sometimes, no loud or even whispered words can I pray; for when deep feeling for God possesses you, you cannot utter any words. That love is secret within, an inner communion, silently giving its oblations into the Spirit. Like a sacred fire, that love burns the darkness from around the soul, and in that light one beholds the mightiness of Spirit. Jesus admonished those who pray not as a sincere heart-offering to God, but as a public display of devotion to manufacture a reputa- tion of holiness. They are hypocrites, for their egotistical motives are not synchronized with their pious actions. It is reprehensibly sinful to use God and prayer to secure the devotion of people under false pre- tenses. By inspiring simple, trusting people in the thought of goodness, such individuals may reap a reward of earthly power and the devotion of blind followers; but God, who sees the heart and never responds to false prayers, keeps Himself remote. Hypocrites who make a show of spirituality to garner temporary prestige are foolish, for they forfeit the eternal, all-redeeming blessing of God won by a true heart's pri- vate romance with the Divine. 492"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"Most houses of worship practice demonstrative prayer. It provides some inspiration and devotion; but insofar as it keeps the attention ex- ternalized, it is, i n itself, ineffective in producing actual God-communion. Public or congregational prayer should be supplemented by deep, secret, soul-loving prayers in the quietness of seclusion. As the parlor awakens social consciousness, the library fosters reading consciousness, and the bedroom suggests sleeping, so every- one should have a room or a screened-off corner, or a well-ventilated closet, used exclusively for the purpose of silent meditation. Tradi- tional homes in India always have such a shrine for daily worship. A sanctuary in one's home is very effective in fostering spirituality, be- cause unlike a place of public worship it becomes personalized, and also because it is accessible for spontaneous devotional expressions throughout the day. The children in India are not forced to frequent the shrine, but are inspired to do so by the parents' example. In these home temples, families learn to find the soul peace hidden behind the veil of silence. Her e they introspect, and in prayer and meditation recharge themselves with the inner power of the soul, and in divine communion attune themselves to discriminative wisdom by which they may govern their lives according to the dictates of conscience and right judgment. Interiorized praye r brings forth the realization that peace and service to divine ideals are the goal of life, without which no amount of material acquisition can assure happiness. Modern religion needs to rediscover and em- phasize the individual search for God, the method of divine romanticism in seclusion. Important to this practice is knowledge of scientific spiritual techniques for actually communing with the Lord in the inner silence of mental interiorization. Usu- ally, even persons who physically sequester them- selves for prayer and devotions are so hounded by their restless thoughts that they fail to enter the soul sanctuary of concentrated communion, where real worship becomes possible. Those who pray without knowing the scientific art of interioriza- tion often complain that God does not respond to their entreaties. Such devotees may be compare d to the person who retires to his study and requests a friend to call him on the telephone, but then keeps the line ceaselessly occupied with other incoming and outgoing calls.

True concentration, whether on prayer or God or anything else, is impossible so long as the mind is thus outwardly distracted. Most per- sons experience surcease from the sensory tumult only in the state of sleep, when the mind automatically stills the flow of the life energy that activates the sensory and motor nerves. The science of yoga meditation teaches techniques of controlling the life energy consciously, enabling one to disconnect the mind at will from the intrusion of the senses. This pro- duces not an unconscious oblivion, but a blissful transference of identity from the false reality of the body and sensory world to the truth of one's being: the supernal soul, made in God's image. In that interiorized silence wherein the soul's divine sonship is no longer squandered in the prodigal outward consciousness, true prayer and divine communion with the Heavenly Father are not only possible, but dynamically effective. * God hears all prayers; but His children do not always hear His re- sponse. In every age, those who succeeded in their efforts to commune with God were those who found entry into the inner silence.f That is * The science of Kriya Yoga includes these techniques, which are taught in the Self- Realization Fellowship Lessons. fLord Krishna referred to the requisite interiorization of consciousness in these words: \"When the yogi, lik e a tortoise withdrawing its limbs, can fully retire his senses from the objects of perception, his wisdom manifests steadiness\" (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita 11:58). Those who find the way to actual perception of the Divine know its universality— whether they call it yoga or use some other terminology. The illumined Saint Teresa of Avila used the identical metaphor to teach her nuns the way to enter the \"interior cas- tle\" to commune with Christ: \"When we are seeking God within ourselves (where He is found more effectively and more profitably than in the creatures, to quote Saint Augus- tine, who after havin g sought Him in many places, found Him within) it is a great help if God grants us this favour [conscious interiorization]. Do not suppose that the under- standing can attain to Him, merely by trying to think of Him as within the soul, or the imagination, by picturing Him as there. This is a good habit and an excellent kind of meditation, for it is founded upon a truth—namely, that God is within us. But it is not the kind of prayer that I have in mind....What I am describing is quite different. These people are sometimes in the castle before they have begun to think about God at all.... They become markedly consciou s that they are gradually retiring within themselves; any- one who experiences this will discover what I mean: I cannot explain it better.

The motive behind the evil ways of even the utmost sinner is that he expects to attain therefrom something that will lead to happiness. God is that happiness. But the urge to seek Him is drowned in the urge to indulge in sense pleasures. When that sensory compulsion disap- pears, then the craving for God automatically appears. Sensations pouring in through the sensory nerves keep the mind filled with myriad noisy thoughts, so that the whole attention is toward the senses. But God's voice is silence. Only when restless thoughts cease can one hear the voice of God communicating through the silence of intuition. That is God's means of expression. In the devotee's silence God's silence ceases. For the devotee whose consciousness is inwardly united with God, an audible response from Him is unnecessary—intu- itive thoughts and true visions constitute God's voice. These are not the result of the stimuli of the senses, but the combination of the devotee's silence and God's voice of silence. God has been with His children on earth all the time, talking to them; but His voice of silence has been drowned out by the noisiness of their thoughts: \"Thou didst love me always, but I heard Thee not.\" He has always been near; it is the consciousness of man that has been wandering away from Him. In spite of man's indifference and pursuit of sense pleasures, still God's love abides, and always will. To know this, one must withdraw one's thoughts from sensations and be silent within. Silencing the thoughts means tuning them in to God. That is when true prayer begins. When the devotee is in tune with God, he will hear the divine Voice: \"I have loved thee through the ages; I love thee now; and I shall love thee until thou comest Home. Whether thou knowest it or not, I shall always love thee.\" He speaks to us in silence, telling us to come Home. 495"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"\"But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask Him\" (Matthew 6:j-8). repeat \"My Lord, I love You,\" countless times, sincerely, feel- JL ingly, so that with each utterance the devotee's love and under- standing of God grow deeper, is a sure method of contacting God through prayer. \"Vain repetition\" signifies praying aloud or mentally, —— \"God, God, God,\" while the background of the mind Acquiring the concen- is occupied with something else—a vacation trip, a trated attention and sumptuous dinner, how to make more money. This is devotion that make using the name of God fruitlessly,* for He will never prayer effective manifest Himself so long as He knows that other de- sires have precedence in the devotee's heart and mind. \"Heathen\" refers to persons who are engrossed in their bodies, their consciousness externalized in communion with the \"gods\" of sen- sory distractions rather than internalized in devoted worship of God \"in spirit and in truth.\" Their prayers are a mere physical practice of parroting or chanting the name of God with no iota of real thought about Him. Such prayers are little better than the automatic vocaliza- tions of a parrot taught to repeat the name of God. If a young man car- ried a recording that played \"I love you\" and used it to express his love to his beloved, she would certainly say, \"My dear friend, if you are try- ing to convince me of your love, it is in vain; you don't mean it at all!\" An aunt of mine used beads to aid her constant repetition of prayers; no matter where she went, her fingers worked those beads. But after forty years of this practice, one day she confided to me that the Lord had never responded. Though her \"prayers\" may have numbered in the millions, her attention was everywhere but on God. I was glad for the opportu- nity to initiate her in Kriya Yoga and the true art of divine communion. The Lord who knows each devotee's innermost thoughts cannot be deceived by mechanically parroted prayers, no matter how polished their composition. It is better to offer a single, simple prayer from the heart—deeply, understanding^, and intensely—than a profusion of prayers consisting of thoughtless repetitions. Formulaic invocations with the mind absent creates hypocrisy, gratifying the ego with a sense * \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain\" (Exodus 20:7). 496"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"of piety that in fact has little spiritualizing effect. To expect divine in- tervention \"on demand\" in answer to unthinking, unfeeling prayers is unscientific superstition. Though God does not respond in the manner hoped for when of- fered such talkative, blindly repeated prayers, yet He cannot remain aloof or deny the true devotee who prays with sincerity, faith, and the deter- mination never to give up. Elsewhere the New Testament conveys Jesus' teaching to \"pray without ceasing.\"* Unceasing prayer involves repeti- tion—not vain or mechanical, but spiritualized with ever-increasing, thoughtful, heartfelt devotion. That devotee is sure to find divine contact who continuously keeps the mind on God, intensifying the thoughts of his prayer, unceasingly reining in the attention regardless of how many times it wanders away. The Gita similarly teaches: \"On Me fix thy mind, be thou My devotee, with ceaseless worship bow reverently before Me. Having thus united thyself to Me as thy Highest Goal, thou shalt be Mine own.\"f Prayers sent out soulfully once or many times, mentally or orally, bring a demonstrative response from God. To utter \"God\" with de- votion, and increase the concentration and devotion with each repeti- tion of His name, is to plunge the mind deeper and deeper in the ocean of His presence until one reaches fathomless depths of divine peace and ecstatic joy, the sure proof that one's prayers have touched God. Prayer with devotion is a wonderful means of opening oneself to the freely flowing blessings of God, a necessary link of man's life to the Infinite Source of all benefaction. But it takes a long time for prayer to be effective when the mind is outwardly roaming. That is why one hour of Kriya Yoga meditation can bestow more effect than twenty-four hours of ordinary prayer. Those who practice the tech- nique of Kriya deeply for even a little while, and sit long in meditation in the resultant stillness, find that the force of their prayer is doubled, trebled, a hundred times more powerful. If one enters the inner tem- ple of silence and worships before the altar of God with prayer and invocation of His presence, He comes quickly. When the conscious- ness is withdrawn from the sensory surface of the body and its sur- roundings and centralized in the cerebrospinal shrines of soul percep- tion, that is the most effective time to pray. *I Thessalonians 5:17. t God Talks With Arjurta: The Bhagavad Gita ix:34. 497"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"Jesus described as \"vain\" the supplications of body-bound \"hea- thens\" with their disunion from God's indwelling Essence. Ordinary man has so entangled himself in the finite law of cause and effect that it is not simple to break his consequential karmic bonds. God does not arbitrarily contravene the orderly workings of His universe. Man must work to harmonize his life and actions with God's laws, and thereby initiate favorable new effects to neutralize past errors. However, the devotee who by pure love, faith, and divine knowing born of medita- tion reestablishes his consciousness of oneness with the Infinite Father transcends finitude and its laws, instantly receiving God's grace, His mitigating unconditional love. To reclaim one's soul status as a child of God is thus the sovereign way to fulfillment of prayers. Approaching the Lord not as a mortal beggar but as a loving divine son, the devo- tee knows that whatever the Father possesses, that also is his own. Devotees who love God deeply, knowing He is their loving Father, never feel they have to beg Him for their daily necessities, for He will give to them what is needful without their even having to ask. God does not want His children to approach Him as beggars. Beggary prayers ex- press doubt as to one's divine birthright as an heir to His infinite king- dom. A beggar gets a beggar's share, but a son has the right to a son's share. That is the consciousness in which to approach the Heavenly Fa- ther: He is ever ready to provide, if only His children would make them- selves able to receive by fully realizing their immortal kinship with Him. \"After this manner therefore pray ye: \"Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

As God's bliss and wisdom are the only kingly powers that ex- ist in the transcendence of Cosmic Consciousness, so in the words \"Thy kingdom come\" Jesus prays that those absolute powers of God may manifest in human consciousness, which is erstwhile steeped in delusion.

Jesus knew he could not very well expect the people to hearken to a spiritual message that did not address their mundane concerns as well —a person with a hungry stomach has little incentive to strive for spir- itual realization. In any case, Jesus was referring to an all-inclusive sustenance for body, mind, and soul, not merely physical bread. He had said, \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\"* Man cannot live solely by material means. Every moment of his existence he is dependent on the life force flow- ing from God's creative Cosmic Vibration, His \"word,\" and on the in- herent wisdom and bliss of the omnipresent Christ Consciousness that supports his own consciousness. The more attuned one is to this di- vine vitality and wisdom, the more he is able to draw unto himself the fulfillment of his physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual needs. So man's first prayer should be for the spiritual bread of contact with God's Bliss, Wisdom, and Love, which alone feeds the soul; then effi- ciency for the mind in order to accomplish one's worthwhile goals; and lastly, material prosperity adequate to meet one's physical needs. \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil\": In these words, Jesus almost seems to make God responsible when man finds himself in the throes of temptation, having been  - * purposively led into that predicament by his Heav- A prayer for self- enly Father.

Good and evil are the light and shadows that create the contrasts necessary to produce God's cosmic motion picture. The white purity of goodness demonstrates its * See Discourse 8. 501"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"virtue on the dark background of evil. God's children are tested by this duality of maya-delusion to develop the wisdom to distinguish be- tween good and evil, and the will to overcome all tests and thereby be free from Satan's cat-and-mouse game of temptation. The Lord could easily countermand the influence of satanic temp- tation, but to do so would negate man's free will and make him a pup- pet. The intrigue of God's drama of creation is to see if perchance His children will choose Him over the allurements of His cosmic show— not from any compulsion on His part, but solely of their own freely chosen response to His love. He wants His mortal reflections to enjoy the grand drama in this cosmic movie house with an unchanging re- membrance of their innate divinity. To prove that divine nature is to pass successfully through trials and temptations that teach wayward man to bring out and manifest in every condition of his life the hid- den God-identity of his soul. The Lord knows that His children will ultimately assert the power of Spirit within them to vanquish the power of temptation. So when Jesus prayed \"lead us not into temptation,\" he intended no indictment of the Lord as having any part in man's miseries. Rather, he expressed man's need to supplicate God for help in over- coming life's unavoidable delusions: \"Leave us not in the pit of temp- tation wherein we fell through the misuse of Thy given reason.\" Man falls headlong into the abyss of evil when he does not use properly the faculties of God-given free choice. Satan snares the unwary with cosmic delusion, subverting reason and will with ignorance. That is how he so successfully obstructs God. Thus Jesus prayed that the Heavenly Father deliver every soul from the evil enthrallment of cos- mic delusion. The Bible says, \"God made man in His own image\";* but when one looks in the mirror he sees anything but God! Every night man becomes a god when he dumps his body consciousness in sleep; and every day he chooses to be a devil. What can the Father do? When man puts on mortal garb he should remember his divinity and not in any way ascribe mortal weakness to his soul. That is what the scrip- tures of India say. In the morning upon awakening, impress on the consciousness: \"I am just coming out of Spirit. I am Spirit now; and I shall be Spirit evermore.\" But when one has a headache, he quickly * Genesis 1:27. 502"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"forgets his sublimity and feels very mortal indeed. If man remembers at all times his true Self, he becomes free again. Simple but true. By continuous affirmation, associating with the wise, studying the scrip- tures, and above all by meditation in which the conscious dream of mortal limitation is completely dissolved in the superconscious per- ception of the soul, the persevering devotee will know he is a god. Di- vine communion restores man to his original Self. He realizes complete satisfaction in all goodness in his soul, and that to crave any tempting offerings of the senses would, to his heartbreak, eclipse the incompa- rable divine joy. Self-control is the master of temptation. It does not speak highly of the human race when man acts like less evolved creatures. Even beasts behave more wisely, being guided by instinct. Only in the com- pany of human beings do they learn to live unnaturally. There is no evil in them, because their actions have no discriminative freewill mo- tivations. Man is spiritually bound to make choices between right and wrong—beneficial or harmful. Unless he develops self-control, he will act unwisely when tempted, even against his better judgment. Many learn self-control only after getting burned in the enticing flames of harmful indulgences. It is better to avoid painful lessons by observation of consequences inflicted on others, by obedience to spir- itual teachings, and by wise discrimination. Without discriminative self-control the refined beauty of virtue is overshadowed by the gaudy tinsel of the senses. He who says temptation is not charming lies. By temptation man is blithely led into trouble because of the hypnotic allure of evil. No one would indulge in vices if they did not give pleasure. The drug ad- dict, the alcoholic, the sex addict, the indiscriminate overeater, had a good time indulging their habit, but at the cost of slowly killing their happiness and themselves. Temptation is the undue influence on the senses of something al- luring that one thinks is harmless, but isn't. It is the desire to have a moment's pleasure, disregarding its future ill effects. As counterfeit coins have no value but may be hard to differenti- ate from the genuine article, likewise it takes discrimination to know the difference between pleasure derived from attractive but worthless vices and real happiness, which is the valuable worth of virtue. Sincere prayer to God for help in the right use of reason and will weakens the confounding effect of delusion and prevents wrong choices between 503"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"good and evil. The saints define as evil anything, no matter how nice it seems, that is subversive to God-contact and the expression of the soul's qualities, which produce true happiness. The joy of God-communion, once tasted, is more tempting than all mundane temptations. If man tempts himself with that true plea- sure, the temptation of the senses will wane. I have always prayed, \"Lord, why don't You reveal Yourself in the very beginning and then there will be no suffering from seeking pleasure in harmful actions?\" Because God is the supremely charming experience, it is only when man does not have that comparison that evil temptation has power. Would anyone eat rotten cheese if he had good cheese? Would anyone prefer suffering to joy? No. Man yields to temptation because of the delusion that it will bring happiness. Criminals think they will get hap- piness from money they steal; but they find that crime does not pay. Neither does succumbing to the temptations of the senses. Sense perceptions are natural and necessary to man's conscious physical existence; the relentless predators of his happiness and well- being are the sensuous actions that arise from perceptions and that are ungoverned by discrimination. The senses of hearing, smell, and sight can usually be overtaxed with little ill effect. Few people are foolish enough to strain their eyes to the point of blindness. No one smells flowers or perfumes long enough to cause death. Unless the volume of sound is excessive, people do not make themselves deaf by continu- ously listening to good music. However, the sense of sight may be baited by attractions that result in wrong judgments and misery. The sense of hearing may mislead the weak-willed by receptivity to dulcet tones of flattery, or harsh vibrations that arouse anger. The sense of smell can stand much abuse without retaliation, but it is a powerful means of stimulating memory and habit impulses and sexual arousal. Dreadful consequences follow when the sense of taste or touch is overtaxed. How easy it is, when catering to the palate, to overeat or to make unhealthful choices in food, which causes disease and hastens death. How easy it is, when enslaved by desires of the flesh, to suc- cumb to physical temptations and indiscretions that bring ill health, satiety, social ostracism, matrimonial disaster—all manner of baneful consequences. God created infinite Bliss to attract man back to his true soul-nature; Satan created the sexual pleasure of the flesh, the stron- gest urge in man, along with self-preservation, to keep him infatuated with his mortal existence. 504"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"The misuse of Nature's law of procreation can be overcome, not by hypocritical suppression, but only by moderation in marriage and by self-control and abstinence by the unmarried, and by joyous con- tact with God in meditation. When the joy of God, felt in meditation with stillness of thoughts and breath, remains continuously in the soul, physical temptation is subdued in a natural way through contrast with this higher consciousness of divine Bliss. So it is right for the devotee to pray to God, \"Do not put before my weak impulses the temptations of Your cosmic maya .\" Delusive sensory temptations are like seeds, and weak mental impulses are their favorite soil. When the seeds of temptation are in a fertile mind, they begin to grow. Bu t if they are dried up by wisdom and the realization of God as th e only reality, latent material desires will lose their com- pelling power. Man is surrounded by fascinations that lure his interest and cloud his reason. No one is safe from giving in to wrong influences in a weak moment until all desires and habits of the past that are grooved in the brain cells are cauterized. The influence of those habits and impulses is very strong. When man submits to them he renounces his free will and good judgment. He should refuse subjugation. Until man is free from compulsions, he cannot trust himself. He acts like an automaton, moving to the remote-control influence of his immediate environment and the company he keeps as they arouse his own innate latent tendencies. Of course, a person may become good or bad due to his own free choice, but in most cases his behavior and habits can be ascribed to prenatal causes or hidden postnatal effects of actions. The Hindu scriptures teach that it is difficult to get away from the effects arising from physical, mental, moral, or spiritual errors made in this life or in past lives. The results of good and bad actions are stored in the superconscious and subconscious minds as seed tenden- cies, samskaras, ready to germinate and grow when the specific suit- able opportunity arrives. That is why man should ask the Maker of cosmic delusion to pro- tect him from temptation: \"Lead us not into places and conditions where our karmic impulses coincide with the temptations of the evils of the world. Lead us into the joyous experience of Thy contact.\" Can- dlelight becomes lost in the light of the sun; the flicker of sense plea- sures disappears in the conflagration of ecstasy. \"O Lord, let us not be 505"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"blinded by the proximity of the light of sense temptation so that we fail to see Thy divine effulgence spread silently over the universe.\" Though God allows the relativities of maya as necessary to the ex- istence of creation, it is up to man to decide whether to side with the temptations of evil or the better temptation of God's presence. Each per- son has to fight his personal battles in the war between his reason and sense impulses, to see which will win. To foolishly yield to the forces of temptation is to lose sovereignty over the kingdom of one's life. Saints are sinners who never gave up. They never gave up rejecting the temp- tations of the world while continuing to tempt themselves with the greater joy of God. \"I weighed Thee and temptation and found Thee more tempting than temptation.\" One must be convinced in his heart and know he loves God more than temptation; then he will find God. The ordinary person does not see, except in an objective way, the fierce resistance of Satan against the magnetic attraction of goodness and God. The devil has been known to manifest in form to tempt great saints who near liberation, but this conscious force knows it requires no such theatrics to catch the average man or the striving devotee— little subtle temptations usually suffice. The person who is trying to avoid temptation will find it suddenly \"coincidental\" that persons and opportunities seem to appear out of nowhere to conspire to take him from his determined path of self-control. For every goodness and virtue, Satan has an equal storehouse of counteracting agents. God created forgiveness; Satan created revenge. God created calmness, fearlessness , unselfishness, spirit of brother- hood, peace, love, understanding, wisdom, and happiness, and for each of these Satan created its psychological opposite of restlessness, fear, greed, individual and material selfishness, war, hate; anger, re- venge, and jealousy instead of understanding; ignorance in place of wisdom; and sorrow to destroy happiness. Conscience, the voice of God, always beckons man to do right. Temptation, the voice of Satan, coaxes him to do wrong. The existence of this host of evils is the reason Jesus prayed: \"Thy kingdom come,\" that man might use his independence to act rightly and thereby substitute the kingdom of God for the anarchy of evil. By perfected living, man helps to make God's heaven from Satan's earthly imperfections, effecting God's patterns to nullify the evil designs of Sa- tan. The power of Satan is transient; the reign of God—His kingdom and power and glory—is forever. 506"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"\"For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses\" (Matthew 6:14-15). * HPhe Divine Father patiently forgives all the bad actors in His cos- A mic drama; and ultimately, through their better behavior, He re- ceives them into His blessedness. When man expresses his higher Self and likewise forgives others their wrong actions against him, he cleanses his heart of harmful caustic feelings—without which no heal- ing from hurt can take place. Even when possessed with power to re- taliate, man should refrain from vindictive feelings, notwithstanding an obligation to resist or noncooperate with evil in a proper way and time. To do what one can to prevent or halt evil is necessary, but it should not be motivated by revenge. It is the function of the Divine Law to mete out just punishment of evildoers and enemies.f When one receives praise and kindness from someone, it is easy for him to smile and respond warmly; it is when one is hurt that his spiritual character is tested. That is the time to practice forgiveness. It will not do to say, \"Oh, no, I don't mind your slapping me,\" but in- side seethe with vengeful thoughts. It is what one feels that matters; while one should not be a doormat, it is inner control that counts. To know that God is in all, and to forgive the deluded wrongdoers through whom God is trying, albeit as yet unsuccessfully, to express Himself, is to be a master. \"One should forgive, under any injury,\" says the Mahabharata. \"It hath been said that the continuation of the species is due to man's being forgiving. Forgiveness is holiness; by forgiveness the universe is held together. Forgiveness is the might of the mighty; forgiveness is sacrifice; forgiveness is quiet of mind. Forgiveness and gentleness are the qualities of the Self-possessed. They represent eternal virtue.\" *See also parallel verses in Mark 11:25-26 in Discourse 35. t \"Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves...for it is written, 'Vengeance is Mine; I will repay,' saith the Lord\" (Romans 12:19). 507"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"\"Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad coun- tenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast.

And when, passing the portals of the grave, he loses all that he has most valued, what grief will possess him when he will not even be able to remain in the glory of heaven, but will be drawn back to this mortal plane to begin again his pursuit of unfin- ished desires. What little time man has on this earth, he spends thinking and planning to get the things he wants; when one desire is satisfied he be- gins to chase after something else. Like a dog hitched to a cart with a sausage hanging out in front on a pole, he pulls an ever-increasingly burdensome life as a slave to his cravings, always thinking, \"I will be happy when I get this thing, or that thing.\" When will that day come? Be happy now, this minute! As soon as the thought of God comes in the mind, grasp it with devotion, strengthen and enliven it by making all other desires subservient. Jesus renounced everything because he had that immortal prosperity in God which no earthly condition could corrupt nor thief could steal. It is perfecting oneself in spirituality that brings real happiness here and in the life hereafter. What else did Jesus have in mind when he exhorted people to lay up for themselves treasures in heaven by be- ing virtuous on earth?

Man's arrogance of self-sufficiency belies his desire to be more powerful than his mortal limitations. By a mere thought or wish he cannot \"add one cubit unto his stature.\" God's laws can be made to work for the benefit of man, but those laws cannot be transcended ex- cept by God Himself and devotees who are one with Him. Man is directly sustained by God and the abundance of nature, and indirectly by his earning capacity and physical efforts. Not by all human care can man maintain himself without the help from God, He who is the Maker of Life and the Creator of sunlight, grain, water, and air, which support human life. But because man does his share to ac- quire the use of God-given things, he soon forgets the direct Divine Hand in human existence. Man cannot make grain, though he wields God's laws to propagate it; nor can he make the power of digestion to assimilate food, nor the life force that transforms the grain chemicals into his cellular tissues. Yet man is so solicitous of the wants of his body that he ornaments it and seeks to grant its every whim, seldom if ever considering that without the inherent Divinity, all he embel- lishes is a clod of earth. \"Consider the lilies of the field,\" how they are attired by God with ethereal fragrance and beauty, even though they make no con- scious effort to spin their petaled clothing, nor feverishly toil to main- tain and enhance themselves. \"Even Solomon in all his glory,\" with his earthly powers and elegant royal robes, could not look so graceful and divine as the naive lilies clothed by God. The Creator, who has power over all things big and small, will certainly clothe with the power of divine magnetism to attract at will what is needed when man, made in His image, corrects his deficiency of faith in the immortal powers within him as a direct descendant of God. It is delusion that causes man to doubt tha t God will remember to care for him. \"O ye of little faith,\" see how God clothes the grasses with green attire for their short span of life, so soon to be withered by the fiery sun or burnt as fuel in ovens.

To \"seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righ- teousness\" is to concentrate on the Eternal Life, the source of all lives, and to express the glory of that immortality in all interactions with the world. Great scientists and literary savants also take care of the necessi- ties of life, but their minds remain mostly engrossed in the subjects in which they have specialized. Similarly, as Jesus himself demonstrated, the divine man maintains his body as the temporary home of the im- mortal soul and fulfills all of his God-given responsibilities, but his consciousness is firmly centered in God. The ordinary man thinks only of food, possessions, and pleasure—that is all he pursues. Under the smoke screen of materiality he has totally hidden God from his per- ception, cutting himself off from life's invigorating Source, depleting his happiness and draining dry the truly satisfying divine joys that inhere in his soul. To acquire everything needful with the mind rest- ing principally on God is the sure way to happiness. To go after in- flated \"necessities\" in a state of God-forgetfulness will certainly lead to misery. No matter how much the worldly man acquires, he never fully en- joys his situation; for he is never satisfied, is always looking for some- thing more, or is afraid of losing what he has. The Western nations, at the height of industrial civilization, gorged with materiality, have not succeeded in producing a society free of depression and discon- tentment. Houses, money, automobiles may be necessary to modern existence; but if man does not also give some time to God and medi- tation, the formula of his life will be missing the catalyst necessary to produce true happiness. Unless one seeks the kingdom of God and es- tablishes within himself its righteousness, peace, joy, and wisdom, the contrasts of pleasure and sorrow in his life will foment inner discon- tentment, unbalance, and physical and spiritual deficiencies.

It is possible with practice to hold the major portion of one's mind on God while one's hands and external attention are performing ser- viceful material duties and enjoying those many material things that express the goodness of God in creation, and with which He intended His children be entertained. Certainly for the masses, that is a better way of living, the happy medium of a yogi's life—to live in the world for God, rather than becoming a monk (the high, consecrate path for which only the minorit y are well-suited), or at the other extreme en- gaging in the abandon of a sybarite.* In the context o f these verses, Jesus was especially addressing his disciples to exhort them to set for mankind an example of living for God and not for the body and its worldly kingdom.

Though Jesus counseled his disciples in a literal sense of re- nunciation, he meant the spirit of his words to apply to the lives of all believers: Seek ye God first.

History shows that in every clime and age, the smartest, wealthiest individuals, with all their thought and effort and wit to acquire material success, have from time to time been made to wallow in the mire of poverty through the naive decree of fate. Wars, depression, failed ventures, political an- archy, natural disasters, can instantly alter the fortune of the fortunate. But the man who keeps his mind principally concentrated upon the Almighty Giver of all things will never be left destitute (unless it is a temporary test brought about by his personal karma) even in the worst of conditions that might come along. It is all right to struggle to gain financial and material advantages, provided God is remembered as the Giver and that accrued good for- tune becomes a means of rendering service and upliftment to others as well as to oneself. Those who have wealth by inheritance and need not labor for sustenance could well use that free time in cultivating their spiritual life—through meditation to achieve God-communion, good works that aid individuals and mankind as a whole, and in general el- evating one's own consciousness to express God's righteousness. Alas, the rich who give only a token genuflection to God do not realize their spiritual poverty. Those who luxuriate in wantonness foolishly spend their unique opportunity in the most insecure happiness. It is a poor investment of the favorable fruits of good karma that those who have the necessities of life, as do the majority of persons in materially ad- vanced Western nations, think first of breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and how much money to make in order to better clothe and house themselves and have a good time—relegating God to an occasional Sunday morning church service. To be always in-  - tent on the gifts of God, rather than on the Giver, Spiritual attitude to- ys extremely wrong.   ward the material If one's whole life is based on the comfort of needs of the body the flesh, coddling the little body, how can one know divine happiness?

It is a delusion by which one becomes more and more attached to his physical existence. The worst habit of man is that he thinks of himself as a mortal body; that thought, being uppermost in his mind, keeps him away from God more than anything else. Many saints think of the body as merely a useful animal under their care—Saint Francis of Assisi used to refer to his body as Brother Donkey. It must be cared for, but not so much worried about. When a disciple in the ashram would bother too much about the body, my guru Sri Yukteswarji would say crypti- cally, \"Throw the dog a bone.\" If the body eats a little, all right. If it sleeps a little, all right. The more one fusses about it, the more de- mands it will make. One should do his duties to the body and forget it. Remember, we are sons of God; we are not the body. Weeks and months at a time the saints are hardly conscious of their bodies, but conscious of God always. In the nectared sustenance of ecstasy with God is life and health. Jesus had not all the hygienic conveniences of modern life. He kept his consciousness free from such imperatives. Without being senselessly rash, one should learn to depend more on mind. It does not mean fanaticism, but more exercise of that mar- velous God-given power. Mind power makes it possible for God to provide directly one's needs. Mind power and faith go hand in hand. One who possesses a firm conviction that God's power can heal can more readily avail himself of mental and spiritual healing. A person who feels dependent on the care of a doctor should have faith in the power of God working through medical science. Persons who believe only in material methods of health and sustenance find after a while that their will is paralyzed. But those who depend more on the mind discover that therein lies the infinite power of God. That power is pure and strong and limitless and instant. As long as the mind accepts the sensation of hunger and other physiological functions, one cannot say that all is delusion and ignore physical needs. Is it not better then to eat the things that are good for the body instead of those that are harmful? If one could live solely on cosmic energy, then it would not matter. But as long as the body changes according to its nourishment, why shouldn't man save God the trouble of healing him by obeying His laws that lessen the chance of his getting sick? There is no sin in that. A person simply should not be so conscious of food and comforts that he cannot be God-conscious. 522"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"Until one is no longer bound by any of the effects of the law of duality, maya, matter does exist as more than an illusion in the mind. That is the practicality of yoga. It provides the means for actually re- alizing that the body and mind are a dream of God, and that He alone is caring and providing for this manifestation of His consciousness. Ordinary man is obsessed with the limitations of his physical body and its afflictions of disease, suffering, pain, heartaches. But on the inner side of the body are the subtle centers of spiritual con- sciousness, with their untold powers and realization of the divine Self. When in meditation the mind follows the stream of inner conscious- ness, the devotee enters the supernal \"kingdom of God\" that exists be- hind physical manifestations. That is why Jesus said, \"Behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\"* In devotional interiorization, the meditator experiences true communion with God in the actual per- ception of His presence as light, wisdom, love, bliss. The constant desire for health and prosperity, the fulfillment of which is the focus of so many modern religious movements, is the way to slavery. First seek God, and then find health and prosperity through Him. When a soul, instead of seeking material things and becoming a mortal beggar who receives only a beggar's pittance, seeks first to re- turn to the kingdom of God-consciousness and once again becomes a true child of God, he receives, without asking, the heavenly share of his divine birthright. Of course, just blind belief in the kingdom of God will not suf- fice; nor will halfhearted prayers or a few good works. Neither will a lifetime of seeking the divine kingdom without receiving it bring the bounty of blessings promised Right way of seeking by Jesus. The right way of seeking is through the God's kingdom: yoga God-given yoga science of entering the kingdom of science of meditation God within, the technique of God-contact in which the sages of India have specialized. When ecstatic communion with God is an established fact, then the devotee will know that with the acquirement of the Celestial Kingdom, all things are within his reach. Jesus had that ultimate realization and could say: \"I and my Father are One.\" That is how he could feed five thousand people with two fishes and five loaves of bread, and could re-create his body after death—achievements that no scientist has yet duplicated. Jesus had *Luke 17:21 (see Discourse 61). 523"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"God first, so he had power over life and death, destiny, and all conditions. Man's mortal efforts are bound by the laws of cause and effect; he cannot get more than he deserves. All his life he may make the effort to become a millionaire; but he may never get there, because the at- tainment of earthly goals is fraught with limitations and obstructions —karmic and environmental. But for the devotee who approaches God first, limitations are surmounted. By the method of mortal begging from Providence, no human being can ever fulfill all his proliferous de- sires; but by first realizing his oneness with God, man can receive every- thing he needs, with a sense of complete satisfaction. He will not even need to pray, to supplicate or beg, for as a Self-realized son of God he will have everything his Father has. So is it not best to know by visu- alization and affirmation, an d above all by realization born of divine contact in meditation, that one is already perfect in health and wisdom and abundance, rather than try to succeed by begging for these neces- sities of life? The wonder of man's relationship with his Heavenly Father is that he does not even have to acquire God. He has Him already. As soon as the veil of maya is pulled away, he knows instantly that God is with him. Each mortal being has in his heart a terrible hunger for happiness, love, peace, joy, the mastery of life, immortality. When one sees the will-o'-the-wisp nature of these longings in delusive Christ's way to happi- matter, and the troubles in life encountered in pur- ness: seeking God suing them, how can anyone desire anything but within and keeping God? That desire by which one is first brought to material life simple the spiritual path is the desire that should be ful- filled. The Self in every being is of God, and so long as man does not express that inner divinity, becoming like Him in whose image he is made, his existence is going to be fraught with un- ending pains and disappointments. Why not remember the counsel of Jesus to seek the kingdom of supreme happiness first? One will then no longer have to suffer rude surprises throughout life. The masters of India similarly say: \"To become one with the Supreme Being is to have destroyed all the roots of suffering.\" That is real freedom. As long as God gives man life, he has an obligation to give some of that time to God. The hour will come when one's time is up; let it not have to be viewed with sadness at having been wasted.

Where is the time for God if it is spent in constant fussing to satisfy the body's wants for what I have termed \"unnecessary necessities\"? Rather simplify life and use that saved time in meditation for God-communion and real progress in attaining life's necessary necessities of peace and happiness. Real Christ-living should consist in seeking the comfort of medi- tation first and in also keeping material life simple while attending to one's dutiful activities. A complex material life is only pleasing to the eyes and the status consciousness of the ego, but few realize \"what price material comforts.\" Economic slavery, nervousness, business worries, unfair competition, dissensions, lack of freedom, disease, mis- ery, old age, and death are the harvest of a materially compacted ex- istence. So much is missed when there is no time left for the appreci- ation of beauty, Nature, and God's many expressions in life. If anybody remonstrates to me that material happiness is better than godly happiness, or that attention given to God can come later, it is revolting to me. Such rationalization is of delusion. One needs to get his mind settled in knowing God as the highest priority, and to master his life accordingly. When he is able through meditation and communion with God to carry a portable heaven within, he will know how to guide his life correctly. Once he has a mind that does not wa- ver from God, whatever he does will be all right, not before. Jesus knew that when one is committed to the obligations of a material life, God flies out the back door of that person's consciousness. Thus his counsel to first strengthen one's spiritual consciousness so that no en- gagement in the world can take the mind away from God. The spiritual path may be difficult until the devotee reaches the final goal; but so is the way hewed by the material man. In fact, the latter is much more difficult. Unless one has God-realization, he is still in delusion, in between two factors. On one side, love of the material pleasures of one's life, and on the other side, love of God. Love of life is annexed to miseries and death. In youth, one does not realize this, being wholly engaged in the abandon of discovering new experiences. But as the aging process of the bodily machine begins to exert a toll, the eyes begin to grow dim, the voice does not register resonant vi- brations, the joints begin to creak, and the corrosive effects of disease require constant repair; one then says, \"Well, life isn't the free ride I thought it was.\" 525"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"Relatively speaking, there is very little happiness in this world, only snatches of transient pleasure for the most part. I do not mean to paint a dark picture, but to urge those who want more from life to make themselves so spiritually strong within that it will serve as a di- vine bulwark against assaults of sorrow and suffering. As long as the mind wanders haphazardly between spiritual in- centives and worldly temptations, that course will be futile in produc- ing spiritual happiness. Those who want the world, and place their faith in things that do not last, are like puppets, dancing on strings of their impulses and karma, any time to be taken away by death. Divine happiness is easier to get for it does not depend on life's fickle doles; and it is everlasting. No comparison with any rich man will be able to make the spiritually wealthy feel poor; for they know they are the rich- est of the rich in the kingdom of God and His righteousness within. A master is one who understands in what lies his highest interest; he lives the words of Christ that we came on earth not for this mate- rial life, but for God. Delusive offerings are only the test of God, a learning experience to bring out the divinity of the soul. Man is not meant to remain in delusion, mesmerized by its chiaroscuro into think- ing it is impractical to seek God, or that there is no time to do so be- cause of the urgent impositions of other pursuits. Suppose God says, \"I won't beat in your heart; I have more important things to do!\" Where would man be then? Why waste time, when in a moment's no- tice one will be dragged out of the body? While others sleep, be awake in God-communion in meditation; and work for Him in the daytime, performing all duties with the thought of Him. If the desire is there, one can make time to spend with God. The body and mind are the soul's precious instruments; they should be kept well and strong to aid one's efforts to find God. But it should be remembered all the while that there is a superior joy hidden behind the sensory experiences of the body. The awakening man should use his life to realize this truth. It is the guiding principle that has produced saints in every religion. Man did not come into this world of himself, by himself, or for himself; that is why when he works for his own material desires and selfish ends they will always lead him to disappointment. One person wants a luxury home, and then gets sick and cannot enjoy it. Another, weary of nervous stress, seeks the quiet and solitude of a desert resi- dence, and then gets lonely there, nagged by desires that only city life 526"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"can grant. It is best to give all one's desires to God; and as Jesus ad- jured, \"Seek ye God first....\" Be content with what God brings, and be busy every minute doing good and becoming good. This is the solutio n for every truly fulfilled existence, not only for spiritually minded people; because God alone, and \"His righteous- ness,\" is the sole Source of all tantalizing glimmers of real happiness. It is the foundation of the many commandments given by Jesus: \"Ye who are wise, ye who are thinkers, seek God first; for to find Him is to open the doo r to all His gifts of health, power, financial sufficiency, wisdom. God is no miser willfully withholding His everythingness from His children. Man has but to learn how to receive.\" It pleases God when His children seek Him. He is hurt when they run away from Him to play with earth's baubles, like spoiled children forgetful of the Giver. The virtuous child conscientiously seeks out the Giver to offer Him a loving, appreciative heart. No matter the diffi- culties, the devotee persists sincerely, alive to the fact that he must know God, and mus t hear from Him—without throttling his own dis- criminative reason—the purpose of life. When that constancy charac- terizes the devotee's consciousness, then God will reveal Himself; but not until then. God is suffering in so many souls because of their disunion from Him. Though every mortal will have salvation—no one will be lost— one person may be near liberation while others will yet inflict on them- selves countless more incarnations. For whosoever wishes it delayed, it will be delayed; for those who wish to be redeemed, there is no ob- stacle that cannot be overcome. Desires have to be sublimated by proving to oneself that the supreme happiness is God. The devotee must absolutely convince himself of this. To take the long way to God by seeking satisfaction of desires first is a foolish way of thinking. But the devotee who meditates deeply every day, plunging his conscious- ness in devotion and yearning for God, who spends time with God at night if his day is too busy, who puts his whole heart and soul into seeking God, will surely find Him. During the busy-ness of the day, the true God- seeker spiritualizes all actions with the thought of Putting God first in Him. He learns t o keep the mind most of the time one's daily life at the Christ center, the Kutastha center of the yogi, and finds the Infinite Christ pouring over his consciousness wave af- ter wave of quiet heavenly joy. \"He who watcheth Me always, him do 527"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"I watch. He never loses sight of Me, nor do I lose sight of him. He looks at Me through the niches of space, and I behold him through the pores of the sky.\"* When the devotee puts his mind on God, he will see that out of the invisible, out of the unseen skies, a perceptible Presence will speak to him. It is possible to talk to God. His voice can be heard in words, as well as through intuitive feeling, if the devotee loves Him deeply enough and refuses to give up. The desire for His re- sponse must be with all one's heart. Whenever there is trouble or unhappiness, the highest recourse is to think of God steadily; just as the needle of a compass points north- ward, no matter which way the compass is turned, so must the mind be on God no matter what conditions prevail from moment to mo- ment. There is a God of love and compassion who steals silently into the consciousness, seen only through the ever increasing light of de- votion. Have faith in Him; He is ever present. None of the wonders of creation could happen without His omnipresent intelligence. This divine intelligence is the evidence, the trademark, of God—in the tree, in the flower, in the skies, in the moon, in the routine of the seasons, in one's life-supporting bodily system. How can one observe the work- ings of the intelligent universe and doubt the existence of God? But no one can find God without continuous love for Him in the heart. To feel that love for God, one must practice it. It is unproduc- tive to analyze and magnify one's defects and troubles. It is enough just to tell God, \"Lord, You are the Divine Healer of all maladies; I give myself into Your charge. You are not only my doctor, but my compassionate mother, my wise father, my Creator-God. You cannot forsake me because You made me Your child. Naughty or good, I am Your loving child. Be with me.\" There is nothing greater than the love of God. If a devotee has found that, his work in the school of life is finished. Until then, precious time should not be wasted. Meditate daily, deeply; and work for God, performing all duties as offerings to Him. Never give up. To the testimony of Lord Jesus, I humbly add my own: In all my life, I have never found God not to satisfy my needs or to grant my wishes. He sometimes makes me think He will not re- spond, but suddenly I find there is fulfillment—even more than I * \"He who perceives Me everywhere and beholds everything in Me never loses sight of Me, nor do I ever lose sight of him\" (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita vi:3o). 528"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"could have hoped for. This is not to say that God gives what we pray for if we just sit idly and wait for Him to manifest for us whatever we have requested of Him. He expects us to do our part; He makes us work—sometimes with great difficulty—to create the right conditions and opportunities for fulfillment. Then through Divine Grace, His an- swer to our legitimate prayers comes to pass. It isn't that I want \"things\" from God, but just to know He is with me. I have said to Him: \"I do not ask for things from You, but when I see what You give to me, knowing my heart and my needs, I rejoice in that gift because of Your own hand behind the giving of it.\" I used to ask God for things for the work He has given me to do, but I see I don't need to ask now. I have merely to think and His hand is there. I only ask for His grace: \"Give Yourself to me.\" In the be- ginning, the devotee will find it is then that God becomes silent. That is the hardest prayer for God to satisfy: \"If I give Myself, I have noth- ing left.\" When God gives Himself to the devotee, He has given every- thing— His ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss, Love, Wis- dom— oneness with Spirit in which the mystery of life is no more. Vanished is the duality of the multiplicity in the Indivisible Unity in the devotee's awakening from the Cosmic Dream. With the realization that all things are of God—all things are His dreaming consciousness —comes the consummate fulfillment of the words of Jesus that hav- ing Him, whatsoever shall be needful for one's role in the cosmic drama \"shall be added unto you.\" That state of oneness with God is granted by Him only when He is convinced the devotee does not want anything else. As long as there will be a single desire in the heart for other than God, then even though He will be near the devotee, He will not be fully manifest to him. While waiting patiently for there to be room in the devotee's heart for the giv- ing of Himself, He continues lovingly to grant the devotee's simple, le- gitimate prayers: \"Lord, although I have to satisfy a few material de- sires to get along as a mortal being, still in my heart there is only You. As Your child, O Lord, I have no desire, because I already have You; and as You have everything, so have You bequeathed that divine in- heritance to me.\" When the devotee with that devotion seeks Him and lives righteously, he cannot fail in his God-seeking. Jesus then summarized: \"Take therefore no thought for the mor- row: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Suffi- cient unto the day is the evil thereof.\" If the devotee lives with God 529"},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"each day, He who guides the destiny of the world, including the lives of His children, will plan the morrow for the divine seeker according to his acts of today.

W hatever judgment one gives out, the same will he attract. In this passage Jesus enunciates that cause-and-effect mechanism of the karmic law as a sort of moral threat to those who mercilessly ex- pose the faults of others, that their own faults similarly will be brought into the light of harsh scrutiny. In the same spirit in —  which one judges others, the divine law judges the Karmic consequences censurer—motivation, as well as the action itself, of being unkindly is an integral part of the cause-effect equation.  judgmental  Punishment or reward is not imparted by God either as an act of vengeance or of special favoritism; good and evil re- sults are the reflex outcome of good and evil actions. Since even God does not judge anyone's actions, having delegated that function to the impartial law of karma, by what right do small-minded humans pre- sume to do so? Those who are already judged and automatically sen- tenced by the karmic law for their misguided actions do not need to be criticized or condemned by anybody else. A person who misuses his free choice and opens himself to evil karmic effects needs sympathy in- stead of criticism. It pleases God when He beholds a spiritually fortu- nate individual trying to rescue an unfortunate brother who is being torn by the talons of the effects of bad actions. When He sees a soul helping another soul out of the entanglements of misery-making karma, He extends mercy and all-forgiving blessings by which the sympathetic soul finds himself free from many of the effects of his own direful karma. By the operation of the same cosmic law, to judge others cruelly is to attract malicious criticism upon oneself. If one peddles the weak- nesses of others, the divine law will mysteriously bring about the pub- licity of his own private faults. One who is tempted to cast aspersion on anyone else should first ask himself: \"Am I without error?\" Judge ye not others; judge and change yourself first. Cruel speech and behavior have their origin in cruel thoughts. If one is constantly unkind, it means his mind is a harbor for unkind thoughts. According to the psychological law of habit, the more one gives mental space to mean thoughts the more he will accustom him- self to being mean-spirited, exciting and angering others by his un- conscionable behavior, and thereby attracting unkindness to himself. 535"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"Hence, it is insidiously undesirable to entertain judgmental thoughts about others under any circumstances, lest such inward ugliness be- come an intransigent habit of meanness. He is foolish who makes him- self a chronic critic of others, for he draws to himself nothing but in- harmony from all sides. He is truly wise who knows when it is right to speak and when it is better to remain silent. There is a great deal of misconception about the ideal of being nonjudgmental versus one's duty to speak the truth. Discrimination is —— necessary. Once when I was lecturing in Trinity Au- The ideal of being ditorium in Los Angeles, someone came up to me nonjudgmental versus afterward and told me that while I was speaking one's duty to truth my assistant had left the book table to go and get a soda. I scolded the gossiper for petty tattling. On the other hand, suppose someone confides to a friend: \"I am going to let loose in John's room a rattlesnake. Now don't you tell him!\" Is it not the duty of the friend to inform John of the danger? Those who abide the evil of human snakes become like them. \"Judge not, that ye be not judged\" does not mean that if one over- looks the crimes of other people, his own illegal activities will be ex- cused. It is contrary to human law for one to conceal knowledge of the felonies of others, such as robbing or murdering. One who does is held liable for helping criminals to evade punishment. Likewise, \"condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned\" is not meant as a promise that obliviousness to others' faults somehow frees one from the karmic sentence of one's own. What Jesus meant is that one who is sympathetic to his fellows will attract the sympathy of oth- ers and God. If John tries to help Judas extricate himself from the mis- eries resulting from past evil actions, by giving him succor and guiding him to the path of righteousness, then according to the law of karma John will attract some advanced soul or souls who would help him es- cape having to endure the full burden of his own karmic recompense. \"For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged.\" \"What judgment\" signifies that judging is of different kinds: kind or cruel, al- truistic or self-serving, wise or ill-advised. The law of cause and effect, as articulated by Jesus in these verses, dictates that if one is used to judging others with kindness, and with the selfless motivation of be- ing helpful, he receives in return the same treatment from Truth, which secretly and judiciously governs the eventual outcome of all poten- tialities.

To warn others about the hazards of evil, based on one's own bitter experience, is good if it is done in private with the sole desir e of saving them from impending misery. To criti- cize others is hard enough on the recipients without hurting them— to no good purpose—by exposure, gossip, or malicious taunting. Self- appointed critics and informers have no right to expose others' faults publicly; it is a sin against God who dwells in the temple of the error- stricken as well as in the righteous. The stricken individual should be offered help in the form of wise counsel if such is requested, or in the form of the better example of one who is victorious over himself, or if totally belligerent he should be left alone to find his own spiritual remedy. In any case, one should never tell other people their faults in public—or even in private if they are unreceptive to being helped, un- less it is positively one's duty. In a family, it is the responsibility of the parents to guide and cor- rect the children's behavior, but there is no need to criticize in front of the whole household. Similarly, to those who ap-  - • proach a guru-preceptor for help in improving them- Right way to give cor- selves, the teacher generally speaks candidly but pri- rection and help oth- vately; and those in his spiritual family take such ers reform themselves correction in the spirit of love and respect in which it is given. Just as a human mother wants her children to be clean and upright in demeanor before others, so is the Divine Mother wanting Her devotees to be spiritually decorous and cleansed of unbecoming traits. If jealousy, touchiness, unkindness, selfishness, are not excised from one's nature, they fester like boils and attract the flies of biting criticism from others. It i s better that the psychological operation be done at home, or by the guru in the ashram, with kindness, love, and the high- est interest of the \"patient\" uppermost in mind. Even when punishment is justifiable, it should be administered to wrongdoers quietly and in a way that encourages them to try to re- form themselves. The court judge punishes criminals for the sake of all society, as well as for miscreants' own good, so that they will not 537"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"perpetrate further or greater crimes. The purpose of judgment should be curative only and not the revengeful retaliation of anger. To pun- ish wrongdoers just to satisfy wrath, or in order audaciously to hurt them or bring them to ridicule, or for any other wrong purpose, is evil. Cruel condemnation makes one forget that the sinner is but an error-stricken child of God whose divinity is eclipsed temporarily by ignorance. No one should be called a sinner; nor should anyone think of himself as a sinner. Hate the sin but not the sinner. The critic should treat the errant as he would hope to be treated for his own sinful mistakes. Those who are wrong do not need scornful kicks; they need a firm but loving hand extended to them. It is purposeless to rub the salt of acerbic criticism into others' character wounds. Give unto the erring the healing salve of proper sympathetic advice and ap- propriate support for any effort toward reformation. Give love to all, the only panacea that can redeem the world; that is the clarion call of Christ. When one does not condemn others but tries to help them with love, then God's laws, being conscious forces, will treat that caring person likewise. \"With the same measure that ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\" One who forgives others who have wronged him will attract forgiveness unto himself. One who gives mental and material help to others with a heart overflowing with kindness will find the same coming back to him. This is the law of action applied to human hearts: that whatever one feels for others remains vibrating in the ether, attracting a return, measure for measure, of sympathies and kindnesses. The giver of negligible love receives negligible love; the greathearted giver will find the fullness of love coming back to him, now or in the future—despite any appearances to the contrary. Even if one's noble actions are unrecognized by one's contemporaries, the law of action unerringly insures that they will be recognized by God in this life or the life beyond. Good actions, like good treasures, once stored in the mind may remain unused, but are never lost. The karmic reward is there for the soul to use when the necessity or opportunity arises. In telling man to forego uncharitable faultfinding, Jesus spoke pri- marily against sanctimonious judgment of human frailties—in partic- ular, sexual immorality, which often grips otherwise virtuous persons despite their willingness and intention to follow the injunctions of 538"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"moral rectitude. The physically compelling sex force is the result not only of metaphysical inheritance from fallen Adam and Eve, but also of bad prenatal past-life habits, which tend to influence heredity in forming the postnatal habits of an individual. That is why children are sometimes helplessly born with overstimulated appetites. The degen- erating influence of bad company and environment—especially in this permissive era of prurient novels, entertainment, and advertising—is also to blame. Some normally healthy persons habitually have little or no sex de- sire due to past-life moral habits; but that does not necessarily make them saints, for they may in other respects have a very wicked, insin- cere heart. Conversely, some otherwise very good individuals struggle day and night against the sex compulsion due to bad karma of past lives, or to inflammation or irritation of the nerves in the sex region, which may be caused by congestion of toxins in the system. Such suf- ferers should consult a physician, follow a healthful diet, and practice the technique of life-force control given by a true guru who has mas- tered every passion within himself and can teach the art of control by sublimation. A man who can match his will power against sex compulsion and win, and who can convince the mind that the peace and moral virility of the transmuting power of self-control is greater than sex indulgence, is a heroic conqueror of his lower self. A man who is innocent simply because of lack of exposure to temptation may harbor weakness and succumb when a sudden enticement arouses his dormant sexual in- stincts. Once stimulated by thought or action, sex is the most enslav- ing mortal habit and the most difficult sense desire to be controlled, regulated, and subjugated. Jesus knew that some immoral persons, though mentally desirous of ridding themselves of their carnality, are extremely weak in resist- ing temptations of the flesh. He helped such persons by wisdom and love, and taught against increasing their troubles by unkind criticism and condemnation. Persecution, gossip, commands, and taboos cannot remedy moral errors. There would be much less hypocrisy in the world if instead of tongue persecutions, persons were taught from childhood moral reme- dies, such as methods of self-control, right living, and proper hygiene, before they become the victims of evil through bad company and worldly influences. 539"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"Gossiping about the moral weaknesses of others is a wicked spir- itual crime. It breeds hypocrisy in social and individual life. How in- cisively Jesus made his point when he said: \"He that is without sin •  among you, let him first cast a stone.\"* One who The spiritual and psy- occupies his mind with an unholy interest in the chological dangers of moral weaknesses of others actually rouses and gossip  stimulates his own sleeping prenatal baser instincts. Gossip, even among well-meaning friends, never has a favorable effect on the person talked about; it ruffles him, makes him mad, steeped in despair, ashamed, and strengthens his in- tractable behavior. There is a proverb that says: \"The person who has lost one ear goes through the village at the side, showing the villagers his one good ear and hiding the lost ear. But he who has lost both ears goes through the center of the village, because he cannot hide his disfigurement from anyone.\" Any person whose moral errors are un- duly exposed becomes desperate and shameless, like the man who lost both ears; he flaunts a devil-may-care attitude and makes no effort to be better. When persons lose face as a result of gossip about their faults, they also lose the desire and incentive to change. (Of course, in rare cases, just the fear of exposure and publicity keeps some peo- ple good.) A small weakness in a person, once publicized, tends to grow in notoriety—if not in fact—proportionate to the attention given to it. Worldly minds are morbid; they thrive on sensationalism and often distort the facts or exaggerate the words of others, or repeat them out of context with no charitable consideration of pertinent circumstances. A psychological defect common to most human beings is to repeat negative reports about the faults of another without having first given the accused person a chance to disprove the allegations. Never be drawn into psychological muddles. My Master used to say, when anyone would approach him confidentially with some sup- posedly scandalous disclosure: \"If it is not something I can repeat to everyone, I don't wish to hear it.\" If someone has a grievance about another, or thinks he knows a secret about him, he should confront that person directly, or keep silent, rather than maligning the alleged wrongdoer for the love of gossip or impelled by an uncontrolled habit of indiscriminate talkativeness. *John 8:7 (see Discourse 35). 540"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"Gossip seems to act like a stimulating tonic. Those who crave this titillation should satisfy that lust by loudly publicizing all the private sins they themselves have committed. They would find such disclosure unendurable even for one minute! A person who himself cannot stand such scrutiny should not in any way rejoice in exposing others. To re- veal the moral weaknesses of others and bring to them senseless dis- comfiture is not the way of the wise. Unscrupulous sensationalism is typical of many Western newspa- pers; they are uncharitable in their attitude because they are not heal- ers of immorality, but rather scandalmongers. A spiritual crime is com- mitted by journalists and publications that love to pickle gossip or to spice up reporting in order to sell more papers by catering to the de- graded taste of gossip-loving readers. Internal criticism is the malignant twin of verbal criticism. To seethe silently with critical thoughts is very foolish, creating disturbing vibrations that affect one's inner peace and are a subtly unpleasant ef- fluence affecting persons around him. It is best to clean the mind of such negation. To be constantly judgmental is a sad —— misuse of man's God-given capacities of intelligence Be not inwardly criti- and discrimination. The wise person observes neu- cal of others; practice trally, allowing no acrimonious feelings to distort his healthy self-criticism perceptions of truth. To critique one's fellow beings in a spirit of intolerance or gloating over their faults is to call forth God's judgment: \"In the light of My wisdom, I find no mortal perfect; and if I were to judge according to human standards of criticism, everyone who breathes My air of maya would be found wanting.\" \"Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,\" said Jesus, \"but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\" Man's task on earth is to keep busy expunging from his own consciousness the original temptation inherited from Adam and Eve. It is a psycho- logical and metaphysical error to spend time in pointing out the men- tal dirt in others instead of cleaning out the dirt in the mansion of one's own soul. The would-be reformer of others' behavior must live wisely himself before h e can accurately discern how to plant wisdom in the lives o f those persons prone to misdeeds. Critical people lack humility and therefore cannot themselves take criticism. Self-elected judges of others quite conveniently forget to scrutinize their own inner weaknesses. They think that they are all 541"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"right because they magnify the faults of others to lessen the magnitude of their own. It is insidious to hide behind such a misconceived men- tal smoke screen. Insincerity and hypocrisy mar the character of one who does not care to overcome his weakness, yet professes hatred for such weakness. If he delights in tearing apart persons who suffer from the same personality flaws he possesses, he is a sadist and a coward, hiding his own defects behind sneers of criticism. The irony is that unscrupulous people who love to castigate oth- ers about their faults usually possess the same faults themselves. Whatever annoys a person most in someone else may often be found festering within himself. Becaus e such persons cannot look honestly at themselves without devastating feelings of guilt, they find satisfac- tion in scathing others to vent their frustration and snidely hide, some- times even from themselves, their own reprehensibility. There are short-tempered people who themselves cannot stand anger in anyone else; those who are greedy, but cannot abide greed in others. Some people have bad social manners, yet disdain lack of decorum in boor- ish persons. One renounces the moral right to chastise others about the self-same faults that haunt oneself. There is little effect in a liar admonishing a liar; or in a confirmed immoralist passing judgment on immoral persons. One who presumes to correct manifestations of ignorance in oth- ers should with equal zeal excise all ignorance from within himself. When one has acquired wisdom he will better perceive how to remove ignorance from the lives of those he wishes to help. Action and ex- ample will speak louder than his words. That is why Jesus said: \"First cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.\" The example set forth by Jesus is to change oneself. As one saint of India said: \"Wanted: Reformers—not of others, but of themselves.\"* As one changes himself, others around him are also changed. The salu- tary effects of this law can be seen in the transformed and transforming lives of all great masters. To make a habit of analyzing people is spiritually profitless; and it also makes the critic unpleasant company. It is better, as Jesus *Swami Ram Tirtha (1873-1906), well-known lecturer and poet. A musical arrange- ment of his poem \"Marching Light\" was included by Paramahansa Yogananda in his Cosmic Chants (published by Self-Realization Fellowship). 542"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"taught, to become like little children: guileless, calm, humbly sincere.* One who mentally dissects and analyzes the botanical properties of a flower misses a full appreciation of its beauty. But one who focuses on how beautiful that flower is, allowing one's intuitive feeling to respond to its pure essence, enjoys fully its loveliness. There are times, of course, when it is prudent, even necessary, to use discrimination to find out the character of a person before enter- ing into a close relationship or exchange—either personal or in busi- ness, and certainly before giving one's trust to one who purports to be a guru or spiritual teacher.f Otherwise, one should simply appreciate the gardens of flowering good qualities in human souls, leaving the tending of unlovely egoistic weeds and withered plants to those re- sponsible for those fields — unless one is a qualified and duly com- missioned spiritual gardener. Effective analysis of one's associates requires clear-sightedness with some intuitive perception. Persons of emotional nature, without a ballast of wisdom, are likely to be prejudiced by undependable feel- ings, precluding objective appraisal. Intellectual types are equally sus- ceptible to misunderstanding; owing to the activity of their hypersen- sitive imaginative rationalization of every nuance of behavior, they often impute wrong meanings to others' motives and actions. Such persons should balance reason with empathy, understanding that every individual life is difficult, complex, and as deserving of sympathy as their own. It is human nature to make broad allowances for one's own mistakes and shortcomings; certainly similar tolerance and under- standing should be extended to others. One should not open himself up to just anybody or everybody to critique his behavior or character. The opinions of those who are not qualified to criticize, especially those who carp and condemn in order to create disharmony or simply for the perverse pleasure it affords them, should be little noted or ignored altogether. There are two ways to disarm undeserving critics: to be abjectly indifferent to them, or to be lovingly indifferent to them. The latter is better. If one has the fault of which he is accused, no matter the source of accusation, he need not blatantly announce or confirm the disclosure of his fault, but qui- * \"Verily I say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 18:3). See Discourse 47. tSee pages 550 ff. : \"Beware of false prophets....\" 543"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"etly and positively remove it from within himself. If the accusation is false, he should vehemently deny it, without argumentation and with- out being wrathful or disturbed. It is not necessary to let anyone know about one's private faults or past failings, except if someone is quali- fied to give help in cases where outside intervention is needed. Psy- chological privacy of one's thoughts is a God-given privilege; why sup- ply \"ammunition\" that might fall into the hands of unconscionable persons who enjoy misusing such information? To conceal one's faults that harm no one but oneself is not hypoc- risy so long as one tries sincerely and mightily to rectify those flaws and thus save himself from the crucifixion of condemnation and spir- itual impotency. How many young people would have matured into better adults if society had not forced hypocrisy on them as a way of getting ahead. Hypocrites take pleasure in their gains acquired by pos- ing as virtuous when they are not. Such people feel no repentance and never try to reform. They love the accolades they receive by deceiving others about themselves. Only the sincere, kind, wise, and perfectly balanced individual is fit to assess the virtues and vices of others. But Truth and God only, the Faultless Omniscience, can judge with absolute fairness. Man's judgment is conditional. God, who shares no base passions with man, is the Sole Impartiality in judging what is right. In His com- passion, He never criticizes anyone openly — only silently, through one's conscience. The voice of an unstifled conscience is louder than words, more penetrating than sermons of human reformers. God criticizes His erring children through their reason, through their sense of moral judgment, which is instinctive, and confirms it through their conscience. Introspection is a wonderful mirror in which to judge oneself. And even more accurate than that mirror is one's reflection in the mirror of a wise man's mind, or that of one's guru. In India, the mas- ters undertake the guidance of a disciple only if that person is willing to undergo the discipline required for spiritual transformation. It is of utmost benefit to see oneself in the light of the wisdom of a mas- ter, to strive to measure up to the standards of his precepts and ideals. One who corrects himself according to that clear-sighted appraisal will find himself magnetically attractive and widely influential; and, most importantly, pleasing in the sight of God. It was this flawless mirror Jesus held up to his disciples. His words of wisdom expressed 544"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"the perfection of soul qualities as the criteria to gauge their reflection; his divine example inspired their aspirations to become that perfect soul-image. To be able to stand criticism is a mark of spiritual strength. It is weakness to allow resentment to conquer one's feelings when criti- cized. To be able humbly to stand the barbs of criticism, just or un- just, and to make continuous effort to improve one's attitudes and be- havior when criticism is justified, will make one a saint. \"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you\" (Matthew 7:6). S piritual advice is of no avail to unappreciative persons who snap at their would-be helper with cynicism and derision. Just as swine would doltishly trample on pearls cast before them, so people who are deeply wallowing in worldly muck are insensitive to the wisdom gems of saints who speak of the priceless happiness of a self-controlled ex- istence. Attempts to reform with helpful sermons low-minded, con- firmed evil persons, or those with an intransigent mind-set, will likely be met with sneers and even attempted injurious antagonism. Jesus' advice means that wisdom should be accorded the esteem due to some- thing spiritually precious; it should neither be flaunted nor used as co- ercion. Similarly in the Bhagavad Gita the Lord mandates: \"Never voice these truths to one who is without self-control or devotion, nor to one who performs no service or does not care to hear, nor to one who speaks ill of Me.\"* Persons caught up in evil or nonunderstand- ing have no wish or intention to change and only laugh at lofty prin- ciples and ridicule those who propound them. Better it is to stay away from evil persons, and to remain reserved around the unreceptive. When an outstretched helping hand is slapped, it should be withdrawn for a time until the recipient is ready to accept it. One who gives sincerity that is not appreciated or is abused is casting away \"pearls\" uselessly; the wise reserve their spiri- tual treasure to benefit those who are receptive. * God Talks With Arjutia: The Bhagavad Gita XVIII:67. 545"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"\"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh re- ceiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. \"Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?

Jesus enjoined on man unswerving adherence to the path of virtue and morality, a course that all human beings must follow to evolve spiritually. He reiterated this in these verses, but also addressed his close disciples in a veiled metaphor. The \"strait gate\" and \"narrow way\" refer also to the gateway in the subtle astral center at the base of the spine, which opens into the astral spine's narrow, extremely fine pathway through which the life and consciousness ascend to the higher cerebrospinal centers of spiritual perception—the sole path to realization of God and union with Him.* Conversely, when life and consciousness flow downward through this spinal channel and are dispersed outwardly through delusion's wide gate of sensory perceptions, into body consciousness and its broad range of material actions and attachments, that is the way that \"lead- eth to destruction\"—forgetfulness of man's inherent divine nature.f \"Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's cloth- ing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

A warning to gullible Spiritual pretenders commit the highest sin against victims of unqualified God, using the Master of the Universe for personal spiritual teachers or monetary gain. Jesus describes such teachers as \"ravening wolves\" of evil, dressed \"in sheep's clothing\" of feigned humbleness and spirituality. The qualifications of a teacher cannot be accurately judged by his outer appearance of superficial behavior. Any man in religious garb may look holy, but he cannot hide a wicked heart; it must eventually come out in his practical dealings as wicked actions. As grapes cannot be gathered from a thorn bush or figs from thistles, so goodness cannot be reaped from a dissimulating evil indi- vidual, no matter how clever his guise of piety. Undiscerning persons may be duped; but God is not deceived, nor is the karmic law. One may argue that a beautiful lotus may be plucked from a murky pond, or that one may savor sweetmeats prepared by a person who himself subsists poorly on bowls of rice; or that one may even glean some profit by reading a good book written by an evil man. But it is an ineluctabl e truth that in spiritual matters, for ultimate realiza- tion and God-union, the shepherding of a \"false prophet\" will not do. The devotee needs to follow the path of a God-knowing person, cho- sen for him by God. A false prophet can never be a God-ordained guru, no matter how artfully he presumes such title. A false prophet is one who knows at heart his hypocrisy and moral weakness and yet professes goodness to attract and hold people who will follow him blindly for his own ends—financial and for gratification of his ego. A true guru will not bring any such evil or misguidance to his fol- lowers. He can be known by his humility, uprightness, and God- attunement evidenced by his ability to enter the elevated states of God- communion in superconsciousness, Christ consciousness, and cosmic consciousness. The signs of a true guru who can enter these states at will are as follows: his eyes are still and unwinking whenever he wants 551"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"them to be so; by the practice of yoga his heart and breath are quiet without his forcibly holding his breath in his lungs; his mind is calm without effort.

The true guru is a master, not of others, but of himself. Every false prophet in time is exposed and cut down by the axe of wise and just criticism and is cast into the fire of oblivion. By the fruits of a teacher's actions, which emanate from the tree of his inner thoughts, the discriminating devotee will know the difference between a good prophet or guru and a false one. The true guru may instruct a few persons or a great many, but his whole intention is to raise his dis- ciples to Christlike, Krishnalike, stature. A great prophet, or savior, is one who comes on earth as a special messenger to answer a specific need of mankind, and accordingly as- pires to reform a portion of mankind or to influence the entire popu- lace. Anyone who knows himself as only wicked, and yet outwardly makes a colossal claim to be a prophet or protege of God, is a stu- pendous hypocrite and a sinner against God. In condemning false prophets and the evil they do, Jesus was not castigating the sincere, humble person still struggling against a few inner weaknesses while trying to help others spiritually. His stern warning was directed at those who make fals e spiritual claims about themselves and preach a false, self-serving doctrine. \"Not every one that saith unto me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. \"Many will say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? 552"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"And in thy name done many wonderful works f' And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity\" (Matthew 7:21-23). H earken, ye would-be followers of Christ: It is not enough just to laud the name of Jesus as \"Lord, Lord\" in conversation and preaching. Professing belief in the divinity of Jesus will not of itself assure entry into the Kingdom of God. Christians whose dedication consists merely of attending church services and absentmindedly listening to Sunday sermons and hymns reach that kind of inner heaven that bestows a degree of peace, faith, some answered prayers, and a little spiritual satisfaction —only that much and nothing more. Real Christ followers are those who embrace in their own consciousness through meditation and ec- stasy the omnipresent cosmic wisdom and bliss of Jesus Christ. This is the meaning of \"he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven\"—the region of Heavenly Bliss. The true devotee, in daily intense meditation, retraces his way- ward footsteps from the land of delusive sense pleasures and material attachments back to his home of Cosmic Bliss in God. He who expe- riences oneness with God in the ecstasy of meditation retains that di- vine attunement and thus knows how to behave correctly during his earthly sojourn, how to act according to God's will here. At death, there is an instant review of one's life. The conscious- ness in the soul recalls one's attempts at virtue and tries thereby to gain the recognition of the liberating Christ Consciousness; but if one's sins and mental desires prevail, he is turned away and cast again onto the rotating wheel of earthly incarnations. Jesus cites especially, by way of example, the reprehensible actions of the \"false prophets.\" Whatever presumed good works one does in the holy name of God or His divine emissaries are instead iniquitous if manipulated by impulses of self- serving motives, fraudulent claims, or the hypocrisy of pretending to be what one is not. Those who have acquired fortunes by selling the name of God, or who have cast out the devils of evil from people only momentarily in a spate of emotional imagination, or have similarly performed spiritual \"miracles\" according to their own deluded esti- mation only, will not be recognized by the Infinite Christ and granted entry into the Eternal Kingdom.

The principles governing divine life are as exact as those of any other branch of science in God's creation. Devotees who want to be real Christ-ians, rather than just members of Christian churchianity, must know and truly feel the presence of Omnipresent Christ all the time, must commune with Him in ecstasy, and be guided by His Infinite Wisdom—and know that He is, and ever will be. If God and Jesus ever existed, They exist now and ever will. If They are perpetually existent, They are knowable—barriers between heaven and earth do not obtain in Their Omnipresence.

That devo- tee, as the soul, builds his house of consciousness not on the shifting sands of earthly pleasures; but with the pickax of meditation and God- communion he digs deep to reach the bedrock of intuitive wisdom, and builds his house of bliss on the everlasting rock of God's Cosmic Consciousness.

But he who gives only token praise to the Christ in Jesus, without heeding the voice of his inner higher consciousness and its intuitive wisdom-perceptions and acting according to those uplifting inspira- tions, is a man who has built his consciousness on a precarious foun- dation of earthly habits. When temptations will come to him, his house of self-control will break up and be swept away by the tide of ignorance, his temporary shelter of spiritual discipline thus devastated. Whosoever leads a careless life patterned after the dictates of his impulsive desires and habits, and who tries to feel security in financial acquirement and sense pleasures, will lose his happiness during the tri- als of life.* Like a house built upon treacherous sand, earthly happi- ness cannot prevail against the rain, floods, and wind of physical dis- ease and mental troubles, the changes of fortune, or the ultimate storm of death.

Spiritually virtuous people act properly and ideally in the various situations in life, in harmony with the laws of righteousness. They move along the path toward redemption through their right actions performed at the inner prompting of conscience, rewarded by a silent satisfaction from their soul. Righteous people need little or no correc- tive discipline, because their innate spiritual sense keeps them on the right path and prevents them from wandering into the temptations of ignorance. \"Sinners\" are those who have defective discrimination and lack the conscience of soul attunement; they thus misuse their God-given rea- son to do that which is wrong.

But additionally, he came to fulfill the more universal dispensation, the quantitative good, of establishing a moral and spiritual standard for all mankind — \"to call sinners to repentance.\" To that end, he mixed with those persons in need of healing from evil to demonstrate personally, by way of example, his quantitative ministry to the masses — to show the transforming power of righteousness that brings response from the forgiving heart of God. Only a highly evolved soul can actually cure the soul sickness of delusive ignorance in others—and that only with their participation. In associating with sinners and publicans as well as with religious and cultured intellectual persons, and healing the physical and mental mal- adies of many of them, Jesus' main purpose was to rouse in them the healing process of spiritual awakening. Each benefited according to his or her present capacity; but by contact with the holy presence and blessing of Jesus, the healing had begun. In associating with his disci- ples, Jesus greatly magnified their spiritual advancement; and in keep- ing company with sinners he worked his healing powers on their soul sickness and started them on the path of redemption. Jesus goes on to say to the intellectually self-important scribes and Pharisees, \"Learn what it means, 'I will have mercy and not sacrifice'\"' —to care for the spiritually sick and needy, instead of catering only to the spiritually and morally A compassionate mes- healthy who make no uncomfortable demands on sage of God's mercy you.

I am here to call not only those who are already redeemed—those who have shunned evil to embrace righteousness—but especially all manner of sinners from all walks of life who in their worldly-wise ignorant conceptions of the true meaning of life remain tenaciously identified with the body and its agonies and worries. If they are not helped to see their mistakes, they will not repent, but will settle for their motley existence of plea- sure and pain, unaware of the saving grace of God-contact in the un- qualified bliss of inner divine communion.\" * Jesus was quoting from the Old Testament Book of Hosea (6:6): \"For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.\" 571"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"To awaken repentance in those inured to evil is to show them the way to redeem themselves. The free will irrevocably endowed to all souls enjoins on them personal responsibility for their choices. Jesus knew that to penetrate the implacable nature of inveterate malefactors he had first to awaken their spiritual reason to make them sorry for their evil actions, and thereby ultimately cause them to redress their evil with a preference for righteousness. Redemption is not forthcoming until the wrongdoer is convinced of the error of his ways. Persons who repeat evil actions usually begin to develop a strong compulsive liking for that be- havior, in spite of any consequent suffering. Without an understanding and acknowledgment of the inimical nature of sorrow-producing sinful actions, those who succumb to temptation can never find in themselves the will to repent. The error-prone must first be reasoned with, so that their paralyzed discrimination may be brought back to life. Once discriminative reason is awakened, repentance usually fol- lows; when people feel sorry for their evil actions, they want freedom from those habits. Without repentance, those in delusion make no ef- fort to liberate themselves spiritually. Therefore, when one sees the in- anity of his evil actions, he must repent and use his free will repeatedly to perform redeeming actions that reinforce his liberating good karma. Great spiritual teachers never claim to forgive unrepentant of- fenders; their work is to awaken the natural righteousness in wrong- doers to the point where they will make an effort to free themselves. No one can prevent confirmed evildoers from reaping the effects of their evil actions; but if they rouse themselves to righteous efforts, the effects of their past evil actions can be neutralized by the effects of their good actions and by the intercession of divine grace.* Repentance is the forerunner of spiritual liberation. It necessarily precedes any sincere and continuous effort to free oneself from evil. Great doctors of souls can inspire metaphysical truants to retrace their footsteps Godward, and support them in the journey; but the actual walking must be done by the error-stricken themselves. By convincing the heart of the folly and misery involved in delusion's nightmares of evil actions, the penitent arouses his soul, long held in that nonsensi- cal somnolence, and with that awakening power makes a dash for spiritual liberty. * Remission of sins by the grace of God or a God-knowing saint is discussed in Dis- course 35. 572"},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"DISCOURSE 32 \"Tine Sailafli Was MaA for Man, and Not JVlam for tlie Salblbatli 99 Tlie Expansion of Consciousness Felt in the P resence or a blaster • Spiritual Consciousness Is Incompatible With Small-Minded Dogmatism The Sp irit of the Sabbath Observed Throughou t C osmic Creation • Religious Rules Are to Be Foil owed With Wisdom, Not Literalistic Blindness Sabbath Is a Necessary Observance for a Peaceful, Balanced Life • IReal Observance of the Sabbath: Feel ing God's Presence Through Inner Communion \"Jesus sometimes flouted 'the letter of the law 3 to demonstrate its in- ner spirit, as in his several clashes with the Pharisees over the proper observance of the Sabbath.\""},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"nd the disciples of John and of the Pharisees JL used to fast: and they come and say unto him, \"Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy dis- ciples fast not?\" And Jesus said unto them, \"Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

Jesus did not dismiss the value of fasting with its spiritualizing in- fluence on the minds of men. Periodic fasting, if properly done, not only promotes health of the body and clarity of the mind, but helps to free the soul from the bondage of body consciousness. It impresses the consciousness with the knowledge that the body is not dependent on food alone for sustenance, but on the Divine Spirit.f Fasting and med- itation are thus effective aids in realizing one's connection with God. But mental and bodily discipline are not an end in themselves; they are a means to achieve God-consciousness, necessary only until one reaches that goal. Jesus was a supreme exemplar of divine attainment, and every receptive person fortunate enough to have contact with him felt the emanations of his spiritual freedom automatically uplifting them, if even momentarily, by a grace that transcended austerities. Jesus went on to specify, however, that more would be required of his disciples when his divinely magnetic incarnate personality would be withdrawn from earthly manifestation into the heavenly realms. They would then have to make greater personal effort in meditation and in following the spiritual mandates of fasting and other disciplines in order to retain their freedom from bodily attachment, and to main- tain and heighten the elevated state of God-consciousness they had en- joyed in their Master's presence. * See Discourse 16. f\"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God\" (Matthew 4:4; see Discourse 8). 577"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"All true masters are \"living\" even after discarding their mortal bodies. Their blessings are omnipresent, available to the ardent devo- tee whether or not disciple and master are incarnate on the same plane. Disciples are those who strive for attunement with the teacher— to remain always in his spiritual \"presence\" whether their physical forms are proximate or apart. A vibratory blessing is actuated in the disciple who with reverent devotion makes that inward contact with his God-knowing guru. The magnetism of that subtle current helps to neutralize delusion's effects of karma and habits, allowing a fresh in- flux of insightful wisdom. The \"same-old-me\" consciousness is nudged aside to reveal the soul potential that the Lord created him to manifest. It is the receptivity of the disciple that facilitates and ultimately makes permanent the transference of divine consciousness from the master who is in touch with God. The guru offers the same spiritual wealth to all students; but according to their receptivity, they absorb to greater or lesser degree. Those who are already rigidly habit-formed when they come to the teacher are always dissembling and question- ing the master's wisdom, assertively defensive of the Tightness of cling- ing to their accustomed second nature. But those who can put aside their obstinacy will find themselves wondrously reborn in spirit. Thus Jesus differentiated the responsive attitude of his close disciples, open to new revelations and bliss through direct perception, from the skep- tics' fault-finding when his ways deviated from the hand-me-down dogmas, unaccommodative to any new infusion of vitalizing truth. \"No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.

Patches of new cloth cannot be  •  well-matched to worn fabric; too, the strong new Spiritual consciousness pieces would pull at the old material, rending it, is incompatible with making it even less useful than before. Jesus was liv- small-minded ing in Truth. He was emancipating the spirit of the dogmatism disciples who understood him through a dynamic revelation of truth-consciousness that was incompatible with the pre- vailing religious stereotypes. No patchwork grafting of new perceptions onto the threadbare cloak of dogma worn by the general populace would suffice for the robes of realization he would offer to his follow- ers. New inspiration, new ways of living truth, replaced the superfi- cially interpreted theology of spiritual codes, rituals, and observances. As new wine put into old containers may well burst the fragile vessels by its expanding power, so new, powerful inspiration poured into dogma-worn minds is sure to shatter old beliefs and cause men- tal rebellion. Jesus' new inspirations needed receptacles of newly en- thusiastic, spiritually powerful souls capable of being filled brimful with the divine revelations of Spirit. So Jesus signified: \"It would be foolish for my disciples to bottle up their divine wisdom of new revelations of truth in an old atmosphere of mechanical rules of popular superstitions and dogmatic codes of conduct. As new wine should be kept in new bottles, so my disciples have been given a new consciousness, a new atmosphere of spiritual living, within which to preserve their new realizations. In their God-intoxication, they are already experiencing that for which rules were made.\" Jesus further noted that persons used to the wine of old dogma would not have a taste for new revelations of truth. They would say, \"Oh, I know it all. The customary practices of the forefathers (ho mat- *Cf. additional parallel reference in Matthew 9:16-17. 579"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"ter how antiquated) were good enough for them, so they are good enough for me.\" Through force of habit they would prefer the old ways of dogmatic living to new habits of spiritual emancipation. Jesus brought a new dispensation, and trained his disciples ac- cordingly. \"God hath made us able ministers of the new testament,\" wrote Saint Paul, \"not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kil- leth, but the spirit giveth life.\"* Jesus sometimes flouted \"the letter of the law\" to demonstrate its inner spirit, as in his several clashes with the Pharisees over the proper observance of the Sabbath. And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the Sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. And the Pharisees said unto him, \"Behold, why do they on the Sabbath day that which is not lawful?\" And he said unto them, \"Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?\" (Mark 2:23-26).

The Sabbath day is meant to be a time of rest and repose, to bal- ance man's outwardly active nature by contact with the transcenden- tal stillness at the core of his being. It is the seventh day, or day of rest, following six days of hard material activity, in imitation of God's sup- posedly six days of creative activity followed by a seventh day of rest.f (Of course, the seven days were not solar days, but consisted of aeonic cycles.) The creation of the earth, as also its galactic neighborhood, took untold measures of time to make it habitable for man. When the divine schema and its operational laws and the ideations of forms and beings had been brought into existence under the direction of the ac- tive intelligence of God, the Father of creation,' the directly active in- telligence of God became inactive or indirectly active, allowing His re- flection as the Universal Christ Intelligence, and His active Cosmic Creative Vibration of Holy Ghost (Mother Nature), to continue the process of evolving the cosmic plans. Thus, when most of the desires of God to create had been ideated, His will and intelligence could take a rest while the universe continued under its own momentum of cos- mic law and His divine agencies of Reflective Intelligence and Creative Vibration. All creation has inherited the pattern of a rest period after * Cf. additional parallel reference in Luke 6:1-4. f \"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.

It is evident in the birth and death of stars, the solar and lunar cycles, the seasons, plant life, and in animals and man. It seems as if we and the universe in which we are situated share a kindred vibration in which rest is needed after activity. Therefore was the Sabbath mad e for man—a time not just for physical relax- ation, but a transcendent spiritual rest for the rejuvenation of the in- dwelling spirit. Jesus upheld the scriptural commandments given by the prophets; but he taught that it is the spirit of the laws laid down in the holy books that is to be followed, lest a literal following of a rule lead to perversion of its purpose. The dogmatic priest of ancient times might be so fanatical about observing the Sabbath day that he would not leave his home and take a carriage to bring a doctor for his dying brother, servant, or guest.* To follow the Sabbath law while forswearing justified and critical needs, such as to ignore giving aid to a helpless person, is a sin, for it breaks a higher law of divine love and service and disregards the dictates of conscience, which in turn disturbs inner harmony with God. To take rest on the Sabbath for communion with God, occasionally breaking the vow of interioriza- tion for a legitimate purpose, would not contradict the spirit of ob- serving that holy day. That is why Jesus taught his disciples that rules of conduct are for their betterment and thus should not be followed blindly, but may be modified with strict reason (though not license) when necessary. Jesus defended his disciples who were inwardly observing the Sab- bath in his holy company and service, even though from hunger they had plucked and eaten a few ears of grain as a matter of necessity. Jesus thereto reminded the critics about the story of David, who lived in the grace of God, and who, when he was in need and hungry, went into the house of God and asked of the priest the sacred shewbread for himself and his companions, even though it was contrary to the * Smith's Bible Dictionary notes: \"[Jesus'] Pharisaic adversaries...had invented many prohibitions respecting the Sabbath of which we find nothing in the original institu- tion. Some of these prohibitions were fantastic and arbitrary....That this perversion of the Sabbath had become very general in our Saviour's time is apparent both from the recorded objections to acts of his on that day, and from his marked conduct on occa- sions to which those objections were sure to be urged.\" Religious rules are to be followed with wis- dom, not literalistic blindness 582"},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"law for anyone to eat it but priests in God's service.* If a literal ad- herence to scriptural injunction could be set aside for spiritual David in order to serve a higher purpose, how much more did Jesus, who was one with God, have the right to disregard outward nuances of the law when he saw that its spirit was truly fulfilled. Jesus then also cites the priests who were exonerated from the sin of activity on the Sabbath in regard to work done by them in the en- virons and service of the temple. The transmuting spiritual vibration of Jesus, in whom the Holy Spirit was incarnate, was greater than the exculpatory sanctity of the temple; that is why he said to the Pharisees: \"If you knew that the Spirit within me has made my body temple holier by far than the atmosphere of the ancient temple, and that the wisdom of Spirit guides all my actions and through me the actions of those who are with me, you would not condemn my disciples who stand faultless in the eyes of God and in the judgment of His eternal laws. Understand that God seeks not your rituals and sacrificial judg- ment of human behavior, but rather your compassionate wisdom and divine understanding. Then would I return your mercy, and wisdom would not be sacrificed on the altar of your ignorance, \"t And he said unto them, \"The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath: Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath\" (Mark 2:27-28).$ HPhe spiritual code of conduct for observance of the Sabbath, es- iL pecially as a day of divine communion, was created for the ad- vantage and spiritual upliftment of man; the Sabbath was not created as some special entity that man is bound to observe blindly, without *The incident is recorded in I Samuel 21:1-6. The shewbread was a ritual offering of twelve newly baked loaves placed each Sabbath on a table in the temple sanctuary and sprinkled with incense. They were left there until the following Sabbath, when the in- cense was burned and they were eaten by the priests and replaced by twelve new loaves. It was forbidden to remove them from the sanctuary. fAs he did in Matthew 9:13 (Discourse 31), Jesus again quoted from Hosea 6:6: \"For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.\" }:Cf. parallel references in Matthew 12:8 and Luke 6:5. 583"},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"rhyme or reason. Indeed, an unenlightened following of a dogmati- cally delineated Sabbath may at times, contrarily, be disadvantageous. Thus Jesus declared that the Son of man, his physical incarnation with its discriminative wisdom, was the determinative Lord as to the application of the Sabbath injunctions. The Sabbath well serves busy worldly people, giving them one day out of each seven days for free- dom from busy-ness, that their outwardly active material nature may be replenished from within by soul calmness and bliss. Sunday (Sun's day, or Wisdom's day) should be spent in God-awakening activities, in keeping with the true purpose of the Sabbath.* To perform distract- ing material work on the Sabbath day instead of engaging in spiritual contemplation and communion with God may be in nonconformance with the Sabbath; but equally so if the businessman compliantly re- mains outwardly inactive yet is inwardly engrossed with business thoughts. A spiritual man who meditates every day, and fasts regularly, and who strives to remain conscious of God during every activity, and yet may be occasionally lax on the so-called one-day Sabbath, may ap- parently transgress the law, but in spirit he does not. The Sabbath is serving him; not he the Sabbath. A rule consists of a system of mandated actions initiated to pro- duce certain physical or mental results. For the most part, they are con- ditioned by time and the social and evolutionary state of man. Hence they are variable in accordance with man's environmental changes. Physical, hygienic, social, mental, and spiritual disciplines were tem- porarily or permanently engendered to suit the development of man and civilization. With due regard to the implacable essence of truth in God's universal laws of righteousness that rules are formulated to up- hold, dictums may have to be modified and diversely applied accord- ing to the changing needs of man with changing times and cultures. Jesus points out that if ordinary men can, without transgression, modify rules of conduct on the Sabbath, certainly the Son of man (his spirit within his body) was also master of the Sabbath day and could adapt its observance to accommodate the physical and spiritual needs of himself and his disciples with no diminution of the spirit of the law. * Saturday was the customary Sabbath day during Jesus' time, and remains so in the Jewish religion. Though most modern Christian denominations use Sunday for that purpose, the Sabbath may be beneficially observed on any day suited to one's circum- stances or community tradition. 584"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"Jesus upheld the Sabbath as essential for man to recharge his vital- ity by the restful silence of interiorization.

So neither does He keep a clock to determine when the Sabbath begins and ends. The Sabbath is any day or hours of the day of inte- rior communion with God, no matter what one is doing exteriorly, so that other days or hours of the day, though filled with life's responsi- bilities, may be inwardly converted into a Sabbath by feeling the pres- ence of God during all activity. This is the spirit of the Sabbath law about which Jesus spoke, in contrast to the rigid literal interpretation simply involving cessation of work. In any case, physical inactivity does not stop the functional work of the body or control its involun- tary movements or still the racing of inner thoughts, all of which in- volve activity that ties man's consciousness to the world. 586"},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"The science of yoga defines the true meaning of the actionless state that lifts the soul to God-communion. The teaching of the Bhagavad Gita about action and nonaction—the \"workless\" state of union with Spirit in the vibrationless realm beyond active creation—parallels the true understanding of inner versus outer observance of the Sabbath:* \"Actionlessness is not attained simply by avoiding actions. By forsak- ing work no one reaches perfection. Verily, no one can stay for even a moment without working; all are indeed compelled to perform actions willy-nilly, prodded by the qualities {gunas) born of Nature (Prakriti). The individual who forcibly controls the organs of action, but whose mind rotates around thoughts of sense objects, is said to be a hypocrite, deluding himself. But that man succeeds supremely, O Arjuna, who, disciplining the senses by the mind, unattached, keeps his organs of ac- tivity steadfast on the path of God-uniting actions [yoga meditation].\"! So long as man's mind and life force are tied to the senses, he is at work. It is when he learns to switch off the life-force currents in the nerves that connect the mind to the senses that he attains the true inactive state of transcendental Spirit. If \"inactivity\" is the measure of proper Sabbath observance, therefore, only the yogi who has reached the savikalpa sa- madhi state, wherein all bodily activity is suspended in the ecstatic trance of God-union, can be truly said to honor that commandment. The Gita points out an even higher state: the ultimate stage of di- vine communion, nirvikalpa samadhi , in which the yogi retains his con- scious oneness with Spirit without necessarily suspending outer activity. Perfectly identified with God as the Sole Doer, he is said to be \"inac- tively active\"—his outer bodily instrument engaged in doing the Lord's will, his inner being free of all desire-born entanglement in the world: \"He is a yogi, discriminative among men, who beholds inactivity in action and action in inaction. He has attained the goal of all actions (and is free).\" And, \"Like unto the lotus leaf that remains unsullied by water, the yogi who performs actions, forswearing attachment and surrendering his actions t o the Infinite, remains unbound by entan- glement in the senses. *The word derives from Hebrew shabath, \"to cease to do; to rest.\" f God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita 111:4-7.

Jesus was always filled with the Spirit; to him every minute of every day was a Sabbath, whether he moved in the marts of men or retired into transcendent stillness. Hence, on any day of the week he could perform legitimate action, such as appeasing hunger or healing, without violating the spirit of the Sabbath. perience, of the interiorized states of God-communion. These in essence correspond ex- actly with the progressively higher states of consciousness expounded in India's cen- turied, universal soul-science of yoga. The saint describes deepening degrees of God-communion as beginning with the various forms of vocal and mental prayer, and progressing through the interiorized states of \"infused recollection,\" \"prayer of quiet,\" and \"prayer of union\" which cul- minates in perfect oneness with God or \"spiritual marriage.\" Of \"the prayer of quiet,\" she writes in The Way of Perfection, trans. E. Allison Peers (Garden City, New York: Image Books, 1991): \"In this state all the faculties are stilled. The soul, in a way which has nothing to do with the outward senses, realizes that it is now very close to its God, and that, if it were but a little closer, it would be- come one with Him through union.... \"The body experiences the greatest delight and the soul is conscious of a deep sat- isfaction. So glad is it merely to find itself near the fountain that, even before it has be- gun to drink, i t has had its fill. There seems nothing left for it to desire. The faculties are stilled and hav e no wish to move, for any movement they may make appears to hinder the soul from loving God.\" She goes on to describe three distinct stages of union: simple union, ecstatic union, and perfect union (spiritual marriage). Saint Teresa's writings on these exalted states have been summarized as follows by Catholic scholar Albert Farges, in Mystical Phe- nomena (London: Burns, Oates, and Washbourne, 1926), who writes: \"Whilst in sim- ple union the sense s are more or less asleep, and awake if disturbed; in ecstasy, on the contrary, they are totally suspended, or rather in a state of anaesthesia, to such an ex- tent that even violent disturbance will not arouse them. The hand of an ecstatic en- gaged in prayer may be approached with the flame of a candle, without his feeling the least pain....[It] is as though the soul were no longer in the body: to such an extent that philosophers and theologians have asked themselves whether, for example, the soul of St. Paul, during his ecstasy, did really cease to animate his body.... \"All mystical theologians are agreed in placing, above ecstatic union, a still more perfect degree of union, the height of earthly contemplation and a foretaste of eternal beatitude....In it ecstasy may become very rare....As Suarez has remarked, our Lord, during his mortal life, was able to enjoy the beatific vision without ever falling into the swoon of ecstasy....The highest summit of contemplative life here below seems, then, to coincide with freedom from this weakness and natural imperfection of the life of the senses; that is to say, with rarity and even complete absence of the swoons of ecstasy.\" (Publisher's Note) 588"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.

Yet he boldly commanded the afflicted man: \"Rise up and stand forth in the midst of the throng in full view so that they can behold the good works of God of healing on the Sabbath day.\" And when the man stood up, Jesus addressed the throng as to whether observing the Sabbath day precluded the performing of good actions. Jesus, by his question, implied that since observing the Sab- bath day was itself a good action, it was contradictory to outlaw other good actions on Sabbath days. The Pharisees could not answer him without entrapping themselves, and so remained quiet. Jesus made his point that none soever among that throng would refrain from rescuing his one valuable sheep fallen into a pit on the Sabbath day; how much greater the necessity, then, to lift an even more precious man from the pit of trouble.

The callousness that obliterated compassion roused in Jesus spiritual indignation—not base anger, but the will force of righteous- ness. He said to the man whose hand was withered, \"Stretch forth thine hand.\" A person to be healed must do something to make his mind and spirit receptive. The man's volition of putting forth his hand was an act of faith in the divine healing power coming from Jesus. The com- mand of Jesus signified: \"Make an effort of your will to stretch forth your heretofore useless hand and send the all-healing energy there. If you do so and are in tune with me, my divine will, controlling the cos- mic energy of the universe, also present in your will and your bodily energy, will heal you.\" J esus reiterated his point about good works on the Sabbath on an- other occasion, as related in the Gospel According to St. Luke: And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. And, behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself. And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, \"Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.\" And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.

And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?\" And when he had said these things, all his ad- versaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him (Luke 13:10-17). A fter Jesus had healed the withered hand of the afflicted man, the temple authorities were outraged at what they perceived as Jesus' defiance of scriptural law: And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea, and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jor- dan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him. And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues. And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, \"Thou art the Son of God.\" And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known (Mark 3:6-12).

He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets. \"A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory. And in his name shall the Gentiles trust\" (Matthew 12:14-21). With plots brewing to destroy him, Jesus did not want to rouse further excitement about his ability to perform spiritual miracles lest the overwrought inimical forces feel threatened by his powers. So, pru- dently, he withdrew with his disciples to the sea, removing himself for a time from the proximity of the controversy. But as a great multitude had followed him, Jesus told his disciples to have a ship ready onto which he could retire from the press of the throng. After he had min- istered to the crowd and healed the many, he wanted to have refuge in solitude. Even the greatest of the great, who serve mankind with their spirit wholly united to God, never forget their highest duty and joy of solitary ecstatic communion. From the adulation of crowds, Jesus turned away to bask in the sole meaningful approbation of the Heavenly Father—without whose power he could not heal the af- flicted, and from whom he derived the grace of his strength, love, and inspiration. With his very life in danger and his mission yet to be consummated, Jesus asked those who were healed and who were witnesses to his miraculous powers to keep those blessings to themselves, lest they only increase the ire of his enemies. Matthew elaborates on the unfolding events by citing the an- cient prophecy of Isaiah enunciating the future conditions surround- ing the appearance and dispensation of Jesus on earth.* God speaks * \"Behold My servant, whom I uphold; Mine elect, in whom My soul delighteth; I have put My spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.

God also promised, \"I will put My spirit upon him\" — God's will and blessings and wisdom will grace the harmony-tuned soul of Jesus, that he might show to the people of the world divine judgment of salvation bestowed by wisdom and righteous living. God signified further to Isaiah that this messenger would be no ordinary saintly soul still having to \"strive\" for spirituality and to \"cry\" in the darkness of delusion for wisdom, but that Jesus, in his coming Christ-consciousness incarnation, will be already spiritually reinforced with the will and wisdom of God. Even so, \"neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets\"—the divinity of Jesus, cloaked in mortal garb, will not be obvious to ordinary human beings, walk- ing the streets of matter; they would not be able to hear the voice of the cosmic vibration of the Spirit of God encased in the body of Jesus. \"A bruised reed shall he not break\" — the transcendent con- sciousness of Jesus as the Son of God would not be at all affected, even though his spirit was encased in the fragile reed of a body that might be bruised, or crucified. \"Smoking flax shall he not quench\" — his spirit, burning with wisdom like smoking flax, would not be quenched or suppressed by the persecution of the flesh. \"Till he send forth judg- ment unto victory\"—though reviled and threatened, he would not give up the body until he had sent forth, or expressed, his judgment of the soul-liberating justice of wisdom in complete victory of the ful- fillment of his God-given dispensation. The triumph of Jesus would be punctuated with his return to earth after death, declaring the ultimate victory of Spirit over matter. He would not leave his incarnation on earth until he had declared to the world that he, even during crucifix- ion of his body, could retain the magnanimity and the God-conscious qualities of the soul untouched by the tortures of flesh and the hatred of man—and the final insult of death. Isaiah prophesied that \"the Gentiles,\" the world at large outside of Israel, would in a far-reaching measure come to accept Jesus as their guru or savior. Even when he was no longer incarnate, they would in- tuitively realize Spirit as the Christ in Jesus.

The choosing of the twelve apostles by Jesus from among his disciples has a very significant meaning. In the guru-disciple tradition in India, each great master who attains God- consciousness has two kinds of devotees who come to him for spiritual training. Those, married or un- married, who come for general instruction are called students; but those students who dedicate their en- tire lives to the pursuit of God-realization and who are thereby enjoined to propagate the teaching of the master to the world through the example of their spiritual development as manifested in their lives are called disciples.* From among the disciples are those who, in many orders, renounce the world in a single-hearted divine quest within a structured spiritual life and service to the work of the master. They help to disseminate his teachings not only through the ex- ample of their lives but also as ordained teachers, whether serving be- hind the scenes in the ashram or in public. The very act of living for God alone is in itself a sermon to the world, eloquent beyond the finest oratory. The duly ordained teacher who possesses both a holy life and a clarity in conveying truth is a true \"apostle\" of the master, \"sent forth\" to serve for him as a pure voice of his God-given message. As worthy children endeavor to add to their family name prestige in the world, so disciples as the spiritual children of a master seek to ex- tol his name by the virtue of their lives. When a father brings forth a son into the world, the child inherits by nature and environment the family traits, good or bad. Even if a child turns out to be problematic, or a crim- inal, he has still to be contended with by the family. Parents have no choice as to the kind of children they bring on earth (unless they know the spiritual art of procreation by which a good soul from the astral world can be invited to be born into their family by an act of super-will power and meditation). A master, on the other hand, has the advantage of oxygen bond more readily to the hemoglobin in the blood, and thus more oxygen is assimilated with each breath . This accounts for the feeling of increased vitality produced by fresh mountain air (and by the ocean breeze and waterfalls and air just after a light- ning storm, all of which generate negative ions).

In the case of Jesus, he not only selected a particular group as his inner circle of disciples, but he chose them from among those souls he had known in a previous incarnation. That is why Jesus, on seeing Si- mon, told him, \"Follow me,\" and without hesitation Simon followed him.* Jesus selected his disciples for three reasons: First, because they had not reached, but were near, the final state of realization; and there- fore he wanted to assist them in the attainment of perfection. Second, after reawakening their past spiritual potential for reaching the final state of emancipation, Jesus required their assistance as apostles or model disciples who could be pioneers to propagate the message of Christhood to the masses through ideal living. Last of all, Jesus knew, according to the plan of the Heavenly Father, that he would have twelve disciples, these particular twelve, to carry out his message to the world. His mission as a world savior, assisted by twelve apostles, had been symbolically foreshadowed in his previous incarnation, when as Elisha he was the chosen disciple of the prophet Elijah: \"So he [Elijah] departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plow- ing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him\" (I Kings 19:19).t The twelve yoke of oxen with which Elisha was plowing symbolized the twelve disciples whom Jesus was to bring under the yoke of spiri- tual discipline for the sake of their own perfection and to make them fit instruments to inaugurate the spread of Jesus' message to all lands. When accepting a disciple for spiritual training, a master some- times changes that individual's family name, which perpetuates a worldly lineage and kinship, to one signifying the disciple's new role in helping to perpetuate the master's spiritual lineage and the life of his ideals and teachings.

Jesus knew the law of cause and effect and the evil propensities of the karma of Judas, so he could predict the probability of his betrayal;* and still Jesus chose him as a disciple. It should be clearly understood that it was not the God- ordained fate of Judas to betray Jesus; rather that Judas insinuated him- self into that villainous role according to the lawful effects of his pre- natal actions that predisposed him to be the cause of the betrayal of Christ, which set the stage for Jesus' test and sacrifice on the cross. Un- der the divine influence of Jesus, Judas had the opportunity to change his karmic pattern; but he heeded the voice of his egoic satanic igno- rance rather than the guidance of Christ-wisdom. God puts his devo- tees through great tests, and Judas failed this one miserably. Yet, such is the paradox that it was Judas who precipitated the culminating vic- tory of Jesus' life that showed to the world for the ages to come Christ's * Jesus' foreknowledge of Judas's treachery is apparent in many Gospel verses, such as John 6:71 [Discourse 43]; John 13:21-17 [Discourse 70]; and Matthew 26:46-47 [Discourse 73]. 603"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"immortality as a world savior and eminent exemplar of the love and forgiveness of God.

And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all (Luke 6:17-19). nd Jesus, in divine glory, with his twelve disciples, stood in the plains amidst a great multitude of people, gathered to hear the gospel and to be healed. The crowd thronged to touch Jesus, for virtue, or life force, went out from his body, drawn by the faith of the sick. The all-healing energy, dormantly present in the afflicted, was roused by their faith and reinforced with the power coming from Jesus. That energy, finer than the finest of gross rays, emanates from the cosmic energy of God with power to destroy not only physical germs and physiological malfunctions, but mental bacteria of evil ten- dencies, and spiritual infectious agents of ignorance. And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, \"Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh. \"Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.

T he Beatitudes, the enunciation of those who are blessed, are enu- merated more extensively in the Gospel of St. Matthew, already commented on.* Having pointed out in The Beati- tudes the practical behavior requisite on the path to Jesus' warnings to heavenly bliss, Jesus' words in the \"Sermon on the those who shun the wis- Plain\" then gave warning to those who would shun dom of seeking God that counsel. In contrast to the blessed ones who seek the rewards of heaven, woe unto those who are so satisfied with their material rewards that they foolishly do not seek the all-misery- quenching fountainhead of Everlastin g Bliss. Jesus had some rich followers. By his words, \"Woe unto you that are rich,\" he condemned not the possession of wealth but attachment to earthly treasure, and selfish hoarding without sharing with others in need. Possessiveness makes one callous to the sufferings of others and gives one a false sense of security. Riches cannot prevent the advent of disease or catastrophe or death. To be satisfied with wealth gives one the false consolation that he has everything, whereas he really has very little—and even that is only given to him for his temporary use, to be instantly taken away whe n the time comes to leave this world. The only prosperity one takes with him is his treasure trove of wisdom and bliss from the realization of truth in meditation. Hence, Jesus warns man to beware of material wealth that it not act as an opiate to deaden the de- sire for God, who alone can give eternal satisfaction and security.! Woe unto those who are content with material offerings and earthly pleasures, feeling no real hunger for God and truth.

Woe unto those who are smiling in satisfaction with material pleasure, for that will be short-lasting, followed by regret that precious time was lost in evanescent follies instead of being well spent in seek- ing the everlasting rejoicing of the soul.* It was not to threaten or condemn that Jesus gave voice to his Fa- ther's loving wisdom-admonitions, but to help man to avoid the igno- rant behavior that ends in suffering. Lord Krishna too in the Bhagavad Gita describes the woeful self-determined fate wrought by one who worships not God and His expression in the soul, but material wealth, power, and pleasures: Believing that fulfillment of bodily desires is man's highest aim, con- fident that this world is \"all,\" such persons are engrossed till the moment of death in earthly cares and concerns. Bound by hundreds of fetters of selfish hopes and expectations, enslaved by wrath and passion, they strive to provide for physical enjoyments by amassing wealth dishonestly. \"This I have acquired today; now another desire I shall satisfy. This is my present wealth; however, more shall also be mine. I have killed this enemy; and the others also I will slay. I am the ruler among men; I enjoy all possessions; I am successful, strong, and happy. I am rich and well-born; can any other be compared with me? Ostenta- tiously I will give alms and make formal sacrifices; I will rejoice.\" Thus they speak, led astray by lack of wisdom. Harboring be- wildering thoughts, caught in the net of delusion, craving only sen- sual delights, they sink into a foul hell.t A deluded individual, trying to the end of life to fulfill his numer- ous unslakable desires, is a victim of endless worries and frustrations. Such a person builds castles in the air, acquiring and maintaining a sur- feit of possessions, vainly anticipating a continuity of happiness from sense enjoyments. * \"Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of noth- ing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see\" (Revelation 3:17-18).

The one-track-minded individual, worshiping the gratifica- tion of human lusts, moves deeper and deeper into the mire of miseries. Good activities and right behavior are the direct way to happi- ness. The pathways of desires and sensory gratifications are a con- founding maze of troubles. Pursuit of material goals as the be-all and end-all of life takes man farther and farther from true soul happiness; he carries a self-created portable hades of misery within himself wher- ever he goes. Pursuit of divine activities leads straightway to the re- covery of man's lost blessedness. Jesus was not counseling a doleful existence when he said: \"Woe unto you that laugh now.\" It is not that one should not laugh at all: Righteousness is the crucible of joy. But material pleasures must not counteract desire for spiritual pleasures; in fact, material enjoyments should be governed by spiritual standards. Unless enjoyment of the good and beauty in the world is spiritualized with right behavior, one becomes satiated with the intoxication of sense pleasures. The heart, so sated, all the more feels the contrast of pain at the loss of enjoy- ment. It is a psychological fact that pleasure is born of a desire fulfilled and pain is born of a desire unfulfilled. Both are crests of waves. Man is constantly tossing atop these contrasting extremes. In the hollow be- tween the two waves is the state of indifference or boredom. He who rides on the crest of material pleasure must also invariably ride on the crest of pain, since relativity is the law of the physical world. Man must neutralize these relativities within himself by mental transcen- dence. Those who float on the still waters of inner peace never have to undergo the pain of unfulfillment. \"He who is everywhere nonat- tached, neither joyously excited by encountering good nor disturbed by evil, has an established wisdom.\"* Woe unto those of whom men of worldly standards speak well, acclaiming them for their material wealth and hedonistic life.

Praise is pernicious when it overestimates the good in a man, cloaking him in a false and hypocritical image. But praise is good when it correctly estimates one's virtues and inspires him to be even more virtuous. Praise in itself does not make anyone better and blame does not make anyone less than what he is in reality. Blame is helpful if it spurs one to correct himself; and praise is beneficial when it in- jects enthusiasm to be worthy. [Verses 27-38 omitted here, as they are commented on in Dis- courses 27 and 30 as parallel to those in the Sermon on the Mount.] And he spake a parable unto them, \"Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the ditch? \"The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master. * \"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

How can a self-elected spiritual guide justify saying to his broth- ers, \"I know the art of pulling out ignorance from your soul,\" when he has not ri d himself of ignorance? Dislodging maya's deeply embed- ded ignorance is not an easy job. It requires practical realization and practical living of the life divine. If one is not a qualified jeweler, how can he accurately teach others to distinguish between good and faulty jewels or detect imitations mixed up with authentic gems? Similarly, how can one who has no direct experience of truth teach others to dis- tinguish between ignorance and wisdom? To pull out the \"motes\" of ignorance from others' souls presup- poses that one has to some successful degree qualified himself by hav- ing pulled ignorance out from his own soul first. Jesus castigates as a \"hypocrite\"—one who is insincere in his actions—one whose own vi- sion is befogged by ignorance yet who presumes with that blurred un- derstanding to be a guide and healer of others suffering from inner blindness. \"For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes\" (Luke 6:43-44). *The illumined master Swami Shankara, father of India's ancient monastic Swami Or- der, wrote: \"No known comparison exists in the three worlds for a true guru.

A human being is a composite of three kinds of trees: (i) The physical nervous system with its roots in the brain and the trunk in the spine (the cerebrospinal axis) and effer- How man's tree of life ent and afferent nerves branching out from it, with grows good and evil the senses and their sensations at the end of the fruits of sensations nerve branches as the fruits.* (2) An astral tree of and desires life with its roots as the thousand-petaled rays in the brain, its trunk of life force in the sushumna, the as- tral spine, and burgeoning branches of life force with their life-giving fruits of vitality and subtle perceptions. (3) The tree of consciousness, which has its roots in the intelligence in the brain; its trunk consists of the mind, and its branches consist of reason, will, and feeling; it bears fruits of evil and good desires. As an aggregate, these three systems of nerves, life energy, and consciousness constitute the tree of life in man.f The human tree of nerves yields good or bad sensations according to the nature of the individual who owns and tends the tree of the nerv- ous system. When an individual administers polluted waters of evil stim- uli to the root s in his brain of this tree of life, he produces fruits of evil sensations hanging from the branches of different nerves. That is, when a person feeds his brain with evil thoughts, howsoever aroused, that stimulus in the consciousness creates desire for evil sensations. When those desires are acted upon by the will, the endings of the optical branch nerves, or th e auditory, or tactual, or olfactory, or gustatory branches of the nervous system become laden with fruits of evil sensa- tions in response to contact with desired objects, such as the wish to see unwholesome sights, listen to words of flattery or evil gossip, engage in lustful sensations of touch or smell, or indulge an unbridled appetite. Conversely, a brain that is fed with good thoughts produces good fruit on the tree of life, from good habits and cravings for good sensations. The roots of every tree of life grow deep in the soil of conscious- ness to tap the wellspring of Cosmic Consciousness. As such, the hu- *Yoga science identifies ten \"senses\" with which the physical body is endowed: five instruments of knowledge (sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch) and five instruments of action (the subtle powers behind the bodily faculties of manual skill, locomotion, speech, procreation, and elimination). fSee also Discourse 7, the tree of life in the Garden of Eden; and Discourse 10, Nathan- ael sitting under fig tree. 610"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"man nervous system was originally created by God to attract and en- joy good sensations only. But man, through misuse of his freedom of will, has converted his tree of life into a bearer of fruits of evil sensa- tions. Once a nervous system is conditioned to producing desire for evil sensations, it is very hard to change its character. A good nervous system will not easily produce fruits of desire for evil sensations, nor will an evil-inclined tree of life produce of itself fruits in the form of desires for good sensations. The astral tree, whose branches spread subtly throughout the phys- ical nervous system, is fed by Cosmic Energy. If this astral tree is not im- pacted by vitiating evil physical habits, it produces fruits of fine inner per- ception which the advanced devotee can pluck and enjoy. As a person cannot partake of the fruits of an undiscovered mango tree hidden in a garden, so a devotee who is yet to see with the light of ecstasy this astral tree of life cannot even imagine the enjoyment to be had from its Elysian fruits: perceptions of subtle forces; possession of miraculous powers; see- ing visions, which are true to life; listening to the celestial sounds beyond the reach of human ears, feeling sensations of the bodies of others, in- haling astral fragrance, savoring astral taste; and possession of the power to dislodge the astral body from the physical body (and to return at will), to magnify or decrease the size of the astral body—these are but a few of the wonders of having discovered one's heavenly astral body. Behind the tree of astral life is the tree of consciousness. When this tree of consciousness is fed with the water of divine thoughts and in- tuition springing from the fountain of meditation, it becomes an en- tirely good tree bearing only fruits of good desires, spiritual aspira- tions, and wisdom. Hidden beneath these three trees of the physical nervous system, of astral life, and of consciousness, is their creator and upholder, the superconsciousness of the soul. Superconsciousness is rooted in the Cosmic Consciousness of God. It sustains the trunk of the threefold tree of life, as also its branches of superconscious perception, subconscious perception, and conscious perception. Superconsciousness, when perceived, will be found to be the source of the fruits of superconscious intuition and of subconscious spiritual dreams and of all good sensations and sentiments. On a macrocosmic scale, God can be spoken of as the root of the universal tree of life; the Cosmic Energy can be spoken of as the trunk; and all rays shooting out of this Cosmic Energy for the creation of uni- 611"},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"verses can be called the branches. The worlds and universes of causal, astral, and physical constitution are the fruits of the tree of Cosmic Consciousness.

That is why we find earthquakes, dissolutions of planetary systems, and all manner of harsh collisions marring the harmony of matter, including the devastations of the evils in man. \"A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh\" (Luke 6:45). A good heart will express itself in good actions; evil feelings will ex- press themselves in an evil way. The use of the word heart by Jesus is esoterically significant here. The great master and exponent of Yoga, Patanjali, says that it is the heart, or chitta, the feeling aspect of • -  man's consciousness, that has to be controlled in or- The yoga science of der to attain God-realization.* As the moon reflected freeing the heart from in a pot of whirling water looks distorted, so also the evil  blessed image of man's true nature as the soul is dis- torted when reflected in the sensation-disturbed men- tal waters of the bodily consciousness. Patanjali says that when, by med- itation, the waves of sensations are stilled, then the pure blessedness of the soul can be perceived. Experiences invading the mind do not create disturbance of rest- lessness until the heart, or feeling, is touched. If all experiences re- mained within an individual as academical knowledge, they could not hurt or bind him.

Instead, the heart through likes and dislikes binds an individual to the wheel of birth and death and mortal suffering. The heart therefore is the archives of an individual's life in which he stores his treasure of good or evil. The good person who is accustomed to do good actions and have good thoughts stores good habits in his heart, and his words and actions reflect that goodness. An evil individual, by evil actions, creates evil habits and a liking for evil in his heart; and when he speaks or acts, evil is expressed therein. Thus, the good or evil entering a man's brain does not automati- cally make him good or bad; but when that stimulus lodges as feelings of attraction or repulsion within his heart, then it will manifest ac- cordingly as good or evil. Man lives in an atmosphere fraught with evil, but no evil experience or perception can influence him to evil un- less he absorbs the evil as a liking for it in his heart. That which comes out of the heart of man declares and affects him rather than that which merely goes into his brain as knowledge.* * \"Our research and that of others indicate that the heart is far more than a simple pump. The heart is, in fact, a highly complex, self-organized information processing center,\" report Rollin McCraty, Ph.D., and his associates in Science of the Heart: Ex- ploring the Role of the Heart in Human Performance (Boulder Creek, California: In- stitute of HeartMath, 2001). \"Traditionally, the study of communication pathways between the 'head' and heart has been approached from a rather one-sided perspective, with scientists focusing pri- marily on the heart's responses to the brain's commands. However, we have now learned that communication between the heart and brain is actually a dynamic, ongo- ing, two-way dialogue, with each organ continuously influencing the other's function. Research has shown that the heart communicates to the brain in four major ways: neu- rologically (through the transmission of nerve impulses), biochemically (via hormones and neurotransmitters), biophysically (through pressure waves) and energetically (through electromagnetic field interactions). Communication along all these conduits significantly affects the brain's activity.\" \"Neurocardiologists have found that 60 to 65% of the cells of the heart are actually neural cells, not muscle cells as was previously believed,\" explains child-development ex- pert Joseph Chilton Pearce in a 1999 interview in Journal of Family Life (Volume 5, Number 1). \"They are identical to the neural cells in the brain, operating through the same connecting links called ganglia, with the same axonal and dendritic connections that take place in the brain, as well as through the very same kinds of neurotransmitters found in the brain. Quite literally, in other words, there is a 'brain' in the heart, whose ganglia are linked to every major organ in the body, to the entire muscle spindle system that uniquely enables humans to express their emotions.\" \"Our emotional-cognitive brain has direct, unmediated neural connections with the heart,\" Pearce reports.

In the tone and vibration of the voice is the echo of one's heart- experiences. A bad man may imitate the voice of a good person, but the evil in his heart will certainly vibrate in his pretending voice. Through the tone and vibrations of mildness or harshness of an individual's voice one can recognize the nature of the hidden feelings in that person's heart. The whole history of an individual as to how he lives his lif e within himself and with his family and associates is re- vealed in his voice. The prenatal and postnatal story of one's life is written also in the eyes of an individual; but those who cannot read those signs in the eyes of others can, with the perception of calmness, intuit the evil or good hidden in the vibratory nature of an individual's voice.

And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant. And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, that he was worthy for whom he should do this: For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue. Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, \"Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed. For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, 'Go,' and he goeth; and to another, 'Come,' and he cometh; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he doeth it.\" When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, \"I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.\" 619"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick (Luke J:I-IO).

A man acquainted with authority, he appealed to Jesus as being one who could command the very laws governing heaven and earth. In rever- — ent awe of Jesus' sovereign power, the centurion felt The dynamics of himself unworthy even to have the Lord enter his faith: connecting one's home. Jesus, being deeply moved by the humility life with an unseen and great faith of this man outside the Hebrew con- Higher Power gregation, commanded the instantaneous healing that the centurion sought. A Sanskrit name for the Lord in His aspect of Cosmic Ruler is Ish- vara (from the root is, \"to rule\"), the Universal Spirit who holds the uni- verses on a pinpoint of thought, revolving their workings on the spindle of His will. The Roman officer, in addressing Jesus as \"Lord,\" spoke with intuitive certainty of Jesus' manifest divinity. He knew that Jesus had only to \"say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.\" A command from Jesus, being united to the Word, cosmic Aum or Amen, carried the man- ifesting power of Omnipotence. In the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, Aum (the Word) is spoken of as the \"symbol\" (manifestation) of Ishvara, the cre- ative power by which the entire cosmos of matter and energy is brought into being, f At one with the omnipotent Lord, Jesus surcharged his word with the cosmic vibratory Word, which endowed him with the authority to heal, or to manifest any other condition in the material world.

The power of maya , delusion, makes possible the effec- tive operation of law, and by its very nature obscures the underlying and all-pervasive Sovereign Spirit. The Sole Reality, the Doer behind all cos- mic happenings, seems absent from His universe. But with the eyes of faith, intuitive knowing, He can be espied, immanent and responsive. Faith reveals a God who is intimately near, just behind the throb of the heart, a God who listens to every word of prayer. His eyes and ears are everywhere, His consciousness attuned to every particular of thought and condition. In His good time He will respond to every sin- cere entreaty—faster than one may think, when He is appealed to with implicit faith. It is doubt that makes Him seem far away. Offering half- hearted prayers, with the mind in the octopus-clutches of doubt, coun- teracts receptivity with a n undercurrent of \"Oh, He will probably not even hear me, let alone respond to my needs.\" His help is virtually ob- structed by that kind of prayer! He must let the karmic law work its impartial justice for good or ill. But appeals made with love, confi- dence, and faith can transcend law and bring results that astonish. Faith means total trust — intuitive conviction, a knowing from the soul, that God is real and that His help is ever ready to flow into man's life. That is the faith extolled by Jesus, the open channel through which he could heal many of the afflicted, and change the lives of countless believers. Despite man's vaunted advances in science and the healing arts, he cannot get away from the fact that in every department of life he is ul- timately dependent on a Power higher than himself. In some respects, modern man enjoys a more secure existence than his ancestors; but still his days are fraught with terrible uncertainties. One never knows when accident or disease, financial failure or natural disaster will strike. Sooner or later, a time arrives in every person's life when a connection with that Higher Power suddenly becomes of utmost urgency, bringing him to his knee s through painful desperation or worshipful devotion— the choice is his—in recognition that not a beat of the heart nor an in- spiration of breath transpires without the supportive will of the Lord. That consciousness of total dependence on God is the power behind the dynamics of faith. Such reliance is not a submissive cowardice that paralyzes one's own constructive will, but an act of consecrated defer- ence to God throug h love for Him and veneration of His supremacy. 621"},{"pageNumber":664,"pageContent":"Thus Jesus cited the exceptional faith of the Roman centurion over the rational skepticism among his own people. The soldier had the humility to bow to an authority superior to his own intellect and station, and the faith to recognize divine power and higher laws, un- seen though they were, so that Jesus could say to him, \"As thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee.\" All creation operates under the law that the effect is equal to the cause. The faith of the centurion was great enough to act as sufficient cause to result in the healing of his servant—through the help of Jesus, who quickened the fruition of the above-mentioned cause. According to metaphysical law, healing power can be transferred from one soul to a consonant soul.* In this case, the centurion's faith was a conduit *See also Discourse 20, commentary on John 4:45-54, in which Jesus heals the no- bleman's son by operation of the same principle. Spirituality and medicine researcher Larry Dossey, M.D., reports experimental ver- ification of the mechanism behind this form of \"distant healing\" in his book, Be Care- ful What You Pray For...You Just Might Get It (New York: HarperCollins, 1997): \"For a decade, a research team led by Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum at the Universidad Na- cional Autonoma de Mexico in Mexico City, has performed experiments examining the electroencephalograms (EEGs or brain wave tracings) of subjects who are far re- moved from each other....While the distant subjects are sitting quietly, there is no cor- relation in the pattern of their respective EEGs. But when they allow a feeling of emo- tional closeness or empathy to develop between them, the EEGs begin to resemble each other, often to a striking degree. No type of energy or signal can be detected to pass between the distant individuals. Moreover, the statistical correlations between the dis- tant EEG patterns do not diminish when the subjects are moved farther apart. This de- fies one of the hallmarks of energy as defined in physics—its decrease in strength with increasing distance from its source. Also, the EEGs remain equally correlated if the sub- jects are placed in metal-lined boxes, which block ambient electromagnetic energy.... \"Grinberg-Zylberbaum's team, along with physicist Amit Goswami, of the Depart- ment of Physics and the Institute of Theoretical Science at the University of Oregon, pro- pose that these 'transferred potentials' between brains demonstrate 'brain-to-brain non- local...correlations....' Nonlocal correlations hav e been a concern of physicists since they were proposed by Einstein, Rosen, and Podolsky in 1935....They were demonstrated ex- perimentally in a celebrated study in 1982 by physicist Alain Aspect and his colleagues. Physicists assumed that nonlocal connections exist only between subatomic particles such as electrons and photons. But the pioneering work of Grinberg-Zylberbaum, Goswami, and their colleagues, which they have replicated, strongly suggests that nonlocal events occur also between human beings.... \"But the connections between distant humans are not automatic. The researchers asked the subjects to try deliberately to 'feel each other's presence even at a distance.' If they did not, the distant EEG correlations were totally absent. This implies that love and empathy are required for distant connections between people to take place, and it is consistent with the universal belief that distant healing depends on love, caring, and compassion.\" (Publisher's Note) 622"},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"through which the healing power of Jesus was received and transferred through the centurion's soul to his servant with whom he shared a warm affinity. Depending on the development of his faculties of perception, man cognizes to greater or lesser degree the gross and subtle workings of cosmic law.

Knowledge of the Transcendent Author of all ma- terial, moral, and spiritual governance, the Law Framer, is utterly be- yond his ken. Unlike the centurion, he egotistically proclaims himself —either overtly by his disrespect or tacitly by his indifference—un- subject to divine authority. One Sankhya* aphorism reads: Ishvar asiddhe (\"A Lord of Creation cannot be deduced\" or \"God is not proved\"). My guru, Sri Yukteswar, explained: \"The verse is not atheistical. It merely signifies that to the un- enlightened man, dependent on his senses for all final judgments, proof of God must remain unknown and therefore non-existent.\" Materialists, accustomed to rationalizing all phenomena in terms of cause and effect, often find no place in their philosophy for a God who transcends the lawful workings of creation. It is irony that ra- tional man distrusts God because of the manifest workings of God's own law of cause and effect! Even a little reflection on the fact that there must be an Author of that law would suffice to start man on the quest for Ultimate Truth. To accept nothing beyond the laws that govern maya is to remain bound in that realm of delusion—to become subject to rather than a ruler of the law of cause and effect. By identifying himself with cre- ation rather than with the Transcendent Creator, man abdicates the authority given to him with his soul to have dominion over the cos- mic phenomena.

But immediately upon awakening he regains the con- sciousness of having a body, which is either young or old, sick or healthy, wealthy or poor. He limits himself so convincingly that those perceptions begin to make him what he is. The phenomena imposed on man's belief are demarcated by the forces of causation h e is capable of understanding—unless, like the centurion, he possesses faith in that which exists beyond the annals of intellect. Scientists have probed the causes of many wonders in cre- ation that previous generations regarded as unexplainable; their ap- plication of that understanding has given us such modern \"miracles\" as radar, atomic energy, television, supersonic travel. Yet because they are unable to identify any known causality in the miracles performed by saints and masters, they deem them to be preposterous superstition. Men of deeper insight, such as Einstein, James, Bose, and Jeans— all those who have intuitively touched the ultimate science and phi- losophy—realize that there is a supreme Power or Intelligence behind the varied forms of matter. What is preposterous is the assumption that the various forms of life and the grand potentials of the con- sciousness in man are just accidents of nature. It is by understanding the laws of life and of our individuality, which are invariably linked, that we find the homogeneity and harmony among all forces. The body is nothing but materialized life. Life is materialized conscious- ness. Consciousness comes from God. ——  This world, existing in God's suggestion of a How yoga frees man relativity of time and space, is merely a condensed from subjection to the thought of God. The wonder I behold is that every- law of cause and ef- thing in this universe God has created out of nothing feet (karma) but His own dream, His own ideations. Man's diffi- culty is that this dream is imposed upon him, like a cosmic hypnosis. When he supinely surrenders his own will to delusive somnolence, he has little or no control over the dream happenings. Under maya's laws of causation, so many operations are necessary in order to achieve something. For us to have bread to eat, a farmer must plant the wheat and water it and tend its growth; then thresh it, grind it, and deliver it to a store. Then the baker has to buy it from the store, make it into dough, and put it in the oven to bake.

But who created the life in the grain that makes the wheat? And who created the earth in which the wheat grew; and who created the heat in the fuel that stokes the oven? It is God's consciousness that has given life to everything. It is the vibration of His thought that has been condensed into light; and that light has been condensed into life force; and that life force has been condensed into electrons and protons; and they have been condensed into molecules and atom s out of which the earth and man's body and everything in this universe is composed. When one, like Jesus, realizes the unity of the Self with God, and that Self as a manifestation of the one Cosmic Light, and beholds everything as a manifestation of that Light, one can control these cosmic radiations, even as God does. Jesus demonstrated that power and proclaimed: \"Ye shall do even greater things than these I do.\"* By deeper and deeper meditation, the aspirant frees himself from maya in the Light beyond the atoms. Only by thus awakening from this daydream of delusion will man know he has been dreaming. When he can dissolve this dream in the ecstasy of God, he will be able to command the universal order to perform any miracle. The Roman officer recognized in Jesus the divine authority to make matter obey his will—to supersede the processes that under the physical law of cause and effect would be necessary to heal the ser- vant. Only supremely God-realized masters, as was Jesus Christ, can operate in a sphere unconditioned by any constraints of causality. United to the omnipotence of the Creator, they can bring into being any object or condition by direct materialization, with no precedent cause other than their act of divine will. There is no law of causation when one knows the law of the In- finite. He who is in tune with God's mind can do anything.f As an earthly emperor may cause all his subjects to obey the laws of his king- dom without himself being bound by them, so the Absolute Monarch of the realm o f manifestation has made all the laws needed for the or- derly operation of His finite creation, including the law of cause and effect, but He is not subject to them.

So long as man considers himself a created being, he is servile to all the companionate forces of cause and effect. As a mortal man he is a creation made by God; as an immortal being of realization, he will know himself as a part of God, possessed of the Father's creative will and lordship over the cosmos.

But in the brutal confines of prison, John's mortal nature reached out for the solace of confirma- tion from Jesus' own lips.

They begin to see themselves as the doers of holy works, forgetting that all glory and honor belong to God alone. Phenomenal powers exert some influence on the operation of natural laws, but no miracles that transcend such laws can be performed with- out God-consciousness.

Hence Jesus de- clares that the appearance of John the Baptist to introduce him to the world was ordained by God long before, as expressed in the Scrip- tures, and therefore John was \"much more than a prophet\"; he was God-blessed and chosen as a part of God's grand scheme. \"For I say unto you, among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he\" And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justi- fied God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

Jesus then distinguishes—with no intended denigration of John's greatness—between John the Baptist's Self-realization in earth life and the Self-realized state of the individual soul when it is fully liberated in the kingdom of God—one with the Absolute Spirit—with no nec- essary submission to the cosmic compulsories of habitation in any of the three bodily confines and their interaction with the manifestations of God's threefold dream creation. From the time preceding John the Baptist \"the prophets and the law prophesied,\" enunciated God's will in law and prophecy. \"Since that time, the kingdom of God is preached,\" when John proclaimed, \"The kingdom of God is at hand,\" and Jesus followed after in preaching, \"The kingdom of God is within you.\" From then until this present time 633"},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"and all future times \"the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence (allows itself to be seized by will and determination),\" and every true man has sought entry into that kingdom. Jesus says with the great yogi Patanjali that the \"violent take it by force,\" that determined devotees achieve sal- vation and the heavenly blissful state by throwing their vision, life force, and concentration on God. As stated by Patanjali: \"The attainment [of the goal of yoga—divine union with God] is nearest to those possess- ing tivra-samvega, divine ardor (fervent devotion and striving for God, and extreme dispassion toward the world of the senses).\"* One who deeply, intensely, and continuously meditates, being guided by one's guru, or savior, knows how with divine will-force to release quickly his consciousness from the body through the gates of the inner heavenly kingdom and allow it to join the cosmic life pres- ent in all space. The soul is thus freed from the bodily prison and unites with the omnipresenc e of the Universal Christ Consciousness in the realization, \"I and my Father are one.\" The expeditious attainment of the heavenly kingdom by spiritually ardent aspirants was fully char- acterized in John the Baptist, who seized the kingdom of God by his extreme asceticism and th e vehemence of his will.f Then Jesus again confirms that the incarnation of John the Baptist was no fortuitous happening, but that in truth it was the fulfillment of the prophecy: \"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.\"i: Jesus unequivocally proclaims: \"And if ye will receive it, this is Elijah which was for to come. He that has ears to hear, let him hear.\" That is, \"All those who have the power of understanding, let them hear, receive, and realize the truth that John the Baptist is none other than Elijah of a former incarnation.\" Jesus here definitely acknowledges reincarnation. This grand philos- ophy alone explains how souls who are taken by death and leave the shores of life without attaining salvation can again strive and attain final emancipation through a succession of other human incarnations.

When Jesus addressed the receptive souls in the crowd, \"He that hath spiritual ears to hear and feel the vibration of truth, let them re- alize the truth behind my words,\" he knew that many others present were nonbelievers seeking cause to condemn him. Most of the people who heard Jesus justified the word of God proclaimed by him because they had received baptism and spiritual preparation from John the Baptist. But the nonbelievers, \"the Pharisees and lawyers\" who were not among the avowed followers or initiates of John, rejected outright the revelations of God coming through Jesus, counsel that would have awakened their torpid consciousness. And the Lord said, \"Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? And to what are they like? They are like unto chil- dren sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, 'We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.' \"For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drink- ing wine; and ye say, 'He hath a devil.'

The industrious accuse the lazy for their fault in not being pro- gressive, saying, \"We played the flute of opportunity, but you didn't dance to its tune of offerings.\" Jesus came and offered the way to the kingdom of heaven; but ignorant people, instead of busying them- selves with spiritual endeavor, continue to while away their time in physical and mental laziness. Some casually mourn for the careless loss of life's treasured time, while others, not learning from any example of remorse, never shed a tear for fruitlessly idling away their life. Conscientious devotees, realizing the worth of that something else that exists beyond the norm, are busy investing in spiritual qualities; some persons superficially revel in spiritual matters; some do not re- joice in spiritual culture at all. Some whose deeper thoughts are stirred by suffering or a sense of emptiness mourn for not finding the truth of existence; others never weep for not perceiving truth because they do not connect life's miseries with their spiritual ignorance. Jesus' analogy also alludes to the childishness of persons who set expectations for the behavior and beliefs of others, accusing the non- responsive for not being spiritually progressive according to those standards. Jesus by inference cites the nonbelievers and skeptics, them- selves spiritually indolent, yet accusing one another about their faults of omission. Being thus engrossed in the foolishness of false superior- ity, and pomposity rather than religiosity, they failed to recognize and take advantage of the wisdom and grace brought to them by God through the Christ in Jesus. Jesus went on to point out the flawed reasoning of those nonun- derstanding minds: \"You who are busy whiling away your time in life's marketplace, where you could find God, have shown yourselves to be ignorant, indifferent, blind, and so mentally scattered that you could not recognize the spiritual greatness of John the Baptist and the inestimable good he could do unto you. You foolishly judged him to be possessed of a devil, because unlike your comfort-loving selves he is austerely self-controlled and abstemious in food and drink. If you can think of his holy asceticism as indicative of being possessed, then how can you justify by that standard your criticism of one who comes amongst you eating and drinking and socializing in the manner of the times?

You know not that all children of God's wisdom, whatever they do, even though outwardly not understood, are justified by the subtle and immutable law s of their God-realization.\" In the dark era of Jesus' time, scientific techniques for attaining God-communion and God-union were hidden from the masses. Those who reached that spiritual pinnacle found the way to interiorization pri- marily through intense devotion and discipline of the body and mind. In portraying his less advanced role as John the Baptist, the prophet set the severe standard of devout self-discipline of fasting and observance of certain physical laws and spiritual rites. Jesus, however, came exem- plifying God-consciousness; his participation in the normal social cus- toms involved only his physical nature (son of man) and did not touch his spiritual nature as manifested in him as the Son of God. The Son of God, the inner Christ, was completely detached from the actions of the son of man, th e external personality of Jesus. Jesus signified that the crit- ics of both himself and John the Baptist were so spiritually blind that they could not recognize either the spirituality of the outwardly ascetic nature of John the Baptist, nor the Christ in Jesus hidden behind the ap- parently unmodified ordinary habits of his simple life. Jesus supported his actions of association with \"publicans and sinners\" as being guided by wisdom. His sociability was to break down caste barriers; and to minister, without reservation, to all those who needed him; to show how the redeeming power of God could help and uplift th e error-stricken by their confidence in his instru- mentality, born of his compatibility and compassion. Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not: \" Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

All of life is a school, and whether he knows it or not, each per- son is preparing for a \"final examination\" on the last day of his earthly incarnation. In social life it may be difficult to judge a person's character by his outward appearance (unless one knows the intuitive art of reading personality); but at death the facade of pretenses is north of Capernaum. Bethsaida, home of Peter, Andrew, and Philip, was situated on the Sea of Galilee where the Jordan River enters it. Tyre and Sidon were wealthy trad- ing cities on the Mediterranean coast in Phoenicia (modern Lebanon), with whom the Jews had occasionally been enemies; see, for example, Joel 3:4-6: \"Yea, and what have ye to do with Me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine?...Because ye have taken My silver and My gold, and have carried into your temples My goodly pleasant things: The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border.\" *Cf. parallel verses i n Luke 10:13-15. 638"},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"Tlie W ©mam Taken in A dii 1L cry And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, they say unto him, \"Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.

Every individual is unique unto himself; no two vi- bratory expressions are identical, for each one's thoughts, choices, and reactions in the school of life are his own. From childhood until his last breath, all these experiences are stored as vibratory patterns, tabloid records, in the brain. These karmic tendencies influence each person's behavior, personality, and life experiences. Most people have difficulty remembering even major happenings of daily life after sufficient time has passed; the conscious mind usu- ally begins to forget the details of events after a few minutes, and most of them wholly vanish over the course of a few days, months, or years. But behind the conscious mind is the subconscious mind; there all outstanding experiences of one's life are registered and can be recalled with the proper stimulus. Even deeper is the supercon- scious mind, which never forgets anything a person ever does, in this or prior incarnations. Body-bound man, in ordinary waking con- sciousness, usually has no access to the superconscious realm. But at the time of death, when life force and consciousness are withdrawn into the spine and brain in order to leave the mortal frame, the tabloid karmic \"recordings\" of every act, thought, feeling, and desire since childhood are activated and made visible. In a flash, the soul is presented with a review of that entire incarnation—all of the good and all of the evil that person has done, no matter how thoroughly he has \"forgotten.\" Viewing the sum total of the use he has made of that incarnation, the dying person is overwhelmed by a concentrated composite of his predominant feelings and desires. If he has led a basically good life, there will be consciousness of happiness or satisfaction; if the primary \"accomplishment\" of his life has been to cause pain to himself or oth- ers, his mind will be overcome by great remorse or guilt. The overrid- ing impression—whether strongly positive or negative or somewhere in between—created by this life review is the \"judgment\" that deter- * Proverbs 23:7. 639"},{"pageNumber":684,"pageContent":"mines where he will go in the astral interlude between incarnations as well as the conditions of his rebirth in a physical body.* The overall tenor of a person's thoughts and feelings during his earth life thus renders the \"verdict\" on \"the day of judgment.\" The fi- nal impression left in one's consciousness, the distilled essence of his predominant habits of a lifetime, is thus the karmic judge that at the sound of \"Gabriel's trumpet\" announces a man's next destination.! The day of judgment, therefore, is a time after death when souls, according to their individual karma, receive judgment from the cos- mic law as to what kind of rebirth or spiritual promotion they should have on earth or another higher sphere of existence. \"And that is why I know and can foretell to you, O inhabitants of Chorazin and Bethsaida, that because of your spiritual indifference you will reap poor fruits on the day of judgment of your karma after death. My consciousness—which is omniscient, perpetual, and unin- terrupted by death—now sees all that will happen in future to you for the spiritual opportunity you scorned. I prophesy that I surely shall grieve on your day of judgment for your folly.\" Jesus speaks similarly concerning Capernaum (his stated abode during his public life—thus the city most favored by God, \"exalted unto heaven\") as to how she will suffer in the future because of the individual and mass karma of her spiritually unappreciative inhabi- tants. Had the peoples of even the condemned Sodom seen such demonstration of the glorification of God in the life and works of Christ, their better response would have resulted in the continued preservation of the city and secured her inhabitants a better state in the hereafter.^ * \"That thought with which a dying man leaves the body determines—through his long persistence in it—his next state of being\" (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita VIII:6). tSee Discourse 21. £ \"Though India possesses a civilization more ancient than that of any other country, few historians have noted that her feat of survival is by no means an accident, but a logical incident in the record of devotion to the eternal verities that India has offered through her best men in every generation.

Though God is the Creator and Sustainer of man, He has or- dained the law of cause and effect, or karma, to govern life so that man himself is the judge of his own actions. By good action he com- pels the law of karma to reward him. When he chooses to act evilly, it is then according to his own decree and invitation to the law of karma that he creates his own suffering.* When a man works evil there is no conscious force ready to pounce upon and destroy him. The cosmic law makes no conscious decisions regarding an individual's fortune or misfortune. \"The All- Pervading takes no account of anyone's virtue or sin. Wisdom is eclipsed by cosmic delusion; mankind is thereby bewildered, \"t As man gropes his way through the bewildering offerings of delusive cre- ation, he fashions his own rewards from virtuous decisions or pun- ishments from sinful choices inasmuch as his acts are in consonance with or contrary to cosmic law. When a soul is identified with the body and its sense pleasures, it forgets its divine nature. This forgetfulness in the throes of indiscrim- inate indulgences is sinful, because the consciousness turns away from God and follows the path of ignorance. Man thereby sins by acting against the interest of his own true Self. Hence, when a child of God chooses to be identified with the senses and sensory happiness, he is a sinner against his soul, a violator of his soul's divine happiness. To love sensual pleasures to the exclusion of the blissful contact of the God- knowing soul in meditation is the basic sin that begets, through igno- rance, all other manner of sinful behavior. He who fails to seek and find the superior happiness of ever new bliss present in the soul, which can be experienced in meditation, will forget his divine Self in the ma- terial lusts of the ego, the delusive pseudoself.

The opposite is true: God is the nearest of the near, ever lovingly con- cerned and working silently for the welfare of His children; it is man who maintains a distant aloofness from God by forsaking Him in pre- occupation with material pursuits. And when man then suddenly and urgently needs God's help, he no longer recalls how to make connec- tion with that Divine Immanence. Originally, when God created man He did not deny him the knowledge or revelation about Himself. As recounted in scripture, communion between God and man in primeval creation was natural and fraught with no obstruction. But man transgressed the law of God and thereby raised the walls of sin and ignorance, shutting out his per- ception of God. Adam and Eve in the beginning met the Beneficent Creator in their daily walks of life. The Lord never denied them His visit, until they knowingly transgressed His code of conduct. In point of fact, God did not drive them away; Adam and Eve drove themselves out of Paradise by their disobedience. Their own action created around themselves the walls of sinful transgression, through the opac- ity of which they could no longer view the Resplendent Spirit. Man's persistence in error is why he is ostracized, banished from God-consciousness. But it would be wrong to blame God as being self- ish, sitting on a celestial golden throne, enjoying the cream of His cre- ation, while consigning the earth's poor fellows to till the hard soil of life.

Similarly, when a soul is in the darkness of incarnations of ignorance and evil actions, if the light of wisdom and faith in the soul and God is introduced, then all that delusive obscurity vanishes instantly. Thus the consummate way that human beings can escape reaping the results of their past wrong actions is to change their status from a human being to that of a divine child. The evil actions of a soul iden- tified with the body (that is, as the ego) will have to suffer punishment according to the law of karma. But if the soul, by ecstatic meditation, becomes fully liberated from its identification with the body and be- holds itself as a pure image of Spirit, it is no longer subject to punish- ment for any mistakes it made in its human state. Consider the postulate that a powerful monarch of a country dis- guised himself, went into a tavern belonging to his estate, got drunk, quite forgetting his status, and started a vicious brawl with one of the 648"},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"patrons. The innkeepers took him to a judge, appointed to that post by the king. As the judge was about to sentence the monarch, he came to his senses, threw off his disguise, and exclaimed: \"I am the king who appointed you as the judge, and I have the power to cast you into prison. How dare you presume to convict me?\" Similarly, the ever per- fect kingly soul during its identification with the body may commit an evil and may be convicted as guilty according to the judge of karma; but when that soul identifies its consciousness with God, the Creator of the karmic judge, that royal soul is no longer under the jurisdiction of such judgment regarding its past dereliction. The more one establishe s one's identity with the Absolute and never deems himself a sinner, the more he will feel God's mercy. Love for God, surrender to God, will destroy in ••-•- man the karma of ignorance. Pure love, divine love, How pure love for removes the barriers between man and his Maker. God brings forgiveness The sinful woman who \"loved much\" found herself of sins transformed by its sanctifying touch. \"I am impartial toward all beings,\" the Lord declares in the Bha- gavad Gita. \"To Me none is hateful, none is dear. But those who give Me their heart's love are in Me, as I am in them.\"* God is love. Every soul, even when the outward consciousness is deluded or in a wicked state, is a holy receptacle filled with this divine love. No matter how deeply error-stricken man is identified with sen- suous pleasures, when by meditation he consciously feels the love of God within himself, he begins to rise above his bad habits. Regardless of the intensity of his sins, when man turns his mind within and sin- cerely seeks and finally attains God's bliss and love templed in the soul, he does not have to undergo the suffering linked to his previous sense attachment. This is the grace that was bestowed on the woman who loved much. With her own consciousness permeated with the love of God within herself, and with the help of Jesus Christ, her con- sciousness became free from her habit of sin, of being identified with the compulsive pleasures of the flesh. Jesus forgave her as a potential divine child made in the image of God. In spite of her many sins, she realized from the teachings of Jesus that the power of God was within herself, and that the power of Jesus could awaken within her that God-consciousness which would release * God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita ix:29. 649"},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"her from the consequences of those past transgressions. This is what is meant by the forgiving of sins. When a criminal breaks a city ordinance, he is condemned ac- cording to the provisions of that law. But the governor of the state is empowered in extenuating circumstances to pardon the offender. Like- wise, God, being all-powerful, and also His saints who are tuned with Him and who exercise their divine will force, can stop the fruition of evil karma in any individual. Only God and realized sons of God can completely or partially forgive an individual's sins against his soul, provided that person is devotedly sincere in seeking forgiveness, not through mere supplication, but through divine love. Shallow prayer and selfish fear of consequences will not cause God arbitrarily to contradict the just and sanctioned working of His karmic law. This would in effect permit man to continue in error with- out consequences. Nor can God be moved by fitful emotions of praise or bartered deals of good behavior for past misdeeds. Man's recourse to the intercession of the grace and forgiveness of God, saving him from his self-created fate at the merciless bar of law, is that God is both law and love. The devotee who seeks redemption by attuning his actions to the righteous guidance of divine law and also implores with pure devotion and faith the unconditional love of God, will be trans- formed in God's light of forgiveness. There is no doubt about this di- vine assurance: Any sin, and its consequence, can be forgiven the re- pentant devotee who loves God deeply enough, and thereby puts his life in tune with the all-compassionate Lord. Love is greater than law; it is the unifying thread that attaches the devotee's heart to the unconditional heart of God. Law is based upon impersonal justice weighed according to the principle of cause and ef- fect; but love claims God as our own forgiving Father-Mother whose all-embracing mercy abides whether or not the full measure of the law has been met.* The sinful woman forgiven by Jesus loved much because despite the magnitude of her sins, in the presence of divine love she felt no condemnation but rather faith in its redeeming power. And like the man in the parable who was forgiven his greater debt relative to the * \"All the wickedness in the world that man might work or think is no more to the mercy of God tha n a live coal in the sea.\"—William Langland, fourteenth-century English mystical poet. 650"},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"debtor forgiven little, her love was magnified by the awesome for- giveness she received through the medium of her devotion and faith and the blessing of the Christ in Jesus.* The removal by God's grace of a small karmic debt may be less noticed and responded to by a complacent righteous man secure in his love for God, whereas the effect of overwhelming love and gratitude is roused in a man whose devotion and faith has merited a divine re- prieve from some dire karmic consequence of his own sinful making. Thus one who loves much is forgiven much; and one who is for- given much, loves even more. And he said unto her, \"Thy sins are forgiven.\" And they that sat at meat with him began to say within them- selves, \"Who is this that forgiveth sins also?\" And he said to the woman, \"Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace\" (Luke 7:48-50). J esus' several pronouncements of his forgiveness of sins was a source of consternation to the people of his time who believed that only God could forgive the sins of an individual. They could little un- derstand the power of Jesus as manifesting his oneness with God, en- abling him to do all wonders sanctioned by the Divine Will. As stated previously, only God and the highly advanced saints can forgive others and free them from suffering the results of their transgressions; this is because they understand the exact relation of mind, habits, and the brain of individuals and can change the nature of a person's brain cells and mind, favorably altering karmic patterns.f Some credulous wrongdoers consider it sufficient to confess their sins to an ordinary cleric to receive divine amnesty from their evil deeds. Because * Saint Teresa wrote: \"There are souls whom the certain conviction that God is with them benefits more than all the fear they may ever have. If a soul love greatly, and is thankful naturally, the remembrance of the mercies of God makes it turn to Him more effectually than all the chastisements of hell it can ever picture to itself—at least, it was so with me.\" — Life of St. Teresa of Jesus (New York: Benziger Bros., 1904), Chapter xv. fSee Discourses 13, 25, and 31. Forgiveness of sins means erasing karmic patterns left in the brain by wrong actions 651"},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"confession confers on them a sort of mental consolation and because they cannot see the subtle operation of the law of karma — whose punitive judgments may not be discernibly linked in time or condition to their cause—they deem themselves forgiven. The idea of confession provides some measure of restraint and unity of moral purpose, but even better than confessing to human be- ings is confession to the Lord in a contrite surrender of pure love. It is unseemly to say to God \"I am a sinner.\" What God wants to hear is that man remembers his true relationship with his Heavenly Father- Mother: \"Lord, I am Thy child. You brought me into a world that is fraught with delusion and temptations. Though I might have made mis- takes, I am Thy child just the same.\" We came from God, fashioned from His own One Being, and in Him we will ultimately merge again. Faith in this belief, this conviction, alone can bring soul freedom. Jesus said to the woman who was forgiven of many sins that it was her faith that saved her. Her faith, made strong by the humble def- erence of her love, released her mind from the grip of her senses and focused it within on her true Self. When Jesus found that she was will- ing to quit her identification with her dissolute behavior, he stimulated with his cosmic energy the life energy concentrated in her brain and erased or \"forgave\" the evil tendencies with which her mind had be- come saturated. In Jesus' pronouncement, \"Thy sins are forgiven,\" he emphasized that God's energy passing through him into the woman had been the principal factor in the healing. He then said, \"Thy faith hath saved thee,\" emphasizing that her receptivity, her conviction in the unlim- ited power of God, was the second requisite. The divine power of Jesus roused the omnipresent Divine Will to send the healing cosmic energy to the brain cells of the sinful woman. The concomitant release of the latent healing life energy in her brain cells was due to her \"faith,\" the revival of her sin-paralyzed will in re- sponse to the divine will of God through Jesus. \"O woman, thy faith in the infinite power of divine healing charged your sin-paralyzed will with Divine Will, causing a release of stored-up energy in the brain which, reinforced with the cosmic en- ergy from me, has cauterized the sinful tendencies lodged in your brain cells. Now, freed from the automatic reaction and compulsion of evil habits and sense slavery, you can be conscious of the revived peace of your soul—'Go in peace.'\" 652"},{"pageNumber":696,"pageContent":"In another incident, recounted in the Gospel According to St. John, Jesus dramatically illustrated the divine attitude toward erring children of God: And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, they say unto him, \"Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what say est thou?\" This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, \"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.\" And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their oum con- science, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, \"Woman, where are those thine ac- cusers? Hath no man condemned thee?\" She said, \"No man, Lord.\" And Jesus said unto her, \"Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more\" (John 8:3-11). J|n this highly charged confrontation, Jesus displays divine wisdom, 1L compassion, and spiritual skill in handling a most difficult situa- tion. He threw an explosive countercharge amidst the sanctimonious hypocrites who hid their own sins and came to condemn the guilty woman and also to implicate Jesus in lawbreaking if he dared t o show mercy to her and thus ignore Jesus' compassion and the law of Moses. Jesus shamed them by suggest- wisdom in dealing ing, \"No one among you is free from sin; should with the woman you not cast aspersions of guilt and stones of con- taken in adultery demnation first at yourselves?\" The words of Jesus are variously applicable in the practical affairs of life: (1) Only the highly spiritual man who is free from sin himself is justified in casting the stone of criticism at the materially minded man in order to awaken him. (2) Any person who is successfully rein- 653"},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"ing in with self-control his own sin may cast a stone of helpful warn- ing at an unrestrained sinful individual. (3) Stones of criticism should not be cast at anyone for any fault if the accuser also harbors that fault within himself. The spiritually ignorant have no right to criticize oth- ers about their spiritual ignorance. Individuals with specific sense at- tachments ought not to criticize others who possess that same weak- ness. Only persons who do not make social mistakes themselves are justified in critiquing others' social errors. Jesus said in effect: \"No one in the crowd was sinless and there- fore could not with a clear conscience condemn you. Nor do I, with my divine perception and wisdom, condemn you before God, even though you have ignorantly sinned. Henceforth, follow the path of righteous- ness. The Christ Consciousness in me has saved you from reaping the consequences of your past adulterous actions. Never again identify your mind with those insatiable lusts that were devastating to your true soul joy. If you repeat your sinful actions, they will fast become a habit again that will compel you to act sinfully, even against your will. In that hapless slavery, you will suffer dire social, mental, moral, spiritual, and physical condemnation from which it will be very difficult for you to be forgiven, or freed through your own efforts or the help of others.\" Adultery is not only a social crime but also a sin against divine happiness. Adulterous behavior leads to marital disruptions, social disharmony, and loss of the true values of love. Those who engage in sexual promiscuity rather than transmuting sex energy into construc- tive purposes devitalize their body of energy, their minds of peace and happiness, their souls of divine bliss and wisdom. Jesus understood human nature and its weakness of yielding to sex transgressions. He knew that social or religious persecution can- not stamp out unhealthy sex habits deep-rooted in the brain and the mind; but that these detrimental compulsions can be overcome by a repentant individual who thoroughly impresses the mind with under- standing of the destructive effects of those habits on himself, and who adopts the proper measures of self-control, will power, good company, and meditation to eliminate them. Once such a repentant individual becomes free from the enthrallment of sex habits by accumulation of life energy in the brain through deep meditation, which also summons the intercession of one's guru, or savior, and the redeeming grace of God, the penitent should not revive those habits and their attendant miseries by sowing fresh seeds of illicit sex activities on the tender soil 654"},{"pageNumber":698,"pageContent":"of his mind. Thus the blessing and admonition of Jesus: \"Neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more.\" The law of karma should not make people fatalists, but should en- able them to diagnose scientifically all the hidden seeds of self-created potential miseries, that they may in time be properly destroyed or at least their growth mitigated by physical, mental, and spiritual means. Seeds of evil action s that have been de-powered cannot suddenly ger- minate to cause suffering in one who is unprepared. According to the legal statutes of a country, a judge might sen- tence a young criminal to three years in a reformatory school. But the judge usually has the privilege to commute that sentence to probation if the young offender repents and promises good behavior. So, ac- cording to the la w of karma, a person who acts evilly must reap the consequences of his actions. But if that evildoer corrects his misbe- havior and by intense devotion, prayer, and meditation appeals to God for pardon, then God, being the Maker of the law of karma, can grant him amnesty from punishment, allowing him instead to work out his sentence through the amelioration of such counteracting ways as righ- teous actions and consciousness-transforming meditation. \"And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses\" (Mark 11:25-26).* H ere Jesus points out another truth pertinent to the devotee seek- ing forgiveness from past wrong actions: If one is forgiving to- ward those who have offended him, then the omni- —— scient Father, the invisible but ever present Cosmic A forgiving attitude Consciousness, which enfolds the devotee as he prays toward others attracts for redemption, will also forgive that petitioner's God's forgiveness for spiritual offenses. But if the omniscient Father finds oneself an unforgiving attitude toward those who have of- fended His child, then He, likewise, may withhold forgiveness for that child's own spiritual sins. It is not that God whimsically plays tit for tat *See parallel passage in Matthew 6:14-15, Discourse 28. 655"},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"with His children. Rather the cosmic law of cause and effect is active even in man's relationship with God, particularly in the beginning stages when divine union has not been irrevocably established. Man begets the causes that bring fort h God's response. Man's soul is a reflection of God, and when he misuses his free will to behave contrary to his divine soul-image, he creates a distor- tion in his consciousness in which God reflects to him a response of his own making. It is the nature of the soul to express unconditional love. When connate forgiveness is withheld by resentment and ill will toward an offender, God likewise does not show Himself as forgive- ness to that person of vengeful disposition. But when soul-forgiveness is beneficently manifested outwardly to one's fellow beings, no matter how they have offended him, then he is imbued with the correspond- ing reflection of God's redemptive forgiveness. Jesus is pointing out that the code of human conduct should not be enforced by justice alone, but be tempered by forgiveness and love —a plea the devotee would be wise to heed. It is the duty of federal or civil law to deal with crime; it is not for an individual to try to pun- ish a person who has offended him—even if it is obvious that he justly merits it. The divine way is to try to forgive him, because he is a child of God, although an erring brother, whose immutable soul has no part in man's mischief. No doubt, a wronged person, also, is responsible for many offenses towar d God and man. But if the omniscient Father finds that one of His sons forgives an offending brother, then because of that mitigating divine love He will relax the determinate law of cause and effect and forgive some of the forgiver's spiritual offenses, even as he forgave his errant brother. \"Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, re- buke him; and if he repent, forgive him. And if he trespasses against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, 7 repent'; thou shalt forgive him\" (Luke 17:3-4). \"T \"^ake heed of the following truths: If your brother acts against your noble wishes and good principles, discipline him by telling him the effects of his evil actions; and if he truly repents of his evil ways, forgive him—even if he repeats his offense seven times in a day.\" 656"},{"pageNumber":700,"pageContent":"This is an affirmation by Jesus that no matter how many times a man falls prey to evil, the divine image within him remains untar- nished and is worthy of consideration. As soon as the evildoer repents, the covering of evil is pushed aside to reveal the shining true Self. When an evildoer repents, but is not forgiven and is still accused and made to feel guilty of his forsaken error, the consciousness of wrong- doing is replanted i n him. If his will is weakened by discouragement and absorbs that suggestion, he may again succumb to error. There- fore the psychology of forgiveness consists in helping the wrongdoer to remove permanently the mask of evil from his soul by encouraging in him the cultivation of good karma. Though one should not hold unforgiving feelings in his heart, nei- ther should he express forgiveness to a wrongdoer who does not truly repent of his evil actions; otherwise it would only justify to him de- liberate repetition of his evil behavior. But a brother should forgive an error-stricken brother as many times as possible if the offender really tries to forsake his evil ways yet falls occasionally due to weakness of will and strength of fleshly physical habit. To extend repeatedly the hand of forgiveness to a repentant brother is to mirror the example of the Heavenly Father who forgives us all countless, infinite, times. Then came Peter to him, and said, \"Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?\" Jesus saith unto him, \"I say not unto thee, until seven times: but, un- til seventy times seven. \"Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. The servant there- fore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, 'Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.' Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. \"But the same servant went out, and found one of his fel- lowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid 65 7"},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, 'Pay me that thou owest.' And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and be- sought him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all' And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. \"So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, 'O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?' And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. \"So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their tres- passes\" (Matthew 18:21-35). HPhe above story of the king and his servants is yet another illus- ^L tration of the operation of the law of karma, cause and effect, in which Jesus points out that the effects of already performed evil ac- tions can be modified by the neutralizing power of prayer and good actions. But along with receiving the mitigating grace of divine help and forgiveness, the recipient also incurs an obligation to learn to for- give the sins against him of his repentant brothers. When human beings tune themselves to God by deep prayer in meditation and realize their divinity, the perfect soul-image within them, they need not suffer for their past human errors. But if after this ecstatic experience their consciousnes s reverts to mortal habits, they lose that freedom from karma and again subject themselves to be gov- erned by the exacting law of cause and effect. Jesus used the example of forgiveness of one's debts to indicate the wiping away of karmic debt—that one can escape the law of karma by identifying himself with God through faith, love, and ecstatic prayer, even as the servant was forgiven his debt when he petitioned his king. But if after finding divine forgiveness from one's own karma by medi- tation, one again becomes meanly human by unforgiveness toward his brothers who sin against him, his reidentification with human life and behavior binds him again to the inexorable laws of limiting karma.

The question arises: If a man performs an evil action against his brother and repents and is forgiven by him \"until seventy times seven,\" then is the transgressor free also from the —— operation of the law of karma? The answer is very When one forgives a complicated.

Repentance is not a cure for the consequences of evil actions. It serves only to keep the mind consciously acquainted with the painful re- sults of evil deeds, with the hope of preventing further repetition of evil experiences. After repentance, one must forever relinquish the evil habit. Repentance is not accomplished by beating one's breast in self- condemnation or uselessly \"crying over spilled milk\"; it means to so impregnate the mind with the consciousness of the repugnance of evil that one will automatically shrink from even the thought of evil deeds, not to speak of the evil deeds themselves. Unless the mind learns to abhor evil actions, it is very difficult to keep it proof against the al- lurements of temptation. Basically, if a guilty man, being forgiven, repents and does not re- peat his evil actions, then he may eventually be free from acting erro- neously again through the influence of subconscious traces left by the evil activity. He thereby incurs no further bad karma from repetition of that action, and the resulting good karma from improved behavior may at least partiall y lessen the effects of his past wrong actions. But it is evident that if a man finds forgiveness for his evil actions from his fellow being, that may not necessarily assure exemption from suffer- ing from the law of karma which governs his past misbehavior. The only sure way for a person to find freedom from the effects of his bad actions is to strike at them at their roots. The karmic patterns of evil consequences one has created in his brain cells and mind must be cauterized either by divine intervention or by consciously engaging one's will power and life force to erase therein all traces left by evil activities. In addition to faith, devotion, intense prayer, and good actions— as already explained — scientific techniques of meditation are the 659"},{"pageNumber":703,"pageContent":"surest way that man can help himself to burn up all traces of his past evil actions. In deep meditation the mind becomes interiorized and contacts the superconsciousness of the soul. This stimulates the im- pressions of good actions stored up in the consciousness and subcon- sciousness of the brain and counteracts the traces of evil actions there. Attention and life energy are inseparable forces working in the brain and the nervous system during all physical and mental activities of man. When the attention is centralized on a particular sense at- traction, then energy goes outward and becomes identified with that specific sense pleasure. But by deep concentration, whether on a good or an evil thought, the attention becomes interiorized. When an evil thought becomes interiorized by concentration—such as when one broods on a lustful desire, or on a vengeful feeling—it stimulates the impressions of evil actions in the brain, invigorating their fruition while diminishing the effectiveness of good karmic patterns. When a good thought becomes interiorized by deep meditation, the inwardly focused mind withdraws life force from the nervous system and cen- tralizes it in the brain cells; the peaceful, powerful character of the concentrated life force stimulates the harmonious traces of good ac- tions and burns up at the roots the inharmonious traces of evil actions.

There is an exceptional metaphysical technique by which great masters and advanced yogis can do away with the accumulated traces of many, many lives of binding karmic actions. When such an ad- vanced soul in the ecstasy of deep meditation identifies his conscious- ness with God, he changes his status from a human being with karma to a perfect image of God or divine soul. But unless he is completely liberated, he has to revert to human status when he comes down from his meditative ecstasy. So the law of karma with its determinative judg- ment comes to bring punishment to the temporarily changed individ- ual. But that individual says to the intelligent law: \"You can't punish me for the faults of a human being who through delusion I dreamed I was before. By wisdom I have regained consciousness of my true Self, a perfect image of God free from the chains of karma.\" But the law of karma insists: \"Whether you are a master now or were an ordinary human being before, you are still the same individualized being and therefore must pay for your uncompensated past human karma.\" The master, finding himself thus confronted, adopts an ingenious method to \"pay up\" and satisfy all karmic debt against himself. The master or yogi enters a state of soul realization and finds in the ar- chives of his superconsciousness exactly all binding karmic traces of his past actions. He then proceeds to work them out in one or two or many bodies, which he creates in a vision—a true-to-life experience. For example, if for five incarnations the yogi led a worldly life in which material habits were not overcome or desires were yet unful- filled, in his vision he creates five bodies which undergo the necessary experiences and play out the parts of those five different lives in a mat- ter of hours. Then the master says to the law of karma: \"There in the vision, by the intensity of my concentration and divine consciousness, I have experienced in the materialized five lives all results of my karma; now I am free.\" As soon as the karmic effects of evil actions have been manifested and experienced, whether in a self-created conscious dream or vision in a few minutes or hours, or in the ordinary events of life in a num- ber of years, the karmic law has been satisfied and the penitent man is \"forgiven,\" freed from that particular karmic debt. Souls who are bound by ignorance do not learn the redeeming les- son of an experience even when it is repeated several times during many years—or lives! But the wise man by deep concentration attains realization of the truth in an experience in a few minutes. 661"},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"This unique vision-method of working out one's karma is not an option available to the ordinary aspiring devotee; it can be performed only by the highly advanced who are in tune with the Cosmic Con- sciousness and thus have complete control over the all-creative Cos- mic Energy, by which they can materialize visions or copies of actual- ities by the power of will. Occasionally, highly developed souls, by the same method, can offer their advanced consciousness to work out karma of others in a condensed, accelerated, manner. 5. There is a fifth way by which great masters can work out the traces of their actions when they have also taken onto themselves the karma of others. Masters and saviors such as Jesus can offer their bod- ies to experience not only their own karma but also the karma of oth- ers to help them toward liberation. The crucifixion of Jesus informs us of one such example. Jesus was not crucified by the will of God to fulfill some dramatic cosmic plan. His suffering on the cross was due to some of his own actions and the taking onto himself of some of the consequences of the sinful actions of his disciples and followers. Jesus knew that his preaching the truth in defiance of political authority and against the canons and traditions of religion would inevitably attract the karma of death; in his incarnate work, he had created a cause that would by the law and purview of the times command a fatal conse- quence. He also knew that by forgiving the evil actions of his disciples and others he had taken on their karmic debt which he would have to pay with suffering in his own body. He consciously, for the sake of highest gain in God-consciousness for himself and others and for working out the karma of himself and others, permitted his body to be crucified. By that supreme sacrifice, he was freed from the cosmic constraints of his mortal incarnation and regained immortality for himself and others. On the higher plane of his immortality and om- nipresence, Jesus, as a world savior, as with other saviors and great masters, continues his mission of redeeming souls. It is evident there is much involved regarding the forgiving of sins by God and by the advanced consciousness of man. The salient consolation is that every human being has absolute surety about his final emancipation if he tries his utmost to help re- deem himself. Man is essentially and eternally made in the image of God; the sins of a million lives cannot erase the perfection of his soul.

Immanent in the Holy Ghost is the conscious reflection of Deity, the Christ Intelligence, by which that Cosmic Vibratory Power is guided to evolve all manifestations of goodness in the world. The con- scious Satanic Power spawns and directs the evil forces of the world, fight- Ahriman), the Evil, or Destructive, Spirit. The demons are in constant battle with Ahura Mazda (later called Ormazd), the Good Lord. \"The hierarchy of demons in Judaism, which is rooted in ancient Middle Eastern and Zoroastrian demonology after the postexilic period (after 538 BC), is quite varied. The prince of the forces of evil (Hebrew shedim, meaning 'demons' and applie d to for- eign gods, or se'irim, meaning 'hairy demons'), who often were believed to inhabit desert wastes, ruins, and graves and to inflict humanity with various physical, psycho- logical, and spiritual disorders, was called by different names: Satan (the Antagonist), Belial (the spirit of perversion, darkness, and destruction), Mastema (Enmity, or Oppo- sition), and other names. Though the Old Testament refers to Satan as the prosecutor of God's celestial court (Zech. 3; Job 1-2), a hierarchy of demons under Satan or other princes of evil was developed in intertestamental literature and later Judaism. \"The hierarchy of demons in Christianity is based on various sources: Jewish, Zoroastrian, Gnostic (a syncretistic religious dualistic-belief system in which matter is viewed as evil, the spirit good, and salvation as being attainable through esoteric knowledge, or gnosis), and the indigenous religions that succumbed to Christian mis- sionizing. In the New Testament, Jesus speaks of Beelzebub as the chief of demons and equates him with Satan. In the European Middle Ages and the Reformation period, various hierarchies of demons were developed, such as that associated with the seven deadly sins: Lucifer (pride), Mammon (avarice), Asmodeus (lechery), Satan (anger), Beelzebub (gluttony), Leviathan (envy), and Belphegor (sloth). \"The Islamic hierarchy of demons is headed by Iblis (the devil), who also is called Shaytan (Satan) or 'aduw Allah ('Enemy of God'). Based to a great extent on Jewish and Christian demonology, Iblis became the leader of a host of jinn, spiritual beings that generally bode evil. \"In Hinduism, the asuras are the demons who oppose the devas (the gods). Among the various classes of asuras are nagas (serpent demons), Ahi (the demon of drought), and Kamsa (an archdemon). Demons that afflict humans include the raksasas (grotesque beings who haunt cemeteries, impel the performance of foolish acts, and attack sadhus (saintly men) and pishacas (being s who haunt places where violent deaths have occurred). \"Buddhists often view thei r demons as forces that inhibit the achievement of Nir- vana (bliss, or the extinction of desire); an important example is Mara, an arch tempter, who, with his daughters, Rati (Desire), Raga (Pleasure), and Tanha (Restlessness), at- tempted to dissuade Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, from achieving his enlighten- ment.

Though God is the Aggregate Creator—nothing can exist outside His consciousness—still He has given man freedom to align himself with either the divine Christ Intelligence in creation or the demonic in- telligence of Satan. In that sense, man participates actively in the per- petuation of evil. The lives of individuals declare their good or evil na- ture by the degree of their seeming separation from blissful immortal Spirit—that is, the degree to which they respond to and absorb the re- deeming power of Holy Ghost or the outgoing force of cosmic delu- sion. Through gradual evolution in repeated incarnations on earth and in the heavenly astral spheres, souls who respond to the divine-love pulls of Christ-imbued Holy Ghost progress to ultimate Self-realization, the perfect manifestation of the image of the Divine within them. Increase of delusive separation from God, and consequent evils of suffering manifesting from the bad karma created by an individual's careless or willful wrong choices and actions, are the fate of those who attune their lives with the outgoing satanic force. Extremely evil indi- viduals, who continue to pull to the farthest depths away from God, karmically draw themselves after death to dark astral spheres of night- marish demonic horrors and conflicts—or in rare cases reincarnate on earth for one lifetime in animal forms of suitable expression for their self-chosen evils. As animals have no free will, being guided primarily by instinct, they accrue no karma for their actions; therefore, this tem- porary devolution of a degraded soul burns out some of its evil karma without the acquirement of further sin. As there are various kinds of angelic beings in the astral world due to souls' different degrees of Self-realization attained during earth ex- istence, so also there are various kinds of degraded astral beings: petty evil spirits and powerful evil spirits, whose wicked behavior has con- signed them—for a karmically determined span of time—to a hellish after-death state. Both angelic beings and devilish spirits do at times come to aid or to harm, respectively, virtuous or misbehaving persons on earth.

The life of Jesus demonstrated the constant choices that man must make between good and evil; as when he was mercilessly cursed and abused by evil people, he nevertheless did not use his divine force to destroy them. Instead, he summoned his love and infinite divine compassion to say, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\" Jesus pointed out the obvious flaw in the accusation that he used the power of Satan to cast out from persons the evils of Satan; such a divided purpose, working against itself, could not long endure. Beelze- bub certainly does not want individuals to be free from the miseries per- petrated by his evil forces, which in effect makes his palliative offerings of material gains and pleasures all the more tempting and desirable. Jesus further cautions that if they impute to him the casting out of devils by Beelzebub, then they imply the same must be true of other healers; those wise persons belonging to their community who have healed others and cast out devils must likewise have done so by the power of the prince of devils. When these doers of good works hear this, they will certainly condemn those accusers who maintained that devils are cast out and sickness healed by the power of Beelzebub. Jesus then avers: \"But if I cast out evil disembodied souls or heal other af- flictions caused by the evil force by awakening the invisible all-flowing power of the spiritual presence of God, then those so healed will feel in their consciousness not only release from evil, but the presence of the Almighty Cosmic Consciousness.\" Jesus' pronouncement that \"Every kingdom...city or house di- vided against itself shall not stand\" is a great law that governs all suc- cessful households, cities, business and religious organizations, na- tions, and races. If a group of people wants to retain its individuality and achieve its goals, each one should act in agreement with the col- lective aims.

When man fully realizes the relation between conscious- ness and the body, he will understand why the separation of con- sciousness and life from the body disintegrates the bodily cells, and will know how to remodel the body by introducing life and mind into it at will, even if it has undergone physical death. The attainment of conscious immortality as evidenced in the resurrection of his physical body is the foremost \"sign\" and metaphysical demonstration that Jesus has shown to the world for all times, to awaken faith and give courage and hope to those who would strive and earn by meditation their own immortality in the kingdom of God. \"The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, behold, a greater than Jonah is here. \"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the ut- termost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here\" (Matthew 12:41-42). J esus emphasized that the men of Nineveh who repented of their material habits and awakened their spirituality in response to the preaching of Jonah would judge and condemn the generation of Jesus for not appreciating the Christ amongst them, greater than Jonah, fully awakened in Spirit. The Queen of Sheba who came from a dis- tant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon* would likewise condemn Jesus' generation for not responding to the Christ whose wisdom out- shone even that of the proverbially wise Solomon. Though all souls, ordinary laymen and masters alike, are potentially the same perfect images of God, their differences are manifestations of the degree of their realization and expression of soul qualities. Jesus Christ fully manifested all the qualities of soul and Spirit; the spiritual conscious- ness of Solomon and Jonah had yet to attain that perfection. * I Kings 10:1-10. 681"},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":"\"When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.

Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation\" (Matthew 12:43-45). J esus here is referring to tenuous spiritual gains that degenerate into the arrogance of a false superiority. He saw that some souls among the people of his time had attained sufficient spiritual development to contact the inner vibratory blessing of the Holy Ghost, which re- moved some of their spiritual blemishes and cast Spiritual dangers of ar- out the inner devil of sense attachment. But Jesus rogant self-sufficiency notes that although they had temporarily exorcised and pride  the devil of material attachment, their egregious at- titude toward him, and prejudicial failure to recog- nize the Spirit in him, would bring back not only their material con- sciousness but even greater devils of ignorance, sense attachment, pride, self-sufficiency, spiritual indifference, and lack of spiritual ap- preciation and spiritual judgment, when by spiritual receptivity they could instead have transformed themselves with the enlightening help of Jesus. Jesus admonishes: \"O ye people of this generation, your erstwhile spiritual development has made you self-complacent and stagnant so that you do not avail yourselves of the God-sent opportunity of re- deeming your souls by attunement with the Christ-manifestation within me. Because of your ill-conceived arrogance, you will suffer even greater ignorance from its possessing devils than you had before.\" Jesus points out that man is a free agent and that by appreciation and contact of great masters he can develop himself; or, by spiritual indifference to God's emissaries and their teachings, he can remain as ignorant as ever; or, by becoming hidebound in narrow theological be- liefs and traditions, he can imagine himself to be self-sufficient, ignor- ing the salvation-yielding teachings of great masters. 682"},{"pageNumber":725,"pageContent":"While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.

The teaching of Jesus, and all great masters, is that God should come first, before every desire and before everyone. The engagement with God in meditation must be one's most important consideration, for no one can keep any other engagement in life without borrowing brain activity and energy, mental and muscular power, from God. No human love should be held as greater than love for God; for it is God who is the Giver of all those we love. If we love our relatives dearly for their lovable natures, how much more should we love God who wisely selected for us those loving parents, brothers, and sisters. We should not forget that God is our perpetual Parent in the past, present, and future times, who during many incarnations looks after us through the instrumentality of countless parents and other familial relations. Those who adore family in utter forgetfulness of God within those per- sons will be disillusioned when death will sever those family ties. It is the tie with God, invisible but invulnerable, that is everlasting. Jesus wanted to emphasize in the minds of the multitude his real- ization of this truth when they cried out, \"Behold, thy mother and thy brethren.\" God alone, whom he perceived everywhere, was his real and only Relative behind all incarnation-imposed family relations. Reflect, if one dies and is reborn to the family next door to his previous home, his dearly beloved former family would treat him as a stranger. The mysterious workings of reincarnation are meant to make it absolutely evident that it is God alone who, by instilling instincts of affection in the earthly mother and father, Himself looks after the baby through that parental affinity. And by extension, when one is attuned to God one will find again in Him all those soul-expressions of God whom he thought were lost to him. Jesus wanted to express his consciousness that he could consider none other than God Himself as his Heavenly Father-Mother, and that whosoever lived in tune with God he considered as his divine relative. Jesus thereby affirmed not only the Fatherhood of God but also the brotherhood of man. All devotees who feel God as their own common Heavenly Father find themselves united by the familial divine cord of lasting universal brotherhood. 684"},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"DISCOURSE 37 \"And He Spake IVIany Tilings Unto Tlhem in ParaM 99 .es Jesus' Sermon Alomt tke King A om of H eaven Parable of the Sowers Spiritual Truths IBless Mail to the Degree of His Mental Receptivity • Jesus Deeper Explanations The Vibratory Seed of Wistlom Received Through ^Contact With Aum • The Wheat and the Taress JU 'estroying the Weeds of Bad Hah its in the Subconscious Mind • The \"Leaven of M ed itative Joy Uplifts the Conscious, Subconscious, and Superconscious blinds • The \"Harvest\" of Ciood and Bad ICarma Reaped at \"the End of the World\" \"Unto those souls that are yet wholly identified with their physical bodies, all these subtle perceptions about the states of heaven, Christ Consciousness, and Cosmic Consciousness are explained in coverings of parables, lest those persons scorn, for lack of understanding, that sacred knowledge of fully revealed truth\""},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"' I f- ' T he same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side .

In such persons, the teachings sprouted into some short-lived, but not deep-rooted, spiritual experiences. When the sun of daily material habits rose, those experiences were fatally scorched. Because they did not form deep-rooted habits in the super- consciousness of the soul, they withered away due to the lack of nour- ishment of continued devotion and spiritual aspiration in new acts of meditation and fervent effort. \"And some seeds of my teachings were sown on the mental soil of persons filled with prolific thorns of spiritual distrust and theolog- ical doubts. Thus, though those seeds sprouted somewhat in such the- oretically inquisitive minds, those spiritual inspirations could not sur- vive when choked by the overwhelmingly predominant thorns of theological skepticism. The ill-fated plants of inspiration could bear no fruits of divine wisdom or God-contact. \"Other seeds of my teachings fell on the soil of mentalities fur- rowed and ploughed by receptivity, watered with continuous goodness and regular, deep spiritual effort at meditation, and hedged in by good company so that the animals and birds of material minds and doubts could not invade and destroy the burgeoning garden of soul qualities. In those protected, receptive minds, the seeds of truth grew into trees laden with the fruits of Self-realization. These human trees, strong and sturdy, could withstand any onslaughts while providing an increasing yield of wisdom, ever new bliss, and advancement in divine attainment of spiritual qualities—thirty, sixty, one hundredfold.\" Jesus' analogy makes it plain that a true disciple, by virtue of a dedicated spiritual life, is fertile ground in which a God-sent guru's teachings can be successfully sown.

What makes the difference in receptivity is whether one's desire and effort to know truth are strong. The most responsive are those who have an ardent desire for God. The parable of the sower and the seed points out how the various good or bad habits of persons affect whether the soil of their minds is fertile or stony. Even if one feels thwarted by bad habits that are al- ready formed, that opposition can be overcome by one's strong spiri- tual desire and faithful adherence to the guru's teachings. The highest intelligence is to be able to change what needs to be changed in one's life so that continual soul progress is possible. Receptive students will definitely make progress with the help of the guru. Resistance from bad habits of the past may make it difficult to obey the divine teachings, but if sincere students make the effort in spite of the inclination to resist, they change. Resistance is formidable if they listen to their moods; but if instead they listen receptively to the wisdom of their guru, who wants for them only their highest good, every seed of divine awakening he plants within them will take root in their fertile consciousness. \"Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.\" Jesus meant: \"He who is receptive and hears with spiritual understanding what I say, let him appreciate the truth in my words and live by them for complete soul- emancipation.\" It is useless to listen haphazardly to the teachings of Jesus or give them only scant attention. A follower of Christ should be earnest and diligent like a spiritual husbandman, employing the art of growing plants of Self-realization by plowing and seeding the con- sciousness with the proper technique of meditation and moral and spiritual living. The yield will be the fruits of divine wisdom, bliss, and complete spiritual liberation. And the disciples came, and said unto him, \" Why speakest thou unto them in parables He answered and said unto them, \"Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.

W hen Jesus was asked by his disciples why he taught the people in the subtle illustrations of parables, he answered, \"Because it is so ordained that you who are my real disciples, living a spiritualized life and disciplining your ac- tions according to my teachings, deserve by virtue of your inner awakening in your meditations to un- derstand the truth of the arcane mysteries of heaven and how to attain the kingdom of God, Cosmic Consciousness hidden behind the vibratory creation of cosmic delusion.

The state of Cosmic Consciousness can be felt by souls who in meditation have withdrawn their minds from the re- gion of the body and gone beyond the subconscious and concentra- tion on the superconscious bliss perceptions of the astral kingdom of heaven and the immanent Christ state. But unto those souls that are yet wholly identified with their physical bodies, all these subtle per- ceptions about the states of heaven, Christ Consciousness, and Cos- mic Consciousness are explained in coverings of parables, lest those persons scorn, for lack of understanding, that sacred knowledge of fully revealed truth. Unreceptive persons would not even try to fathom the deeper truths by which they could be free from their bad habits of materiality, \"lest they should be converted\" from body-identified souls into spiritual beings, through the grace of God and their own effort. Jesus then cites an exact law that governs all habits. \"Whosoever hath\" created a habit of spirituality shall attract perceptions of Self- realization from within himself; and having the taste of soul wisdom and bliss, shall grow more spiritual habits, attracting greater mani- festations of soul unfoldment. \"But whosoever hath not\"—that is, cares not to possess or create spiritual habits of meditation and liv- ing—must lose, owing to the lack of tasting the spiritual joy of Self- realization felt in meditation, any spiritual habit that might be latent within him.* How do the receptive perceive truth, whereas the unreceptive \"seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they under- stand\"? The ultimate truths of heaven and the kingdom of God, the reality that lies behind sensory perception and beyond the cogitations of the rationalizing mind, can only be grasped by intuition—awaken- ing the intuitive knowing, the pure comprehension, of the soul. \"Therefore, O ye my disciples, I speak in parables, covering the meat of truth with the shell of mystical words, esoteric illustrations.

They are so enamored of their material delusion that they fear the message of Jesus, which proposes to take them out of their long-lived familiar existence in ignorance.* Jesus praised, in contrast, the consciousness of his disciples: \"Blessed are your eyes of wisdom, for they see the truth; and blessed are your ears of receptivity, for you listen understandingly to truth.

God as Spirit, formless and infinite, does not commonly speak in words but vibrates His consciousness as perceptions through intelligible vibratory sound understood only by devotees with devel- oped intuition. \"The sower, the advanced devotee, is one who has attained con- tact with the Cosmic Sound and Wisdom in meditation. Those by the wayside where the word is sown are devotees who have temporarily meditated deeply and for a little while have received in their con- sciousness through the intuition-permeated feelings of the heart, the Vibratory Wisdom and Cosmic Sound proceeding from within.

Then Satan as cosmic delusion came to them, immediately bringing back the consciousness of the body and taking away from within them the perception of that Vibratory Wisdom and Cosmic Sound, which had come to free them, but which they had failed to ap- preciate as a manifestation of the blessed Cosmic Consciousness of God. \"When the seed of Cosmic Vibration was first perceived by less prepared devotees in whose minds were stony-hard material habits, contact with the strange wisdom-vibrations and cosmic sound in med- itation gave delight to those devotees. But they did not meditate long enough and continuously enough so that they could feel the Cosmic Vibration not only in their conscious mind but in the deeper levels of their subconscious and superconscious minds. \"Such devotees, meditating for a relatively little while on the vi- bratory manifestation of God, find that afterward, when tempted by their habits of material pleasures, or when afflicted with diseases of the body, or persecuted by poverty or spiritual tests, they ceased to meditate, and the diverse sprouts of inner vibratory communion, hav- ing formed no deep roots, withered and fell away.\" Those devotees who hear the Cosmic Vibration and experience temporarily the pleasure in it, often undergo a mental comparison be- tween the joy of meditation and the pleasures and habits of the body; but uncommitted devotees, not persevering long enough to become strongly accustomed to the perception of God as the Cosmic Wisdom and Cosmic Bliss of meditation, succumb to the long-familiar sensory demands and pleasures of the body. \"And there are some devotees whose mental field is filled with the thorns of temporal interests and worries. These devotees who succeed in contacting the cosmic vibratory manifestation of God in meditation are subject to being gradually overwhelmed by the influences of the world, with its concerns and lures of happiness promised by wealth and the pleasure-giving lusts of life. Those devotees who succumb, kill their meditation perceptions of the vibratory peace-manifestations of God be- fore they can become fruitful with ultimate wisdom and emancipation. \"Lastly, there are those supremely successful devotees whose men- tal ground is made fertile and tilled by good company and good thoughts and consistency in deep meditation.

For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad. If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.\" And he said unto them, \"Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given. For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath\" (Mark 4:21-25).

This enemy emerged from and then secretly disappeared again within his sub- conscious mind. In the course of time when the blades of spiritual de- velopment grew appreciably, beginning to produce fruits of divine bliss and wisdom, there appeared concurrently an abundance of tares of in- ner doubts, vexations, fears, and a sense of hopelessness about being able to attain God-communion and solve the mysteries of life. So the servants of self-control and spiritual discipline belonging to the household or consciousness of the devotee arose within him and vibrated their question unto him, \"O devotee, did you think that you sowed only seeds of Self-realization in your field of consciousness? Then whence did these weeds of spiritual obstacles arise in you?\" The devotee, in introspection, spoke unto his spiritual self-control and di- vine aspiration: \"An enemy of subconscious bad habits has secretly grown these weeds along with the crop of my spiritual habits.\" Through introspection, the spiritual servants, with their desire to meditate, intimated unto the devotee: \"O master of the household of your consciousness and thoughts, do you desire us to busy ourselves in weeding out from the subconscious mind the deep-rooted tares?\" * Tares: \"This bearded darnel, lolium temulentum, is common in Palestine and resem- bles wheat except that the grains are black.

In sleep, the subconscious mind, being mechanical, uses the retired energy to dis- pel only temporarily the troublesome mental aberrations. In deep med- itation the superconscious mind uses the relaxed energy concentrated in the brain to penetrate into the brain grooves where habits are secreted, consciously seeking out and cauterizing the unwanted evil proclivities. \"O ye divine perceptions, having separated out and destroyed all the tares of spiritual obstruction, gather up the wheat of divine wis- dom and bliss grown in the field of consciousness and store it in the expansive receptacle of my superconsciousness.\" Additional correlative parable included in the Gospel According to St. Mark: And he said, \"So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.

But in the mention of the kingdom of God in this present verse, Jesus speaks of the ad- vancement of those devotees who go beyond the heavenly contact of vibratory creation to become one with God the Father Consciousness, Cosmic Consciousness, the Blissful Infinity beyond all creation. Jesus relates metaphorically how the kingdom of God is attained. When the spiritual man sows the seeds of superconscious ecstasy— oneness with the supersensory realizations of the heavenly forces of the astral regions — into the soil of his consciousness, and feels that state of astral ecstasy equally during sleep and wakefulness, he will find that the astral ecstasy will mature into contact with the Christ In- telligence hidden in all vibratory creation and only thinly veiled in the manifestations of Heaven. Automatically, the Christ state will grow into the cosmic consciousness of God the Father lying beyond cre- ation; for the \"earth,\" or astral perception within the body, brings forth by astral ecstasy the fruit of the consciousness of Christ Intelli- gence and gradually of the consciousness of Cosmic Consciousness be- yond vibratory creation. The devotee develops through various stages, just as a seed of corn develops into the blade, then the ear, and then the full corn. The blade refers to the superconsciousness of astral ecstasy with its per- ception of divine lights and vibrations, the first manifestations in the consciousness of the advancing devotee. The second stage is marked by the contact of Christ Intelligence in all vibration, which is referred to in the parable of the corn as \"the ear.\" In the third state, the devotee contacts God's consciousness be- yond creation, which is the \"full corn\" in Jesus' metaphor.

These nascent ecstasies of super- consciousness, becoming firmly rooted in the 'earth' of daily ecstatic meditation, begin to grow and become a potentially effectual part of the conscious and subconscious makeup of the physical body. Such perceptions may seem preliminarily to be less significant than all other seeds of sense happiness or material experiences, but when the tiny 'mustard seed' of the inspiration and joy felt in daily meditation matures within the soil of human consciousness, it becomes su- premely predominant in its influence over all other herbs of human sense perceptions. *Cf. parallel reference in Luke 13:18-19. 705"},{"pageNumber":750,"pageContent":"\"It shoots its superconscious branches of joy into the conscious and subconscious perceptions and experiences of one's everyday exis- tence, proliferating until it becomes 'a tree' of cosmic joy and wisdom.

There is nothing similar with which to compare that state, ex- cept to say that its potential realization lies as if in a relatively infinitesimal spiritual 'mustard seed' with its burgeoning power of proliferation.

The human mind, with its limitation, cannot comprehend that state of ecstasy. The mind and human consciousness must become expanded into oneness with Cosmic Consciousness in order to realize the kingdom of God.\" Another parable spake he unto them: \"The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three mea- sures of meal, till the whole was leavened\" (Matthew 13:33).* \"T ^he kingdom of astral ecstasy and superconscious joy of medi- tation is like unto 'leaven' which the devotee introduces into the 'three measures of meal,' the three divisions of consciousness—con- — scious, subconscious, and superconscious.

In cosmic ecstasy, the ecstasy of Cosmic Vibration, the devotee joyously feels all vibratory creation as his own body. In Christ ecstasy, the devotee feels himself merged in the transcendent reflected image of God's Intelligence as Christ Consciousness omnipresent in creation. In God the Father ec- stasy the devotee feels one with the infinity of Cosmic Consciousness beyond vibratory creation, with its indescribable state of joy: \"He who knows, knows.

Jesus conveyed in terms and illustrations familiar to his genera- tion the eternal verities he received directly from God. The ordinary people of his time could not understand, for example, the differences between the kingdom of heaven attained by superconscious ecstasy * \"Spoken by the prophet\" refers to Psalms 78:2. 707"},{"pageNumber":752,"pageContent":"and the transcendent kingdom of God-consciousness. Jesus taught the deeper truths to his disciples when they were alone with him, the same truths he guarded with parables when given to the nonunderstanding masses, but discernable to all deserving advanced souls who could hear the underlying wisdom with ears of intuition. Ordinary people, to whom deep metaphysical truths were unintel- ligible, received the parables as simple illustrations from which guid- • -  ance they could better their lives and rouse their Without soul intui- faith in God. To this day, the words of Christ are re- tion, the ultimate ceived similarly, with varying literal and theological truths remain a mys- interpretations around which have grown so many tery to man denominations and sects. The reference of Matthew to \"things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world\" declares the ultimate nature of truth as prov- able only by the infallible perception of soul intuition, the direct expe- rience of truth by becoming one with it. Without this inner realization, truth remains a mystery to man, only dimly imagined or otherwise sur- mised by the intellect. Thus, to understand the one and only one per- ception of Jesus Christ behind the words of his teachings, devotees must be able to perceive through their intuition in the sanctuary of meditation the revealed mysteries of which he spoke in parables. The very fact that it was to his close disciples alone that Jesus \"ex- pounded all things\" o f those truths he had hidden in the parables given to the multitudes tells modern would-be disciples of Christ that they need not be satisfied with receiving the same revamped superfi- cial sermons at Sunday morning church services. A minister with mere theoretical knowledge of the scriptures is gratified if he can momen- tarily inspire his congregatio n with what he infers or imagines to be the truth taught by Jesus Christ. But a real divine spokesman, medi- tating to become imbued with Christ Consciousness, inspires others to become with him a disciplined band of truth demonstrators who by meditation congregate in the inner sanctuary of silence to learn from God, who speaks through the lips of the devotee's intuition, the mys- teries of life and soul liberation. A true house of God will not be satisfied only with preaching the- ories about God; it will teach the art of God-contact, of how to make the soul of ma n an illuminated temple wherein God Himself will come and deliver sermons through His voice of intuition to the sincerely seeking devotional thoughts of the devotee. 708"},{"pageNumber":753,"pageContent":"Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, \"Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.\" He answered and said unto them, \"He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; the enemy that soweth them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear\" (Matthew 13:36-43). HPhe parable of the tares is explained to his close disciples by Jesus ^L in an expanded metaphorical imagery: \"He who cultivates the good seed of God-wisdom (the good children) in his own consciousness (the world) finds the body (son of man) attuned with Cosmic Consciousness (the kingdom); even as my body (the Son of man) is at- tuned, and as I have come to sow my teachings and my life in the field of the world consciousness. \"But the cosmic delusion of Satan implants ignorance, the weeds of worries, anger, fear, mental darkness, in the minds of evil-bent individuals. \"The inimical cosmic ignorance is the devil, the archangel of God who misused his independence and created the seeds of all evils to en- trap man in delusion. When souls leave this earth at the 'end of the world'—after finishing earthly existence at the time of death, or by otherwise transcending worldly consciousness—they reap the harvest of their good or bad karma. The reapers are the truth-revealing bright angels of soul intuition. \"In the after-death state, the astral-bodied consciousness of souls with evil karma, gathered together in the astral world, will burn in the fire of sorrows resultin g from their own ignorance.

They will wail and re- monstrate about their errors and the sad state of their astral existence. Those that can draw on their store of subverted good karma and spir- itual desire, and will repent and consciously try to embrace righteous- ness, will shine forth as the sun of wisdom manifested in their soul through contact with the consciousness of God.* Those who have ears to hear, let them hear; God is not a God of vengeance but of redemp- tion, who aids souls whether they punish or reward themselves ac- cording to their own activities.\" A kind and merciful God would never throw a sinner into an eter- nally tormenting furnace of fire; even the greatest sinner in the after- death state is an immutable, immortal soul and has a luminous astral body that cannot be burned by any physical fire.f Souls encrusted with wicked karma not only can repent and heal the burns of their evil ways in this life by the salve of wisdom and peace found in meditation, but also, in the after-death state, they can find redemption when they are awakened by the angels of God and are given the opportunity in their astral existence to repent and resurrect their buried good karma. Evil- bound souls usually die in an unconscious transition from the body, but the after-death unconscious state is temporarily removed by angels of God to give souls suffering subconsciously in the fire of their own wicked tendencies a chance to strive toward God-consciousness by as- tral meditation. If they are overwhelmed by their habitual preference for ungodly mortal ways, that door of opportunity is quickly closed, leaving them closeted in their karmic destiny. This parable is ambiguously complex in its broad scope of mean- ing of \"the end of the world,\" as intended by Jesus. The literal end of the world could refer either to the extinction of the earth after it has * \"In those who have banished ignorance by Self-knowledge, their wisdom, like the il- luminating sun, makes manifest the Supreme Self\" (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bha- gavad Gita V:I6). fThe true meaning of the various Biblical references to \"hellfire\" is explained in Dis- courses 48 and 68. 710"},{"pageNumber":755,"pageContent":"completed its aeonic cycles of usefulness to creation; or further, to the dissolution of the entire universe when Spirit ceases Its creative dream- ings after trillions of years of manifestation. The vast extent of these two possibilities is hardly relevant, though true in principle, to the warning given by Jesus to evildoers to change their ways. The \"end of the world\" is more usefully understood as applied to that time when the world ends in the consciousness of each individual, temporarily or permanently, as the case may be. This occurs in the fol- lowing ways: In deep sleep when the superconsciousness of the soul be- comes semiconscious, reminding the subconscious of man's essential perfection hidden in the tares of worldly consciousness; in righteous freedom from earthly desires and attachments, breaking karmic bonds that tie man to the world; in death, when the world recedes from one's consciousness, being replaced by astral perceptions; in samadhi medi- tation when God alone is experienced as the Sole Reality; and in the highes t nirvikalpa samadhi state in which one transcends delusion even while engaged in material activities. The metaphor given by Jesus ap- plies to any and all of these ways to experience the end of the world, and to the condition of man pertinent to each. In consequence, the above parable can also be explained as follows: The devotee who sows the good seeds of wisdom in his consciousness and in his bodily activities becomes a good example in the world, and all his children of good tendencies are saturated with the blissful state of the soul's intrinsic contact with Cosmic Consciousness. And the tares or weeds are those mental tendencies of selfishness, greed, lust that spring up as children of wicked ignorance born of sense contact with Sa- tan's delusive temptations; they arise in the consciousness of man with- out his participation in creating them, only in succumbing to them. In creating these evils, Satan fights God everywhere, in man and in nature, resisting and marring God's perfection and harmony at every opportu- nity. At the en d of worldly consciousness, the devotee will gather in his divine harvest through his reapers of angelic intuition, Self-realization and wisdom. He will burn in the newly kindled fire of his wisdom the tares or weeds of accumulated karmic effects of his past evil actions. The God-saturated son of man, the devotee, will send his angels of intuitive perceptions deep into the subconscious and superconscious minds to gather all hidden offending and sinning tendencies of past lives and these will be burned in the flames of the devotee's fiery wis- dom spread throughout his conscious and subconscious and super- 711"},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"conscious minds. His evil inner tendencies will wail and rebel at being consumed in the fire of wisdom. Then the pure righteousness of the devotee will come out from behind the clouds of all past evil karma and shine forth as the sun of cosmic wisdom, ablaze with pure tran- scendental consciousness in the kingdom of God the Father, felt in the union of the body, mind, and soul with Christ Intelligence in creation and Cosmic Consciousness beyond creation.* Those who have spiri- tual ears, let them hear and absorb into their consciousness through direct experience the truth of these words. \"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. \"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it\" (Matthew 13:44-46). \"T ^he astral kingdom of heavenly forces and heavenly percep- tion, experienced by the devotee in superconscious ecstasy, is filled with rich spiritual treasure, angels of God, departed saintly souls and masters, revelations of the mysteries of life and death and of the —— comings and goings of all manifestations, hidden God-realization: the behind the field of material consciousness and sense \"pearl of great price\" perception.

The center of an individual's consciousness is in the con- scious mind during wakefulness, the subconscious The ever-wakeful om- mind during sleep, and in superconsciousness dur- niscience of illumined ing deep meditation. When an individual is con- masters centrated in the state of wakefulness, his subcon- sciousness and superconsciousness remain in the background. When he is asleep, hi s consciousness and superconsciousness remain in the background. But a master like Jesus, whose center of consciousness is Cosmic Consciousness, is omniscient in Spirit whether his body is awake or asleep. He is able to watch his body sleeping and to be aware of any present or far-flung condition or circumstance, even as God watches all human beings and notes equally the grandeur of evolving universes and the fall of a single sparrow. God's omnipresent consciousness knows the life and death, the sleep and wakeful activities, of all creatures present in Him, even as we know all our thoughts within our one mind. A human being with his one self-contained life is conscious of the sensations of his body or of pain that may occur in any conglomerate of the twenty-seven thou- sand billion cells of his body; God's consciousness, encompassing all space, knows every happening, even in any one of the tiniest atoms among the multitudinous creations in the cosmos. Jesus questioned his disciples' faith because they did not realize that, even though his body slept, his consciousness was awake with the Father in th e storm, in the boat, in the disciples—in everything. If the disciples had had faith in the omnipresent consciousness of Jesus, *Cf. additional parallel reference in Matthew 8:23-27. 721"},{"pageNumber":766,"pageContent":"they would have known his inner consciousness was aware of their plight and that he was, even in that dire moment, protecting them. To reanimate their paralyzed trust, Jesus admonished: \"Why do you permit ignorance to assault you with fear and steal away your faith in the all-protecting omnipresent power and consciousness within me?\" With the sanction of the Divine Will to prove the omnipotence of God within him, Jesus rose and addressed the sea, commanding the forces of nature, winds and water: \"O ye boisterous wind and tumul- tuous sea, governed by cosmic forces, you who are created and active according to the will of God, the Father with whom I am One, I com- mand you to change your vibration and be peaceful and quiet.\" \"Peace, be still.\" As soon as Jesus, with his omnipresent con- sciousness and the omnipotent will of God within him, vibrated peace, the God-guided forces of nature immediately fol- lowed his example, becoming still in vibrations of calmness. It seems to ordinary persons that the ele- mental processes of nature are the result of the workings of coincidental blind forces without any plan. But it is evident that the harmony in nature, the routine of seasons, the mathematics of planetary order, the suste- nance of life, reveal an intelligent law and cosmic plan of God by which they are governed. Only an obstinate rationalist ascribes to chance the law and order in the universe and in the tidy life-supporting generosity of this earth; the divine man consciously perceives God in everything upholding by His divine will the scrupulous laws and forces of His wonderworks. Hence, Jesus, being a master, not in imagination but by Self- realization of his oneness with Spirit, could evoke the will of God manifested in his own will to control the raging storm and waves. I was blessed to witness the control of nature by my great master, Swami Sri Yukteswarji. Once when I was with Master at his seaside ashram in Puri on the Bay of Bengal, he asked me to lead his students in a summer solstice procession along the beach and through the streets of the town. The weather boded the expected seasonal heat, with not the slightest prospect of rain or clouds. I remonstrated with Master that it would be next to impossible for the disciples to main- tain any decorum while walking barefoot on the fiery sands and city streets. Master replied, \"I will tell you a secret. The Lord shall send an umbrella of clouds; you all shall walk in comfort.\" 722 All forces of nature subject to the God- given power in man's soul"},{"pageNumber":767,"pageContent":"As soon as the religious procession started, the entire sky became overcast as though by magic, and a very light rain fell, cooling the streets and scorching seashore. To the astonishment and immense gratitude of all, the comforting rain continued throughout the two-hour procession; but the instant we returned to the hermitage, the sky burned again with the oriental sun and the parade route seared with hostile intent. Master ascribed no personal- credit to his part in the many miracles I saw him perform. As to taming the relentless Indian sun, he remarked simply, as was his wont: \"You see how God feels for us. The Lord responds to all and works for all. Just as He sent rain at my plea, so He fulfills any sin- cere desire of the devotee. Seldom do men realize how often God heeds their prayers. He is not partial to a few, but listens to everyone who ap- proaches Him trustfully. His children should ever have implicit faith in the loving-kindness of their Omnipresent Father.\" Whether a master prays for a specific response from God, or in di- vine attunement with God wills that desired effect, he activates the manifesting power of the Lord's creative vibration. Long before West- ern science recognized the vibratory essence of matter, the rishis of an- cient India spoke of the whole spectrum of nature as an objectification of Aum, the Primal Sound or Vibratory Word. They showed that all natural phenomena can be controlled by the manipulation of vibration through the use of certain mantras or chants.* Historical documents tell of the remarkable powers possessed by Miyan Tan Sen, sixteenth- century court musician for Akbar the Great. When ordered by the Em- peror to sing a night raga at midday, Tan Sen intoned a mantra that in- stantly caused the whole palace precincts to become enveloped in darkness. Man was made to be lord over nature, and the forces of nature in turn work together to serve man. Man negates his lordship by faulty, self-serving stewardship of his earthly environment. He guides nature, though usually unknowingly, not only by his actions but also by the vi- brations of his thoughts. The calamitous effects of floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, and all othe r natural disasters are results of the cumula- tive evil actions and thoughts of earth's human beings. The evils of war, for example, create tremendous negative vibrations that unbalance the * Folklore of all peoples contains references to incantations with power over nature.

Conversely, man's goodness promotes peace, prosperity, well-being. When man becomes master of himself, sublimating the evil vibrations within himself, he re- claims the God-given power in his soul by which he can command from servant Nature—with God's sanction—whatever he so wills. Several thousand years hence in the fourth yuga, the spiritual age of this present world cycle, there will be greater control of the ele- mental processes of nature, both in the earth's environment and in people's lives in general. In the heavenly spheres of the astral world, it is common to control the atmosphere and one's individual state of be- ing. (The astral beings in the lower strata have no such control.) In the higher regions they ca n manipulate the lifetronic light-images and forces according to the power of their will. In the gross material world when one doesn't want rain, it rains; and when the earth needs rain, the sun shines. Imagine living in a world where you can command the storm to come and snow to melt. By control of the astral forces that empower nature, Jesus could calm the ravaging storm and Sri Yuk- teswarji could cool with clouds the searing rays of the sun. While there is a certain degree of uniformity in nature, there is also tremendous vagrancy—unpredictable extremes meant to bring out the conqueror in man, to encourag e him to look behind the apparent disorder and to spiritualize his will with God's will in the malleable heavenly astral forces that activate th e workings of the material universe.

These disembodied astral beings knew the influence of Jesus Christ's consciousness in the astral world. They knew of his power over evil spirits; so they begged him not to condemn them to roam again, without the consciousness of a physical body, in the oceanic depths of black space where they were trammeled in the torments of their own visions of a nightmare existence without a light to guide them. These diabolical spirits crowding the brain of their host were highly delighted with their freedom to run riot among the perceptions of a world full of definite objects, enjoying through the brain of this possessed individual the sensations of sound, light, taste, smell, and touch. They feared being denied a further joyride in the fleshly vehi- cle, which they sent careening through a land of physical sensations and sceneries, and being thrown back into the Hades and nightmare of dark subconscious existence, \"the deep.\" And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the moun- tain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them.

S ince Jesus Christ, by his divine power, was compelling the unclean spirits to leave the body of the madman, they implored him to let them enjoy instead the lesser sensibilities in the bodies of a nearby herd of swine, preferring a transition from the feeling of human sensations to the feeling of animal sensations rather than suddenly to be whirled back into the dark subconscious Hades to which they were con- demned by their evil karma. Jesus acquiesced. Through his help, the unclean spirits then left the brain of th e possessed individual and entered the bodies of the herd of swine.

When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country. Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sit- ting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed. Then the whole mul- titude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again (Luke 8:34-37^. I t was foolish of the people of Gadara to be afraid of Jesus because of their nonunderstanding. What they should have feared was their own ignorance. Had they realized the redeeming power of Jesus, they would have asked him how they could be free from being possessed by ignorance, the devil of devils. Circumspection in spiritual matters is wise, but closed minds are de- plorable. Even in modern times, in the absence of many once-prevalent bizarre superstitions, there are still otherwise educated people who re- main skeptical, even fearful, of a true master who can demonstrate as well as teach the art of attaining advanced states of consciousness in ec- static meditation—as also the God-given powers accompanying those el- evated states. There is nothing akin to superstition, magic, self-hypnosis, mediumistic spiritualism, witchcraft, or any such practices in the spiri- tual science of God-realization and God-union—yoga—as taught by a God-knowing master. It is the purest of sciences, for it opens naturally all inner doors for the expression of the potentials innate in the soul, the image of God in man, his true Self. Fixity in spiritual ignorance is the cause of lost opportunity for soul progress, just as the uncomprehending fears of the Gadarenes two 727"},{"pageNumber":772,"pageContent":"thousand years ago incited them to command Jesus to depart from their shores instead of asking from him the way to salvation.

J esus was without ego—the remarkable hallmark of true masters. He spoke not of his own powers of healing, but of the Divine Power that manifested through him: \"how great things God hath done.\" Jesus asked the man dispossessed of the legion of devils to serve as living publicity, that other afflicted souls might be encouraged to seek help from the unlimited divine power. Publicity used for ma- terial gain yields materia l results. Publicity for spiritual purposes is useful to broadcast truth and divine demonstrations for the inspira- tion and guidance of souls; but its use for self-laudation and personal material gain is pernicious and repugnant to the spiritual man.

And he said unto her, \"Daugh- ter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace\" (Luke 8:40-48).* IPhe omnipresent Christ Consciousness in Jesus, being conscious JL of the astral world and its subsistent life force in all bodies, knew that among the throng pressing upon him, one par- ticular woman, by her faith-enhanced will power, How faith can draw through her hands reverently contacting the hem of \"virtue\" or healing en- his garment, had drawn some life force from his ergy from divine body into her body. Like a powerful X-ray of en- personages ergy, it had burne d out her pernicious disease. As a diseased person touching the electrodes of an electrical medical appa- ratus may be benefited by the stimulus of the current, so the woman desiring healing made contact with the magnetism of Jesus and rein- forced the impaired life force in her own body with the subtle aura, or astral current, emanating from and surrounding his body. In the cure of every diseased human body, medicine or mental healing only rouses and supplements the inert life force, the direct cause of healing. A sick person can energize his healing life force by his will power revived by the strong will of a healer, or the sick per- son may by fait h draw life force from a divinely magnetic individual's body and thereby rouse and reinforce his own all-healing life force to effect the healing. It was the latter case that caused Jesus to say, \"Some subtle faith, seeking healing, has touched my astral emanation by an astral hand and has withdrawn virtue, or life force, from me.\" *Cf. parallel references in Matthew 9:18-22 and Mark 5:21-34. See also Mark 6:53-56 (and its parallel in Matthew 14:34-36), which cite simi- lar instances of healing: \"And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore. And when they were come out of the ship, straight- way they knew him, and ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.

Both are necessary. Healers must be sure of the presence of these two factors in divine healing—the faith of the person desir- ing to be healed and the ability of the healer to charge himself with di- vine healing power by daily deep God-contact in meditation. The virtue, or conscious cosmic energy that Jesus always felt within him- self and that emanated from him, was absorbed by the faith of the woman, producing healing in her. It is noted in the Gospel that in Jesus' own country, some people could not be healed of their sickness because they were too material to receive the blessing of the omnipo- tent consciousness of Go d manifested in him.* When Jesus felt \"virtue is gone out of me,\" he expressed the prin- ciple of darshan in which a divine personage, with or without conscious intention, bestows blessings on those who approach the indwelling Di- vinity with a pure heart and mind. Receptive devotees thereby attract instant blessings from the mere sight or touch of a holy person. Doubt is insidious static that disturbs the reception of the vibra- tion of healing, n o matter how strong the power of the healer.

By joining the congregation for scripture reading and prayer, Jesus signified that all human beings should set aside definite times — at the very least once each week — for God-reminding worship that will revivify in their lives the peace and wisdom of their souls. The average churchgoer, for whom worship is a Sunday-only af- fair, usually finds the eroding influence of material habits predominant on the remaining six days, and can seldom retain sufficient of the sa- cred influences of the worship service to keep his consciousness spiri- tualized until the following Sunday. Of course, a dime is better than no money at all. Even once-weekly Sunday sermons help the materi- ally minded person acquire some spiritual ballast from the peaceful ef- fects of scriptural wisdom, prayer, and silence. However, to feel ap- preciably throughout the week an undiminished inspiration of Sunday peace one ought to make each day a real \"Sun's Day\" or Wisdom's Day by basking in the light of the Sun of Wisdom and cultivating a re- generating inner peace through a regular habit of meditation in the early morning, at noontime before lunch, in the evening before dinner, and especially during the quiet time before sleep. The true peace- church into which Jesus sought to lead his followers is the inner sanc- tuary of silence wherein one is spiritually restored in the obliging wis- dom and joy of the soul. If anyone, even twice daily, during the hours of dawn and in the depth of night, worships God in the temple of med- itation for fifteen minutes to one hour, he will find the spiritual habit of peace diminishing his worry-producing material habits. But there will be those who cannot bring themselves to set aside even a half hour out of twenty-four to meditate: the so-called too-busy person—busy until death with a myopic foolish pursuit of perishable treasure to satisfy unsatisfying desires. Stocks and bonds and vain accu- mulations cannot pass through the pearly gates of the afterlife, leaving the astral being to rue its paucity of spiritual wealth. Such persons ought at least to make their best effort weekly to commune with God at church or temple or other place of worship—not merely bringing the body to services while the heart and mind are rehashing the worries of the busi- ness week, but giving one's devotion to God with attentive sincerity, a calm body, and a quiet mind. The temporary upliftment brought by this minimal fulfillment of the divine command to \"remember the Sabbath 784"},{"pageNumber":786,"pageContent":"day\"* may eventually incline the worshiper to make his Sunday peace more lasting by devoting a time to meditation every day. Scheduling the important things in one's life creates the willing- ness and facilitates th e ability to perform those actions. The body as- similates food more equably when breakfast, lunch, and dinner are partaken at the same hours each day. Consistency in worshiping on the Sabbath develops the habit of thinking of God and spiritual culti- vation at least once a week. Regularity in the repetition of any mate- rial or spiritual action—eating, efforts at business success, churchgo- ing, meditation—is bound to create a physiological, and consequently psychological, habit. In general, people are ruled by their habits. When their bad mate- rial habits hold sway, they may wonder why, in spite of their continued willingness to get rid of these despots, they are still dragged by them into undesirable behavior. Bad habits cannot be stopped by merely wanting to eradicate them, but only by reconditioning oneself physiologically and psychologically with contravening good habits. Willingness is not enough. One must act according to that willingness, not only once or a few times, but repeatedly and continuously until the opposite good habit is installed. Only then can one expect the demise of the tyrannical bad habit. Achievement lies in continued regularity of activity. Knowing the law of habit that governs human nature, Jesus set the example by his customary attendance at the synagogue on the Sabbath day. He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day; and stood up for to read. And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recov- ering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.\"\\ * Exodus zo:8.

J esus used the medium of a passage from the book of Isaiah that tal- lied with the works of his divinely ordained mission to proclaim dis- tinctly thereby that his coming had been foretold in the Hebrew scrip- tures. Of course, charlatans may quote scripture to serve their own nefarious ends; but Jesus knew he was the promised Messiah, the Christ, spoken of by the holy ones of centuries past. In his The Christ in Jesus ful- meek way, Jesus read the words of Isaiah to declare filled Isaiah's prophecy that he was not an ordinary religious teacher, but of healing and was chosen and empowered by the Lord, \"He hath salvation  anointed me,\" for a preordained mission.* \"The Spirit of the Lord (the Infinite Intelligence of Christ Consciousness, which directs all creation) is upon my soul,\" not through symbolical baptism with water by man, but through immersion in the Ocean of Spirit. When one restores his mortally identified soul to union with the infinit e Spirit, he is baptized with illimitable spiritual wis- dom and thus can ably and fittingly \"preach the Gospel,\" the intuitively perceived truths of God, \"to the poor,\" to humble recipient minds. Likewise, only God-saturated souls can permanently \"heal the brokenhearted\"—human hearts sorely wounded with disillusionment and despair by dependence on treacherous expectations of material satisfaction. As immortals, souls are sent on earth to be entertained by the Lord's cosmic drama; but when delusion captures and holds man's consciousness with its subtle nuances of pretense, the divine nature loses itself in identification with the physical form and its love of ma- terial pleasures. Matter can never satisfy spirit; sooner or later this is a hard-won realization. Then God-knowing souls come to the rescue of the brokenhearted by illuminating the way of return to the imper- ishable happiness of Spirit hidden within one's own soul. God-empowered souls, attuned with the Source of all power, can restore sight to the sightless, by exercising matter-controlling Divine Will to remodel the disorganized atoms in a blind man's eyes, and also bring \"recovery of sight\" to the spiritually blind. *The word Christ (as also Messiah) literally means \"the Anointed.\" 786"},{"pageNumber":788,"pageContent":"God-perceiving souls alone can offer \"deliverance to the captives\" of mortal bondage, and \"set at liberty\" those who have been long bruised by woes, worries, and the faithlessness of inconstant friends.

Ac- ceptance signifies faith; and without the good soil of faith, no healing seed can be brought to fruition even by a man of God. The Almighty subjects His prophets to His inculcated spiritual laws. We are con- strained to honor the code that gives man free will, which God Himself does not contradict. There can be no greater healer than omnipotent God. He is trying to heal His mortal children from all troubles; but since He gave independence to man, man is free to shut divine power out of his life or to allow it to shine through the window of faith. \"Divine healing is based on the law of reciprocity.

Only one—a foreigner—because of her faith received God-ordained spiritual aid from Elijah. Without directly accusing the cynics at Nazareth, Jesus indicated that he would perform for them no feats of divine healing, for the same reason that Elijah brought no aid to his famine-stricken country. Even the God-illumined prophet, with all his power, was helpless to stop the devastation caused by mass karma, the willful misdeeds of the people.* Jesus was not speaking fatalistically: Widespread human evils such as wars, moral iniquity, or spiritual degeneration disrupt the sub- tle astral forces behind the physical mechanisms governing earth's cli- mate and other environmental conditions, wreaking so-called natural disasters on good and evil persons alike. These are not \"fate\" or \"acts of God,\" but the outcome of the karmic law, that man must suffer the consequences of his actions if he does not invoke and make himself re- ceptive to the intercession of God's aid and forgiveness when he has fallen. The masses of people in Elijah's time did not exercise their free choice to cultivate repentance and faith, and therefore had to undergo the ravages of three-and-a-half years of famine. Then Jesus, with subtle insinuation, spoke of himself as the Elisha of yore, who was similarly constrained from healing the many lepers of his time, with the exception, at God's command, of one honorable Syrian named Naaman. By citing these stories from the scriptures, Jesus elucidated the divine laws that work in justice and secrecy, pro- ducing both karmic consequences of man's actions and the interven- tion of God's contravening mercy if man is receptive through repen- tance, devotion, and faith: \"My dear countrymen, you do not understand how divine laws operate; you yourselves by your irreverent faithlessness have decreed that I cannot work multiple wonders of healing in my own country. As the prophet Elisha healed one Syrian leper but not the multitude of lepers in Israel, so also I do only what God's will operating through His spiritual laws influences me to do.\" * It was during this time that Elijah said to God: \"The children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain Thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left\" (I Kings 19:14). 792"},{"pageNumber":794,"pageContent":"And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath, and rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.

How different are those who speak from realization from the many missionary types, both in the Orient and the Occident, who come forth from theological training to preach to others with the pur- pose of converting and holding followers with dogma. Appointed or self-elected soap-box orators can create intellectual or emotional up- heavals in the minds of listeners to be sufficiently convincing, but they cannot save or uplift souls. To save others, one must first save oneself. To heal others, one must have healing power. Only those who are thoroughly grounded in meditation so that there is real contact of their hearts, minds, and souls with God (whether or not they have book learning) are qualified to teach. Intellectual or emotional preaching through the power of a good memory or creative imagination bears no comparison with spiritual preaching through example of a God- attuned life and consciousness. Contact with God is evidenced in a holy life. The ego is dimin- ished and replaced with an ever-increasing love for God and desire to follow His will alone. A truly holy person touches one's whole being with a \"peace which passeth all understanding\"* and radiates to all as kindness and goodwill. God-contact in deep meditation opens the channel of soul intuition and speaks through the inner guiding voice of conscience. God uses His great prophets to proclaim revelations; He speaks personally to His true devotees those revelations that will change them into God-loving beings who inspire others to become likewise. The exultations, visions, and divine oneness of God-contact come in good time to the advanced devotee who perseveres in deep- ening meditation; but God's presence is no less real in its subtle trans- forming power of inner peace, joy, understanding, and divine love. * Philippians 4:7."},{"pageNumber":802,"pageContent":"A true minister of truth hears the voice of God as inner intuitive in- spiration and does not depend solely on running to a library to prepare undigested, unlived sermons. Jesus preached extensively to the masses; and in between gatherings, he retired to the seclusion of the desert or mountaintops to commune with God. Renewed in body and spirit, he came back to give his reinforced God-consciousness to the true seekers. Ministers of churches and leaders of religious organizations should be selected according to their devotion to God and Self-realization at- tained through meditation. Persons of shallow spirituality, whose lives and understanding lack at least some degree of actual God-contact, can do little more than lead their followers down the path of ignorance; their ministry consists primarily of worrying themselves with the fi- nancial problems and fund-raisings of their organizations. But those who are themselves settled in God are the true ministers who can suc- cessfully transmit God to other souls. Even business ethics demand that one should not attempt to sell a product without a thorough acquaintance with the article and a sin- cere belief in its usefulness. How unethical it is, then, to try to sell God to others without an inner intuitive perception of God and faith in what God is, and how in a supreme way He is essential to all. The age-old tradition of India is that every would-be spiritual teacher must first learn to contact God and live a life of discipline un- der the tutelage of a divine teacher. They must be worthy disciples be- fore they can be teachers of others. Any accredited disciple of a great teacher who lives and upholds his master's ideals is a person consid- ered fit to teach. It is exemplary when great teachers not only instruct their disci- ples in the ways of physical and mental healing by the system of di- etetics and methods of concentration and prayer, but also initiate them in the highest technique of meditation to cure spiritual sickness by driving away the ignorance of delusion. Real divine ministers can teach spiritually advanced devotees more advancement and spiritually sick true seekers the art of healing themselves. Religious denominations, in their modern form, do well in remind- ing people of the necessity of knowing God and truth; but to really serve, they should be universities of spiritual discipline and offer com- prehensive practical training in God-contact as well as in spiritual liv- ing. A house of God should not be a social and moral organization only, but primarily a spiritual academy for training in actual God-perception. 758"},{"pageNumber":803,"pageContent":"Realization of God is the true and only purpose of churches and tem- ples; all activities should be subservient to that cause. Genuine seekers fall away from congregational worship if they do not receive a real experience of God. The usual method of most religious denomina- tions has been to hold their people by inbred churchgoing habits, or by dogma and threats of eternal perdition, or by stimulating lectures and musical or festive entertainments. Congregations are often built on the personalities of oratorical ministers, trained like actors to effectively deliver the lines of their theoretical sermons. In the absence of that intellectual or emotional oratory, as also practiced mu- sical performances and supplemental socials, the members in time lose interest if they have not received fulfillment in an inner experience of God-contact in meditation. The church cannot compete with profes- sional entertainment and should not try to do so; the temple of God is a unique place where souls should come together to share the joy of God-communion. Nor should huge sums of money be tied up in church edifices just to attract class-conscious persons with the grandeur of architecture, offering scarcely more than a place to see and be seen. There is noth- ing wrong in dedicating to God beautiful places of worship. But struc- tural hives, regardless of their magnificence, are useless unless they are filled with the honey of God's presence. As with churches in the West, many elaborate Hindu temples in India have become places of mechanical chanting and ritualism. Holy temples at first were places of meditation and worship for saintly souls and those who came for their blessings; but after their passing, priests or trustees with ambition for power and financial gain seized control and desecrated the sacred sanctuaries with their unspiritual commer- cial methods. Owing to this monopoly, great masters now avoid the temples in favor of sequestered nooks and simple mandirs where they teach the methods of attaining Self-realization to selected students, less by preaching and more by meditating with them in the inner temple of God-contact. Sermons may create the desire to know God, but med- itation with great saints or according to their methods gives one the knowledge and bliss of actual God-communion.

Rather than conducting only stilted services and scripture classes in which the members are passive re- cipients, the congregation should be reorganized to do more of their own introspective thinking and silent prayer and meditation. It would be a more peaceful, harmonious world if the various re- ligions and religious denominations ceased condemnation of paths dif- ferent from their own. Instead of fighting about the infallibility and exclusivity of their respective dogmas, they should foster a spirit of unity based on the commonality of the real meaning of life and man's relationship with his Creator. The universal moral and spiritual codes of discipline for right human behavior that are basic to all true reli- gions would be found to be a universal spiritual treatise on the art of moral and spiritual living.

The Sankhya philosophy teaches that the cardinal necessity of man con- sists in destroying the roots of the threefold suffering of body, mind, and soul so that there is no possibility of recurrence. It describes the spiritual cosmology of creation and man's place in the divine schema. Yoga is the science of the step-by-step-methods of progressive Self- realization that lead directly to God. According to the highest Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, Yoga is the supreme way, for it is the sci- ence of salvation.

If it claims to meet that criterion, then it must do so or it will cease to exist as a spiritual force. Toward this end, it is the paramount duty of all clerics to improve themselves by daily deep sci- entific meditation for communion with God, and to reform their congregations likewise with spiritual habits and the joy of divine communion. The Self- realization of true seekers would spontaneously, without urging, hold those members to their respective path that is leading them to God. A strong congregation is united in uncoerced loy- alty born of each member's Self-realization garnered from the inner dis- cipline and meditation taught by the church or temple. Services should not consist so much of various rituals of the body and mind required in chanting and choirs, standing up and kneeling down, intoned prayer, scripture recital, and other external ceremonial practices. Congregational worship should stress primarily meditation, interiorization with cessation of bodily motions, absence of mental rest- lessness, and the presence of God-contact. When bodily motions cease and thoughts become quiet, God begins to appear as the blessedness of stillness and divine bliss on the altar of peace and changelessness. Congregational recitation of chants and prayers keeps the mind ex- ternal. They may do some good, no doubt, to those whose concentra- tion on the meaning is sincere and devout. But the effect remains lim- ited unless supplemented by deep, secreted, soul-loving prayers in the quietness of solitude. The lack of individual prayer and communion with God has divorced modern Christians and Christian sects from Jesus' teaching of the real perception of God, as is true also of all reli- gious paths inaugurated by God-sent prophets whose followers drift * A synthesis of these three philosophies is provided in Paramahansa Yogananda's com- prehensive commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, God Talks With Arjuna.

In- stead, in India's hermitage s that follow the ancient tradition of her lin- eage of saints, the master and the disciple often sit together to discuss spiritual principles; and then together, or individually, through proven techniques of concentration and meditation, they try to commune with God and to realize truth through the direct experience of soul intuition.

Instead of first concentrating on the building of ornate edifices with heavy mortgages, teachers should es- tablish the temples of Self-realization in the souls of their followers. What is necessary for the revival of true churches of Christ is not new denominations, but the real teachings of Christ and the living of those teachings, improving the quality of church members by medita- tion, and the selection of God-known, God-contacting ministers. The failings of churchianity can be abolished and real Christianity be brought back into the church if the churches are made places of wor- ship by members who practice meditation in their homes and also as part of their congregational services. The atmosphere of nonsectarian meditation for deep inner God-communion would change churches from the divisiveness of churchianity into the heaven of Christ Con- sciousness or Christ-ianity. Every spiritual teacher should pass his life more in meditation, and in order to be able to transmit spirituality to real seekers—those whom he meets through the will of God and proper moral publicity—regularly meditate with them whenever he can, in small groups, preferably in quiet or se- cluded centrally located places. If churches get to- gether and follow the above practice they will bring about a real revival of Christ Consciousness in the hearts of true worshipers. In deeply meditating together in small sin- cere groups, such seekers will find that the Christ Consciousness which was in Jesus will manifest in them and bring about in their conscious- ness the Second Coming of Christ. If this spiritual nucleus of devout devotees then wants to build a church, it is commendable; for they will then be qualified to fill that \"Hives \" of organized churches should be filled with the honey of God's presence 764"},{"pageNumber":809,"pageContent":"hive with the honey of God's presence. The leader should be under no constraint to cater to or flatter others for monetary gain. He must faithfully make time daily to keep his most important engagement with God in meditation. The pure vibrations of a true minister draw those devotees who really seek God. Such souls, by receiving the bless- ing of their own realization, will give loyal support to a leader whose spiritual demeanor and moral behavior give sincere evidence of his communion with God. God makes no distinction between rich and poor, fame or no fame. A successful minister is often equated with an elaborate church in an aristocratic neighborhood, attended by a rich, influential con- gregation. In sending forth his first apostles, Jesus gave a hint to all generations as to wher e churches should be built and to whom the teachings should be given. Suitable areas, aristocratic or poor, are those in which there is spiritual interest. That is where to build a foun- dation, wherever people repent of their earthly folly and like lost sheep are sincerely seeking return to the fold of God-consciousness. Thus did Jesus command his disciples that they should not go to the self-satisfied worldly people, \"the Gentiles,\" worshipers of gods of fame and fortune, or to the Samaritans, fixed in their convictions, but rather to the truth-seekers who are repentant for having strayed away from God. \"Vibrate into them your God-realization and show them that the kingdom of heaven, the state of attunement with the heavenly powers of astral vibration, wisdom, bliss, and God-consciousness, lies within their reach, just behind the human consciousness of wakeful- ness and subconsciousness, in the state of superconsciousness and God-contact as realized in deep meditation. As you heal the soul of material consciousness by establishing the kingdom of heaven or God- consciousness there, so also heal the ailments of the bodily instrument of the soul. \"Free the truly repentant God-seekers not only from physical sick- ness but also from mental, moral, and spiritual sickness. Raise spiri- tually dead people into the consciousness of God; and by transmitting your God-power, release them from devils and obsessions of cosmic delusion and Satanic ignorance and evil disembodied souls. Bring to life the good departed souls who have more good than evil karma, or at least equal good and bad karma, because such acts are now sanc- tioned by the Heavenly Father to assure benighted mankind that all things are possible with God's true devotees and followers of the path 765"},{"pageNumber":810,"pageContent":"of goodness.

In the way you have grasped God-consciousness, teach the same to the people. You exercised your divine ardor, reason, and free will to meditate and advance spiritually, and so you awakened the spontaneous response in God and desire in me to transmit into you Our divine consciousness.

It par- allels the uniting of the two distinct paths followed in India by spiritu- ally aspiring devotees. First, the school of outer renunciation; second, the school of yoga, which enjoins mental renunciation and nonattach- ment while living in the world. A follower of the path of outer renunciation leaves the world, does not marry, divests himself of personal possessions and human re- ——• lations, and seeks a secluded place, such as an The paths of outer ashram, where undisturbed by worldly intrusions, and inner renunciation the devotee can pursue his sadhana for attaining God-realization. The Order of Swamis belongs to the path of renunciation, akin to monastic orders in the West.* The path of yoga, the uniting of the soul with Spirit through the practice of scientific meditation techniques of God-contact, can be fol- lowed by devotees in all walks of life. A yogi does not necessarily have * Speaking of the first Christian monastic communities (the Desert Fathers), which were formed in Egypt in the early centuries following the life of Jesus, British historian Sir Charles Eliot writes : \"Egypt was a most religious country, but it does not appear that asceticism, celibacy, or meditation formed part of its older religious life, and their appearance in Hellenistic times may be due to a wave of Asian influence starting orig- inally from India.\"— Hinduism and Buddhism, Volume HI. 768"},{"pageNumber":813,"pageContent":"to be in the world as a householder or to leave the world as a monas- tic. Whether yogis live in the civilized jungle of physical luxury or in the primitive conditions away from material influences and comforts, by tuning in with the Infinite they seek to become so concentrated on divine bliss that automatically their minds will rise above and inwardly renounce the desire for material fulfillments. A true yogi is a practitioner of real renunciation, even if he lives in the world and to outer appearances looks like any ordinary person of the world. The advanced yogi, having inwardly renounced all de- sires and attachments, remains intoxicated with God. Such yogis do not mind obeying fastidiously, as well, the laws of outward renuncia- tion. Lahiri Mahasaya was a sublime exemplar of a householder yogi; he took no formal vows of renunciation but no taint of worldly con- sciousness dared touch his sanctity. The devotee of outer renunciation, on the other hand, forswears all material luxuries in the beginning to accustom his consciousness to the simple life and the nonattachment native to his soul—the prereq- uisite renunciation of worldly pleasures and worldly ways of living be- fore one can know God. But though an aspirant renounce everything outwardly, he may yet remain inwardly attached to mundane objects and be haunted by sensual desires. The yogi says, \"Have God-contact first through meditation; and then through attachment to God the at- tachment to material objects will drop away.\" The yogi who practices the scientific meditation technique of actual God-contact belongs to the highest spiritual path. The physical austerities of renunciation alone without the yoga of God-union is unnecessarily arduous. There- fore, even the devout renunciant ought to be a yogi as well. The path of outer renunciation is successfully followed only by the few; the path of yoga can be followed by all. Devotees may choose the path of renunciation or the path of yoga as suitable according to their differing temperaments; but to be a yogi as well as a renunciant is wonderful. Outward as well as inward renunciation is ideal for those with a single-hearted yearning for God—for those devotees of God who, without the obligations and entanglements of a family, can give their full time to seeking God through yoga and unreserved serv- ice to God and all mankind. Jesus was a yogi, constantly engaged in divine union, and a man of renunciation as well. He not only contacted God in his spirit and inwardly rose above all material attachments, but he also practiced 769"},{"pageNumber":814,"pageContent":"nonattachment to material things in his outward life. He instructed his apostles likewise to be men of renunciation along with the inner wis- dom and Self-realization they possessed. Jesus Christ first empowered his disciples with God-consciousness and then advised them: \"O my disciples, who are divinel y charged and permeated with God and His healing powers, show you r exalted spiritual example of having over- come the world by taking nothing for your journey that would indi- cate a sense of luxury for the body or dependence on material security for your needs.\" As similarly advocated by Jesus, the Buddhist monks of India from pre-Christian times and the members of the Swami Order in India con- fined their possessions chiefly to a staff and simple dress; and most of the time they went barefoot or wore wooden or woven-straw sandals —shoes made from the hides of slaughtered animals being considered unclean and unholy. Jesus' instructions to his disciples were apropos to the times and climate, presenting a truly holy example for the people of his country. I am sure Jesus, or any Oriental teacher, would greatly modify the dress code and other rules of renunciation to be followed by those dis- ciples who live under different conditions or in cold countries. Barefooted or sandal-shod swamis in India who are clad only in simple cotton dhotis when in the warm regions dress sensibly in warmer attire when they go to the cold regions of the Himalayas. Even so, I have seen some great swamis and yogis in secluded haunts of the frigid mountain regions bare-bodied without suffering from cold or any effects of exposure to extreme weather. The garb one wears, or the lack of it, and other external expressions of renunciation do not necessarily make one spiritual. I have always stressed to the monks and nuns of Self-Realization Fellowship who have chosen to follow the path of renunciation I have embraced: \"First make your heart a hermitage and your robe the love of God.\" ——  Jesus further instructs his disciples as to how Avoiding commercial- they should maintain themselves: \"O ye divine re- ism in religion: Jesus' nunciants, remember that just as the skilled work- instructions on money man earns his honest livelihood by his labor, so in the ministry you, as divine workmen giving to people the high- est spiritual service and salvation, deserve to receive your bodily maintenance from those you help. Even though I ask you to live humbly by the grateful charity of the people you serve, always 770"},{"pageNumber":815,"pageContent":"retain the consciousness that you are not beggars, but divine children made in the almighty image of God.\" A spiritual man who is sincerely engaged in offering the public the highest service, that of saving souls, lives very honorably even though he exists by alms and the goodwill of those he serves. In the West, owing to the high cost of living, ministers receive salaries. But the one baneful result of this subsistence is that the min- ister is often thereby controlled by the trustees or board of a church; and if he, as an employee, does not agree to the course outlined by his \"employers,\" he runs the chance of being discharged, just as a clerk in an office may be discharged for refusal to obey his superior. In the centers of religious concentration in India, there are insti- tutions where swamis and yogis may freely board without any obli- gations whatsoever. This arrangement is intended to foster the growth of real teachers who want to devote themselves exclusively to the cause of spiritual welfare, without the time-devouring distractions of gainful ordinary employment. The concomitant evil that arises is from abuse of this beneficence by persons who simply do not care to put forth the effort to maintain themselves; they don the garb of renun- ciants to enjoy free board and lodging from such religious institutions. Nevertheless, this provision for real spiritual teachers immensely helps the growth of advanced souls by freeing them from the control of a board of trustees or philanthropic gifts compromised with conditions. In the Western world, sometimes religious teachers who are not satisfied with their limited ministerial salary try to utilize various other means of fund-raising in the guise of providing for God's work, but from which they personally benefit. There is no sin for ministers or re- ligious teachers to arrange to maintain themselves financially so that they can be free to help without interruption the growth of spiritual- ity in the world, provided that neither God nor their followers are ex- ploited for that purpose. I have always maintained that it is all right in the modern world to use business methods in religion, but that it is blasphemy and a grievous spiritual sin to use religion for business or to trade upon the sacred name of God or dupe sincere devotees to sat- isfy one's personal ambition for financial gain and luxurious habits. Teachers who promote their self-envisioned greatness by publi- cizing falsehoods claiming contact with God and that they have been commissioned by masters and saints are no more than metaphysical racketeers. If truth-seekers of the West followed the discriminating 771"},{"pageNumber":816,"pageContent":"method of India, that only those teachers are qualified who truly live the spiritual life and who are definitely known to have practiced and achieved self-mastery under a great living master or bona fide lineage established by such a master, they would avoid being disillusioned by the antics of self-elected pseudoprophets. The aim of false prophets is always the same, to gratify their ego with the adoration of a large following and to reap financial gain from their trusting flock. Maintaining a church or religious organization by freewill offerings received at services and religious meetings and from funds received from book sales and other media of disseminating truth is spiritually legitimate if the money is used for propagating the spiri- tual cause and for the reasonable livelihood of the teacher who gives all his life to the spreading of the divine work. However, it is con- demnable if such funds are diverted to line the pockets of unscrupu- lous pseudoprophets and their acolytes. The instruction of Jesus to the apostles he sent forth made these spiritual ideals of ministry unequivocally clear. Times change, as well as the external modes of expression; but the ideals are invariable. A teacher of God's word must be an exemplar of the highest ideals of self-abnegation for the greater love of serving God and truth-seeking souls. Concentration was to be on those who were \"worthy,\" recep- tive, regardless of their station—high or low, rich or poor, certainly not just the wealthy or influential from which favors can be sought. The commercial religious teacher uses his students to further his own ends; the tru e spiritual teacher guides the attention of devotees to bring them unto God. \"And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.

Ordinary serpents have no wisdom, are quick to anger, and are stupid enough to court their own death by biting people. Doves are not altogether harmless, for they can spread mites and disease. Even though the dove might be tra- ditionally a symbol of peace for its peaceful looks and behavior, the serpent certainly does not look wise or inspiring. Since Jesus was ad- dressing his advanced disciples, he used these words metaphorically, in an esoteric sense. As previously explained [in Discourse 14], the Oriental scriptures employ the simile of a serpent to illustrate the kundalini or astral life force in the body, which, when awakened with the help of an ad- vanced technique of Self-realization, passes through a serpentine coiled passage at the base of the spine upward to the highest spiritual centers in the brain, bestowing divine consciousness. The dove symbolizes the tricolored spiritual eye—the mouth of the dove representing the white star in the middle of the spiritual eye; the blue and gold spherical rings surrounding the star symbolizing the wings of the dove.* A person in ordinary consciousness, identified with the minutiae of his little ego's senses, reason, and feeling, perceives himself circum- scribed by his body, family, society, country, world, and a certain por- tion of space. But when by scientific meditation he awakens his serpent force, he reverses the searchlight of his awareness from physical sense consciousness to divine consciousness. Taking his kundalini force up- ward through the cerebrospinal centers and penetrating his life and con- sciousness through the spiritual eye, he beholds himself as omnipresent. His perception is restricted no longer to a limited sphere of matter and the sensations in one body, but expands into perception of the infinite reaches of space and awareness of the sensations of all beings. The devotee who perceives through his spiritual eye his om- nipresent existence, who feels an ineffable peace and attunement with every thing and every living creature, and who beholds all selves as manifestations of his own being, becomes harmless to all, equally lov- ing the different parts of his own cosmic body. Awakened in eternal wisdom, the realization of his true Self, he cannot in any wise be in- * See Discourse 6, commentary on declaration of John the Baptist when he baptized Jesus: \"I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him\" (John 1:32). 780"},{"pageNumber":824,"pageContent":"wardly disturbed or incited to evil actions no matter how provoked by trials and temptations. Jesus knew that his advanced disciples had awakened their higher consciousness by rousing the kundalini divine life energy through practice of the methods of meditation he had taught them. Therefore he reminded them to retain the deep wisdom and calmness bestowed by kundalini awakening when confronted with opposition and perse- cution. Anyone who has lifted up this coiled life energy and thereby elevated his human consciousness into Christ Consciousness by pene- trating through the spiritual eye has acquired tremendous miraculous power; such a one could destroy by divine will force his would-be en- emies, as well as satanic temptations.* That is why Jesus warned his disciples not to use their powerful awakened energy in vengeful retal- iation when confronted by the wickedness of erring children of God; but rather to overcome enemies with the celestial power of God's in- finite peace and love, with which they were blessed in the baptism of their consciousness by the spiritual eye, the dove of light, f All Christlike souls aspiring to attain the kingdom of God must behave divinely and resist evil only by soul force, even as God resists Satan by divine forces of goodness. Evil cannot be conquered by the evil use of spiritual power. To use divine power for evil purposes is blasphemy and conducive to spiritual downfall. The soul force ac- quired by arduous meditative effort is quickly lost if one employs it under the influence of the intoxication of delusion to wreak vengeance against one's own divine brethren.^ *See also pages 798 ff. of this Discourse, where Jesus tells the disciples he has given them \"power to tread on serpents,\" i.e., power over all satanic material temptations engendered by the outgoing life force and consciousness. f Saint Paul emphasized this teaching of Jesus in letters he wrote to those in his ministry: \"Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breast- plate of righteousness; and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

Cosmic Consciousness does not reason with devotees, it rather drops truths in their intuitions. Intuition is the father of reason and can satisfy all the demands of reason. Reason is based on sense experience and is limited by it. If the sense experience is misinterpreted, reason proves to be erroneous. A person beholding wind-blown dust on a distant hill might be led to think that the hill is on fire and emanating a cloud of smoke. Sensory- dependent reason from immediate observation or from memory con- ditioned by repeated past experiences can blunder if the sensory ob- servation or experience is faulty or incomplete. God has no senses, nor reason dependent on sensory perceptions; He Himself is the Knower, the process of knowing, and the wisdom to be known. He knows the truth about all things through His cosmic in- tuition, His feeling present in everything. Likewise do His true devotees, being in tune with the Spirit of their Heavenly Father, depend on the un- limited power and guidance of intuitive God-perception and not on lim- ited reason when confronted with persecutions or human problems. In the context of the reference in Luke cited above (21:14-15), as also in St. John (14:26), Jesus assures his disciples of his intercession in times of need: '\"I will give you a mouth and wisdom'—you will feel my spirit of Christ Consciousness with you, manifesting in 'the Com- forter, which is the Holy Ghost...he shall teach you all things.\"' \"And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their par- ents, and cause them to be put to death.

They cannot destroy or cause grief Moral and spiritual to your divine consciousness nor dissolve your inde- courage to uphold di- structible, immutable soul. But I warn you, and all vine principles who are wicked, that you must learn to stand in re- spectful and loving awe before God—the Almighty One who through His law of cause and effect evolved your soul and body from His own Self, and who alone upholds your existence and per- petuates by His divine will the immortality of your soul. His divine law of karma is empowered, after the death of your body, to prevent the ex- pression of your soul's peace and joy and to make your astral-bodied consciousness suffer your accumulated wickedness of one life or many lives. Therefore, rather fear your wicked actions, which can compel the divine law to make you conscious of a self-created after-death hell of the effects of your burning conscience and wicked tendencies, which even in life will torment with its fires the inner being as well as the outer health and other conditions necessary to a happy existence. \"Fear not, therefore, even if you have to sacrifice the body. That sacrifice will not bring destruction to the soul, but the sacrifice of a spir- itual principle might bring disaster to the soul as well as to the body.\" Jesus is emphasizing to his disciples the necessity of moral and spiritual courage, that it is a great sin if one, for fear of man, acts against the cosmic law. Persecution may destroy the body, but acting against the laws of truth affects both the body and the soul. The mis- eries of the body end in death, but the agonies accruing out of an in- dividual's evil actions continue to confine the soul in the sufferings of its astral body in the after-death state. The conception of hell as a place where souls are literally burned everlastingly with fire and brimstone is ridiculous. It is the propensity for vindictiveness in man's own heart that assumes such awful cruelty as the revenge of a Creator offended by the misdeeds of man. Poor God! That is a terrible declaration against Him—the Father-Mother who created all things in love, sustains them on the Infinite Bosom of love, and draws them back to Everlasting Bliss by the forgiveness of love.

It ated by man's own is untenable that Jesus, who was love, mercy, for- vindictiveness giveness incarnate, would support and preach such a doctrine. The context of his whole life and teachings forbids a literal reading of references to hell as a place of eternal fiery torment. Material fire can produce sensations of burning on the physical body, but the soul itself is incorporeal and cannot be tortured by phys- ical sensations. Its astral-bodied consciousness, however, if afflicted with hellish wicked tendencies acquired in earth life, can undergo for a time a mental hell of torture that who can gainsay might be worse than a physical fiery hell. The mental hell of wickedness can persist in the after-death state indefinitely until one gains a new opportunity to improve himself in a new incarnation, or otherwise repents and prays for release. An indi- vidual's stubbornness and doggedness to be wicked, even in the after- death state, can make his self-created mental hell as everlasting as he permits it to be.

He then cautions that they must not lose that blessing by diminishment of their attunement with the Christ Consciousness in him, under duress of ob- stacles or spiritual persecution, or through succumbing to selfish mo- tives. The fortitude of faith and of perseverance in divine attunement brings forth upon the devotee the liberating grace of the \"Father which is in heaven,\" and the assistance of the heavenly forces of \"the angels of God.\" But Jesus warns that devotees who are deterred from their course of personal advancement and of helping to uplift the con- sciousness of others, intimidated by fear of worldly condemnation or cowed by temptation, will forfeit divine aid, suffer loss of their con- tact with Christ Consciousness, and be unable to advance further. \"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.

Rather, he is admonishing all who set their sights on the kingdom of God not to re- main steeped in the ignorance of a material life, but to use the sword of wisdom he brought to them to destroy their delusions of earthliness. Family environment and familial love exert a strong force on even the most stalwart devotee. Jesus therefore stresses that if a devotee finds his family members dissuading him or trying to obstruct his efforts to cultivate God-consciousness, he should not yield but continue unde- terred and undismayed.

He does not mean literally that all devotees should hate their parents and relatives or detest their own life.

Through my Christ Consciousness, I will give you the will power by which you shall be able to control the coiled serpent force at the base of the spine. The creative life force flowing outward into the body feeds sexual desires and 'scorpions' of tormenting, poisonous, evil instincts. When you master the technique of withdrawing the coiled serpent force upward through the awakene d astral centers in the spine to the celes- tial astral region in the cerebrum, then you will have full self-control over the unruly passions of sex and all evil desires that obstruct the at- tainment of divine bliss. Be less elated that you have power to control evil spirits and evil forces in healing others, and rather rejoice more that your souls have attained a sufficient degree of Self-realization to access the heavenly region of Cosmic Consciousness.\" As was explained in previous verses,* Satan was originally an archangel, an intelligent force of God's creative cosmic energy, en- dowed with power to create in tune with Divine Intelligence perfect heavenly manifestations in material creation. This force came out of Maha-Prakriti, Great Nature, the Holy Ghost, the primal creative as- pect of Spirit. The informing power of the Mother of Creation is maya, cosmic delusion, that transforms the One Spirit into myriad manifestations. With a thin veil of maya, Prakriti's pure nature, Para- Prakriti, works in harmony with God's reflected Christ -Kutastha In- telligence to produce the divine laws and forces informing all mani- festations of the heavenly astral-causal realms. A denser pall of cosmic delusion was required to generate the gross vibrations necessary to beget a sustained material creation from this underlying astral-causal * See Discourse 7. 798"},{"pageNumber":842,"pageContent":"matrix. Because these gross vibrations of cosmic delusion distort and eclipse the true nature of matter as made of God's consciousness, this outflowing creative power is referred to as Prakriti's impure nature, Apara-Prakriti. It is this aspect to which Satan is equated, depicted as an archangel fallen from divine grace, a creative force not guided by heavenly vibrations—a force that rebelled against God-consciousness, obscuring the Innate Divinity, in order to preserve his own kingdom of humankind through self-perpetuating misuse of free will. Thus, heaven is not only transcendental Cosmic Consciousness, but also that region of manifestation in which the pure Cosmic Intel- ligent Energy works in tune with the creative will of Cosmic Con- sciousness, God the Father of Creation. And the sphere of space in which there is the creation and presence of imperfect manifestations is the field wherein the conscious cosmic force of Satan, the energy fallen from heavenly attunement into deception, spawns tantalizing delu- sions of bondage to oppose the hidden essence of the intercessional, liberating works of the pure Divine Intelligence. Similarly, in the human body there is the transcendent and heavenly region and the region of delusion or satanic influence. The heavenly re- gion extends from the astral dorsal or heart center up to the transcen- dental cerebral center of Spirit. The region of satanic influence and the receptacle of baser instincts extends from below the heart, through the lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal centers (notwithstanding that when these very centers are spiritualized by meditation and righteous action, their soul-attuned functions then aid the devotee, respectively, with self- control, adherence to spiritual observances, and resistance to untoward sensory temptations).* When the energy from the senses is concentrated by meditation in the divine astral center in the brain, the devotee is spo- ken of as having attained heaven. But in most people, those who do not meditate nor behave in harmony with their soul qualities, their con- sciousness is tied to the life force flowing downwards, falling from the heavenly astral cerebral region to the region of the senses. The satanic or delusive force in every human being keeps the lightning-like life force continuously descending toward the senses, al- lowing the searchlight of sensory perceptions to reveal the attraction of sense objects only. This, Jesus also observed in the seventy disciples he was addressing. Unlike the more advanced among his twelve apos- * See also commentary in God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita i:i i. 799"},{"pageNumber":843,"pageContent":"ties, they had yet to master fully the art of pranayama, life-force con- trol. So Jesus taught them—\"I give unto you the power\" — by medi- tation and will power to reverse the life force—\"to tread on serpents and scorpions\" of sensory passions—and thereby enjoy the heavenly consciousness and divine perceptions of the kingdom of God within them. Thus Jesus said to these disciples that they should rejoice, not only for being able to control the devils or evil passions aroused when the force at the base of the spine flows outward to stimulate lust and other sensory passions, but for the power they had been given to withdraw the energy upward, through the coiled serpent-like passage at the base of the spine into the cerebrospinal region of heavenly forces and heav- enly bliss. By self-mastery \"over all power of the enemy,\" acquired by obe- dience and meditation, Jesus assured them, \"Your names are written in heaven\" — having secured their consciousness in the kingdom of heaven within, they would be qualified to be recalled to the infinite wall-less mansion of the blissful Cosmic Consciousness of the Heav- enly Father. In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, \"I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in Thy sight\" (Luke 10:21). * ^TT thank Thee, O Heavenly Father, Thou Infinite Lord pervading as iL Cosmic Consciousness behind all heavenly manifestations and in the vibrationless region beyond creation ('Lord of heaven') and as Christ Consciousness existing in all vibratory creation ('Lord of...earth'), that although You have hidden Yourself and Your omni- science from egotistically wise and theoretically prudent individuals, You have revealed the mystery of truth unto Your simple, guileless chil- dren, even though they are but babes in wisdom before Your incom- parable Infinite Mind. Heavenly Father, the revealing of Yourself and *Cf. parallel reference in Matthew 11:25-26. 800"},{"pageNumber":844,"pageContent":"ultimate truth unto Your devotees who are humbly simple and sincere —spiritual babes who surrender their sensate intelligence unto the un- limited intuitional inspiration that comes from Thee —is in accord with Thy proper judgment.\"  God is revealed not Though Jesus' disciples were mostly unedu- by intellectuality, but cated in scholarly matters, he found them receptive by pure and guileless to a higher knowledge than that of the rationaliz- devotion ing intellect. Divine realization, perception of the Infinite, is unrelated to academic degrees. It is good to have knowl- edge befitting a professor in preference to a doltish brain of an igno- rant man; but if one's intellect is so complacent in its scholastic dis- tinction that one feels no need to seek wisdom in God, the evolution of that soul is laggardly compared to an illiterate who has devotion to the Lord. By drawing his disciples from among the common populace —even \"publicans and sinners\" and unlettered fishermen such as Pe- ter, James, and John—Jesus showed that it was possible for any devo- tee to attain divine realization, for God is not a respecter of persons as to their status. As the little and big fingers equally belong to one's hand, so all souls—whether or not they are significant in the eyes of the world—belong to God. Whoever approaches Him with pure de- votion will attain Him. God reveals Himself unto those who completely surrender them- selves unto Him, those who have no intellectual or emotional resis- tance to Him. Before God, the most accomplished of humans is but a child; even the most brilliant scientist does not know why or how God created this world. The Lord is not interested in how much one knows, but in how much one loves Him. The only way to touch Him is by the ardent devotion of the heart. Jesus lauded the childlike qualities of his disciples over the \"wise and prudent\" who loved to use their erudition and logic to find fault with his teachings. A closed-minded critical attitude is spiritually stul- tifying. Attunement with the guru through devotion enables the devo- tee to progress steadily toward God-realization; doubters and habit- ual criticizers fall by the wayside. A guru does not seek to silence the disciple's reason; but he can only help those who are willing to be taught, not those who self-assertively \"know it all.\" That devotee be- comes filled with intuitive wisdom who is childlike in guilelessness, free of presumption and doubt, full of sincerity, humble and receptive. That devotee finds God. 801"},{"pageNumber":845,"pageContent":"DISCOURSE 41 LUKh 1UU2-24 \"All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him.\" And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, \"Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see: For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them\" (Luke 10:22-24). * omniscience and omnipotence of Cosmic Consciousness, God .1 the Father of creation, are transmitted to the omnipresent re- flected Christ Consciousness s o that the laws of all manifestation can be intelligently governed by truth and wisdom.

As the reflection of the moon in the lake and the moon in the sky are essentially the same image, so Cosmic Consciousness mirrored in all cosmic vibration as Christ Conscious- ness is the same as the Cosmic Consciousness existing beyond the vi- bratory realm. The ordinary man is bound by the consciousness of the body and its relation to the material world, but by advancement in meditation he does away with the circumscriptions of bodily attachments and re- alizes an unfathomable depth of bliss, which lies beyond his conscious and subconscious experiences in the superconsciousness of the soul.

When th e devotee by passing his consciousness through his inner spiritual eye experiences this vast cosmic vision, he is spoken of as having attained Christ Consciousness. The whole vi- bratory universe, and everything in it, is felt as his own Self, just as he feels all the cells and the different parts of his own physical body. After attaining Christ Consciousness, the devotee goes further, be- yond all vibratory space, into an indescribable state of Cosmic Con- sciousness of pure eve r new Joy, Consciousness, and Existence. Here in this Cosmic Consciousness no eddies of vibration or change can dis- turb the absolute bliss of the consciousness of the devotee merged in divine union with God. In the very highest ecstasy that an incarnate soul can experience, nirvikalpa samadhi, the supremely advanced devotee finds his con- sciousness simultaneously merged in the vibrationless Cosmic Con- sciousness and the ocean of Cosmic Vibration with its bubbles of plan- ets, nebulae, comets, stars, and universes. Jesus attained this state; hence he said, \"The Father (Cosmic Consciousness) knows the Son (Christ Consciousness), and the Son knows the Father.\" No one can suddenly jump from limited body-consciousness and its attachment to earthly surroundings directly to realization of the Transcendental Infinite, God th e Father. Even though man's soul itself is an individualized reflection of the Christ Intelligence, the soul con- sciousness is entangled in a cluster of electronic and lifetronic vibra- tions of the physical and astral bodies. The soul consciousness of man must first leave the limited region of the senses and bodily conscious- ness. Like a little wave being reabsorbed into the sea, the conscious- ness then encounters expansion in the vast Holy Ghost Cosmic Vi- bration. As the expanded soul is baptized in that sacred Vibration of Spirit, it experiences th e immanent Christ Intelligence. Only then, blessed by this Reflected Presence, does the consciousness go beyond to the vibrationless infinitude, the kingdom of God the Father, Cosmic Consciousness. If Jesus were speaking of his body as the Son of God, one would have to conclude that no souls were ever redeemed before the birth of Jesus—neither Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Elijah, nor any of the proph- 803"},{"pageNumber":847,"pageContent":"ets. The true meaning of this verse (and similar ones*) is that spiritu- ally evolved souls, of whom many existed before the time of Jesus and would continue to be born after him, have to pass their consciousness through the Holy Ghost Cosmic Vibration and the Son or Christ In- telligence existing in it before they can ascend to the transcendent kingdom of His Heavenly Majesty, God. Thus the emphasis of Jesus that it is the Son or Christ Consciousness alone that can reveal God the Father to any soul. \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30). I n oneness with the infinite Christ Intelligence, Jesus lovingly urged all spiritual aspirants to \"Come unto me\" (the Christ Conscious- ness) and \"Take my yoke upon you\"—follow the step-by-step meth- ods of self-discipline that lead to Christ Consciousness and that assure ultimate liberation in God's kingdomrf \"O ye aspiring souls who are heavily laden with bad karma and are struggling to free yourselves from the self-created prison of evil actions: Tune your consciousness in deep meditation with the all-pervading, ever new bliss of Christ Consciousness, which surpasses the semijoyous state *For example, John 14:6: \"...no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\" (See Dis- course 70.) t Yoke (zugo in the original Greek of the Gospel) and yoga are etymologically related, all deriving from the Sanskrit root yuj, signifying union.

Even as Jesus in these verses promises his disciples that the transcendent, all-liberating Cosmic Consciousness will b e revealed to those who attune themselves with the imma- nent Christ Consciousness by taking up his \"easy\" yoke of spiritual discipline, so does Bhagavan Krishna declare to his disciple Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita: \"To thee, the uncarping one, I shall now reveal the sublime mystery (the immanent- transcendent nature of Spirit). Possessing intuitive realization of this wisdom, thou shalt escape from evil. This intuitive realization is the king of sciences, the royal secret, the peerless purifier, th e essence of dharma (man's righteous duty); it is the direct per- ception of truth—the imperishable enlightenment—attained through ways (of yoga) very easy to perform\" (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita IX:I-2). 804"},{"pageNumber":848,"pageContent":"of subconsciousness in sleep and the ever new joyous state of supercon- sciousness beyond the state bf deep sleep.
