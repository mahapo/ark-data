The Hindus haverevealed to the whole world the Truth. And this is only natural, when weconsider that more than five thousand years ago, while the forefathers of Britonand Gaul, Greek and Latin, were roaming the vast forests of Europe in search offood, true barbarians, the Hindu was already engaged in pondering the mystery oflife and death, which now we know to be one.The essential point to be remarked about Parama-hansa Yogananda's teaching, incontradistinction to that of European philosophers, such as Bergson, Hegel, andothers, is that it is not speculative, but practical, even when dealing with theutmost reaches of metaphysics. The reason is that the Hindus, alone of mankind,have penetrated behind the veil, and possess the knowledge, which is really notphilosophical, i.e., wisdom-loving, butwisdom itself. For, when expressed in terms of verbal dialectic, this knowledgemust perforce lay itself open to the criticism of philosophers whose life it is,as Plato said, to be constantly engaged in discussion. The truth cannot beexpressed in words, and when words are used, even by a Sankara, acute minds canalways find a loophole for attack. The finite, in fact, cannot contain theinfinite. Truth is not an eternal discussion; it is Truth. It follows that onlyby actual personal realization, by practice or method such as ParamahansaYogananda offers can Truth ever be known beyond doubt.All the world desires bliss, as Paramahansa says and proves, but most aredeluded by desire for pleasure. Buddha himself never stated more clearly that itis desire, ignorantly followed, which leads to the morass of misery in which thevast majority of mankind is helplessly floundering.But Buddha failed to state with equal clearness the fourth of the four modes ofattaining to the state of bliss that we all desire. This fourth mode is by farthe easiest, but needs for its practical achievement the guidance of an expert.This expert is now among us to give to the West the technique, the simple rules,which have been handed down for centuries from the ancient philosophers ofIndia, and which lead to realization or the state of permanent bliss.This direct contact is always stressed as of great importance in Hindu thoughtand practice. Until our day, it has been out of reach of all but those fortunateenough to dwell in India. Now that we have it in the West,actually at our door, he would indeed be unwise, who should avoid or neglect tomake trial of a practice which of itself is intensely blissful—\"far more purelyblissful than the greatest enjoyment that any of our five senses or the mind canever afford us,\" as Paramahansa Yoga-nanda truthfully declares, and adds, \"I donot wish to give anyone any other proof of its truth than is afforded by his ownexperience.\"The first step can be taken by reading this small book; the others needful forreaching the complete state of bliss will follow, naturally.I conclude by quoting a few lines from my \"John of Damascus,\" in which I attemptpoetically to suggest what in this book is attained. The Buddha speaks, who forus is Paramahansa Yogananda, since \"Buddha\" means simply, \"He who knows.\"Long have I wandered, long, he sang, Bound by the chains through lives and painsInnumerable, and felt the fangs Of self on fire, of fierce desire.Found, it is found, the Cause, he sang. Of self on fire, of wild desire. Nohouse, O Architect, for me Again can ever builded be.Shattered are thy rafters, scatteredAre thy roof timbers utterly:No house thou buildest more for me.Mine is Nirvana, mine; it lies Within my reach, before mine eyes. Now, if I willit, now, I may Pass now eternally away To bliss eternal, leave no trace Of me inthis or other place.But love I bear thee, love; and stay, Humanity, for thy sole sake. With mine ownhands the bridge to make. Which, if thou cross, thou too ahalFst gain Freedomfrom birth and death and pain. And thus eternal bliss attain.We have the Bridgemaker among us. With his own hands he will build the bridge,if we truly wish him so to do.Douglas Grant Duff AinslieFebruary, 1927 London, England"},{"pageContent":"leaf 17 [images/leaf-image0017.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"THE SCIENCE OF RELIGIONCHAPTER IIntroductionThe purpose of this book is to outline what should be understood by religion, inorder to know it as universally and pragmatically necessary. It also seeks topresent that aspect of the idea of the Godhead which has a direct bearing on themotives and actions of every minute of our lives.It is true that God is Infinite in His nature and aspects, and it is also truethat to prepare a chart detailing, so far as is consistent with reason, what Godis like is only an evidence of the limitations of the human mind in its attemptto fathom God. Still, it is equally true that the human mind, in spite of allits drawbacks, cannot rest perfectly satisfied with what is finite. It has anatural urge to interpret what is human and finite in the light of what issuperhuman and infinite—what it feels but cannot express, what within it liesimplicit but imder circumstances refuses to be explicit.Our ordinary conception of God is that He is Superhuman, Infinite, Omnipresent,Omniscient, and the like. In this general conception there are many variations.Some call God Personal, some see Him as Impersonal. The point emphasized in thisbook is that whatever conception we have of God, if it does not influence ourdaily conduct, if everyday life does not find an inspiration from it, and if itis not found universally necessary, then that conception is useless.If God is not conceived in such a way that we cannot do without Him in thesatisfaction of a want, in our dealings with people, in earning money, inreading a book, in passing an examination, in the doing of the most trifling orthe highest duties, then it is plain that we have not felt any connectionbetween God and life.God may be Infinite, Omnipresent, Omniscient, Personal, and Merciful, but theseconceptions are not sufficiently compelling to make us try to know Him. We mayas well do without Him. He may be Infinite, Omnipresent, and so forth, but wehave no immediate and practicaluse for those conceptions in our busy, rushing lives.We fall back on those conceptions only when we seek to justify, in philosophicaland poetical writings, in art or in ideahstic talks, the finite craving forsomething beyond; when we, with all our vaunted knowledge, are at a loss toexplain some of the most common phenomena of the universe; or when we getstranded in the vicissitudes of the world. \"We pray to the Ever-Merciful when weget stuck,\" as the Eastern maxim has it. Otherwise, we seem to get along allright in our work-a-day world without Him.These stereotyped conceptions appear to be the safety valves of our pent-uphuman thought. They explain Him, but do not make us seek Him. They lack motivepower. We are not necessarily seeking God when we call Him Infinite,Omnipresent, All-Merciful, and Omniscient. These conceptions satisfy theintellect, but do not soothe the soul. If respected and cherished in our hearts,they may broaden us to a certain extent—^may make us moral and resigned towardHim. But they do not make Godour own—they are not intimate enough. They place Him aloof from everydayconcerns of the world.These conceptions savor of outlandishness when we are on the street, in afactory, behind a counter, or in an office. Not because we are really dead toGod and religion, but because we lack a proper conception of them—a conceptionthat can be interwoven with the fabric of daily life. What we conceive of Godshould be of daily, nay hourly, guidance to us. The very conception of Godshould stir us to seek Him in the midst of our daily lives. This is what we meanby a pragmatic and compelling conception of God. We should take religion and Godout of the sphere of belief into that of daily life.If we do not emphasize the necessity of God in every aspect of our lives and theneed of religion in every minute of our existence, then God and religion dropout of our intimate daily consideration and become only a one-day-in-a-weekaffair. In the next chapter of this work an attempt is made to show that inorder to understand the real necessity of Qod and religion wemust throw emphasis on that conception of both which is most relevant to thechief aim of our daily and hourly actions.This book also aims to point out the universality and unity of religion. Therehave been different religions in different ages. There have been heatedcontroversy, long warfare, and much bloodshed over them. One religion has stoodagainst another, one sect has fought with another. Not only is there a varietyin religions, but there is also a wide diversity of sects and opinions withinthe same religion. But the question arises, when there is one God, why thereshould be so many religions?It may be argued that particular stages of intellectual growth and special typesof mentality belonging to certain nations, owing to different geographicallocations and other extraneous circumstances, determine the origin of differentreligions, such as Hinduism, Mohammedanism and Buddhism, for the Asiatics,Christianity for the Westerners, and so forth. If by religion we understand onlypractices, particular tenets, dogmas, customs, and conventions, thenthere may be ground for the existence of so many religions; but if religionmeans, primarily, God-consciousness, or the realization of God both within andwithout; secondarily a body of beliefs, tenets, and dogmas, then, strictlyspeaking, there is but one religion in the world, for there is but one God.The different customs, forms of worship, tenets, and conventions may be held toform the grounds for the origin of different denominations and sects includedunder that one religion. If religion is understood in this way, then and thenonly may its universality be maintained; for we cannot possibly universalizeparticular customs and conventions. Only the element common to all religions maybe universalized; we may ask everyone to follow and obey it. Then may it betruly said that religion is not only necessary but universal as well. Everyonemay follow the same religion, for there is but one; the universal element in allreligions being one and the same.I have tried to show in this book that as Qod is one, necessary to all of us, soReligion is one, necessary and universal. Only the roads to itmay differ in some respects at the beginning. As a matter of fact, it isillogical to say that there are two religions, when there is but one God. Theremay be two denominations or sects, but there is only one religion. What we nowcall different religions should be known as different denominations or sectsunder that one universal religion. And what we now know as differentdenominations or sects should be specified as different branch cults or creeds.If we once know the meaning of the word \"religion,\" which I am going to discusspresently, we shall naturally be very circumspect in the use of it. It is onlythe limited human point of view that overlooks the underlying universal elementin the so-called different religions of the world, and this overlooking has beenthe cause of many evils. This book gives a psychological definition of religion,not an objective definition based on dogmas or tenets. In other words, it seeksto make religion a question of our whole inward being and attitude, and not amere observance of certain rules and precepts.CHAPTER IIThe Universality, Necessity, and Oneness OF Religion. Pain, Pleasure, and Bliss:Their Differences. God as Bliss.First we must know what religion is, then only may we judge whether it isnecessary for all of us to be religious.Without necessity there is no action. Every action of ours has an end of its ownfor which we perform it. People of the world act variously to accomplish variousends. There is a multiplicity of ends determining the actions of men in theworld.But is there any common and universal end of all the actions of all the peopleof the world? Is there any common, highest necessity for all of us which promptsus to all actions? A little analysis of the motives and ends of men's actionsin the world shows that, though there are a thousand and one proximate orimmediate ends of men in regard to the particular calling or profession whichthey take up, the ultimate end —^which all other ends merely subserve—is theavoidance of pain and want, and the attainment of permanent Bliss. Whether wecan permanently avoid pain and want, and obtain Bliss, is a separate question;but as a matter of fact, in all our actions we obviously try to avoid pain andto gain pleasure.Why does a man serve as an apprentice? Because he wishes to become an expert ina certain business. Why does he engage in that particular business? Becausemoney can be earned therein. Why should money be earned at all? Because it willsatisfy personal and family wants. Why should wants be fulfilled? Because painwill thereby be removed and happiness be gained.As a matter of fact, happiness and Bliss are not the same thing. We all aim atBliss, but through a great blunder we imagine pleasure and happiness to beBliss. How that has come to be so will be shown presently. The ultimate mo-tive is really Bliss, which we feel inwardly; but happiness — or pleasure — hastaken its place, through our misunderstanding, and pleasure has come to beregarded as the ultimate motive.Thus we see that the fulfillment of some want; removal of some pain, physical ormental, from the slightest to the acutest; and the attainment of Bliss form ourultimate end. We may not question further why Bliss is to be gained, for noanswer can be given. That is our ultimate end, no matter what we do—enter abusiness, earn money, seek friends, write books, acquire knowledge, rulekingdoms, donate millions, explore countries, look for fame, help the needy,become philanthropists, or embrace martyrdom. And it will be shown that theseeking of God becomes a real fact to us when our true end is kept rigorously inview. Millions may be the steps, myriads may be the intermediate acts andmotives; but the ultimate motive is always the same—^to attain permanent Bliss,even though it be through a long chain of actions.Man usually likes to go along the chain to get to the final end. He may commitsuicide to endsome pain, or perpetrate murder to get rid of some form of want or pain or somecruel heart-thrust, thinking he will thereby attain a real satisfaction orrelief, which he mistakes for Bliss. But the point to notice is that here, too,is the same working (though wrongly) toward the ultimate end.Some one may say, \"I do not care anything about pleasure or happiness. I livelife to accomplish something, to achieve success.\" Another says: \"I want to dogood in the world. I do not care whether I am in pain or not.\" But if you lookinto the minds of these people, you will find that there is the same workingtoward the goal of happiness. Does the first man want a success that has in itsachievement no pleasure or happiness? Does the second want to do good to others,yet himself get no happiness in doing it? Obviously not. They may not mind athousand and one physical pains or mental sufferings inflicted by others, orarising out of situations incidental to the pursuit of success or the doing ofgood to others; but because the one finds great satisfaction in success, and theother intenselyenjoys the happiness of doing good to others, the former seeks success, and thelatter seeks others' good, in spite of incidental troubles.Even the most altruistic motive and the sin-cerest intention of advancing thegood of humanity, for its own sake, have sprung from the basic urge for achastened personal happiness, approaching Bliss. But it is not the happiness ofa narrow self-seeker. It is the happiness of a broad seeker of that \"pure self\"that is in you and me and all. This happiness is Bliss, a little alloyed. Sowith Pure Bliss as a personal motive for altruistic action, the altruist is notlaying himself open to the charge of narrow selfishness, for one cannot himselfhave Pure Bliss unless he is broad enough to wish and seek it for others, too.That is the universal law.So if the motives for the actions of all men are traced farther and fartherback, the ultimate motive will be found to be the same with all—the removal ofpain and the attainment of Bliss. This end being universal, it must be lookedupon as the most necessary one. And what is universal and most necessary for manis, ofcourse, religion to him. Hence religion necessarily consists in the permanentremoval of pain and the realization of ^liss or Qod, And the actions which wemust adopt for the permanent avoidance of pain and the reaUzation of Bliss orGod are called religious. If we understand religion in this way, then itsuniversality becomes obvious. For no one can deny that he wants to avoid painpermanently and attain permanent Bliss. This must be universally admitted, sincenone can gainsay its truth. Man's very existence is bound up with it.All want to live because they love religion. Even if a man committed suicide itwould be because he loved religion, too; for by doing that he thinks he willattain a happier state than he finds while living. At any rate, he thinks hewill be rid of some pain that is bothering him. In this case his religion iscrude. But it is religion, just the same. His goal is perfectly right, the samethat all persons have. For all of them want to obtain happiness, or Bliss. Buthis means is unwise. Because of his ignorance he does not know what will bringhim to Bliss, the goal of all men.Thus, in one sense every man in the world is religious, inasmuch as everyone istrying to get rid of want and pain, and to gain Bliss. Everyone is working forthe same goal. But in a strict sense only a few in the world are religious, foronly a few in the world, though they have the same goal as all others, know themost effective means for removing, permanently, all pain or want— physical,mental, or spiritual—and gaining true Bliss.The true devotee cannot hold a rigidly narrow orthodox conception of religion,though that conception is, in a remote way, connected with the conception I ambringing out. If for some time you do not go to church or temple, or attend anyof its ceremonies or forms, even though acting religiously in your daily life bybeing calm, poised, concentrated, charitable, squeezing happiness from the mosttrying situations, then ordinary people of a pronounced orthodox or narrow bentwill nod their heads and declare that, although you are trying to be good,still, from the point of view of religion, or in the eyes of God, you are\"falling off,\" as you did not oflate enter the precincts of the holy places.While of course there cannot be any valid excuse for permanently keeping awayfrom such holy places, there cannot, on the other hand, be any legitimate reasonfor one's being considered more religious for attending church, if at the sametime one neglects to apply in daily life the principles which religion upholds,viz., those that make ultimately for the attainment of permanent Bliss. Religionis not dovetailed with the pews of the church, nor is it bound up with theceremonies performed therein. If you have an attitude of reverence, if you liveyour daily life always with a view to bringing undisturbed Bliss-consciousnessinto it, you will be just as religious out of the church as in it.Of course this should not be understood as an argument for forsaking the church,which is usually a real help in many ways. The point is that you should putforth just as much effort outside of the church hours to gain eternal happinessas you forego while from the pews you are passively enjoying a sermon. Not thatlistening is not a good thing, in its way; for it certainly is.The word religion is derived from the Latin religarey to bind.\"^ What binds,whom does it bind, and why? Leaving aside any orthodox explanation, it stands toreason that it is \"we\" who are bound. What binds us? Not chains or shackles, ofcourse. Religion may be said to bind us by rules, laws, or injunctions only. Andwhy? To make us slaves? To disallow us the birthright of free thinking or freeaction? That is unreasonable. Just as religion must have a sufficient motive, soits motive in \"binding\" us must also be good. What is that motive? The onlyrational answer we can give is that religion binds us by rules, laws,injunctions, in order that we may not degenerate, that we may not be in misery—bodily, mentally, or spiritually.Bodily and mental suffering we know. But what is spiritual suffering? To be inignorance of the Spirit. It is present, always, though often unnoticed, in everylimited creature, while bodily♦ The derivation of the word \"religion\" from religare, to bind, has beenaccepted by St. Augustine, Lactantius, Lucretius, and Servius. (See Enc. Brit.,11th Edition.)and mental pain come and go. What other motive of the word \"binding\" than theabove may we ascribe to religion that is not either nonsensical or repelling?Obviously other motives, if any, must be subservient to the one given.Is not the definition of religion already given consistent with theabove-mentioned motive of the word \"binding,\" the root meaning of religion? Wesaid that religion, in part, consists in the permanent avoidance of pain,misery, suffering. Now religion cannot lie merely in getting rid of something,such as pain, but it must also lie in getting hold of something else. It cannotbe purely negative but must be positive, too. How can we permanently get awayfrom pain without holding to its opposite—Bliss? Though Bliss is not an exactantonym of pain, it is, at any rate, a positive consciousness to which we cancling in order to get away from pain. We cannot, of course, forever hang in theair of a neutral feeling that is neither pain nor the reverse. I repeat thatreligion consists not only in the avoidance of pain and suffering, but also inthe attainment of Bhss, or God (that Bliss and God are synony-mous, in one sense, will be explained later).By looking, then, into the motive of the root meaning of religion (binding) wearrive at the same definition of religion we reached by the analysis of man'smotive for action.Religion is a question of fundamentals. If our fundamental motive is the seekingof Bliss, or happiness, if there be not a single act we do, not a single momentwe live, that is not determined ultimately by that final motive, should we notcall this craving the most deep-seated one in human nature? And what canreligion be if it is not somehow intertwined with the deepest-rooted craving ofhuman nature? Religion, if it is to be anything that has life value, must baseitself on a life instinct or craving. This is an a priori plea for theconception of religion set forth in this book.If one replies there are many other human instincts (social, self-preservative,and so forth) besides a craving for happiness, and asks why we should notinterpret religion in the light of those instincts, too, the answer is thatthose instincts are either subservient to the instinct ofseeking happiness or are too indissolubly connected with the latter to affectsubstantially our interpretation of religion.To revert once more to the former argument, that which is universal and mostnecessary to man is religion to him. If what is most necessary and universal isnot religion to him, what then can it be? That which is most accidental andvariable cannot be it, of course. If we try to make money the one and only thingrequiring attention in life, then money becomes religion to us—\"the Dollar isour God.\" The predominant life motive, whatever it may be, is religion to us.Leave aside here the orthodox interpretation, for principles of action, and notintellectual profession of dogmas or observance of ceremonies, determine withoutneed of our personal advertisement what religion we have. We need not wait foreither the theologian or the minister to name our sect or religion for us—ourprinciples and actions have a million tongues to tell it to us and to others.The significant part of it all is that back of whatsoever thing we worship withblind ex-clusiveness is always one fundamental motive. That is, if we make money,business, or obtaining the necessities or luxuries of life the be-all andend-all of our existence, still back of our actions lies a deeper motive: weseek these things in order to banish pain and bring happiness. This fundamentalmotive is humanity's real religion; other secondary motives formpseudo-religions. Because religion is not conceived in a universal way it isrelegated to the region of clouds, or is considered by many people to be afashionable diversion for women or for the aged and feeble.Thus we see that Universal Religion (or religion conceived in this universalway) is practically or pragmatically necessary. Its necessity is not artificialor forced. Though in the heart its necessity is perceived, yet unfortunately weare not always fully alive to it. Had we been so, pain would long since havedisappeared from the world. For ordinarily what a man thinks to be reallynecessary he will seek at all hazards. If the earning of money is thought by aman to be really necessary for the support of his family, hewill not shrink from running into dangers to secure it. It is a pity we do notconsider religion to be necessary in the same way. Instead, we regard it as anornament, a decoration, and not a component part of man's life.It is also a great pity that although the aim of every man in this world isnecessarily religious, inasmuch as he is working always to remove want andattain happiness, yet owing to certain grave errors he has been misdirected andled to consider the true religion, the definition of which we have just given,as of minor importance.What is the cause of this? Why do we not perceive the real necessity in place ofthe apparent unimportance? The answer is—the wrong ways of society and our ownsense attachments.It is the company we keep that determines for us the necessity we feel fordifferent things. Consider the influence of persons and circumstances. If youwish to orientalize an Occidental, place him in the midst of the Asiatics; or ifyou want to occidentalize an Oriental, plant him among Europeans—and mark theresults. It is obvious—inevitable. The man of the West learnsto like the customs, habits, dress, modes of living and thought and manner ofviewing things of the East, and the man of the East comes to like those of theWest. The very standard of truth seems to them to vary.Upon one thing, however, most people will agree, and that is that their worldlylife, with its cares and pleasures, weal and woe, is worth living. But of thenecessity for the Universal Religion few or none will ever remind us, and so weare not quite alive to it.It is a truism that man seldom looks beyond the circle in which he is placed.Whatever falls within his own circle he justifies, follows, imitates, emulates,and feels to be the standard of thought and conduct. What is beyond his ownsphere he overlooks or lessens the importance of. A lawyer, for instance, willpraise and be most attentive to what concerns law. Other things will, as a rule,have less importance for him.The pragmatical or practical necessity of the Universal Religion is oftenunderstood as merely a theoretical necessity, religion being considered anobject of intellectual concern. If we know thereligious ideal merely through our intellect, we think we have reached thisideal and that we are not required to live it or realize it.It is a great mistake on our part to confuse pragmatical necessity withtheoretical necessity. Many would perhaps admit, on a little reflection, thatUniversal Religion is surely the permanent avoidance of pain and the consciousrealization of Bliss, but few understand the importance and practical necessitythat this religion carries with it.Now it is necessary for us to investigate the ultimate cause of pain andsuffering, mental and physical, in the avoidance of which the Universal Religionpartly consists.First of all we should assert, from our common universal experience, that we arealways conscious of ourselves as the active power performing all of our mentaland bodily acts. Indeed many different functions are we performing— perceiving,thinking, remembering, feeling, acting, and so forth. Yet underlying thesefunctionswe can perceive that there is an \"ego,\" or \"self,\" which governs them and thinksof itself as substantially the same through all its past and present existence.The Bible says, \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spiritof God dwelleth in you?\"* All of us as individuals are so many reflectedspiritual selves of the universal blissful Spirit — Qod, Just as there appearmany images of the one sun, when reflected in a number of vessels full of water,so is mankind apparently divided into many souls, occupying these bodily andmental vehicles, and thus outwardly separated from the One Universal Spirit. Inreality, God and man are one, and the separation is only apparent.Now, being blessed and reflected Spiritual selves^ why is it that we are utterlyunmindful of our blissful state and are instead subject to physical and mentalpain and suffering? The answer is, that the Spiritual self has brought on itselfthis present state (by whatever process it♦ / Corinthians 3:16.may be) by identifying itself with a transitory bodily vehicle and a restlessmind. The Spiritual self being thus identified, feels itself sorry for ordelighted at a corresponding unhealthy and unpleasant or healthy and pleasantstate of the body and mind. Because of this identification, the Spiritual selfis being continually disturbed by their transitory states.To take even the figurative sense of identification: a mother who is in deepidentification with her only child suffers and feels intense pain merely by thevery hearing of her child's rumored or real death, whereas she may feel no suchpain if she hears of the death of a neighboring mother's child with whom she hasnot identified herself. Now we can imagine the consciousness when theidentification is real and not figurative. Thus the sense of identification withthe transitory body and restless mind is the source or root-cause of ourSpiritual self's misery.Understanding that identification of the Spiritual self with the body and mindis the primary cause of pain, we should now turn to a psychological analysis ofthe immediate or proxi-mate causes of pain and to the distinction between pain, pleasure, and ^liss.Because of this identification the Spiritual self seems to have certaintendencies, mental and physical. Desire for the fulfillment of these tendenciescreates want, and want produces pain. Now these tendencies or inclinations areeither natural or created, natural tendencies producing natural wants andcreated tendencies producing created wants.c/t created want becomes a natural want in time, through habit. Of whatever sortthe want may be, it gives pain. The more wants we have, the greater thepossibilities of pain. For the more wants we have, the more difficult is it tofulfill them, and the more that wants remain unfulfilled, the greater is thepain. Increase desires and wants, and pain is also increased. Thus if desirefinds no prospect of immediate fulfillment, or finds an obstruction, painimmediately arises.And what is desire? It is nothing but a new condition of \"excitation\" which themind puts on itself—a whim of the mind created through company. Thus desire, orthe increase of condi-tions of ^'excitation'' of the mind, is the source of pain or miseryy and alsoof the mistake of seeking to fulfill wants by first creating and increasingthem, and then by trying to satisfy them with objects instead of lessening themfrom the beginning.It might appear that pain is sometimes produced without the presence of previousdesire, for example, pain from a wound. But we should observe here that thedesire to remain in a state of health which, consciously or subconsciously, ispresent in our mind and is crystallized into our physiological organism, iscontradicted in the above case by the presence of the unhealthy state, viz., thepresence of the wound. Thus when a certain exciting condition of the mind in theform of a desire is not satisfied or removed, pain results.As desire leads to pain, so it leads also to pleasure, the only difference beingthat in the first case, want involved in desire is not satisfied; while in thesecond case, want involved in desire seems to be satisfied by the presence ofexternal objects.But this pleasurable experience, resulting from the fulfillment of the want byobjects, does not remain but dies away, and we retain only the memory of theobjects that seemed to have removed the want. Hence, in future, desire for thoseobjects brought in by memory revives, and there arises a feeling of want which,if unfulfilled, again leads to pain.Pleasure is a double consciousness —^made up of an \"excitation\" consciousness ofpossession of the thing desired and of the consciousness that pain for want ofthe thing is felt no more. That is, there is an element of both feeling andthought in it. This latter contrast consciousness, i.e., the entireconsciousness (how I felt pain when I did not have the desired object, and how Inow have no pain, as I have obtained the thing I wanted), is what mainlyconstitutes for men the charm of pleasure.Hence we see that consciousness of want precedes—and consciousness of the want'sbeing fulfilled enters into — pleasurable consciousness. Thus it is want and thefulfillment of want with which the pleasure consciousness is concerned.It is mind that creates want and fulfills it.It is a great mistake to regard a certain object as pleasurable in itself and tostore the idea of it in the mind in the hope of fulfilling a want by its actualpresence in the future. If objects were pleasurable in themselves, then the samedress or food would always please every one, which is not the case.What is called pleasure is a creation of the mind— it is a deluding^'excitation\" consciousness, depending upon the satisfaction of the precedingstate of desire and upon present contrast consciousness. The more a thing isthought to excite pleasurable consciousness, and the more the desire for it isharbored in the mind, the greater the possibility of hankering after the thingitself, the presence of which is thought to bring a pleasurable consciousnessand its absence a sense of want. Both of these states of consciousness leadultimately to pain.So if we are really to lessen pain, we are, as far as possible, to free the mindgradually from all desire and sense of want. If desire for a particular thing,supposed to remove the want, isbanished, deluding \"excitation\" consciousness of pleasure does not arise, evenif the thing is somehow present before us.But instead of lessening or decreasing the sense of want, we habitually increaseit and create new and various wants in the satisfying of one, resulting in adesire to fulfill them all. For instance, to avoid the want of money we start abusiness. In order to carry on the business we have to pay attention tothousands of wants and necessities that the carrying on of a business entails.Each want and necessity in turn involves other wants and more attention, and soon.Thus we see that the original pain involved in want of money is a thousand timesmultiplied by the creation of other wants and interests. Of course it is notmeant that the running of a business or earning of money is bad or unnecessary.The point is that the desire to create greater and greater wants is bad.If, in undertaking to earn money for some end we make money our end, our madnessbegins. For the means becomes the end and the real end is lost sight of. And soagain our misery com-mences. In this world everyone has his duties to perform. Let us, for the sakeof convenience, review the former instance.The family man has to earn money to support his family. He starts a certainbusiness and begins to attend to the details that will make it successful. Nowwhat often happens after a time? The business goes on successfully and moneyperhaps accumulates until there is much more than is necessary for thefulfillment of his wants and those of his family.Now one of two things happens. Either money comes to be earned for its own sakeand a peculiar pleasure comes to be felt in hoarding, or it may happen that thehobby of running this business for its own sake persists or increases the more.We see that in either case the means of quelling original wants—^which was theend— has become an end in itself—^money or business has become the end.Or it may happen that new and unnecessary wants are created and an effort ismade to meet them with things. In any case our sole attention drifts away fromBliss (which we, by nature, mis-take for pleasure and the latter becomes our end). Then the purpose for which weapparently started a business becomes secondary to the creation or increase ofconditions or means. And at the root of creation or increase of conditions ormeans there is a desire for them which is an excitation or feeling, and also amental picture of the past when these conditions gave rise to pleasure.Naturally the desire seeks fulfillment by the presence of these conditions; whenit is fulfilled, pleasure arises; when not fulfilled, pain arises. And becausepleasure, as we remarked already, is born of desire and is connected withtransitory things, it leads to excitation and pain when there is a disappearanceof those things. That is how our misery commences.To put it briefly: from the original purpose of the business, which was theremoval of physical wants, we turn to the means—either to the business itself orto the hoarding of wealth coming out of it—or sometimes to the creation of newwants, and because we find pleasure in these we are swept away into pain, which,as we pointedout, is always an indirect outcome of pleasure.What is true of the earning of money is also true of every action of the world.Whenever we forget our true end — the attainment of ^liss or the state,condition, or mode of living eventually leading to it — and direct our soleattention to the things which are mistakenly thought to be the means orconditions of ^liss, and turn them into ends, our wants, desires, excitations goon increasing, and we are started on the road to misery or pain.We should never forget our goal. We should put a hedge round our wants. Weshould not go on increasing them more and more, for that will bring misery inthe end. I do not mean, however, that we should not satisfy necessary wants,arising out of our relation to the whole world, or become idle dreamers andidealists, ignoring our own essential part in promoting human progress.To sum up: pain results from desire, and in an indirect way also from pleasure,which stands as a will-o'-the-wisp to lure people away into the mire of wants tomake them ever miserable.Thus we see that desire is the root of all misery, which arises out of the senseof identification of the \"self\" with mind and body. So what we should do is tokill attachment by doing away with the sense of identification. We should breakthe cord of attachment and identification only. We should play our parts, asappointed by the Great Stage Manager, on the stage of the world with the wholemind, intellect, and body, inwardly as unaffected or unruffled by pleasure andpain consciousness as are the players on an ordinary stage.When there is dispassion and severing of identification. Bliss-consciousnessarises in us. As long as you are human you cannot but have desires. Being human,how then can you realize your divinity? First have rational desires, thenstimulate your desire for nobler things, all the while trying to attainBliss-consciousness. You will feel that the cord of your individual attachmentto various desires is being automatically snapped.That is to say, from the calm center of Bliss you will ultimately learn todisown your own petty desires and to feel only those which seemto be urged in you by a great Law. So Jesus Christ said, \"Not my will, butThine, be done.\"*When I say that to attain ^liss is the universal end of religion, I do not meanby Bliss what is usually called pleasure, or that intellectual satisfactionwhich arises from the fulfillment of desire and want and which is mixed with anexcitation, as when we say we are pleasurably excited. In Bliss there is noexcitement, nor is it a contrast consciousness, i.e., \"my pain or want has beenremoved by the presence of such and such objects.\" It is a consciousness ofperfect tranquilUty —a consciousness of our calm nature unpolluted by theintruding consciousness that pain is no more.An illustration will make the point clear. I have a wound, and feel pain; whenhealed I feel pleasure. This pleasurable consciousness consists of an\"excitation\" or feeling, and a constant thought-consciousness that I am nolonger feeling the pain of the wound.Now the man who has attained Bliss, even♦ Luke 22:42.though he might receive a physical wound, will feel, when healed, that his stateof tranquillity had neither been disturbed when the wound existed, nor regainedwhen it was healed. He feels that he is passing through a pain-pleasure universewith which he really has no connection, or which can neither disturb norheighten the tranquil or blissful state which flows on within him withoutceasing. This state of Bliss is free from both inclinations and excitementinvolved in pleasure and pain.There is a positive and a negative aspect in Bliss-consciousness. The negativeaspect is the absence of pleasure-pain consciousness; the positive one is thetranscendental state of a superior calm, including within itself theconsciousness of a great expansion and that of \"all in One and One in all.\" Ithas its degrees. An earnest truth-seeker gets a little taste of it, a seer or aprophet is filled with it.Pleasure and pain having their origin in desire and want, it should be ourduty—if we wish to attain Bliss—to banish all desire except the desire forBliss—our real nature. If all our im-provements—scientific, social, and political—are guided by this one commonuniversal end—removal of pain—why should we bring in a foreign something —pleasure — and forget to be durably fixed in what is tranquillity or Bliss?He who enjoys the pleasure of health will inevitably sometimes feel the pain dueto ill health, because pleasure depends upon a condition of the mind, viz., theidea of health. To have good health is not bad nor is it wrong to seek it. Butto have attachment to it, to be inwardly affected by it, is what is objected to.For to be so means entertaining desire, which will lead to misery.We must seek health not for the pleasure in it but because it makes theperformance of duties and the attainment of our goal possible. It will, sometime or other, be contradicted by the opposing condition, viz., ill health. ButBliss depends upon no particular condition, external or internal. It is a nativestate of the Spirit. Therefore it has no fear of being contradicted by any othercondition. It will flow on continually forever, in defeat or success, in healthor disease, in opulence or poverty.Now the above psychological discussion about pain, pleasure, and Bliss, with thehelp of the following two examples, will make clear my conception of the highestcommon necessity and of the Godhead, which was touched upon incidentally at thebeginning.I remarked at the outset that if we made a close observation of the actions ofmen, we should see that the one fundamental and universal motive for which manacts is the avoidance of pain and the consequent attainment of Bliss, or God.The first part of the motive, i.e., the avoidance of pain, is something wecannot deny, if we observe the motives of all the good and bad actions performedin the world.Take the case of a person who wishes to commit suicide, and that of a trulyreligious man who has dispassion for the things of the world. There can be nodoubt about the fact that both of these men are trying to get rid of the painwhich is troubling them. Both are trying to put an end to pain permanently.Whether they are successful or not is a different question, but so far as theirmotives are concerned there is unity.But are all actions in this world directly prompted by the desire for theattainment of permanent Bliss, or God, the second part of the common motive forall actions? Does the evildoer have for his immediate motive the attainment ofBliss? Hardly. The reason for this was pointed out in the discussion aboutpleasure and Bliss. We found that because of the identification of the Spiritualself with the body it has fallen into the habit of indulging in desires and theconsequent creation of wants. These desires and wants lead to pain, if notfulfilled—and to pleasure, if fulfilled—by objects.But here occurs a fatal error on the part of man. When a want is fulfilled, mangets a pleasurable excitement and, through a sad mistake, fixes his eye solelyupon the objects which create this excitement, and supposes them to be the maincauses of his pleasure. He entirely forgets that he had formerly an excitationin the form of desire or want in his own mind, and that later he had anotherexcitation in his mind superseding the first one, in the form of pleasure whichthe coming of objects seems to produce.So, as a matter of fact, one excitation arose in the mind and was superseded byanother in the same mind.Outward objects are only the occasions—they are not causes. A poor person'sdesire for delicacies may be satisfied by an ordinary sweetmeat, and thisfulfillment will give rise to pleasure. But the desire for delicacies on thepart of a rich person may perhaps be satisfied only by the best of pastries, andthe fulfillment will also give the same amount of pleasure. Then does pleasuredepend on outward objects, or on the state of mind? Surely the latter.But pleasure, as we said, is an excitation. Therefore it is never justifiable todrive away the excitation in desire by another excitation, viz., that felt inpleasure. Because we do this our excitations never end, and so our pain andmisery never cease.What we should do is to set at rest the excitation that is in desire and not tofan or continue it by excitation in pleasure. This setting at rest is renderedpossible, in an effective way, only by Bliss-consciousness, which is notcallousness buta superior stage of indifference to both pain and pleasure.&very human being is seeking to attain ^liss by fulfilling desire, but hemistakenly stops at pleasure, and so his desires never end, and he is swept awayinto the whirlpool of pain.Pleasure is a dangerous will-o'-the-wisp. And yet it is this pleasurableassociation that becomes our motive for future actions. This has proved to be asdeceptive as the mirage in a desert. Since pleasure, as was said before,consists of an excitation-consciousness plus a contrast-consciousness that thepain is now no more, we prepare ourselves, when we aim at it instead of atBliss, for running headlong into that cycle of ignorant existence which bringspleasure and pain in never-ending succession. We fall into terrible distressbecause of the change in our angle of vision from Bliss to pleasure.Thus we see that though the true aim of mankind is the avoidance of pain and theattainment of Bliss, yet owing to a fatal error man, though trying to avoidpain, pursues a deluding something named pleasure, mistaking it for ^liss.That the attainment of Bliss and not pleasure is the universal and highestnecessity is indirectly proved by the fact that man is never satisfied with oneobject of pleasure. He always flies from one to another. From money to dress,from dress to property, thence to conjugal pleasure—there is a restlesscontinuity.And so he is constantly falling into pain, even though he wishes to avoid it bythe adoption of what he deems proper means. Yet an unknown and unsatisfiedcraving seems ever to remain in his heart.But a religious man (the second example which I proposed to show) always wishesto adopt proper religious means by which he can come in contact with Bliss, orGod.Of course when I say that God is Bliss, I mean also that He is ever-existent andthat He is also conscious of His blissful existence. And when we wish EternalBliss or God, it is implied that with Bliss we also wish eternal, immortal,unchangeable, ever-conscious existence. That all of us, from the highest to thelowest, desire to be in Bliss has been proved a priori, and by a consid-eration of the motives and acts of men.To repeat the argument in a slightly different way: suppose some Higher Beingshould come to us and say to all people of the earth, \"You creatures of theworld! I will give you eternal sorrows and misery along with eternal existence;will you take that?\" Would any one like the prospect? Not one. All want eternalBliss (o/inanda) along with eternal existence (Sat). As a matter of fact,consideration of the motives of the world also shows there is no one but wouldlike to have Bliss.Similarly, no one likes the prospect of annihilation; if it is suggested, weshudder at the idea. All desire to exist permanently [Sat). But if we were giveneternal existence without the consciousness of that existence, we would rejectthat. For who is there that would embrace existence in sleep? None. We all wantconscious existence.Furthermore, we want eternal blissful conscious existence: Sat-Chit-Ananda(Existence-Consciousness-Bliss). That is the Hindu name for God. But for apragmatical considerationonly, we emphasize the Blissful aspect of God and our motive for Bliss, leavingout the aspects of Sat and Chity i.e., conscious existence (also other aspectsof Him not dwelt on here).Now, what is God? If God be something other than Bliss, and His contact producesin us no Bliss, or produces in us only pain, or if His contact does not drivepain away from us, should we want Him? No. If God is something useless to us, wewant Him not. What is the use of a God who remains always unknown and whosepresence is not inwardly manifest to us in at least some circumstances in ourlife?Whatever conception of God we form by the exercise of reason (such as: \"He istranscendent\" or \"He is immanent\") will always remain vague and indistinctunless really felt as such. In fact, we keep God at a safe distance, conceivingHim sometimes as a mere Personal Being, and then again theoretically thinking ofHim as being within us.It is because of this vagueness in our idea and experience concerning God thatwe are not able to grasp the real necessity for Him and the prag-matical value of religion. This colorless theory or idea fails to bringconviction to us. It does not change our lives, influence our conduct in anappreciable way, or make us try to know Qod,What does Universal Religion say about God? It says that the proof of theexistence of Qod lies in ourselves. It is an inner experience. You can surelyrecall at least one moment in your life when, in prayer or worship, you feltthat the trammels of your body had nearly vanished, that the duality ofexperience—pleasure and pain, petty love and hate, and so on—had receded fromyour mind. Pure Bliss and tranquillity had welled up in your heart and youenjoyed an unruffled calm—Bliss and contentment.Though this kind of higher experience does not often come to all, yet there canbe no doubt that all men, at some time or other, in prayer or in a mood ofworship or meditation, have enjoyed a few moments of unalloyed Peace.Is this not a proof of the existence of God? What other direct proof than theexistence of ^liss in ourselves in real prayer or worship can we give of theexistence and nature of Qod?Though there is the cosmological proof of the existence of God—from effect werise to cause, from the world to the World-Maker. And there is the teleologicalproof as well—from the telos (plan, adaptation) in the world, we rise to theSupreme Intelligence that makes the plan and adaptation. There is also the moralproof—from conscience and the sense of perfection we rise to the Perfect Beingto whom our responsibility is due.Still, we should admit that these proofs are more or less the products ofinference. We cannot have full or direct knowledge of God through the limitedpowers of the intellect. Intellect gives only a partial and indirect view ofthings. To view a thing intellectually is not to see it by being one with it: itis to view a thing by being apart from it.But intuition, which we shall later explain, is the direct grasp of truth. It isin this intuition that Bliss-consciousness, or God-consciousness, is realized.There is not a shadow of doubt as to the absolute identity of^liss-consciousness and Qod-con-sciousness, because when we have that Bliss-consciousness we feel that ournarrow individuality has been transformed and that we have risen above theduality of petty love and hate, pleasure and pain, and have attained a levelfrom which the painfulness and worthlessness of ordinary consciousness becomeglaringly apparent.And we also feel an inward expansion and all-embracing sympathy for all things.The tumults of the world die away, excitements disappear, and the \"all in Oneand One in all\" consciousness seems to dawn upon us. A glorious vision of lightappears. All imperfections, all angularities, sink into nothingness. We seem tobe translated into another region, the fountainhead of perennial Bliss, thestarting point of one unending continuity. Is not Bliss-consciousness, then, thesame as God-consciousness, in which the above states of realization appear?It is evident, therefore, that God cannot be better conceived than as Bliss ifwe try to bring Him within the range of every one's calm experience. No longerwill God be a supposition then, to be theorized over. Is this not a noblerconception of God? He is perceived as manifesting Himself in our hearts in theform of Bliss in meditation—in prayerful or worshipful mood.// we conceive of Qod in this way, i,e,y as '^liss, then and then only may wemake religion universally necessary. For no one can deny that he wishes toattain Bliss and, if he wishes to achieve it in the proper way, he is going tobe religious through approaching and feeling God, who is described as very closeto his heart as Bliss.This Bliss-consciousness or God-consciousness can pervade all our actions andmoods, if we but let it. If we can get a firm hold on this, we shall be able tojudge the relative religious worth of man's every action and motive on thisearth.If we are once convinced that the attainment of this Bliss-consciousness is ourreHgion, our goal, our ultimate end, then all doubts as to the meaning ofmultifarious teachings, injunctions, and prohibitions of the different faiths ofthe world will disappear. Everything will be interpreted in the light of thestage of growth for which it is prescribed.Truth will shine out, the mystery of existencewill be solved, and a light will be thrown upon the details of our lives, withtheir various actions and motives. We shall be able to separate the naked truthfrom the outward appendages of religious doctrines and to see the worthlessnessof the conventions that so often mislead men and create differences betweenthem.Furthermore, if religion is understood in this way, there is no man in theworld—whether boy, youth, or an old person—who cannot practice it, whatever maybe the station of life to which he belongs, whether that of student, laborer,lawyer, doctor, carpenter, scholar, or philanthropist. If to abolish the senseof want and attain Bliss is religion, who is there that is not trying to bereligious and that will not try to be so in a greater degree, if proper methodsare pointed out to him?Herein does not arise the question of the variety of religions—that of Christ,of Mohammed, or of Sri Krishna. Every one in the world is inevitably trying tobe religious, and can seek to be more completely so by the adoption of propermeans. There is no distinction here of caste orcreed, sect or faith, dress or clime, age or sex, profession or position. Forthis religion is universal.If you said that all the people of the world ought to acknowledge Sri Krishna astheir Savior, would all the Christians and the Mohammedans accept that? If youasked every one to take Jesus as their Lord, would all the Hindus andMohammedans do that? And if you bade all to accept Mohammed as their Prophet,would the Christians and Hindus agree to that?But if you say, \"Oh, my Christian, Mohammedan, and Hindu brethren, your Lord Godis Ever-Blissful Conscious Existence (Being),\" will they not accept this? Canthey possibly reject it? Will they not demand Him as the only One who can put anend to all their miseries?Nor may one escape this conclusion by saying that Christians, Hindus, andMohammedans do not conceive Jesus, Krishna, and Mohammed respectively as theLord God—they are thought to be only the standard-bearers of God, the humanincarnations of divinity. What if one does think that way? It is not thephysical bodies of Jesus, Krishna, and Mohammed that we are pri-marily interested in, nor are we so much concerned with the historical placethey occupy.Nor are they solely memorable to us because of their different and interestingways of preaching truth. We revere them because they knew and felt Qod. It isthat fact which interests us in their historical existence and in their manifoldways of expressing the truth.Did not all of them realize God as Bliss and reveal real blessedness as truegodliness? Is not that a sufficient bond of unity among them—let alone otheraspects of Godhead and truth they may have realized and expressed? Should not aChristian, a Hindu, and a Mohammedan find interest in one another's prophets,inasmuch as all of them attained God-consciousness? As God unites all religions,it is the realization of Him as Bliss that unites the consciousness of theprophets of all religions.*One should not think that this conception of*Bliss-consciousness is also stressed in so-called adieistic religions, such asBuddhism. The Buddhistic Nirvana is not, as mistakenly supposed by many Westernwriters, a \"blowing out of light,\" an extinction of existence. It is rather thestage whereGod is too abstract, having nothing to do with our spiritual hopes andaspirations, which require the conception of God as a Personal Being. It is notthe conception of an Impersonal Being, as commonly understood, nor that of aPersonal Being, as narrowly conceived.God is not a Person, as are we in our narrowness. Our being, consciousness,feeling, volition have but a shadow of resemblance to His Being (Existence),Consciousness, and Bliss. He is a Person in the transcendental sense. Our being,consciousness, and feeling are limited and empirical. His unlimited andtranscendental. He has an Impersonal and Absolute aspect, but we should notthink He is beyond the reach of all experience—even our inner one.He comes within the calm experience of men. It is in TBlisS'Consciousness thatwe realize Him. There can be no other direct proof of His existence. It is inHim as ^liss that our spiritualnarrow individuality is blotted out and transcendent calm in universality isreached. This is exactly what comes in higher Bliss-consciousness, though thename of God is not attached to it by the Buddhist,hopes and aspirations find fulfillment — our devotion and love find an object.A conception of a Personal Being who is nothing but ourselves magnified is notrequired. God may be or become anything—Personal, Impersonal, All-merciful,Omnipotent, and so forth. But we are not required to take note of these.Whatever conception we have put forth exactly suits our purposes, our hopes, ouraspirations, and our perfection.Nor should we think that this conception of God will make us dreamy idealists,severing our connection with the duties and responsibilities, joys and sorrows,of the practical world. If God is Bliss and if we seek Bliss to know Him, we maynot neglect the duties and responsibilities of the world. In the performance ofthem we can still feel Bliss, for it is beyond them, and so they cannot affectit.We transcend the joys and sorrows of the world in Bliss, but we do not transcendthe necessity of performing our rightful duties in the world.The man of Self-realization knows that God isthe Doer—all power to perform actions flows into us from Him. He that iscentered in his Spiritual self feels himself to be the dispassionate seer of allactions, whether he is seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, tasting, orundergoing various other experiences on earth. Immersed in Bliss, such men livetheir lives in accordance with God's will.When nonattachment is cultivated, narrow egoism vanishes. We feel that we areplaying our appointed parts on the stage of the world, without being inwardlyaffected by the weal and woe, love and hate, that the playing of a partinvolves.Verily, in all respects the world may be likened to a stage. The stage managerchooses people to help him in the enactment of a certain play. He allotsparticular parts to particular persons; all of them work according to hisdirections. One the stage manager makes a king, one a minister, one a servant,another the hero, and so on. One person has to play a sorrowful part, another ajoyful role.If each man plays his part according to thedirections of the stage manager, then the play, with all its diversities ofcomical, serious, sorrowful parts, becomes successful. Even the insignificantparts have their indispensable places in the play.The success of the play lies in the perfect acting out of each part. Each actorplays his role of sorrow or pleasure realistically, and to all outwardappearances seems to be affected by it; but inwardly he remains untouched by itor by the passions he portrays — love, hate, desire, malice, pride, humility.But if an actor, in the playing of a part, identified himself with a certainsituation or a particular feeling expressed in the play and lost his ownindividuality, he would be thought foolish, to say the least. A story will bringout the latter point clearly.Once in the house of a rich man the play of %amayan was staged. In the course ofthe play it was found that the man who should play the part of Hanuman (amonkey), the attendant-friend of Ram, was missing. In his perplexity the stagemanager seized upon an ugly simpleton.Nilkamal by name, and sought to make him enact the part of Hanuman,Nilkamal at first refused, but was forced to appear on the stage. His uglyappearance excited loud laughter among the spectators and they began to shout inmerriment, ^'Hanuman, Hanuman!\"Nilkamal could hardly bear this. He forgot that it was only a play, and bawledout in exasperation, \"Why, sirs, do you call me Hanuman? Why do you laugh? I amnot a Hanuman. The stage manager made me come out here this way.\"In this complex world our lives are nothing but plays. But alas! we identifyourselves with the play, and hence feel disgust, sorrow and pleasure. We forgetthe direction and injunction of the Great Stage Manager. In the act of livingour lives—^playing our parts—^we feel as real all our sorrows and pleasures,loves and hates—in a word, we become attached, affected.This play of the world is without beginning and end. Everyone should play hispart, as assigned by the Great Stage Manager, ungrudg-ingly; should play for the sake of the play only; should act sorrowful whenplaying sorrowful parts, or pleased when playing pleasurable parts, but shouldnever be inwardly identified with the play.Nor should one wish to play another's part. If everyone in the world portrayedthe role of a king, the play itself would lose interest and meaning.He that has attained Bliss-consciousness will jeel the world to be a stage andwill play out his part as best he can, remembering the Great Stage Manager, God,and knowing and feeling His plan and direction.CHAPTER IIIFour Fundamental Religious MethodsWe have seen in the last chapter that the identification of the Spiritual selfwith body and mind is the fundamental cause of our pain, suffering, andlimitations, and that because of this identification we feel such excitations aspain and pleasure, and are almost blind to the state of Bliss, orGod-consciousness. We have also seen that religion essentially consists in thepermanent avoidance of such pain and in the attainment of pure Bliss, or God.As the sun's true image cannot be perceived in the surface of moving water, sothe true blissful nature of the Spiritual self—the reflection of the UniversalSpirit—cannot be understood owing to the waves of disquietude that arise fromidentification of the self with the changing states of the body and mind. As themoving waters distort the true image of the sun, so doesthe disturbed state of the mind, through identification, distort the true,Ever-Blissful nature of the Inner Self.The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the easiest, most rational, and mostfundamental methods, practical for all, that will free the Ever-Blissful,Spiritual self from its baneful connection and identification with thetransitory body and mind, thus causing it permanently to avoid pain and attainBliss, which constitutes religion.Therefore the fundamental methods to be considered are religious and involvereligious actions, because only by means of these can the Spiritual self befreed from identification with the body and mind and thus from pain, and be ableto attain permanent Bliss, or God.When Christ called himself the \"Son of God,\" he meant the Universal Spiritdwelling in him. In John 10:36 Jesus says: \"Of him whom the Father hathsanctified and sent into the world ... I said, I am the Son of God.\"But, at other times, when Christ used another phrase—the \"Son of man\"—^he meantthe physi-cal body, the offspring of man, the flesh that is bom out of another human body.For instance, in Matthew 20:18-19, Jesus says to the disciples: \"Behold, we goup to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests . .. and they shall . . . deliver him to the Gentiles ... to crucify him.\"In John 3:5-6, Christ says: \"Except a man be bom of water (the oceanic vibrationof cAum or cAmen, the Holy Ghost, the Invisible Force that upholds all creation,God in His immanent aspect of the Creator) and of the Spirit, he cannot enterinto the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and thatwhich is born of the Spirit is Spirit.\"These words mean that unless we can transcend the body and realize ourselves asSpirit, we cannot enter into the kingdom or state of that Universal Spirit.This thought is echoed in a Sanskrit couplet of the Hindu scriptures: \"If thoucanst transcend the body and perceive thyself as Spirit, thou shalt be etemallyblissful, free from all pain.\"Now there are four fundamental, universalreligious methods which, if followed in daily life, will in time liberate theSpiritual self from the trammels of its bodily and mental vehicles. Under thesefour classes of religious methods I include all the possible religious practicesthat have ever been enjoined by any saint or savant or prophet of God.Religious practices are inculcated by prophets in the form of doctrines. Men oflimited intellect, failing to interpret the true import of these doctrines,accept their exoteric or outer meaning and gradually fall into forms,conventions, and rigid practices. This is the origin of sectarianism.Rest from work on the sabbath day was wrongly interpreted to mean rest from allwork —even religious work. This is the danger to men of limited understanding.We should remember that we are not made for the sabbath, but that the sabbath ismade for us; we are not made for rules, rules are made for us—they change as wechange. We are to hold to the essence of a rule, not dogmatically to its form.Change of forms and customs constitutes for many a change from one religion toanother. Butthe deepest import of all the doctrines of all the different prophets isessentially the same. Most men do not understand this.But there is equal danger in the case of the intellectually great. They try toknow the Highest Truth by the exercise of the intellect alone. But the HighestTruth can be known only by realization.Realization is something other than mere understanding. We could not possiblyunderstand intellectually the sweetness of sugar if we had not tasted it. Justso, religious knowledge is drawn from the deepest experience of one's own soul.This we often forget when we seek to learn about God, religious dogmas, andmorahty. We seldom seek to know these through inner religious experience.It is a pity that men of great intellectual power, successful in their use ofreason in the way of discovering the deep truths of the natural sciences andother fields of knowledge, think that they will also be able to graspintellectually the highest religious and moral truths. It is also a pity thatthe intellect or reason of these men,instead of being a help, is often found to be a bar to their comprehension ofthe Highest Truth by the only means possible—living it in one's life. Let usconsider the four methods characterizing religious growth.I. Intellectual Method — the commonly adopted, natural method, not quicklyeffective in realizing the end.Intellectual development and progression has been natural and hence common toall rational beings. It is our self-conscious understanding which differentiatesus from the lower animals, which are conscious but not self-conscious.In the grades and processes of evolution we see that this consciousnessgradually becomes self-consciousness — from animal consciousnessself-consciousness arises. The consciousness gradually tries to free itself andtries to know itself by itself; thus it is changed into self-consciousness. Thischange is due to an evolutional necessity, and the universal urge towardintellectual pursuits is due to this evolutional tendency. The Spiritual self,identified with various degrees andsorts of bodily and mental states, tries gradually and naturally to return toitself through itself.The development of the conscious thought-process is one of the methods which theSpiritual self adopts to rise above the trammels of the body and mind. Theeffort of the Spiritual self to return to itself—its lost condition—through thedevelopment of thought-process is natural. This is the process of the world.The Universal Spirit expresses itself in different grades of development, fromlower to higher. In stone and earth there is no Ufe or consciousness as we canconceive it. In trees there is vegetative growth, an approach to life, yet nounhampered life and no conscious thought-process at all. In animals there islife and also consciousness of life. In man—the culmination point— there islife, consciousness of it, and also consciousness of the Self (i.e..Self-consciousness).Hence it is natural for a man to develop himself through thinking and reasoning,by deep study of books, by original research work, and by laboriousinvestigations into causes and effects in the natural world.The more deeply a man engages in thought-processes, the more he may be said tobe utilizing the method by which he has come to be what he is in the course ofthe world-evolution process (i.e., the method by which consciousness developsinto Self-consciousness) and the nearer, knowingly or unknowingly, he approachesthe Self.For in thought we rise above the body. The deliberate following of this methodwill bring about sure results. Exercise of thought in study, for the acquirementof knowledge in a particular field, though to some extent improving theSelf-consciousness, is not so effective as that thought-process which has as itssole object the transcending of the body and seeing the truth.In India the intellectual method in its highest form is called Jnana Toga —theattainment of true wisdom through recoUectedness and discrimination, such asconstantly reminding oneself: \"I am not the body. The passing show of creationcannot affect my Self. I am Spirit.\"One of the defects of this method is that it is a very slow process for theSpiritual self to thusrealize itself. It may involve a good deal of time. While the Spiritual selfbegins to apprehend Self-consciousness by this method, still it is alwaysengaged with a series of passing mental thoughts with which it has no relation.Tranquillity of the Spirit is something beyond thought and bodily sensation,though when once attained it overflows into them.II. Devotional Method. This consists in the attempt to fix our attention on oneobject of thought; rather than on different series of thoughts and on varioussubjects (as in the intellectual method).Under the devotional method are included all forms of worship, such as prayer(from which we should eliminate all thoughts of worldly things). The Spiritualself should fix its attention deeply and reverently on whatever it chooses toconcentrate on—whether the thought of a Personal God or of an ImpersonalOmnipresence.The main point is that the devotee should concentrate on one devotional thoughtin good earnest.By this process the Spiritual self becomes gradually freed from the disturbancesof many thoughts—the second series of disturbances— and gets time andopportunity to think of itself in itself. When we pray earnestly, we forget allbodily sensations and drive away all intruding thoughts that try to engage ourattention.The deeper our prayer, the more intense is the satisfaction felt, and thisbecomes the criterion by which we measure how far we have approached Bliss-God.As the bodily sensations are left behind and as the vagrant thoughts arechecked, the superiority of this over the foregoing method becomes manifest.However, this method presents certain defects and difficulties. Owing to thelong-continued attachment and slavery of the Spiritual self to the body—to thisdeep-rooted bad habit—it ineffectually tries to turn its attention away from thesphere of bodily and mental sensations.However much one may wish to pray or engage in any form of worship with one'swhole heart, one's attention is mercilessly invaded by the raiding bodilysensations and fleetingthoughts brought in by memory. In prayer we are often wholly engrossed in theconsideration of the circumstances favorable to it, or we are too ready toremove any of our disturbing bodily discomforts.In spite of all our conscious efforts, our bad habit, which has become a secondnature to us, lords it over the Self's wishes. In spite of our desire, the mindbecomes restless, and, to paraphrase, \"Wherever your mind shall be there shallyour heart be also.\" We are told to pray to God with all our hearts. Instead, wegenerally pray while our minds and hearts are distracted by roving thoughts andsensory impressions.III. Meditational Method. This and the next method are purely scientific,involving a practical course of training, and are prescribed by great sages whopersonally have realized the truth in their own lives. I myself learned from oneof these.There is nothing of mystery in these methods, nor anything to be dreaded asharmful. They are easy, if one is properly acquainted with them.They will be found to be universally true. Practically felt knowledge is thebest proof of their validity and pragmatic utility.By undergoing regularly the processes of meditation till they become a habit, wecan bring upon ourselves a state of conscious sleep. We generally experiencethis calm and pleasurable tranquil state just when we are falling into deepsleep and approaching unconsciousness, or rising from it and approachingconsciousness.In this state of conscious sleep we become free from all thoughts and outerbodily sensations, and the Self gets opportunity to think of itself— it comesinto the blissful state from time to time, according to the depth and frequencyof its practice of meditation.In this state we are temporarily forgetful of and free from all bodily andmental disturbances which divert the Self's attention. By this process ofmeditation the outer or sensory organs are controlled by the quieting of thevoluntary nerves, as in sleep.This state of meditation is the first and not the final state of realmeditation. In \"conscioussleep\" we learn to control only the outer or sensory organs; the only differencebeing that in ordinary sleep the sensory organs are automatically controlled,while in meditation, the sensory organs are voluntarily controlled.However, in this early stage of meditation the Spiritual self is still liable tobe disturbed by the involuntary and internal organs, e.g., the lungs, heart, andother parts of the body that we mistakenly suppose to be beyond control.*We must look for a better method than this, for as long as the Spiritual selfcannot at will shut out all bodily sensations^ even interior ones, which are theoccasions of the rise of thoughts, but remains vulnerable to these disturbances,it can have no hope of control nor of time or opportunity to know itself.*We seldom learn, as great saints and savants have learned, how to give rest tothese internal organs. Because we suppose them to be beyond control, they getoverworked and suddenly stop, which stoppage we term \"Death\" or the \"GreatSleep.\"IV. Scientific Method or Yoga. St. Paul said: \"I die daily \"^ By this he meantthat he knew the process of controlling the internal organs and couldvoluntarily free his Spiritual self from the body and mind—an experience whichordinary untrained people only feel at final death, when the Spiritual self isfreed from the worn-out body.Now by undergoing a practical and regular course of training in this scientificmethod the Self can be felt as being separate from the body, without finaldeath,I will give only a general idea of the process and the true scientific theory onwhich it is based. I set it down here from my own experience. I may say it willbe found to be universally true. And I may also safely say that ^liss^ which is^as I pointed out^ our ultimate end, is felt in an intense degree in the act ofpracticing this method. The practice of it is itself intensely blissful — farmore purely blissful, I venture to say, than the greatest enjoyment that any of♦7 Corinthians 15:31,our five senses or the mind can ever afford us,I do not wish to give anyone any other proof of its truth than is afforded byhis own experience. The more one practices it with patience and regularity, themore one feek intensely and durably fixed in ^liss.Owing to the persistence of bad habits, the consciousness of bodily existence,with all its memories, revives occasionally and fights against thattranquillity. But if anyone practices regularly and for extended periods, it maybe guaranteed that in time he will find himself in a highly supramental state of^liss.We should not, however, over-wisely seek to imagine beforehand the possibleresults to which the process may lead, and then cease practicing the methodafter a short trial.In order to make real progress the following things are necessary: First, lovingattention to the subject to be learned; second, desire to learn and an earnestspirit of inquiry; third, steadfastness until the desired end is attained.If we go only half-way and then, after a short practice, reject it, the desiredresult will not fol-low. A novice in spiritual practices who tries to prejudge the experience ofexperts (the masters and prophets of all ages) is like a child that attempts toimagine what post-graduate courses would be like.It is a great pity that men will spend their best efforts and time in securingwhat is needed for worldly existence or in indulging in intellectual controversyover theories, but seldom seem to think it worth their while to realize andpatiently experience in life the truths which not only vivify but impart meaningto it. Misguided efforts often engage their attention longer than well-guidedefforts.I have been practicing the above-mentioned method for many years, and the more Ido so, the more I feel the joy of a state of permanent and unfailing Bliss.We should bear in mind that the Spiritual self has been in bondage to the bodyfor how many ages we know not. It may not be freed in one day, nor will short ordesultory practice of the method take one to the Supreme State of Bliss or giveone control over the internal organs. Itmay require patient practice for a long, long time.This can be guaranteed, however—that the following of this process will bringthe great joy of pure Bliss-consciousness. The more we practice it, the morequickly we attain Bliss. I wish that, as seekers of Bliss, which all of us are,you would try to experience for yourselves that universal truth which is in alland may be felt by all. This state is not an invention of anyone. It is alreadythere. We have simply to discover it.Do not, until you have tested this truth, look upon what I write withindifference. It may be that you are tired of hearing various theories, none ofwhich has hitherto had any direct bearing on your life. This is no theory, butrealized truth. I am trying to give you an idea of what can be reallyexperienced.I had the good fortune to learn this holy, scientific truth from a great saintof India many years ago. You may ask why I urge you—why I draw your attention tothese facts. Have I any selfish interest? To this I answer in the aflSrma-tive.I wish to give this truth to you with thehope of getting in return pure joy for having helped you to find your joy in thepractice and realization of it.Now I have to enter into a little physiology, which will enable us to understandthe method, at least in a general way. I will refer to the work of the maincenters and to the electrical current that flows from the brain through thesecenters to the outer (sensory) and internal organs and keeps them vibrating withlife.There are six main centers through which Pranic Current, Vital Current, or LifeElectricity from the brain is discharged throughout the nervous system. Theseare:1. Medulla Center. 4. Lumbar Center.2. Cervical Center. 5. Sacral Center.3. Dorsal Center. 6. Coccygeal Center.The brain is the supreme electrical Power-House (highest center). All thecenters are connected with one another and act under the influence of thesupreme center (brain cells). The brain cells discharge life current, orelectricity,through these centers, which in turn discharge electricity to the differentefferent and afferent nerves which respectively carry motor impulses andsensations of touch, sight, and so forth.This electrical flow from the brain is the life of the organism (of its internaland external organs)y and it is this electrical medium through which all oursensory reports reach the brain and cause thought reactions.The Self, if it wishes effectively to shut out the disturbing reports of bodilysensations (which are also the occasions of the rise of the thought-series),must control and concentrate the electrical flow and draw it back from thenervous system as a whole to the seven main centers (including the brain), sothat by this process it may give the outer and internal organs perfect rest.In sleep, the electrical conductivity between the brain and the sensory organsis partially inhibited, so that ordinary sensations of sound, touch, and soforth, do not reach the brain. But because this inhibition is not complete, asufficiently strong stimulus from without restores this electrical conductivityand is reported to thebrain, awakening the person. Yet always in sleep there is a steady electricalflow into the internal organs—heart, lungs, and other parts—so that they keep onthrobbing and working.As the control of life electricity in sleep is not complete, bodily sensationsof discomfort, disease, or strong outside stimuli disturb it. But through ascientific process of control, which may not be here described in detail, we cancontrol simultaneously the external and the internal organs of the system in aperfect way. That is the ultimate result of practice. But it may take long yearsto attain that perfect control.As after sleep, which is rest, the outer organs are invigorated, so the internalorgans, after rest as a result of the practice of this scientific method, aregreatly vitalized; and with the consequent increase in their working power, lifeis prolonged.As we do not fear to go to sleep lest for the time being the sensory organsremain inert, so we ought not to fear to practice conscious death, i.e., giverest to the internal organs. Death will then be under our control; for when wethinkthis bodily house is unfit and broken, we shall be able to leave it of our ownaccord. \"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.\"*We may describe the process thus: If the main telephone office in a town ispermanently connected by wires with different parts of the town, men telephoningfrom those parts can always, even against the will of the authorities of themain telephone office, send messages to the central office through the medium ofthe electric current running along the connecting wires. If the main telephoneoffice wishes to stop communication with the different parts, it can turn offthe main electrical switch and there will be no flow to the different quartersof the town.Similarly, the scientific method teaches a process enabling us to draw to ourcentral part — spine and brain—the life current distributed throughout theorgans and other parts of our body. The process consists of magnetizing thespinal column and the brain, which contain the seven main centers, with theresult that the dis-♦/ Corinthians 15:26.tributed life electricity is drawn back to the original centers of discharge andis experienced in the form of light. In this state the Spiritual self canconsciously free itself from its bodily and mental distractions.The Spiritual self is, as it were, being disturbed, even against its wish, bythe telephone reports from two classes of people—gentlemen (thoughts) and lowclass people (bodily sensations). In order to break connection with them theSelf has only to draw away the electricity flowing through the telephone wiresto the central battery of its house by turning off the switch (i.e., practicingthe fourth method), in order to enjoy relief.c/ittention is the great director and discharger of energy. It is the activecause of the discharge of the electrical life current from the brain to thesensory and motor nerves. For example, we drive away a troublesome fly bydischarging, through the power of attention, electrical current along the motornerves, thereby producing the desired movement of the hand. I cite this to givean idea of the power by which the electrical flow of thesystem can be controlled and drawn back to its seven centers.It is these seven starlike (astral) cerebrospinal centers and their mystery thatare mentioned in %evelation in the Bible. St. John unsealed the hidden openingsof the seven centers and ascended to true understanding of himself as Spirit.\"Write the things which thou hast seen . . . the mystery of the seven stars.\"*In conclusion I wish to describe the nature of the states which emerge when theelectrical flow is completely controlled. In the beginning a most attractivesensation is felt in the course of magnetizing the spinal column. But continuedand long practice will bring about a state of conscious Bliss which counteractsthe exciting state of our body consciousness.This blissful state has been described as our universal aim and highestnecessity, because in it we are really conscious of Qod, or ^liss, and feel theexpansion of our real selves. The more frequently this is experienced, the moreour nar-* Revelation 1:19,20.row individuality falls away, the sooner the state of universality is reached,and the closer and more direct is our communion with God.Religion is really nothing but the merging of our individuality in universality.Therefore in the consciousness of this Blissful state we ascend the steps ofreligion. We leave the noxious atmosphere of the senses and vagrant thoughts andcome to a region of heavenly Bliss.We learn by this process what will be found to be universally true: when byconstant practice the consciousness of this Blissful state of the Spiritual selfbecomes real, we find ourselves always in the holy presence of the Blissful Godin us. We discharge our duties better, having an eye more for the dutiesthemselves than for our egoism and the consciousness of pleasure and painarising therefrom. Then we can solve the mystery of existence and impart realmeaning to life.In the teachings of all religions, whether it be Christianity, Mohammedanism, orHinduism, one truth is stressed: until man knows himself as Spirit — thefountainhead of Bliss — he is limited by mortal concepts and subject to theinexorable laws of nature. Knowledge of his true being brings him eternalfreedom.We can know God only by knowing ourselves, for our real nature is similar toHis. Man has been created in the image of God. If the methods here suggested arelearned and earnestly practiced, you will know yourself to be a Blissful spiritand will realize God.The methods given in this book embrace all the conceivable means essential tothe realization of God. They do leave out of consideration the thousand and oneconventional rules and minor practices enjoined by the so-called differentreligions, because some of these relate to differences in the frame of mind ofthe individuals, hence are less important, though by no means imneces-sary; andbecause others come up in the course of practice of these methods, hence do notrequire fuller treatment in the limited space here.The superiority of this method over others lies in the fact that it works withthe exact thing that binds us down to our narrow individuality—the life-force.Instead of being turned back and absorbed into the expansive self-consciousforce ofthe Self, the life-force goes outward, keeping the body and mind always inmotion, and causing disturbances to the Spiritual self in the shape of bodilysensations and passing thoughts.Because the life-force moves outward, sensations and thoughts disturb anddistort the calm image of the Self or Soul. This method teaches us to turn thelife-force inward.* Hence it is direct and immediate. It takes us straight tothe consciousness of Self—the Bliss-God. It does not require the help of anintermediary.This method is to control and direct the course of the life-force by the controland regulation of a known and directly connected manifestation of the life-forceitself.The other methods employ the help of the intellect, or thought process, tocontrol the life-force in order to induce consciousness of the Self in itsBlissful and other aspects.It should be noted that all religious methods in the world directly orindirectly, tacitly or expressly, enjoin the control, regulation, and tum-♦See page 102.ing back of the life-force so that we may transcend the body and mind and knowthe Self in its native state.The fourth method directly controls itself by itself, whereas the other methodsdo it indirectly through some other intermediary — thought, prayer, good works,worship, or \"conscious sleep.\"Presence of life in man is existence, absence of it is death. Hence the methodthat teaches life's direct power to control itself must be the best of all.Savants of different ages and climes have suggested methods adapted to themental frame and condition of the people among whom they lived and preached.Some have laid stress on prayer, some on feeling, some on good works, some onlove, some on reason or thought, some on meditation. But their motives have beenthe same.They all meant that body consciousness should be transcended by the turning backof the life-force inward, and that the Self should be realized, as the image ofthe sun appears in calm.unruffled water. Their purpose is the inculcation of just that which the fourthmethod teaches directly, without the help of any intermediary.At the same time it should be noted that the practice of this method does notprevent the cultivation of the intellect, the building up of the physique, andthe activity of a social and useful life—a life of the best feelings andmotives, devoted to philanthropic works. As a matter of fact, all-sided trainingshould be prescribed for all. It positively helps rather than retards thepractice of the method; the only thing required is that its point of view beretained. Then all actions, all pursuits, will result to one's advantage.The main thing in this process is to understand thoroughly the mystery of thelife-force that sustains the bodily organism of man, causing it to vibrate withlife and energy.CHAPTER IVInstruments of Knowledge Perception — Inference — IntuitionThe universality and necessity of the religious ideal (ever-existent,ever-conscious Bliss-God) and the practical methods to reach it have beendiscussed in the previous chapters. Now we wish to discuss the validity of themethods.The methods are essentially practical, and if they are followed the ideal mustbe reached, whether we deal with the theories or not. Their validity is shown bythe practical result itself, which is palpable and real.It is not, be it understood, really necessary to show the theoretical grounds ofvalidity. But simply to satisfy others we treat a priori of the validity of thetheories of knowledge on which the methods are based, that their validity mayalso be theoretically shown.This will launch us into the epistemological question: How and how far can weknow the ideal, the truth? To show how we know the ideal we must consider how weknow the actual world. We must deal with the process of knowing the world. Therewe shall see whether the process of knowing the world is the same as the processof knowing the ideal, and whether the actual world is separate from the ideal orwhether the latter pervades the former, only the process of knowing the twobeing different.Before proceeding further let us discuss the \"instruments\" of knowledge—the wayby which knowledge of the world is made possible to us.There are three instruments or means of knowledge: Terception^ Inference,Intuition. .I. Perception. Our senses are, as it were, windows, through which stimuli fromthe outside come and strike the mind, which passively receives theseimpressions. Unless the mind operates, no impression can be made on it by thestimuli coming from the outside through the sense-windows.Mind not only furnishes the connections to the stimuli received through thedifferent senses, but stores their influences in the form of impressions. Butthese impressions remain a confused, disconnected mass until the discriminativefaculty C^uddhi) operates on the impressions.A relevant connection is then established and the details of the outer world arerecognized as such. They are projected, so to speak, and known in the forms oftime and space, having distinct associations — quantity, quality, measure, andmeaning. A house is then known as a house, and not as a post. This is the resultof the operation of the Intellect (\"Buddhi),We may see an object, feel it, and then hear the sound of it when struck, ourmind receiving these impressions and storing them, ^uddhi interprets them andseems to project them in the form of a house with its various parts—^size,shape, color, form, fashion, and its relation to others in the present, past, orfuture—in time and space. This is the way that knowledge of the world arises.An insane person has impressions stored in hismind, but they are in a chaotic state—^not sorted and made up into distinct,well-ordered groups by the intellect.Now comes the question: Can Reality (the ideal, ever-conscious, ever-existentBliss-God) be known by perception of this sort? Is the process of knowing thisworld, viz., by perception, valid in the matter of knowing the highest truth?We know that the intellect can work only upon the materials supplied by thesenses. It is certain that the senses give us only the stimuli of quahties andvariety. Not only do the senses give variety, but intellect itself deals withvariety and remains in the region of variety. Though it can think of \"unity indiversity,\" it cannot be one with it. This is its drawback. Intellectualperception cannot really give the true nature of the One Universal Substanceunderlying diverse manifestations.This is the verdict of reason itself. When ^uddhi turns back upon itself tojudge how far it is capable of knowing Reality by interpreting thesense-impressions, it finds itself hopelessly confined within the domain of thesense-world.There is no loop-hole through which it can peep into the super-sensuous world.Some may say that because we drive a wedge between the sensuous and thesuper-sensuous worlds, reason cannot bring itself to believe that it may haveany knowledge of the super-sensuous. They say that if we think of thesuper-sensuous as manifesting in and through the sensuous, then in knowing thesensuous—^with its connection (teleology, or adaptation) and all the details andvarieties by the process of the intellect—^we shall be knowing thesuper-sensuous manifested as \"unity in diversity.\"But it may be questioned, what is the nature of this knowing? Is it merely anidea in the brain, or is it seeing the truth (unity in diversity) face to face,first-hand and direct? Does this form of knowing carry the same conviction thatbeing one with it would carry? Surely not, for this knowing is only partial,defective. It is merely looking through a colored glass. The super-sensuousworld lies beyond. These are the a priori arguments against perception as aninstrument for knowing Reality, or God.From calm experience, also, we find that we cannot attain that Blissful state,which is Reality and the ideal itself, as shown in the previous chapters, untilwe rise to a considerable extent from the restless, perceptual stage. The morewe leave behind the disturbing perceptions and interior thoughts, the greater isthe possibility of the dawning of that supramental state of Bliss, or Bliss-God.Ordinary perception and Bliss seem to be mutually exclusive in commonexperience. However, none of our methods is based on pure perception, hence theinability of the latter to know Reality is not important.II. Inference. This is another way of deriving knowledge of the world. Butinference itself is based on experience—on perception— be it deductive orinductive. In our experience we find fire wherever there is smoke; hence if wesee smoke on any occasion, we infer there is fire. This is deductive inference.But it is possible only because of our previous experience (perception) of smokeas being associated with fire. Ininductive inference, also, there is the same dependence on perception.We observe that a certain kind of bacillus is the cause of cholera. We find outthe causal connection between that kind of bacillus and cholera and at onceinductively infer that wherever we find this bacillus, cholera will be present.While there is a leap here from the known cases of cholera to the unknown cases,still by inference we get no new fact, though the cases may be new. The verypossibility of the establishment of a causal connection between certain bacilliand cholera depended upon observation (perception) of specific cases.So inference ultimately depends upon perception. In inferred cases we do not getany new truth—nothing really new that was not found in observed cases. Inobserved cases bacilli are followed by cholera, and in the inferred cases, too,bacilli are followed by cholera—^no new truth, though the cases are fresh andnew.No matter what forms of thought, reasoning, inference, or imagination we employ,we are still not face to face with Reality.Reason or thought may arrange and systematize facts of experience. It canendeavor to see things as a whole. It may try to penetrate into the mystery ofthe world. But its effort is hampered by the materials on which it works—factsof experience, sense impressions. They are bald, hard facts, disconnected,limited by our powers of perception. The materials disturb rather than help thethought process, which itself has a restless continuity.The first method, as we pointed out, is the Intellectual Method, utilizing thethought process in order to know Reality—the state of Bliss and calmrealization. But it fails. Bodily perceptions disturb us; the thought process,also, owing to its working on varied, restless sense-impressions, forbids ourremaining for long in a concentrated state. We therefore fail to attain theconsciousness of unity in diversity.One merit of the intellectual method is that when we are absorbed in thethought-world, to a certain extent we transcend bodily sensations. But this isalways temporary.In the other two methods—Devotional andMeditational—the thought process is less. Still, it is present. In theDevotional Method, i.e., in ritual or ceremonial worship, in prayer,congregational or individual, much of the thought process is engaged in thearrangement of favorable conditions. Still there is the attempt to concentrateon some subject of worship or prayer.So far as the diversity in thought processes is checked or prevented, thedevotional method is successful. The defect is this: owing to a bad habit,confirmed in the course of ages, our concentration is not deep, leaving thepossibility of setting the diversity of thought processes to work at theslightest disturbance.In the Meditational Method (outward formalities, conventions, rites, beingdispensed with, thus barring the possibility of the thought processes being setinto motion as easily as in the Devotional Method) concentration is fixed on oneobject of thought. There is then a gradual tendency to leave the sphere ofthought behind and to step into the sphere of intuition, which we shall nextconsider.III. Intuition. So far we have been considering the instruments and processes ofknowing this sensuous world. Intuition, with which we now deal, is the processby which we know the super-sensuous world—the world that is beyond senses andthoughts. It is true that the super-sensuous expresses itself in and through thesensuous, and to know the latter in completeness is to know the former, but theprocess of knowing the two must be different.Are we able to know even the sensory world in all its fullness merely byperception and thought? Assuredly not. There is an infinite number of facts,things, laws, and connections in nature and even in our own organism that arestill a sealed book to mankind. Far less, then, shall we be able to know thesuper-sensuous realm by perception and thought.Intuition comes from within; thought from without. Intuition gives aface-to-face view of 'Reality; thought gives an indirect view of it. Intuition,by a strange sympathy, sees Reality in its totality, while thought chops it upinto parts.Every man has the power of intuition, as hehas the power of thought. As thought can be cultivated, so intuition can bedeveloped. In intuition we are in tune with Reality—with the world of Bliss,with the \"unity in diversity,\" with the inner laws governing the spiritualworld, with God.How do we know that we exist? Through sense-perception? Do the senses first tellus that we exist —^whence the consciousness of existence comes? That can neverbe. For the consciousness of existence is presupposed in the attempt of thesenses to let us know of our existence. Sense cannot consciously be aware ofanything without our first knowing that we exist in the very act of sensing.Does inference, the thought-process, tell us that we exist? Assuredly not. Forthe materials of thought must be sense-impressions, which, as we have justfound, cannot tell us of our existence, as that feeling is already presupposedin them.Nor can the process of thought give us the consciousness of existence, for thelatter is already implied in the former. When, by com-paring ourselves with the outer world, we endeavor to think or infer that weexist therein, the consciousness of existence is already present in the very actof thinking and inferring.Then, if sense or thought fails, how do we know that we exist? It is only byintuition that we can know this. Such knowing is one form of intuition. It isbeyond sense and thought—they are made possible by it.It is very difficult to define intuition, for it is too near to every one of us.Every one of us feels it. Do we not know what the consciousness of existence is?Every one knows it. It is too familiar to admit of definition. Ask one how heknows he exists. He will remain dumb. He knows it, but he cannot define it. Hemay try to explain, but his explanation does not reveal what he inwardly feels.Intuition of every form has this peculiar character.The fourth method, explained in the last chapter, bases itself on intuition. Themore earnest we are about it, the wider and surer will be our vision ofReaUty—God.It is through intuition that humanity reachesDivinity, that the sensuous is brought into connection with the super-sensuous,and that the latter is felt to express itself in and through the sensuous. Theinfluence of senses vanishes, intruding thoughts disappear, Bliss-God isrealized, the consciousness of \"all in One and One in all\" dawns upon us. Thisintuition is what all great savants and prophets of the world possessed.The third, or Meditational Method, as explained in the last chapter, alsocarries us into the region of intuition—^when it is earnestly practiced. But itis a bit roundabout, and ordinarily takes a longer time to produce in us thesuccessive states of the intuitional or realization process.Thus it is by intuition that God can be realized in all His aspects. We have nosense that can reveal knowledge of Him. The senses give knowledge only of Hismanifestations. No thought or inference can enable us to know Him as He trulyis. For thought cannot go beyond the data of the senses. It can only arrange andinterpret the impressions of the senses.When the senses are unable, thought, as de-pending upon them, is ako unable to bring us to God. So it is to intuition thatwe shall have to turn for knowledge of God in His blissful and other aspects.However, there are many bars to this intuitional point of view—to therealization of truth. These are some of them: disease, mental incapacity, doubt,indolence, worldly-mindedness, false ideas, and instabiHty.These are either inherent or engendered and aggravated through association withothers. Our inherent tendencies (samskaras) to certain faults may be overcome bystrong-minded effort (pu-rushakara), By exercise of will power we can remove allour shortcomings. It is by right effort and by association with good people,devotees of God, that we can eradicate bad habits and form good ones.Until we associate with those who have seen, felt, and realized true religion intheir lives we may not fully know what it is, and in what its universality andnecessity lie.The spirit of inquiry is in all. Everyone in the world is a seeker after truth.It is his immortalheritage, and he seeks it, blindly or wisely, until he has fully reclaimed it.It is never too late to mend. \"Seek, and ye shall find; knock and it shall beopened unto you.\"*II^Matthew 7:7.By PARAMAHANSA YOGANANDA THE BOOK THAT IS AWAKENING THOUSANDSThis is the first time that an authentic Hindu yogi has written his life storyfor Western readers. Describing in vivid detail many years of spiritual trainingunder a Ghristlike master — Sri Yukteswar of Serampore, Bengal —^Yogananda hashere revealed a fascinating and little-known phase of modem India.
