You will open and clean the Great Bridge and the Great Regu- lar Channel. Both consist of a Yin and a Yang Channel. All together they form four channels (Yin and Yang Wei and the Yin and Yang Chiao Channels). They are the last Extraordinary acupuncture (psy- chic) Channels to open. The others are; the Governor (Du Mai) and Functional (Ren Mai) Channel of the Microcosmic Orbit and the Thrusting Channels (count as one Channel, related to the Chong Mai) and the Belt Channel (related to the Dai Mai). 2. You will learn to protect the spine and your energy field, to seal the aura and the senses and to drill your head. 3. You will learn to transform the Microcosmic Orbit, the Thrust- ing Channels and the Belt Channel in the Energy Body. Fusion of the Eight Psychic Channels is the last part of the Fu- sions. It teaches the last techniques and meditation to prepare you for the higher practices. After you master all the Fusion Practices you are ready and prepared to start the Practice of the Immortal Tao. Practice of Fusion of Eight Psychic Channels Great Bridge Channel and the Great Regular Channel 1. Theory The Great Regulator and Great Bridge Channels have no points of their own, but run across specific points of the twelve organ merid- ians. They connect in this way all these meridians together which enables the energy to flow from one meridian to another, balancing and regulating the energy flow in the meridians. The Great Bridge"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 Channel (Yin and Yang Chiao Mai) serves to connect all the merid- ians. The Great Regulator Channel (Yin and Yang Wei Mai) serves to regulate, coordinate and balance the energy flow between these meridians, also called the body’s channels. The routes they follow lie close together. Although they are separate channels we practice them in Fusion of Eight Psychic Channels as one channel with a Yin and a Yang part. The Yin part connects all the Yin organ-meridians and regu- lates the flow of energy in these meridians, the Yang part connects all the Yang organ-meridians and regulates the flow of energy in these meridians. The Yin channels run along the inside of the legs and arms and the front of the body. They also regulate the blood. The Yang channels run on the outside of the legs and arms and the back of the body. They control the defensive energy and regulate resistance to external infections. In other words, the Yin Channels protect the body from “attacks” from within and the Yang Channels protect the body from external “attacks”. The most important reason to open the Bridge and Regulator Channel is to promote the unimpeded flow of energy in the body, to heal the body and to prepare the body to receive and to circulate the higher energy forces of the Immortal Practice in your body. All the Eight Psychic Channels act as receivers and distributors to the or- gans and glands of the Universal Force . For this reason, working with the Eight Psychic Channels is considered spiritual work in the Taoist system. Forming the control base of the Eight Psychic Channels is the Gate of Death and Life (also known as the Gate of Mortality ) at the perineum point. The perineum point serves many purposes. It is considered the sexual energy base. It is also the point to which is joined the Bubbling Spring, the collection point of the Earth energy at the soles of the feet. The Belt Channel passes through the perineum point as it interconnects the other seven channels. The interconnection of the Belt Channel makes it possible to move the energy from one channel to any other channel, while it serves to protect all the body’s centers. The crown point at the pineal gland is the other common point of the Eight Psychic Channels."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 2.

Concentrate on the Flow of (Energy in) the Channel(s) The most important thing is that you will feel the flow of (energy in) the channels. Therefore just go along the Channels with your hands and mind and be aware of the Channels and the flow of energy. Start at the top (GB-17) and go over the face and down in a straight line, along the front of the body and the inside of the legs to the K-1 (Bubbling Spring). Then go up, on the outside of the legs, hips and spine to the shoulder and down to the armpits (SI-9). Next go with the right hand over the outside of the left arm and back on the inside of the left arm to LI-16 on the shoulder. We continue with the left hand from SI-9 over the outside of the right arm and back on the inside of the right arm to LI-14 on the shoulder From there we continue with both hand along the neck to GB-20 back to CB-17. Touch lightly each point and use your mind/eyes, when you go down and up along the Channel in this way. You can repeat a few times until you really are aware of the Channel and feel the flow of energy."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30 B. Open the Channel(s) More Specific by Individually Opening and Connecting each Point along the Channel a. Open and connect the points GB-17 to ST-4 on both sides of this part of the Channel. Preparation: 1. Sit or stand up, and smile down. 2. Practice quickly Fusion of the Five Elements, reactivate the pakuas, the facial and universal pakua as well. Spiral the pakuas and draw all the energies also of the organs, the senses and the mind to the big space, the cauldron in your Tan Tien. Balance the emotional energies in the organs as taught in Formula III and let the Compassion Energy grow with the creation cycle of Cosmic Fu- sion. Spiral and condense the energies in the cauldron to form a shin- ing pearl. 3. Move the pearl down to the perineum and circulate the energy a few rounds in the Microcosmic. Let the pearl absorb forces of the Earth, the Cosmic Particles and the Universe. Move the pearl down to the perineum again. 4. At the perineum use the pearl to clear the Left, Middle, and Right Thrusting Channel. Move the pearl up and down through all three Thrusting Channels to the crown, in the following way. - Hold your left arm, with your fingers pointing down to the earth, along your side. Inhale, close your right nostril and pull up your left anus and suck the energy up through the left Thrusting Channel. Exhale and let all the toxic and sick energy flow through the channel down into the earth. - Close both nostrils, pull up the middle part of the anus and suck the energy up through the middle Thrusting Channel. Exhale, bring your right hand along your side, keep the left nostril closed, and let all the toxic and sick energy flow through the middle Thrust- ing channel into the earth. - Keep the left nostril closed, and the right arm hanging down. Inhale, pull up the right side of the anus and suck the energy up"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31 through the right Thrusting Channel. Exhale and let all the toxic and sick energy flow down through this right channel into the earth. - Repeat the procedure for the middle thrusting channel (when you exhale down, keep your right nostril closed and your left arm hanging down), the left Thrusting Channel, the middle Thrusting Channel (exhale down on the right side), the right Thrusting Chan- nel, the Middle Thrusting Channel (exhale down in the left side) and the left thrusting Channel. - Rest and feel the three Thrusting Channels and all the or- gans, they penetrate, open and clean. With your mind/eyes you can still let the energy flow up and down in the three channels. All the routes and clean the Thrusting Channels. Practice: 1. Then move the pearl through the Left and Right Thrusting Channel to point GB-16 on both side of the Pai Hui, at the top of the head. Use your right and left’s hand middle finger to press on the center of the crown through which the Middle Thrusting Channel runs. Now move this fingers to a point about one and a half inches to the left and right of the crown, and press on this point, GB-16. The points GB-16 will feel painful when pressed. Release; press again, then rest. Concentrate on and feel this point. Note: It is not necessary to find the exact location of each point. The points are quite large. When you use three fingers to cover the point(s), you will find it/them by feeling the spot(s) where the energy is most condensed, recognizable by the strongest pulsation. 2. With the middle fingers of each hand remain on GB-16, place the index fingers about one inch away from the middle fingers on GB-17, and the fourth fingers to a point about one inch away from the middle fingers on GB-15. Press and release all three points a few times simultaneously. All three points will feel painful when pressed. Then continue to use all three fingers to press them lightly until you feel a pulsation at the fingertips. 3. Continue to press the fingers on these points. Then, using the index, middle, and fourth fingers together, gently press on point GB-"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 14 on both sides, in the middle of the forehead over the left and right eye. When you feel the points, mentally move the energy down from the crown to the forehead. Feel the energy flowing. The energy will flow quite easily through this point, perhaps it will be a little bit pain- ful. Continue to press here until you feel again a pulsation at the fingertips. If you feel tense and worried, GB-14 is usually blocked. Wrinkle the brow as you do when you are tense, and hold GB-14 on both sides to stimulate the energy flow. Stiffness in the neck and face, which is the product of overall tension, can be relieved by restoring proper flow to the area of GB-14. In addition, since this point is strongly related to consciousness, good energy flow through GB-14 will calm the spirit and brighten vision. 4. Move the three fingers of both hands down to press on ST-2 on both sides of the cheekbone in line with the pupil and GB-14.

Spinal Cord Microcosmic Orbit: Supplemental Belt Channel This practice serves to strengthen the spine and protect it, and it is also important in the higher practice to wrap the spine with energy for its maintenance during trips to the midplane. A. Practice Fusion, and then run the Microcosmic. Bring the pearl into the sacrum, and run it up the inner side of the back of the spinal cord to the brain. Wrap the energy around the frontal lobe and in- side the skull. Return it down the inner side of the front of the spinal cord, and wrap it around the whole length of the spine. B. Bring the pearl down to the coccyx and through it, and then up the outer side of the back of the spinal cord to the outside of the head. Wrap it around the frontal lobe and bring the pearl down along the outer side of the front of the spinal cord and return it to the coccyx. C. Wrap the pearl around the coccyx. Wrap it around the outside of the spinal cord all the way up to the brain and the frontal lobe of the brain. Wrap the pearl around the skull, and then wrap it down the inside of the spinal cord to the coccyx. D.

Cut until the whole body has been cut, including all the organs and glands. Return the pearl to the mideyebrow. The spine is now completely wrapped with energy. B. When finished, bring the energy back down from the mideyebrow to the navel to collect it there. Butterfly Protection of your Body Cutting with Energy. 1. Start at ST-16 just above the nipples. (This point is slightly higher on women than on men.) Fig. 28 Spiral Energy From ST-16 Just Above the Nipple, Increase the Spirals on the they Encompass the Body."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40 2. The pearl spirals in line with the body from ST-16. As it spirals, it cuts through both sides of the body through the rib cage in out- ward and downward ares (like the wings of a butterfly), and then cuts back in. 3. The spirals grow larger each time to include the whole body and legs. Eventually the spirals come forward out of the body into the aura. 4. Collect the energy at ST-16. This exercise is often used in the Martial Arts. Because you are spiraling your energy all around you, your opponent can not find where the center of your energy is and can therefore not “attack” you. We use the Butterfly for the same reason in the higher prac- tices to hide our center of energy so “nobody” can attack us. It is a very good psychic protection. Cutting the Senses This is a good way to protect and seal our senses. A. Begin about half an inch in front of the eyes, spiral the pearl in three figure eight motions from the mideyebrow in the following man- ner.

Circle around the back of the right ear, up to the right eyebrow, and join the first spiral at the mideyebrow. 3. From the mideyebrow spiral down to the left side of the nose, and down to the right corner of the mouth in a half circle. Spiral under the mouth to the left corner of the mouth, and then cut across to the right side of the nose. Return to the mideyebrow. B. Collect the energy at the mideyebrow when finished. Drilling the Head with Energy This exercise is used to drill our head more open in order to receive the higher frequencies. Drilling the head with energy helps also to clear the brain. 1. Drill with the energy by spiraling the pearl into the head hori- zontally from points on the forehead to the back of the head, starting from the mideyebrow. 2. Later you can drill with energy all over the face, horizontally and vertically, including from the top of the skull to the neck and chin, until you feel your head clear.
