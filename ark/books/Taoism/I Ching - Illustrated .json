Contributors included the legendary Fuxi, King Wen of Zhou (11th century B.C.) and Confucius (551-479 B.C.), as well as many great unknown minds and hands. It took over one thousand years for this unique classic to come into being. And, in the almost two thousand years that followed, in-depth research on the book by many scholars has helped the book to further develop. Originally titled Zhouyi, or Zhou Changes, the book, recommended by Confucius, was listed as the principal classic of the Confucian school and was renamed Yi Jing, or the Book of Changes. In Chinese, the word jing means the vertical threads (warp) when weaving cloth. There have to be vertical threads before horizontal ones (woof) can be weaved onto them. Later, people respectfully called any philosophical work that can guide people jing. In the five thousand years of Chinese civilization, the philo- sophy in the Book of Changes has gradually been woven into people's lives, and the book came to be known as a jing, or book of guiding principles. Graphically, Zhouyi means \"knowledge of scheming of universal significance.\" The Zhouyi is the record of the Chinese outlook on the universe and a classic of divination based on this outlook. It should be pointed out that the study of divination in ancient China was a major branch of knowledge that was strictly tested by practice. The Zhou Li, or the Ritual of Zhou, a book recording rituals in ancient China, points out that \"a diviner would write his prediction on a piece of silk fabric so that he could compare what would really have happened with his divination; and by year's end, the trueness of his divination would be examined.\" Wei Boyang, a Yi Jing scholar of the Eastern Han Dynasty (A.D. 25-220), said more clearly that \"instead of being fabricated, the words and viewpoints of the Zhouyi came into being through observing the results and examin- ing the subtlety of divination.\" Because of the seriousness and effectiveness of the ancient divination represented by the Zhouyi, it became an important factor in the decision making of rulers. Let's see what Ji Zi, a wise man, told King Wu of Zhou (11th century B.C.) about the impact the diviners had on the decisions made by ancient emperors. He said that in those days whenever there was a major decision to be made, a five-vote system was adopted: one vote was from the emperor, one from the administrative representative, one from the civilian representative and the remaining two were from the diviners. If the emperor and the civilian voted against it, the motion could still he"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"passed and it would still be considered to turn out good results; if the emperor and the administrator voted against it, the draft could be passed as well. From this we can see the important role played by diviners in decision making. The Book of Rituals also records that if anyone tried to cheat when doing divination, he would face execution. In this sense, the Yi Jing should be seen as a book with unique and effective divinatory powers developed by the Chinese ancestors through their serious, or rather, cruel life and practice. When Confucius -who held that things can he done only through divination and without it they would be abandoned halfway—found out about Zhouyi in his later years, he regretted that \"if only heaven could give me a few more years and let me find out about Zhouyi when I was fifty, I would not have made all those mistakes.\" My father Li Kuchan once told me that the Zhouyi, in a sense, was a great book on mathematical philosophy in this world.\" The Zhouyi is a form of analysis unique in terms of its understanding of society and the divination based on this understanding. It sets itself apart from other forms of logic first of all, because it uses images rather than logical thinking as its main way of thinking and expression in its arguments. Secondly, symbols are used to demonstrate the process of understanding. For example, when we say (in the language generally used in logical thinking) that \"when something is far away from you, you can not really understand it. You may even misunderstand it. As you get closer to it, however, you will have a better idea. But when you think you have understood it, you will have doubts about it now that you are near it. Nevertheless, as time goes by, your doubt will be solved.\" When the same thing is said in the Zhouyi using images, it is expressed in this way: \"Horses have galloped and turned to this way. People are riding on the horses coming nearer. Who are they? Oh, they are not bandits. They have conic to propose. The woman is a decent person, but she could not get pregnant. It was only after ten years that she became pregnant. \" (Sec the tun hexagram). The qian (universe) hexagram, , symbolizes heaven. The dragon, the totem of the Chinese people created by the ancient Chinese is the symbol of the formless heaven(qian). The six lines in this qian hexagram have six meanings. For instance, the bottom line is a \"hidden and rolled up dragon whose opportunity to show his talent has yet to come_\" The fifth line indicates that \"the dragon is now flying in the vast sky, which is a time where great man will appear.\" The Zhouyi vividly puts the understanding of a thing past, present and future onto a coordi- nate of time and space to predict and get a better understanding of this particular thing. This is indeed a special wisdom the Chinese have contri- buted to the world. The symbols in the Zhouyi came into being over many years of life and practice by the Chinese ancients. People in the ancient world tried to understand the world by watching the sun and the shadows. If you put up a pole at noontime, the shadow of the pole will be in the middle and short, just like the shape of \"—.\" As the sun goes down, the shadow will he tilted and long, and the pole and shadow will form an angle like \" /.\" In long past ages, Chinese wise men carved \"—\" and \"/\\ \" on bones or tortoise shells to represent yang and yin, respectively. These symbols, however, were later changed into \"—\" and \"/ \\\" which were gained changed to \" and \"- -\" for the convenience of carving. In the opinion of the Chinese ancestors, everything is connected to yin or yang no matter how compli- cated things in the world change. The apparent difference and change of things result from the changes of ratio of the inner yin and yang, which is also the principle of the Book of Changes. The \"—\" and \"- -,\" the basic symbols in the Book of Changes, are used to express the knowledge of changes in the universe. The ancients also held that the world was formed by the three cosmic powers, i.e., heaven, earth and people. Therefore, they invented another basic triagram, which has three lines, each of which is known as a yao. Their full combination is 2 ; =8, or the eight triagrams in eight formations, representing eight natural phenomena: Symbols: Natural Phenomena: heaven earth thunder mountain wind lake fire water Name of Triagram: qian kun zhen gen xun dui li kan The ancients also held that the understanding of the relations among heaven, earth and people should include two aspects: inborn instinct and acquired knowledge. In this sense, when two groups of three-lines are put together, they become six lines, thus the symbol of a \"compound tri- agram, \" appearing as 2`' = 64, or 64 hexagrams, representing 64 things or situations. Take the jinn hexagram = for example: the upper three yao symbolize water while the lower three yao represent mountain, meaning water on the mountain. It can be understood in this way: water from the mountain does not flow directly and freely (it winds about and hurdles many obstacles). We can be certain that the water will flow downward. Although the waterway may be tortuous, in the end, the prospects are promising. Another example is the dui hexagram both the upper and lower three yao represent lake, meaning kindness and smoothness, auspi- cious future. The Book of Changes uses a series of 64 writings to explain the meaning of every hexagram, with the first section, or hexagram readings, of each series telling the basic meaning of the hexagram; the second to the in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"seventh sections, known as yaoci, or line readings, of each series basically explaining the specific line (the qian and kun hexagrams each has one more section of yaoci than other hexagrams). Here, the hexagram readings explain the whole meaning of that particular hexagram and its divination. The yaoci explains the situation in the stage of that particular hexagram divined by that i•ao. Understanding and conforming to nature and society in their changes, the philosophy in the Book of Changes does not define absolute favorable- ness or unfavorableness. Good or ill luck, smoothness or adversity are all relative and transformable. As long as you can grasp the proper time, position and direction, you can obtain relative freedom even under abso- lutely restricted circumstances. On the other hand, if you proceed from a stiff and one-sided view, you may end up in a situation which is unfavor- able and dangerous to you even if the other circumstances are favorable. Considering the above as the principles of heaven and earth, the Book of Changes puts the two hexagrams of heaven (titan) and earth (kun) as the first and second hexagrams. This shows how Chinese worship the \"way of heaven\" or the law and virtue of heaven. The Book of Changes held that proper changes can transform the unfavorable to the favorable. The fourth yaoci in the ge (reform) hexa- gram goes like this: \"Worries and regretfulness are gone and captives have been taken. This is because the destiny of reform is auspicious.\" It is easy to misread the Book of Changes and conclude that it advocates fatalism. This is not the case. Instead, it propagates the theory of \"understanding the decree of heaven.\" Confucius pointed out in the last chapter of his Lunyu, or The Analects, that \"those who don't know the decree of heaven will not be considered as intellectuals. Therefore, the Book of Changes, strongly recommended by the Confucianists, was natur- ally considered as the \"head of all classics\" and the \"source of great philosophy.\" No matter from which angle we look at it, all viewpoints and thoughts in the long history of Chinese civilization find their root in the Book of Changes. We can find the living influence of its philosophy in every aspect of Chinese life, such as their outlook on the universe, life, values, the environment, managing finance as well as rituals, ways of thinking, expression, aesthetics, and military thinking. Every science and civilization in this world came into being and developed in certain cultural environment. This is the same with both Western and Chinese science and civilizations. While they share common characteristics, they are also unique in their own way. Only by working hard to develop their uniqueness, can they benefit each other. If we measure and comment the uniqueness of one thing only by using that of another, we may result in distorting, or even concealing its uniqueness, thus bringing harm to this world where all civilizations tend to mix together. With the intention of doing my' bit towards furthering Western and Eastern cultural exchange, I have tried for the first time in the history of the research of the Book of Changes and that of fine art to illustrate this hook. On the basis of China's standard Book of Changes and the Book of Changes written on the silk of the Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D. 8) unearthed in 1973, I have adjusted the original content and translated it into colloquial Chinese. Now with 450 illustrations, I hope I have presented my readers with a more vivid and easier explanation of this ancient classic. At the request of many foreign readers, this book is now published by the Foreign Languages Press in English, French, German and Spanish. This will no doubt benefit the cultural exchange between China and the West. It should noted that the content in this book mainly contains the hexagram and yaoci, or line readings, in the Book of Changes, and the explanation of the diagram of the Supreme Ultimate, the core of the Book of Changes. For ease of reading, l did not list all the sources. It is my hope that my foreign readers will like the Book of Changes and thus, this illustrated one. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Kang Yin, Mr. Liu Dajun and Mr. Zhang Yansheng, who have given me great assistance in my research of the Book of Changes. My thanks also go to the Foreign Languages Press for its support in translating and publishing this book. At the Beijing Studio, 1995."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate The diagram of the Supreme Ultimate represents the pattern of the universe and was created by China's great philosophers in early antiquity. It has long been the logo of the Book of Changes, fixed in the mind's eye of scholars who study this sacred text. Using the simplest of patterns, the diagram of the Supreme Ultimate expresses what the ancient Chinese understood about the principles of the universe. Most scholars think it appeared around A.D.960, at the end of the Five Dynasties (907-960) and the beginning of the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127). In my opinion, however, the earliest, most comprehensive and vivid description of it can be found in the Dao De Jing, or The Classic of the Virtue of the Dao by Lao Li (often Lao-tzu), prior to Confcius. \"The Dao of the universe created one, one produced two and two made three. Three produced everything in the universe, \" said Lao Zi in his Dao De Jing. \" The universe is divided into On and rang. Yang contains yin and in contains yang, just like a person: standing in the sun one side faces the sun (Sang) the other side bears the shadow (yin); and the shadow embraces the sun—they mix together.\" In the opinion of Lao Li, Dan is shapeless. And \"this `Dao' is the Supreme Ultimate,\" which was said by Shao Yong, expert of the Book of Changes in the Song Dynasty (960-1279). Lao Zi held that everything in the universe was called \"existence,\" which was produced by \"non- existence,\" or the Dan. In Shao Yong's opinion, the Dao or the Supreme Ultimate bore two parts: yin and yang. In other words,\"one produced two.\" Yet, there is no clear distinction between yin and yang. The Thirty-six Tricks a hook written by an unknown writer and has long been taken seriously by strategists of past dynasties—mentions that \"vin is included in rang, rather than opposite to yang.\" This has resulted in the third meaning the four phenomena: yin, yang, yin in yang and yang in in. These complicated relations between yin and yang form everything in the univ- erse. In order to show an interrelated and transformable relations among the above yin and yang, an s-shaped line is used to separate the black and white—the yin and yang—on the diagram of the Supreme Ultimate. It should be pointed out that the graphic diagram is not just two dimension- al. rather, it is three- or multi-dimensional. The three-dimensional dia- gram drawn by computer can better illustrate this ancient, yet vital cliagram of the Supreme Ulnmate.
