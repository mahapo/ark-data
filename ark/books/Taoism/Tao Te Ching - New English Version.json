Th at which can be named is not the n ameless One. The s ource of heaven and earth is without form or substance . Naming creates the ten thousand things. W hen desire is absent , the mystery is obvious. When desire occurs , creation unfolds. Mystery and creation arise from the same source. Th e source is emptiness. Void within void . Th e re alm of Tao. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Two Judging beauty c reates ugliness. Defining good c reates evil. All and v oid arise together. Hard and soft , long and short, high and low , sound and silence , now and then . Opposites exist because of each other. Therefore the sage acts by n ot - doing and teaches no - thought. The ten thousand things arise and vanish without him. He works without motive , indifferent to outcome . Because there is no doer , his actions are timeless. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Three Bestowing honor breeds ambition s . Hoarding treasure invit es thieves . Displaying objects of desire sows the seeds of discontent. Therefore the sage govern s by emptying minds and filling bellies, by weakening will s and strengthening bones. He extols the virtue of desireless unknowing and keeps intellects off ba lance . When not - doing is accomplished, nothing remains undone. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Four Tao is hollow emptiness . T he substance of All , it is absent of substance. Dimensionless V oid , it is the source of the ten thousand things. It blunts sharpness , unravels entanglement s , diffuses brightness , merges with dust. Dark, invisible, it only seems to be. It is the child of no - thing and the father of God. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Five The realm of h eaven and earth is indifferent to the myriad creatures. T hey appear as straw dogs. Th e sage is indiff erent to the multitudes of m e n . They appear as straw dogs. The realm of h eaven and earth is like a bellows , both empty and full. Moving, it brings forth , endlessly . More words, less understanding. Hold fast to the core. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Six The urge of creation is ce aseless . It is called the Dark Mother. The womb of the Dark M other is the ground of heaven and earth. Timeless, imperceptible, it continues ever - present. Endless use does not touch it. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Seven The realm of h eaven and earth is e verlasting . Why is it e verlasting ? Because it is not conscious of itself. Having no thought of be ing , it never is not. Like this , the sage forgets himself so is always present. Without self - concern, the self is eternal. When self - interest s ubsides , fulfillment happens. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Eig ht Supreme virtue is like water. It nourishes the ten thousand things without effort and flows in places men shun. I t is like Tao. Stand on solid ground. Go deep into the heart. Speak only what is true. In friendship, be kind. In governing, be just. I n enterprise, be able. In action, watch the timing. Do not contend with nature and nothing will go wrong. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Nine An over - filled cup is difficult to carry . An over - sharp point is easily broken.

"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Ten While maintaining a body can you become One? While breathing the force of life can you be innocent as a babe ? While p olishi ng the dark mirror can you be without dust? While loving and ruling the people can you refrain from action? While coming and going from heaven can you be passive as a woman? Understanding all things can you abide in unknowing? Give birth and nurture . C re ate with out claim . L ead without taking co mmand . This is supreme virtue. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Eleven Thirty spokes of the wheel converge to define a hole. Clay is molded into pots to shape emptiness. Walls are hammered into room s to enclosed space. Windows are cut into walls to frame absence. Though things may have value, without no - thing they are useless."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Twelve T he five colors confuse the eye. T he five tones deaden the ear. T he five flavors dull the palette . Racing and hunting madden the mind. Valuable goods hi nder movement. Therefore the sage is guided by his gut , not his senses. He attends to one and ignores the other. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Thirteen Re ceive honor with dismay. Accept misfortune gratefully . W hy r e ceive honor with dismay ? Honor and dis honor cause the same distu rbance. With honor comes the fear of dis grace . With disgrace comes anxiety and dread. Wh y a ccept misfortune gratefully ? Misfortune weakens the bond to body and self. Without a separate self , what misfortune is possible? See misfortune as a condition of se paration , and you will become whole. See the world as your body , and a ll will be delivered unto you. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Fourteen Searching, we cannot see it. We call it ephemeral . Straining, we cannot hear it. We call it e thereal . Reaching, we cannot grasp it. We call i t intangible. These three are often confused because they are the same. The One is not bright above and dark below. Transparent, it moves in and out of nothing. It s form has no shape. Its image has no substance. It is indistinct, elusive. Nothing to fa ce, nothing to follow. Hold to the timeless Tao. Abide in the present. Now is the ancient beginning. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Fifteen The o ld masters were deep , u nfathomable , p rofound beyond understanding. Because the y were unfathomable w e can only describe their demeanor . Cautious, as if crossing a n icy stream. Alert, as if sensing danger . Respectful, like visiting guests. Yielding, like melting ice. Simple , like uncarved wood. Open , like beckoning valleys . Mysterious , like opaque pools. Still the mind and the mud settle s . Do nothing and action comes of itself . One who embraces Tao has no desire for fulfillment. Not desiring fulfillment, he is finished with birth and death. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Sixteen Be completely empty. Be completely still. Witness t he ten thousand things a ppear and vanish in one motion. Watch as they a rise, linger, and re turn to the source — stillness . This is the way it is. It is called everlasting life. To witness the everlasting is to be awake. Not seeing the everlasting , one engages in blind action. Blind actio n lead s to misfortune. Seeing the everlasting, one encompasses all. Encompassing all, one is impartial. Being impartial, one acts nobly . Acting nobly , one enters heaven. Entering heaven is to be one with Tao. Being one with Tao is to be everlasting. Tho ugh the body dies, nothing is disturbed. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Seventeen When a sage governs, people barely notice. Lesser rulers are praised and loved. Lesser still are feared and obeyed . The l east are ridiculed and despised. Trust is earned by trusting. The sage uses wo rds sparingly. His work is done without fanfare. People say : “It happen ed by itself. ” "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Eighteen When Tao is forgotten, charity and righteousness are born. When intelligence and knowledge ar e valued , duplicity and pretense soon follow. When the family is discordant, love and duty are preached. When the country is in chaos , loyal patriots a ppear .

Love and empathy will na turally return. Give up cleverness and profit. Thieves and bandits will disappear. But t h ose are outward lessons, not the core. Be simple. Be true. Cast off selfhood and desire. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Twenty Between yes and no, is there really much difference? Good and b ad , are they so far apart? Must I think as others think ? Alas, there would be no end to fear. The multitudes are busy with feasts and celebrations. In spring they climb t owers and enjoy the view. I alone am unmoved , like an infant too young to smile . Oth ers have more than enough. I alone have nothing. My mind is that of a fool — empty . Others are clear and bright. I alone am nebulous and dim. Others are alert and clever. I alone am withdrawn , adrift in the ocean, directionless as s wirling wind. Everyone else has purpose. I alone am stubborn and untamed . I am different. I am nourished by the Dark Mother. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Twenty One Supreme virtue is to abide in Tao alone. Tao is elusive and empty — o h yes, utterly empty and elusive — yet within it dreamlike images a rise . Oh yes , it is indistinct and nebulous, but with i n it shadows take form . Oh yes , it is mysterious and dark, but within it appearances originate . Th e origin of creation is the r eal. Its manifestations are unceasing. This can be witnessed. How do I witn ess the origin of creation? By looking! "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Twenty Two Surrender and be come whole. Bend low and be straightened . Become empty and be filled . Burn out and be renewed. Having nothing , beauty is revealed. Having much, the way is hidden. The sage abides in One and thus is master of heaven and earth. Not being self - absorbed, his vision is clear. Not asserting himself, his light shines for th . Not showing off, his merit is obvious. Not praising himself, praise is showered upon him. Not contending, nothing unde r heaven stands in his way. This ancient saying, “Surrender and be come whole,” is it empty words? Being whole means all things have returned to you. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Twenty Three To speak a short time is the way of nature. High winds blow out before morning. Hard rai n subsides in a day. What issues these? The realm of heaven and earth. If the realm of heaven and earth cannot maintain duration , wha t chance has m an ? This is why one embraces Tao. He who aligns with Tao becomes one with Tao. He who aligns with virtue at tains supreme virtue. He who fails to align with Tao is lost. He who aligns with Tao is received by Tao. He who aligns with virtue finds only virtue. He who has become lost is close to home. Faith comes to the faithful. "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Twenty Four He who stands on tiptoe is unsteady. He who strides too hard cannot go far. He who shines a light on himself is not enlightened. He who asse r ts himself is not distinguished. He who praises himself has no merit. He who brags of his success will not last long. Observer s of Tao see these as spoiled food and pointless action — shunned even by the myriad creatures . One who knows Tao does not abide them . "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Twenty Five Formless no - thing . Pre cedent of heaven and earth . Timeless, unchanging, solitary , silent. It is the mother of the ten thousand things. I do not know its name . I call it Tao. If forced to describe it , I call it great. Great implies vast reaches. Vast reaches implies far away. Far away implies return. Tao is great. Heaven is great. Earth is great. Man, too, is great. In the realm there are four greats , and a noble man is one. Man follows the way of earth. Earth follows the way of heaven. Heaven follows the way of Tao. Tao is the g reat Way. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Twenty Six Gravity is the ground of lightness. Stillness is the master of unrest. The sage can travel all day , yet never wander far from the baggage wagon. Though splendor and spectacle may beckon , he remains unmoved, indifferent . Why should the lord of ten thousand chariots act lightly? One who acts lightly is not grounded. One who is restless is not his own master. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Twenty Seven A good walker leaves no trac ks . A good s peaker does not slip up. A good accountant needs no c ount er . A good doorsmith uses no bolts or locks yet none can open what he closes. A good binder uses no knots yet what he binds cannot be unraveled . The sage is good at saving souls and rejects no one. He takes care of all things and abandons nothing. This is called \"the way of awareness.\" The good man is the ignorant man's teacher. T he ignorant man is the good man 's lesson. To not honor the teacher and value the lesson — no matter how much wisdom one acquires — is to miss the mark . This is an essential secret. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Twenty Eight Know the strength of the male, but keep to the role of the female. Be the river of the world. Being the river of the world, supreme virtue flows without end. Flowing without end, y ou are the timeless infant. Know the purity of light but maintain darkness. Be the model of the world. Being the model of the world, supreme virtue is constant. Maintaining constant virtue, you are the boundless realm. Be worthy of h igh honors , but keep to the role of the lowly. Be the valley of the world. Being the val l ey of the world, supreme virtue is fulfilled. Being fulfilled, you are the uncarved block. The uncarved block appears as separate things . The sage sees things as they are and rules the world. Great power does not divide. "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Twenty Nine Th ere are th ose who want to control the realm and make it more to their liking . The y will never succeed. The realm of heaven and earth is perfect, a sacred vessel. It cannot be improved. He who tries to change it, destroys it for himself. He who tries to hold it, loses all contact. It is natural for beings to sometimes lead, sometimes f ollow, sometimes breathe hot, sometimes blow cold. sometimes expand, sometimes decay, sometimes overcome, sometimes collapse. The sage therefore abandons pleasure, judgment and pride. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Thirty When counseling rulers, o bservers of Tao do not advise f orce. This is certain to bring consequences. Where great armies have passed, thorn bushes thrive. Famine follows in the wake of war. A good ruler does only what is necessary to achieve results. He does not abuse po sition . Achieve results, but do not glory in them . Achieve results, but do not boast. Achieve results, but be not proud. Achieve results because there is no choice . Achieve results but do not overpower. Doing more than necessary brings exhaustion . This is not in harmony with Tao. What is not in harmony with Tao soon perishes. "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Thirty One Even the finest weapons are instruments of ill omen , hated and feared by all creatures. Observers of Tao have no use for them. At home , a man of virtue gives precedence to the left. At war , he gives preced ence to the right. Weapons are not the tools of a man of virtue. Weapons are instruments of ill omen , to be employed as a last resort. Do not relish their use or admire their excellence. To see weapons as excellent is to relish killing. If you relish kill ing you will never find the way. On joyful occasions, precedence is given to the left. On sad occasions , precedence is given t o the right. When an army is arrayed, the lieutenant is placed on the left. The commander is placed on the right. Thus, war is c onducted as a funeral rite. When multitudes are being killed, hold in your heart only sorrow. When victory is achieved , mark it with mourning. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Thirty Two Tao is t h e uncarved block . Timeless, undefined, infinitesimally s ubtle . N one is its master . If l ords and princes observed it , the ten thousand things would arrive as guests to the table. Heaven and earth would rejoice and sweet nectar would f all , though none under heaven had decreed it. When the whole is divided the parts are named. There are alrea dy too many names. It is time to stop. Knowing when to stop av oids exhaustion. Tao in the world is like stream flowing to river flowing to sea. "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Thirty Three One who knows others is wise. One who knows self is enlightened. One who masters others is st rong . One who masters self is powerful . Knowing you have enough is fulfillment . Exerting strong effort brings exhaustion. He who abides where he is lasts long. He who dies without ceasing is timelessly present. "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Thirty Four Great Tao flows everywhere , left and right , all directions . The ten thousand things depend on it and it does not turn away. Its p urpose is fulfilled but it lays no claim. It clothes and nourishes the ten thousand things but is not their lord. It desires nothing. It is smaller tha n small. The ten thousand things return to it but it is not their master. It is indeed great. Because it knows nothing of greatness, it is greater than great. "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Thirty Five Extol the gr eat illusion and the men of the world will gather . Talk of success, security and happiness and the multitudes will flock . Offer music and tasty food and travelers will stop in. T alk of Tao has no flavor. Look for it -- t here is nothing to see. Listen for it -- t here is nothi n g to hear. Merge with it -- t here is no boundary or end. "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Thirty Six If you want it to contract, let it expand. If you want it to weaken, let it gain strength. To bring a thing down, let it be raised h igh. To bring a thing to you, let go. This is called \"perceiving the subtle workings.\" Soft and weak overcome hard and strong. A fish should not leave deep water. A country should not show off its power. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Thirty Seven Tao does nothing yet nothing remains undone. When a noble man observes this the ten thousand things are transformed. When the desire t o act re - emerge s , it is stilled by the nameless no - thing. Without things there is no desire. Without desire there is stillness. In stillness, the realm of heaven and earth is perfect. "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Thirty Eight The man of high virtue is not aware of himself and thus attains supreme virtue. The man of low virtue self - consciously strives and thus is without virtue. The wise man does nothing yet leaves nothing undone. The ignorant man is consumed by doing yet little is accomplished. The compassionate man acts with out motive. The righteous man acts to g ain merit. The moral man acts to impose order. If no one responds, he bares his arms and becomes an enforcer. When Tao is lost there is virtue. When virtue is lost there is goodness. When goodness is lost there is mo rality. When morality is lost , rules of conduct are imposed. Rules are the remnants of tr ust and faith, and the beginning of chaos. Knowledge is an ornamental blossom of Tao and the beginning of misunderstanding. The sage dwells in the depths , not the su rface, in the root not the flower. He abides in one and lets go of the other. "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Thirty Nine Before time, these ancestors arise from One : Heaven arises from One and bec omes clear. Earth ar ises from One and bec omes firm. Spirit ar ises from One and bec omes divine. Emptiness arises from One and becomes creation . The ten thousand things arise from One and become manifest. Kings and princes arise from One and become exalted. One is the source of All. Separated from the S ource : the clearness of heaven would v anish, the firmament of earth would dissolve, the divinity of spirit would dissipate, creation would be come desolat ion . The ten thousand things would perish , and k ing doms would disappear. Humility is the root of honor . Lowliness is the foundation of estee m. Thus, a noble man considers himself orphaned, bereft , unworthy . This is knowing the humble source — is it not? To seek praise is not praiseworthy. Do not j a ngle like j ewelry . Be still as stone. "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Forty Tao moves by returning and acts by yielding. Thu s, the ten thousand things arise into being. Being arises from non - being. Things arise from no - thing. "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Forty One When the wise student hears of Tao he practices diligently. When the average student hears of Tao he practices off and on. When the foolish student hears of Tao he laughs out loud. If the foolish do not laugh, it is not Tao. Thus it is said: The path of light is through darkness. The road ahead leads b ack . The easy way is most difficult. The highest fulfillment is emptiness. True purity see ms sullied. True abundance seems bereft . True power seems weak. True substance seems hollow. The greatest region has no boundaries. The best tools are fashioned slowly. The highest sounds are hard to hear. The perfect form has no shape. Tao is unseen, undefined. Yet Tao alone nourishes and brings all things to fulfillment. "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Forty Two From Tao, One arises. From One, two. From two, three. Three becomes the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things carry yin on their backs and hold yang in their a rms. E xistence depends on the two. Men hate to be orphaned, bereft, unworthy, yet this is how the noble man describes himself. Loss is gain , gain is loss. I teach what has always been taught: \"A fervent man is surprised by death.\" I see this as the found ation of my teaching. "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Forty Three Under heaven, the soft and yielding overcomes the hard and strong. That without substance permeates the impenetrable. Thus, I embrace no n - action. T each without words . Work without doing. F ew under heaven understand t his. "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Forty Four Name or person, which is more dear ? Person or possessions , which is mo re precious ? Gain or loss, which is mo re harmful ? Excessive desire incurs great expense. One who hoards treasure suffers loss. One who knows enough is enough will al ways have enough. One who knows when to stop avoids exhaustion. Thus, he will endure. "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Forty Five Perfection appears imperfect but has no flaw. F ulfillment appears as emptiness but has no limit. Great truth is a paradox. Great wisdom is self - evident . Great eloquence is unpracticed. Movement overcomes cold. Stillness overcomes heat. Stillness and simplicity put all things right under heaven. "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Forty Six When Tao is embraced in the realm , race horses haul their own manure. When Tao is unknown in th e realm, war horses are bred at the borders. There is no greater curse than desire , no great er misfortune than greed. He who knows enough is enough will always have eno u gh. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Forty Seven Without leaving home one can know the whole world. Without looki ng outside one can see heaven. Looking afar does not find what is near. Thus, the sage knows without learning , sees without seeking , acts without doing. "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Forty Eight For students of knowledge, every day something is acquired. For observers of Tao, ever y day something falls away. Less and less is done until not - doing is achieved. When there is no doer, nothing remains to be done. The realm of heaven and earth is ruled by timeless principles . He who tries to interfere is not ready to receive it. "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Fo rty Nine The sage has no heart or mind of his own. Thus, he knows the heart and mind of all. I am good to the good and good to the not - so - good. This is the goodness of V irtue. I trust the trustworthy and have faith in those who should not be trusted. T his is the faith of V irtue. The sage is in harmony with the realm of heaven and earth. His mind is merged with the world. People turn to him and listen. He treats them as his children. "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Fifty In the passage from womb to grave one in three are disciple s of li ving . One in three are disciples of death. One in three are just passing through . All believe they have life . He who knows the truth of existence does not fear wild bulls or tigers. He wears no armor in battle. Bulls have no place to thrust their horns. Tigers have no place to sink their claws. Weapons have no place to enter. Why is this? Because death is for the living. "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Fifty One Tao gives them life. Virtue gives them nourishment. The manifest world gives them form. The tendencies of each m ake them what they are. Therefore the ten thousand things honor Tao and esteem Virtue . This honor and esteem are not commanded. It is just the nature of things. And so, all things arise from Tao . By Virtue they are nourished, developed, clothed, sheltere d, soothed, aged and buried. To create without possessing, to act without making claims, to lead without taking command — t his is timeless Virtue. "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Fifty Two Where the realm of heaven and earth begins could be called the mother of creation . Knowing the mother, become the child. Being the child, stay close to the mother. Death will not bother you. Stay quiet , keep inside , and you will never want for anything. Open your mouth, meddle in affairs, and you are beyond rescue. Perceiving the subtle is insig ht. To yield requires strength. Us e the light of creation to become illuminated and thus be saved. This is called \"entering the Absolute.\" "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Fifty Three If I have the least bit of knowledge I will follow the g reat W ay alone and fear nothing but being s idetracked . The great W ay is simple but people delight in complexity . The government is corrupt. The fields are overgrown. The granaries are empty. Yet some wear fine clothes, carr y sharp swords, gorge on food and drink , and are surrounded by luxury. The y are thieves. This is certainly not the great Way. "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Fifty Four What is deeply rooted will not topple. What is firmly grasped will not slip away. It will be honored through generations of ancestors. Cultivate d in the self, Virtue is manifest. Cultiva te d in the family, Virtue grows. Cultivate d in the village, Virtue flourishes. Cultivate d in the nation, Virtue abounds. Cultivate d in the universe, Virtue is everything. As the self, observe the self. As the family, observe the family. As the village, ob serve the village. As the nation, observe the nation. As the universe, observe the universe. How do I know the universe? Like this. "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Fifty Five A man of Virtue can be compared to a newborn child . Snakes and scorpions do not st rike him. Fierce beasts d o not prey up on him. Birds of prey do not attack him . Though h is bones are soft and his m uscles weak , h is grip is firm. Without knowing the union of man and woman, his organ stands erect. His vital force is strong. He can scream all day without becoming hoarse . His harmony is perfect. To know harmony is to know the e verlasting . To know the e verlasting is enlightenment. To interfere with life is ill - fated. To control the breath causes strain. If you exert yourself you will become exhausted. This is not in harmony with Tao. What is not in harmony with Tao does not long endure. "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Fifty Six One who know s do es not talk about it. One who talk s about it do es not know. Stay quiet. Keep inside. Blunt sharpness. Unravel enta n glements. Diffuse brightness. Mer ge with dust. This is called \"discovering original nature.\" One who knows original nature is indifferent to intimacy and estrangement, unconcerned with benefit and harm, immune to honor and disgrace. He is embraced by heaven. "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Fifty Seven Rule the co untry with sincerity. Wage war with cunning. Master the universe with indifference. How do I know this is the way it is? Because of this: The more taboos , the poorer the people 's spirit . The sharper men's weapons, the more trouble in the land. The greate r the ingenuity, the more clutter in the world. The more abundant the laws, the more abundant the thieves. Therefore the sage says: I take no action and the people naturally reform. I remain at peace and the people become content. I do not meddle and the people become prosperous . I desire nothing and the people return to original nature. "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Fifty Eight When government does not interfere , the people are genuine. When government intru des , the people are cunning. Happiness is founded on misery. Misery lurk s within happiness. Is there an end to it? Nothing stays the same. Honesty moves with deceit. Good flows with evil . But people's d elusion persists. Th us , the sage is sharp but not divisive, straightforward but not hurtful , principled but not severe, il lumined but not blinding. "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Fifty Nine In leading people and serving heaven, nothing surpasses humility. Humility is having no preferences. Humility accumulates virtue. Whe re virtue accumulates, nothing is impossible. When nothing is impossible, there a re no limits . A man without limits is fit to rule the realm. The mother of the realm is everlasting. This is called being deeply rooted. Timeless awareness of Tao. "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Sixty Governing a country is like cooking a delicate fish. Rule i n observance of Tao and the forces of adversity become harmless. They do not lose their power, only their power to harm. The sage , too, does no harm a nd so he is not harmed. Virtue flows unimpeded. "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Sixty One A country becomes great by lying low, like the delta of a grea t river. The confluence of the realm. The mother of the world. The female conquers the male by stillness. Being still, she takes the lower position. A great country conquers a small country by taking the lower position. A small country conquers a great c ountry by merging with it. Thus, the great country conquers by yielding, the small country conquers by being absorbed. The great country needs more people. The small country needs greater purpose. Each gets what it needs. It is proper for greatness to y ield."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Sixty Two Tao is the ground of the ten thousand things. It is the refuge of the good man and the guardian of the bad. Fine speech can buy high rank. Good deeds can earn respect. Should one without them be abandoned ? Therefore, on the day the son is crowned and the three ministers named, do not send gifts of jade and teams of horses. Remain still and offer Tao. Why has Tao been honored since ancient times? \"Seek and you will find ; transgress and you will be forgiven.\" Is this not the reason? Abov e all else, observe Tao. "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Sixty Three Perform no t - doing. Work without motive. Savor what has no flavor. Regard the small as great, the few as many. Repay injury with compassion. See simplicity in the complex. See greatness in small gestures. Confront the difficult while easy. Do great things in small increments. The sage does nothing great, but great things are accomplished. Easy promises are easily broken. Things taken lightly become difficult. The sage regards nothing lightly, therefore nothing is difficult. "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Sixty Four That which is still is easy to contain . What has not yet begun is easy to prevent. Th e fragile is easily broken. The minute is easily dispelled . See things before they emerge. Attend to them before they grow out of control. A tree trunk that fills a man's arms begins as a tiny shoot. A terrace nine stories high begins with a basket of dirt. A journey of a thousand miles begins underfoot. Those who strive meet defeat. Those who grasp lose their grip. The sage does nothing and never fails . He has nothing and never loses. F ailure often comes on the verge of success. Be as careful in the end as the beginning and there will be no failure. The sage desires no - desire. He does not value wealth . He learns by not thinking. He restore s to others what has been lost. He helps the ten thousand things return to original nature but does not interfere. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Sixty Five The ancient observers of Tao did not teach it to others. They let them remain simple and unknowing. People are difficult to d eal with when they think they know. Leaders who think they know are a curse to those they lead . Leaders with a simple heart are a blessing to all. Both are manifestations of the same truth . Knowing the truth is Virtue. Virtue is mysterious, profound, fa r reaching. Reaching far , it returns to itself and is complete. "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Sixty Six Rivers rule valleys and seas rule rivers because they take the lower position. The sage is elevated by placing himself below others. He leads by leaving himself behind. When he assumes high position, the people do not feel his weight. When he rules they do not feel threatened. The realm rejoices and never tires of his presence. Because he does not contend, nothing stands against him. "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Sixty Seven Everyone agrees th e Tao I tea ch is great , yet unlike anything else. Indeed, if it were not singular it would not endure. I hold three treasure s close: The first is unconditional regard for all. The second is being content with little. The third is not placing myself before others. F rom compassion comes courage. From contentment comes an open heart . From humility comes the capacity to lead. Daring without mercy, giving without generosity, ruling without modesty, this is the way of death. Attacking with compassion , you are victorious . Defend ing with compassion , you are impregnable. What heaven favors it infuses with compassion. "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Sixty Eight A good general is not aggressive. A good warrior is not wrathful. A skillful conqueror does not instigate battle. A skillful employer serves t hose under him. This is the virtue of not contending. This is mastering the strength of others. This is being in accord with the principles of heaven. "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Sixty Nine Skillful warriors have a saying: \"Do not move first, play the guest. Do not move forward an inch, retreat a foot.\" This is called advancing without moving. Reaching without showing one's arms. Capturing without attacking . Doing battle without weapons. There is no greater mistake than underestimating the enemy . Underestimating the enemy, I r isk losing eve r ything of value. Thus, when equal opponents are matched, the one aware of sorrow will prevail. "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Seventy What I teach is easy to understand and practice, yet no one understands it or puts it to practice. My words are from the source. My actions are those of the ancestor. People do not understand this. Therefore, they do not understand me. Those who see me as I am are rare. Those who seek to follow my teachings are few. The sage wears coarse clothing but carries jade in his pockets. "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Seventy One To know that you do not know is clarity . To think that you know is sickness . Being sick of sickness, one attains clarity. T he sage is sick of sickness. Therefore, he is clear. "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Seventy Two When people do not respect power , disaster is on the horizon. Do not limit their space . Do not disrupt their liv es . Do not oppress them and they will not tire of you. T he sage knows hims elf, but does not claim knowledge . He loves himself, but does not feel important. He lets go of that and chooses this . "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Seventy Three A courageous and reckless man will kill or be killed. A courageous and careful man preserves life. Of the two, which is beneficial and which brings harm? Who knows what heaven favors . Even the sage is unsure. The way of heaven does n ot contend, yet overcomes . D oes not speak, yet converses. Without being summoned it comes of its own , u nhurried, and according to plan. The net of heaven is vast. Though the mesh is wide, nothing slips through. "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Seventy Four If people are not afraid of death, why threaten them with death ? I f people are in constant fear of death, and if being unruly m eans you will be killed , who would dare be unruly? Who would dare kill him? There is always a lord of death. Trying to do his job is like taking the pl ace of an artisan . He who tries to carve like a master carpenter rarely avoids being cut. "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Seventy Five Why are the people starving? The government takes their grain for taxes. Therefore the y are starving. Why are the people rebellious? The government interferes in their lives. Therefore the y are rebellious. Why do people ignore the gravity of death? They are consumed by the intensity of life. Therefore they ignore the gravity of death. One who is not consumed by life is better off than one who value s it. "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Seventy Six A man is born supple and soft . At death he is rigid and hard. The ten thousand things, the grass, the trees, while living are tender and pliant. In death they are dry and withered. The hard and unbending are companions of death. The soft and yielding are companions of life. Thus, an inflexible army is easily defeated. An unbending tree is easily broken. The hard and strong are laid low. The soft and yielding are raised up. "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Seventy Seven The way of heaven, is it not like the stri nging of a bow? The high end is lowered, the low is raised up. If the string is too long it is shortened. If the string is too short it is lengthened. The way of heaven takes from the excessive and gives to the insufficient. The way of man is different. Those with too much take from those who have little. Who keeps just enough and give s the rest to the world? Only o bservers of Tao . The sage works without expectation. Achieves without taking credit. He does not desire to seem worthy. "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Seventy Eight In all the world nothing is softer and weaker than water. Yet for overcoming the hard and strong it is unequaled. The pliant overcomes the unbending . The submissive overcomes the unyielding. Everyone kn o ws this but no one put s it into practice. Therefore t he sage says: He who takes on the suffering of the world is fit to rule it. One who accepts the evils of the world as his own is a king under heaven. Truth is often a paradox.

He fulfills his obligations but makes no demands. The Tao of heaven plays no favorites. It flows with Virtue. "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Eighty Let the state be small . Let the people be few. Though th ey have equipment to arm ten battalions they do not do it. They take death seriously and do not venture far. Th ey have ships and carts but th ere is no place they want to go. Th ey have armor and weapons but they are not displayed. Men return to knotting r ope. They enjoy their meals and are comfortable in their clothes. They are content in their homes and happy with their lives. Though the neighboring state is so close you can hear the cocks and dogs, they leave each other in peace as they grow old and die. "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Eighty One Truth is not eloquent. Eloquence is not t ruth. Wise men do not try to persuade. Whoever tries to persuade is not wise. One who knows , claims unknowing. One who claims knowledge , does not know. The sage does not acquire. He bestows wh at he has on others and always has more. The more he gives, the greater his abundance. The way of heaven is to give without harm. The way of the sage is to serve without striving."}]
