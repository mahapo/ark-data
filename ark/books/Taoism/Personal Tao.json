A Personal Tao is about freedom to be yourself. Six years ago I began an explor ation of how to make a posi tive difference in the world. During this time, several health issues came up to force a process of self examination. My reaching out to aid others, while inwardly healing myself, revealed that the deepest healing is the process of self acceptance. This has also been a time of intense political turmoil. Mixing these last few years together as a jambalaya of life, led to a simple insight and the foundation for a Personal Tao: Accepting oneself without judgment is th e starting point for personal liberty. How can we change the world? Culture reflects our personal and social inte rchanges. To be yourself includes the practice of advocating your nature in society. Taoism ta kes this concept further to state that the best political system is one that allows people to be themselves without hindrance. Speak and act to your nature. Your actions dictate society. As a reflection of the people, society also ex erts a pressure onto each person to conform to its representation of the many. In a cultu re of mass communicati on, society exerts an unusually large influence to change people. Mo dern culture has sculpted a large portion of the population to the point where many indi viduals cannot separate their lives from a lifestyle imposed upon them through societal pressure and law. The feeling of being lost is often due to a person not really living his or her life. This is the influence of ac ting outside one’s na ture, by living the American Dream instead of one’s own personal dream . A Personal Tao provides the power to stand up against any form of dictatorship. This is strength arising from inner peace to follow what feels right. Voti ng by one’s actions to make a statement about, or change, how the world should be. We can help others find peace simply by havi ng our own peace first. This is the message that Martin Luther King, Jesus, Gandhi and others of spiritual strength have shown us. Who am I to think I can expre ss this truth any differently? I am just a father holding out my hand, lifting others by passing on a smile. Re vealing hope that someone is out there to toss us back up into the air, if even for a moment, to be as a child again, to fly.

The gift to simply say: “Hey, just be yourself :)” . It's enough to make one fly. It’s enough to change the world. Namaste    Casey Kochmer Being an angel: Means ---- having no wings. Means lifting up to their feet those who have fallen off the beat. What the great teachers of the past would say today... Isn't for them to say It has been handed to us now: here and now, To stand up and make our way into truth. Because we don't have wings, yet we can help each other fly.

So follo w suit, meandering to whatever calls. This will allow for a more natural form of exploration. Reveal the Tao at the pace of your own life, rather than the metered speed of written words. Each section limits itself as a small self-cont ained topic. While it would be possible to write an entire book on each topic, the goa l is simplicity. Long, detailed writings would actually hinder the pr ocess of learning, as it intr oduces too many tangents to the central theme: Taoism is simply the process of living to one’s own nature. To illustrate the Tao, the text mirrors huma n nature by becoming a mixture of Poetry, Art, Literature a nd Spoken Word. ========================= == Paths ============ ================ The Tao isn’t a path; the path is our lives meandered. In life I have discovered finding my way has at times been a difficult undertaking. The path sections are lessons learned from my own wanderings as a Taoist. I also contradict myself at times. This is part of the process of understanding ourselves and the Tao. Contradictions ar e often found when looking at something from a different perspective. Expe rience is based purely on perspective. Contradictions within a pers on are an indicator that he or she has traveled several distinct paths within life, incorpor ating different view points and truths. A contradiction is the starting point to a more complete understanding.

What is Tao? The Tao cannot be described, yet a person will express it simply by being alive. It is possible to list definitions from th e dictionary, from various documents. Each definition: a set of words echoing reality. Living to the Tao is not a summarization found within the mathematics of word pl ay. Poetry, philosophy, literature all offer only helpful guidance but never the ac tual Tao. A simple analogy would be swimming under the water. It's possible to r ead about snorkeling or diving, but until diving under the water, feeling the pressure , experiencing unders ea life, having lungs squeeze outside-in yet feeli ng inside-out from pushing down as deeply as you can dive, only to resurface to feel a sudden gasp of wet air... all of this is an idea approximated by a reader but only grasped by the experiencer. When the last line was read by a friend of mine, she said: “but when you snorkel th e pressure doesn’t feel like that”. Surprised, I asked her if she ever dove to about 25 feet while snorkeling, she said no, at which moment we both real ized how personal the experience becomes due to differences in the path taken. Th is example touches why discovering the Tao is a personal, living experience. The key for writing and reading this come s down to the following chain of thought: Words are never about the Tao, words are always about us. Sometimes to understand ourselves, we need to write aloud a personal truth as it is human nature and hence the Tao to do so. Reflections in this document become one possible outline to help myself be... myself, while giving others a chance to comment and contemplate their own personal situation. This then becomes a circular process between author, reader and everyone involved to help define and discover their own Personal Tao. So Move, tumble, stumble, spin poetry, swirl, dance  The Personal Tao is about self discovery .

Connect the dots... A strong desire exists for people to find c onnections. This in turn becomes patterns, literature and music. Think about musi c for a moment, in life, as life. The moments are notes Strung together, this becomes a song of life Our consciousness the melody The tempo, is the heart beating. As an aside, it could be said: The 20th century tempo has been replaced by alarms and seconds of a time clock. compared to the previous clock of the farmer's seasons compared to the previous clock of various tides compared to the previous clock of .... Seemingly always a clock somewhere <!-- To be blatant: the key word is \"seemingly\" --> Melody is a rhythmic succession or arrangem ent of sound: similarly our life is a rhythmic succession or arrangement of mo ments. Humans love melody since humans have the capability to flow with the melody. The melody’s very nature permits reflective discovery. Similarly: if life can be considered to be a melody, it becomes possible to self discover and harmonize with our own lives. The problem within this analogy: many people try too hard. It’s tempting to treat life as sheet music: looking for the notes to be handed to us, to be read. Rather, we must be receptive, listening to our lives. Over time, it becomes possible to learn various patterns of our nature. Relax, don’t “over anticipate”. The song of life is about change. In time, with time, learn to flow with your song 1 as it happens.

The first written text to describe the Tao is the Tao-Te Ching, wr itten by Lao-Tzu (The old master). The Tao- Te Ching is a series of poems that can be considered to be a work of philosophy, a treatise on how to run a government, a how-to book for achieving a ba lanced life, or a sage’s reflection of humanity and the univers e. It is known to have been written over 2400 years ago but not much else is retain ed about the origins. Many fun stories abound about these origins; however , these are just that, stories 1 . What is important is that the Tao-Te Ching and its poetry surviv e, having had an impact on the course of human events over the past 2400 years. It ’s an interesting book, worth skimming. I say “skim” because it is written in a light-hea rted manner. If a reader stares too hard or takes the Tao-Te Ching too literally, th e multiple intentions within the poetry will be lost. Most interestingly, a person w ho never reads the Tao-Te Ching may be closer to the Tao than a person who reads the Tao-Te Ching a thousand times. The Tao is a personal truth unique to everyone. Personal truth is not found in another person’s writing: it’s found within us. Taoist sages and the Tao-Te Ching will only act as a guide; the actual discovery of truth is always performed through our own actions. This creates an interesting problem: How to explain something which is unique to each person? A tack often taken is to use metaphors or similes such as: Discovering the Tao is swimming in the deepest of rivers, where the more one examines the Tao, the deeper it becomes. A person starts off swimming with simple movement; this is the Tao. Our choices made in exploring the river means everyone meanders thru an entire personal universe, yet the entire outer universe has its own currents which buffet and influence each one of us - completely- back. This is the Tao. Finally , enlightenment occurs when a person awakens upon the other shore of the rive r, where both the river and their clothes are gone, leaving one naked in the sand. This is also the Tao. Metaphors / similes, while powerfu l, often leave people thinking: “Huh?” as they fail to provide a direct answer . The point is to invoke a pe rson’s consideration of their own experiences. This process of self reflec tion is the tool used to describe the Tao. However, this approach often has the problem of being confusing or even useless as we all have very different experiences. The other common Taoist tact is to only us e indirect references and “‘not’ logic” to define the Tao. “Not” logic works since th e Tao seems in large part outside of our overall experience. It’s a similar concept to infinity. Just when you have a number big enough to describe infinity, you add one, and th e identity of infinity expands out yet again, to become different yet the same. The Tao represents the other side of infinity as the fundamental absolute. 1) Some of these stories could be true, a nd some could be fables. As a Taoist, the point is to learn from the mixing of our reactions to the tales. Veracity is best left to history; time will change “truth” for each generation."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   24 Using these basics, anyone can seemingl y become a Taoist master and easily assemble standard mystical an swers about the Tao. For example: Knowing of the Tao should not change an ything. But it does, just as knowing yourself really shouldn't change who you are, but does. It's the difference between being material or the reflection in the mirror. When the answer is we are both, more and less..... The Tao is every contradiction, every truth and each of the standard circular Yoda Yoga style answers... leaving us trying to hold flowing water in a single hand . Try to grasp it, and it’s gone, yet our hands are wet. Accept the fact that we ar e each a contradiction. This is the truth being described when answers are bantered about: using one impossible statement to prove another impossible statement... Forget these endless answers . Instead Relax A reality is: the Tao’s definiti on always changes. The nature of change is illustrated from one simple question: how constant is your definition of self? If you were a rock, you would pretty much know what you were , over time getting eroded into sand then to become dust. But humans lead interes tingly convoluted transformative lives before becoming dust! The beauty and complexity of the Tao comes from the constant changing in the way we live and in turn the attempt to describe our own path. The Tao is a crux and a puzzle which become s the lever to help one lead a more balanced life. The reason is simple: hu mans have limits, yet our aspirations are limitless. The goal is to touch and embrace these limitless possibilities. Within these aspirations one can find the Tao waiting for them as a reward. The reward we seek isn’t the destination, but the path itself. This means finding the Tao is attainable within ourselves simply by living. Hence we always have access to our Personal Tao.

It isn't an object in itself. Give it a name: Tide, and it becomes distinct due to the name. The tide is not a thing. The tide is an effect: felt but when grasped only the water touches us back. The true nature of a tide isn't the water, it’s a mixture of processes related within a dance. It's the m oon and earth swinging. It's the sun adding tempo with storms and wind. The water merely flows with the pulling and pushing of gravity, piling up in the b eat of what we call the \"Tide\". The Tao is a tide of tides. Harmony with the Tao means flowing with all the various forces connecting everything seemingly invisible yet still measurable in relative effects. Tide of emotions Joy to sadness to Joy These tides sweep body mind spirit Where thoughts ache and relax to pinpricks of pure joy wrapping caresses of absolute sadness Being alive ejaculates in being awashed It’s unpredictable tumbling of ever-receding waves Feelings mixed to chaotic elements of sand, air, water, fire of life, tumult... and ... strangely, calmness A moment between the tides Finding peace not within the calm rather within the tumult to come To be awashed in joy is so simple the answer being...

Every one is awash in their own tumult. Even for myself, I developed a personal language which helps me come to terms with my nature. I spent years creating journals, poetry and art, all to document my experiences. Once capturing snapshots of living within my writing, it be came possible to step out and recognize my own nature, to witness my own stum bling, swirling and tumbling-about from event to event. I have been a Taoist my entire life; ho wever, the ironic twis t was I didn’t understand the Tao until coming full circle to accept my self first. Over time, I learned to flow with the ups and downs of life, to em brace both the sad and happy moments. This became a lesson: that living itself was a tide of emotions sweeping thru my own blood. Once accepting this ever shifting beat of my nature, it became possible to understand more than myself. Some points to consider: • The first step in touching the Tao is very simple: It's accepting we are connected within a larger web of the world. • Understanding a single thing as an item, as a name is knowledge. Knowledge in this form, as a static definition, will be subjected to the erosion of time. • Understanding the nature of something is not a matter of knowledge, but a process of embracing and releasing in cycles. The embrac ing itself is a tidal process, ever the same, yet ever shifting. • Our understanding is never perfect; it will fl ow in and out. This is very important; trying to hold on to one single understanding leaves only fossils. Understanding must evolve to change with the meanderings of a life. • Understanding the larger world begins with flowing with the natural patterns of your own life. The process of living creates a world of ch ange. Know the Tao, as the tide of tides, unexpectedly shuffles everyone around with change. Hence, a Personal Tao starts with the acceptance of a tidal balance between our inner and outer worlds.

Love: the active acceptance of an outside relationship. The act of , the process involving , the connection between oneself and another is love. How do you define love? This expression of connection: of love → is vastly unique from person to person. Each person reaching out to meld themselves into something that stands more completely to the larger world. For some this is something dark indeed, a need to be to rn down or to tear down, as a means to bring up and forth their inner aspects which require healing. For others, love is a fulfilling experien ce in the building upon positive aspects of themselves. Between these two extremes discover the spectrum of variations through relati onships. It’s an ever- shifting experience: as life bounces against life: as one love changes another love: onward and onward in the interweaving of souls. Love is the one area of humanity where people consistently flail in an attempt to find completeness. So many lonely souls trying to find refuge in another; when completion must start within the self first and then grow outward to the warmth of another.

Nor should love be thought as a final destination. Ra ther love is a continuous process, thru which we become a little more than our previous states of being. Finding true love is not the same as discovering harmony with a Personal Tao . However, discovering love enables on e to access additional resources and perspectives, which in time leads to discove ring deeper truths a bout our own nature. A personal peace exposes self truth; a persona l love exposes truth gained from joining to the outside. The two seem so close that people confuse thei r search of personal peace with the completion of discovering love . Love is not a way to find self-peace. Remove an object of love, to discover how quickly one loses a personal peace based on such outside connections. Love is a wa y to discover harmony to what is outside oneself. The importance of love comes from its ability to aid a person to do ever so much more than they could do alone. For these reasons love should be embraced fully and deeply. However, personal peace, as it is personal, must come from the inside of ourselves to be true. Those we love might help us find truth in ourselves, yet in the end, embracing the peace of a Personal Tao mu st in large part come from our own inner self. While discovering love usually will not he lp a person find a true personal peace, the reverse is often true. Finding a Personal Tao, coming to peace with oneself, permits a person to discover harmony and love much more easily. Usually I find most people look for love first, and then try to find a personal peace. This is the harder path. Why would this be the case? It’s the case si mply because once you have inner peace; it becomes possible to accept love as a relationship . If a person doesn’t have personal peace, then much of the energy of love isn’ t going into a balanced relationship, it’s going into shoring up, trying to keep an inne r peace alive. This would be a one-sided relationship and often times these relationships burn up. How often does anyone ever truly teach us how to love? How can it be taught, when love’s definition is personal in nature? Our true teachers within l ove are those who we entwine with love. Teaching is a process of expression found within love itself. By default we teach ourselves much of what we need in love (as we are part of the entwining). If we cannot accept ourselves wi thin love, then we lose half of the equation. Many people I have watch spend time imitati ng others and basing love by example. No wonder so much time ends up in the maze of love. Instead of following our nature, we attempt to follow the nature of others. We lose our own nature in the process of pretending to be something we are not.

Is it real Is this... what is it, to be in love Wanting to vomit out entire souls  When at times criss crossing Lover’s anger flays indiscriminately about Doesn't make sense... At all Love It's a melding of souls and at times ripping of souls  screaming for velcro  In time tearing heals Makes stronger The puzzles of who we are Together This also explains anothe r aspect of love; many individuals tend to bounce between love and discovering personal truth. Yet because they don’t understand what is happening, it becomes a very drawn-out proces s of repeating past mistakes as they redefine themselves. Anyone going through this will understand the *sigh* at this point. Turn the *sigh* into a smile, as we are who we are. It’s a process of expanding ever softly outward to joining to a larger world. To discover love: Embrace your own nature. Following needs, to dispel needs. Love is always a mixing and matching to what feels right. It’s self destructive to become someone else in the process of love. Accept your nature and add upon the qualities which reinforce/ support your nature. Love is an important aspect of human life. To reject it, is to reject a part of humanity. The path of love is a way of reaching out to a larger world. Treat the overall process as love, each lover as its own separate lesson and your life will grow accordingly.

No one person can know or represent the va st amounts of literature covering Taoism. Attempting to do so is counte r-productive to accepting the Tao. As a result the core version of this book does not discuss di rectly the Yin and Yang, Chi, Wu-Wei, Zhenren or ten thousand other possible Taoist topics. Very few direct references to traditional Taoist terms are used in this book. Spending energy to associate old names and trying to understand how it al l relates would make the “ process ” of learning more important than just relaxing and being yourself. To some: this approach will be an incentiv e to explore the additional wonders of the older texts. For others: this style will make the discovery of the Tao a very simple process. Taoism has no requirements of degrees , exceptional backgrounds or previous knowledge. Touching the Tao takes only a single breath. Learning the Tao is simply Moving with Heart Tracing the Spirit p.s.        Nothing is ever missing"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   35 ======================== Finding An swers ======= ================= Between here and there in time, in the about now, it becomes time to answer the questions about Taoist terms such as Wu-Wei. Since when does the world flow accord ing to our statements of fact? Wu-Wei means “ not doing ”, means “action thru inaction”, means “Spontaneity” , means “action without directed intention”, means... I have read pages upon pages on what Wu-Wei means, what it might mea n, how the meaning varies upon scholar or parrot, and...     Now know...    Moving backwards  ... it means: nothing . Now after telling you,  other questions pop up: “how does that relate to Tao?”, “how do I not act, and get something done?” , and, and... And questions upon questions then pile up, each question taking a person one additional question further away from understanding the Tao. Re-wind time: if I don’t define Wu-Wei, the reverse happens, bri nging it all one step closer as the directed action has been removed. Instead within an ongoing gradual conversation between you and I, spread acr oss the pages is a mo re natural way of discovering Wu-Wei; as in reality, Wu-Wei is weaved throughout the entire book. Hence by the end of the book you will fully understand Wu-Wei without having to know its Wu-Wei 1 and to the Taoist that’s the ultimate in Wu-Wei.  (1) It makes sense as when you stop trying, becomes the point Wu -Wei kicks in and everything typically comes together as if it all were planned, yet the only planning is common sense .

A smile is acceptance, a joining with someth ing larger than oneself. It’s recognition (often an initiation) of intention to ex plore an opportunity.

We might appear as a human body and mind, but a greater form extends out as a larger real ity. Take the time to stop → examine a reflection → trace back a shadow → reach to touch the world as the day’s surf shuffles everything around our path. Mind, body, spirit and so much more hidden in our unrealized reflections & shadows. As example: in Norse knowledge, our physical body and mind are very small parts of a larger complex in each single life. Soul (sal) : represents the results of our lives which touch both others and the world after we leave. A soul would be a footprint in the sand, left behind, that still influences the world. Mind (hugr, minni, odhr, ek) : The mind isn’t a single entity but rather a combination of several distinct elements of memory, reason, ecstasy, and self. Fetch: The union of our opposites in the world, as well as a touching to our personal godheads. Body: (hamr, lik): Actually 3 elements of a shape, appearance & a physical body. Spirit: (ond): The vital breath of life. Another term would be Indian “Prana”. Hamingja: The overall power of our life. I bring up the Norse example for two reasons. First, it illustrates how other cultures have a rich and complex view of a pe rson’s existence beyond just a mind running a body. I believe that modern western society, in an over-reliance of reason and material strength, has lost touch to the more s ubtle and hidden aspects of humanity. Many cultures have rich, deep traditional wisdom gathered upon human nature that doesn’t appear in the general wester n culture of 2005. Secondly, I want to tease you to explore your own nature from another cultural viewpoi nt. I could not within this book begin to list all the important ideas from Indian, Nors e, Aboriginal or any of the thousand other cultures around the world. Yet it is possible to discover more of one’s self by learning 1 an alternative cultural un derstanding of humanity. 1) Learning from another culture has the st rength of removing many assumptions we inher it from our default culture. It’s hard t o leave the comfort of what is known, yet doing so increases many fold what can be learned thru new perspectives. Many amazing figures in history (Gandhi, Attila the Hun, Moses, etc) are those who have been rais ed cross-culturally. An incredible strength of presence can be achieved in this path."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   39 Land, Wellsprings, Layers  "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   40 ======================== Side Excu rsions ======================== Like the land, this section only shows a surf ace of a topic.

Say it out loud: “Remember practice makes perfect”... Ahhh. That’s a clue: “Perfection” Do we practice something in order to become perfect? Wow, now that’s something to consider isn’t it? Consider the desire pe ople have to reach perfection, the absolute dedication that some people show in the pr acticing of a talent to achieve perfection. Perfection is boring. The secret to a practice is achieving a bala nce. Now mix in the mistaken belief that achieving perfection also will be a balanced state. Perfection is a very fleeting achievement: once a person practi ces their way to the top, na ture and society practices kicking them back down. Balance is challenging. In Taoism, the goal isn’t a practice to achie ve mastery. Taoism instead concentrates upon a personal set of practices which t ogether move with harmony to achieve balance within a person’s life. This is a fine difference. West ern culture is most definitely into being the best . Being the best is all about practice. Taoism is about balance. Learning balance often comes from a practice teaching stability. Being the best isn’t a very stable position to be with in, as the process of becoming the best tends to come at the price of limiting personal development of other important traits. I have a personal mantra that we are a ba lance of Body, Mind and Spirit. But I also believe we are actually more than this trinity. For practical purposes summarizing it as Body, Mind and Spirit helps make it easier to maintain a balanced lifestyle. This translates to a set of practices which ai d in maintaining a Personal Tao. Typically these practices are a comb ination of activities whic h support the Body, Mind and Spirit equally. A Personal Tao is not a set of practices you maintain. A healthy set of practices are merely activities a person uses to focus / flow smoothly to their own nature. The two are related, but practices are not required to achieve or find a Personal Tao. Practices are a very important tool for a Taoist to use, yet too much reliance on a single practice will at times blind a person to discovering their Personal Tao. A hammer is an awesome tool, but you can’t work with scre ws very well with a hammer. Likewise, a Taoist will meditate to open up an inner eye, but you still need your normal physical senses to interact with the world.

Anyone else looking at my prac tice would be confused by the seemingly random way I skip between activities: Poetry, massage (giving and receiving), Jujutsu, Yoga (3 different styles), Patterning 1 , Wandering, Mediation, Meditation, Love, Pastel Drawing, Dancing, Reading, Day Dreaming, Chi-Gung 2 and finally Listening. I have only really mastered thr ee of these practices a nd within the rest I am just a novice or have only a very basic level of skill. The goal 3 isn’t to become a master. The goal is to flow with needs of life. If my body is feeling out of shape, I ramp up the Yoga and Jujutsu. If my body is extra sore I get some massage. If I can’t stop thinking, then I write poetry or medita te. If I have an excess of positive energy “Chi” then I will help heal someone by gi ving a massage or perform some patterning. As the real world interferes unexpecte dly every day, it means having access to a range of different activities permitting flexib ility by matching a practice to my current needs. I had no plan to learn so many different skills. Instead, over time, one skill led to another. Life kept introducing new skills due to traveling, having to balance work situations, or just sharing life experiences with other people. Interestingly enough, each practice in itself led to other pract ices. So the process of learning rapidly expands out in time. A person may only ha ve a few skills until reaching a critical point and it all suddenly flashes over into many new areas at once. ========================= = Paths ============ ================ Taoists take a “buffet” appro ach to living a practical lifest yle. Typically a Taoist will explore and try many different practices. Over time a collection of tools and ideas are gathered to keep everything exercised and in shape. There isn’t a rush to learn something new: instead we learn practices that fit with both our personal style and needs. As our bodies, mind and spirit change over ti me, these practices also flow and change over time for an individual. 1) Patterning is a term I coined for describi ng the practice of using a combination of patterns found in our lives to help unlock truth or ideas. Many different types of patterning exist. For exampl e: Psychology is a form of pa tterning based on human mental processes. Feng Shui is patterning based on human nature, artistry and older lore. Di vination is another fo rm of patterning us ing I-Ching, Tarot cards or Rune stones to predict possible future ev ents. I developed the term patterning as I discovered that my practice combines aspects of each of these different forms of traditional systems into a more comprehensive system. Patterning is a more generic name, which doesn’t get tied down to preconceptions of a single existing practice. 2) I highly recommend the spin-cycle-washing- machine-slap-your-kidneys movement in Chi-Gung. (Ok, I purposely forget the movement’s name) You learn so many things across the various practices: like how working your kidneys and liver with certain movements aids in solving allergy issues. This in turn helps relieve the stress on the body, which in turn helps reach a momen t of peace, which in turn relaxes you to a poi nt of realization of “hey I like this path I am living” which in turn helps a perso n discover a Personal Tao, rather than being in fight for survival mode as the allergies won’t let me sleep, which interferes.... anyway, you can continue the run-on sent ences with examples from your life. 3) The goal is never a goal; the purpose of any practice is supportin g your essence with tools f itting the needs of the moment.

Taoist yoga practice offers a simple piece of advice: Exercise at roughly a 70 percent effort. Working out under a 50% effort ensures the losing of abilities. The body and mind require at least a 50% level of effort to just sustain itself; anything less translates into losing tone and capabilities. Setting a wor kout pace harder than 80% effort typically ensures wearing out the body or creates an opportunity for a more serious unhealable accident to occur. Working at a 100% effort quickly results in a 100% chance of breakdown. “Giving it your all” is an unpractical way to live. A 70% effort is a rule of thumb. It’s a ha rd enough pace to keep a person growing in strength. It’s a point where a person can stay slightly on the edge, keeping a feeling of change present. Life is change, so feeling change is a required part of our health. A 70% effort isn’t too much to overload a person or to cause injury. It’s an exercise load from which a person can back away when a problem does arise, allowing time to correct oneself within the practice. This also allows room to shift gears and to adjust for the unexpected moments of life. This effort level is based upon the conditions of the moment and not past achieveme nts or future expectations. This simple rule of thumb a pplies to most areas of life (not just exercise) including love, relationships or trying to govern a populat ion. This is a simple starting point for learning how to live a balanced life. ======================== Fee ling the Edge ================ ========= Getting hurt is part of liv ing. The human body and mind evol ved to handle occasional injuries and rejection (for isn’t a rejection in love also an injury?); as a result, never getting hurt in living is also an unhealthy lifestyle 1 . Humans have a need to overcome problems, letting the body and mind use their internal healing mechanisms. Experiencing problems is part of the process for healthy human development. When I first started martial arts and y oga, I couldn’t understa nd why my body actually enjoyed the occasional physical pain it recei ved in the practice. It made sense once I understood that my body and mind actually were rejoicing in the proce ss of healing itself. This is not a statement that a person should seek injury or problems. Instead it’s an acknowledgment that the process of healthy living isn’t to be static; it’s to change along with the challenges of life. A balance exists between caution tempering reckless action for safety and bold actions removing fear that hinders our growth. Living is in part permitting the mind and body to accept and then resolve minor problems.

Yet, so many chains, chains of our own making, limit what we think is possible. These chains are forged from a desire to simplify everything to binary rules (yes/no, black/white, good/bad) or by limiting life to definable labels. Taoism offers a third path. It’s the option to be yourself, to toss away irrelevant questions, to change rules as rules are arbitrary, to discover color after seeing everything in black or white. Physics shows us an object is there or not there... or when not m easured the object is indeterminate, as it could be in any stat e. Taoism adds the extra option that the measured state of our life doesn’t matter. Every day just before waking our life is indeterminate. Instead of measuring life ag ainst the morning light, open up the day to the possibility you are free to become what you aspire to be. What we are is always a choice on how we meander into the future."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   47 ================== ========== Paths ============ =============== Depression is when the fire dims within life. It is a calling to join back with the universe. Everyone merges into the earth. Moth er earth will merge b ack into the stars. At some point the stars tumble down, e xploding into stardust that someday again merges into something new. Knowing this cycle of change, Taoism reminds me that life is a haven and time to be brightly aliv e. As a Taoist I have embraced depression to experience it, yet Taoism also gives a pers pective to live thru the worst times of my depression. Years ago I wondered why Jung and Freud e xplored spiritualism. Ten years later I came to an understanding that our consciousness comes out of the movement of our spirit. For instance, performing Yoga a nd Jujutsu both enliven the body which then stokes up the spirit to brightly burn depr ession away. Writing, laughing or perking the mind, has similar effects to dispel the de pression. Anything that affects the spirit directly impacts our minds, our bodies, th e very way we flow thru life. These relationships are related and mutual. A few times when my spiritual spark has b een the dimmest I have considered ending my life. Once after work, while driving ho me, I had a thought that it would be so much easier to slam the car at 80 miles per hour into the highway wall. It would have been a quick and simple death. Yet, at that moment Taoist beliefs kicked in and I shook my head realizing: if things were th at bad I could just walk away from the problem. The next morning I started the pro cess to close down the work project I was on. Then each day, in a journey seven years long, I moved each morning into a new life. It was a process of weaving seven y ears of aspirations an d dozens of distinct changes together as a whole to recreate my self. Yes, it would have been quicker and easier to end my life, a matte r of a mere seven seconds as compared to seven years, but my life will end eventually so why rush into it? I look forwar d to the time when I will fade. However, until then, I enjoy lif e, hug the sadness, celebrate the happiness, circle and embrace all aspects of being alive. At the moment of this story, the choice to walk away was the harder decision over staying on a path of life that was diminish ing me. This now brings up an interesting point in Taoism. Some people think that to go with the flow, to be with the Tao, is to do what is easiest. To go with the flow doesn’t me an to do what is easiest; it means to be true to your nature. We often have to deal with rough times and a more difficult path to be true to our nature.

At first, I went with the flow: having a career which would have been labeled an ideal lifestyle as shown thru parents, friends, the educational sy stem and general culture. Yet in time I rejected a cash flow work ethic wher e companies and workers rush about to maximize profit. The basic dilemma I came across is: how does a person support themselves and family, stay true to personal values/needs while working in environments that strip them of those same values? Many angles exist to this topic. go  march  beat  to work ... to timing ... to industry...

Two questions: Listen care fully for the difference: Question 1: What do you do? Question 2: What do you do? To most people these questions are the same . For instance: I can answer to question one: What do you do? I am an author. Compared to the vastly different question: What do you do? I am a poet. Seemingly the difference is the answer, ye t no, the basic difference is in the two questions: The first question asks a person wh at is their job, the second question asks how one lives life. An author is a person who writes to earn cas h, with all sorts of j ob-related issues of publishing, royalties and other such yada. An “author” is a job. It’s about cash flow. A “poet” refers to a life style. A poet lives in happiness & sadness, mixes & explores the world thru living and at times expresse s commentary within poetry as an attempt to understand the daily grind of what is calle d life. Being a poet is not about cash, as much as about experiencing life. This distinction is very important. Defini ng a person as a job will end up defining that person’s life as the job. This is the ultim ate in de-humanization, I am not a person. Nope! I am only a wo rker: all I do and will do suddenly gets forced by that one statement. Many very basic examples exist of this defi ning of our nature to a job. Look at the many generations of last names carrying a tr adition in labeling people to their work. Smith, Carpenter, Koch (cook), Mason. Showi ng this is something which isn't unique to the modern age. While last names rarely shift much today (children aren't labeled John Programmer) identifications to work s till happen at the ea rliest ages: \"Oh, you want to be a Doctor when you grow up!”"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   52 People tend to automatically iden tity themselves to a job. What do you do? I am an electronic radiation shielding specialist, hair beautician. Of course this is logical, as on average a person spends more time at work than even with family. Work is a very important aspe ct of human society, and always has been. Nothing new here except the refinement of the high art of modern business economics. Where does this leave us? First and foremost, let’s go back to the two questions: What do you do? This should be truly two separate questions: 1) What trade do you perform, and 2) Who are you. Western culture merges the questions toge ther. The \"who are you\" question tends to get dropped as knowing our nature typically takes a lifetime in learning. It's easier just to label oneself as a \"Job\" and no t worry about life's trickier and often unanswerable questions in small talk. It’s very important to untangle these que stions with a change in understanding. We are not a job! Work is performed as a method to survive in society. Now here is the change in understanding: A wise man on ce taught me sometimes you just need to change the question you are answering. In th is case the question s hould be shifted to: Why do we work? The main reasons to list could be the following For survival For consuming For serving For passion/belief For the work itself While no classification is perfect or will c over all possibilities. These five categories are an excellent starting point to help understand the relationship between ourselves and the reason for working. In exploring th ese with friends, an interesting fact became clear: when people work for reasons that matched their nature, they tended to be content. When people work for reasons against their nature, they tended to be discontent. The job itself wasn’t as important as the reasons for working. "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   53 A few examples: • Some people don’t like to work, they only work to survive. These individuals, to be happy, will work just enough to cover what they consider basic needs and then live appropriately for their survival. • If a person is a true consumer, who enjoys living life as an expression of consumption, then a person’s job should be geared to support consumption. If you live to ski, then work in such a way so you can ski. Nothing is inherently wrong in being a consumer, life is a fire, we burn to live, we consume, and it’s a natural state. However, consumption has limits, so a balance needs to exist lest we turn the planet and ourselves to ash, but life is as we live it. • A direct example from my life working in the drug abuse treatment field: I know many social workers with a passion to hel p addicts recover from drugs. Without the passion to help others, this job burns out most people in the first few months. All this might seem terribly basic. Howe ver, how often is the question seriously posed, \"Why do I work?\" with an attempt to then try to find a balance between the job and life. Usually people are chasing dollars or expectati ons of rewards. Or more tragically and universally true : they need to take any job possible as they are starving, supporting a family and have no outside support. Yet know, unde rstanding why we work is more important than the job choi ce itself. Once we understand our nature, in why we work, then it becomes much easie r to find work, a job, which fits your lifestyle and needs. Of course when pe ople are taught to think the job is more important than the reason for work, then pe ople will cling to or be attracted to jobs which will continually cause discontentment, as they will be working cross purposes to their own needs. The point simmers down to: people are not a job. We have lives and work is an important aspect of life. Ye t work and life shouldn’t be thought as meaning the same thing. Attempting to separate our identitie s and work can be very complicated, since the two can become very entangled in da y to day life. To help find answers it becomes necessary to change the question slightly to first un derstand why you work. Once understanding why you work, it becomes po ssible to balance wo rk and lifestyle in a more acceptable nature. ========================= == Paths ============ ================ To work as a Taoist means to live fully as a person. To work means working to your nature, to support your nature. Part of the problem is we think a job is a path to walk down in life. Work is not a path. The actual path is living life. Work is merely an activity within life. The second someone substitutes \"a path of living\" to be \"a career path\", often becomes the moment of birth creation of a cog in the uncaring machinery of a working society. Are we a job or are we living humans? We ar e always the latter, work is always an activity to support our lives. This is one key to finding a balance in work and life."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   54 ================ Pondering Area for Frus trated Workers ================ Why do you work?

For some odd reason I wanted to design the perfect paper ai rplane. I did just that 1 . Perhaps someone else has built the same paper airplane, I don’t know. I just know that in 1985 a single design of mine summarized all the concepts which were learned over 21 year s of living.

The other point was it had to be simple, no glue, no st aples; I wanted the plane to be only a sheet of pa per along with basic cuts. The first thing I discovered was that a plan e might work fine inside, but outside, in the winds, most designs failed. Our minds make a good initial test bench, a safe walled room makes a good stepping stone, ye t, in the end, you need to throw something into the larger world to discove r how well it works. I would test in my room, and then once that worked, I would take test planes to the top of a ten story building I lived within, and throw it off the roof. So for 3 nights I folded and folded and folded, until the third night, I ca me across this most elegant design. It’s supremely simple. It has a blunt nose, so you can reuse it over and over; as it doesn’t get damaged upon a crash or slammi ng into the wall. If you cut wing flaps it becomes a stunt plane. If you leave it with no flaps, it will fly smoothly like a ripple over a calm pond. The night of testing, I took it to the roof. On the first th row, it floated, smoothly went straight, and forward, and forward, getting sm aller, and smaller, never losing height. It flew until I lost it in th e darkness, long out of my visi on. Perhaps it is still flying today. I have this wonderful memor y, of a paper airplane floating out → out → out... over Riverside park, slowly fading into th e unknown darkness of night. The moment was perfect, breathless in unfol ding of amazement as the plane flew out of sight. Over my life, I have had similar experience s, people slowly leaving out of my life, events moving into distant points. Like my paper airplane; events, other lives and endeavors coming into focus and then later moving out into the distance to be gone. Funny thing, that paper airplane and myself are still on the roof, a nd indeed it is still flying, still floating high over Riverside Park. ========================= == Paths ============ ================ Moving on often means letting go, watchi ng what was in our lives move on to its own destiny without us.

When this happens make it something different: At this point, it can become a mantra to aid the process of reflection. To illustrate this: Once my job had become dismal and the general attitudes of co- workers desperate (some were literally in tears over the daily problems). The experience crescendo-ing into my nearly resigning at exactly 1:12 pm in the afternoon. My mind switched into a calme r mood, pushed over a boundary, thinking about leaving the job, doing the math of all the debts and resp onsibilities, accepting that tomorrow I would deal with each problem , one at a time, to rebuild a new life. While starting to write a resignation letter, something else filled my mind. In that moment, I happened to look out of the 11 th floor window: everything was crisper, the buildings in the view appeared as if each were a stone. The buildings moonlighting as black mountains, outlining an empty space 3 city blocks in size. In that moment, a seagull drifted thru the empty space betw een the manmade stone-skyscrapers. The bird flew in curves, defined by invisible h ills and valleys of wind and air. The bird knew this terrain, its flight thru, illuminated an entir e empty space, showing me something as a man myself I could only f eel in sharing with a seagull. In that moment, the entire space became a Zen Garden, illuminating the empty space of my own personal frustration with a job. The stone s of skyscrapers, a pebble of a bird, the lines of flight, the simplicity of a vista... left me at one with the whole moment. I didn’t leave the job, as any ot her corporate job would have been the same, but within this job I had found, within a most crazy si tuation, a time of reflection and peace in a personal Zen garden which had manifested itself. Now this last paragraph reads as rambling run on sentence. Shift the experience. Change the angle by reading it out loud as a story . A simple shift in approach modifies everything. Similarly simple alte rations in work style can change a long tedious job into a poetic experience (- to a point -) . Life and work aren’t packaged in neat sentences; they run on for us to experience. Many monasteries use hard repetitive wo rk, such as constant cleaning and maintenance of the monastery, as a form of meditation. A job doesn’t have to be just a job. It can be the source of more than ju st cash if we are willing to be awake to other possibilities. Even the most munda ne job can open realizations within ourselves. The key isn’t to lose our personal identity to the control of something else! I have a goal to help meld the spiritual practice of meditation within the western work environment. At times all jobs ar e empty, hard, boring or meaningless → yet with a slight shift of the mind, the same emptiness can illuminate a whol e new vista of self discovery."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   66 A Paper Spittoon This is a holding area for items removed from other areas of the book.

In Hindu culture a person can become \"sanyasis\" , handing off previous responsibilities, cast off their caste, return into nature to discover spiritual connections with an inner self and the larger universe. This casti ng off process is a common pattern across many cultures. The western world often labels this time of life as a \"mid-life crisis\" 1 . Instead of being a “ crisis ”, it should be understood as a transformative time when a person is seeking personal growth and enlight enment into something new. This is the path to becoming a sage. The process is like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly, complete with changes on all levels of a person’s makeup. Human conversation is an over-powering ac tivity. Humans spend an extraordinary amount of energy making and listening to our ex pressions of life. They live amidst a cacophony of humanity. One aspect within th e transformation into the sage typically includes walking away from that cacophony. Th is permits a person to hear the more subtle conversations between the inner self and the natural world. 1) I find it interesting that western culture subverts this time of ch ange into a consumer event. In stead of being a time of self discovery, mass culture labels it as the time to buy a red sports car or to have a fling. However, by the time the car gets paid off or the fling ends the chance to discover r eal change within oneself has often passed on by.

Juggling balls of fire   fire of my own spirit. Transformation is never easy Watching who you are crumble While growing into the wonder of something new. Mid-Life Revelations ========================= = Paths ============ =============== Twenty years ago I worked with Boris the en gineer. Boris was in his early forties and one day he stopped working. Instead, Boris sp ent the entire day at his desk drawing abstract art. He would shuffle colors ar ound for hours until at the end of the day he proclaimed it a masterpiece. It was nice art, but I didn’t under stand then why he stopped all work in order to make the draw ing. It was clear that Boris was connecting to somewhere that I didn’t have the same perspective to view. Two years ago, at age 39, I f ound myself drawing. I talked to other people going thru similar bursts of expression upon reaching mid life. The common th read: the art is a probing into deeper levels of oneself. At age twenty my exploration was about reality and how it related to my direct experiences . At age forty this flipped around to the aspects of my life which are indirectly asse ssable. The drawings now made sense, as tools of expression at an emotional level. Th e whole goal is to stir into feelings the things that the 5 primary senses cannot dir ectly discern. This emotional response acts as a lens to get a closer vi ew of our hidden nature. For myself, this artistic process was the starting point of a mid-life transformation. Having gone thru a mid-life transformation, I am surprised by how little our culture understands the process or supports this inner revolution . Western culture is more concerned with maintaining status quo. A mid-life transformation is a time of breaking one’s personal status quo. This pro cess of transformation takes time and is about a person changing & gr owing into themselves. My other observation is it’s very painful to be within the state of dramatic change too long. Typically it seems if the change is n’t completed within several years’ time social pressures and / or personal pain for ce people to revert to old patterns. Most people I have met never complete the tr ansformation process for this reason. I recommend growing into new aspects of life. To anyone going thru this process I encourage you to stay true to change. It ’s hard, risky and unpredictable. However, once completed the change opens up whol e new aspects of living and whole new worlds to explore.

Answers can be analyzed down to: --- Nothing --- Nothing is a starting point. Spring into --- following yourself. Then match and choose something else.

Movement of Water      ================== ========= Thoughts ========== ================ My nine year old son Clayton replied when reading this, “Feeding the animals is impor tant at the end of the day.” It was an automatic answer to the question. No fuss or worries, at the end of the day dad we need to feed the animals that depend on us. Children are of the Tao, because children tend towards actions that feel right, without hesitation. Each action springs forth and we live in the dance of those actions. ========================= == Paths =========== ================ The Tao: As an example, is a river. A person: A single eddy, in motion with the water, moments of swirling, reflecting when still swept quickly other times upon the currents. But all within a river which flows. Where the river isn’t only a river, rather , it’s a cycle within larger cycles. The movement of water is part of a much larger river of moving patterns. From spring to stream to river to sea to cloud to rain to earth to spring. Now unfold and repeat until grasping that each point in this cycle is the same moment amidst the many which form the Tao.

It ’s imagination in action as living. Death is the time for us to re turn to our true nature, when a person no longer pretends to be anything other than themselves. Death isn’t an ending of our paths. The moment of death is timeless and the turning point of consciousness; it’s when conscious ness can touch the entirety of life. In touching our entire nature we can stop pretending and *sigh* into the Tao.

Many myths have a person going into the land of the dead to learn. Even the Gods (Odin as example) would die in order to gain wisdom. I think it’s true; one does gain wisdom from death, whether from personal experience or through experiences de aling with death natu rally as it occurs in our lives. Experiencing death within one aspect of our nature, ripples ac ross our entire being. So experiencing a spiritual death is as re al as experiencing a physical death. I have briefly touched upon both, and wi ll share a brief story of my path and observations. Time is the key People think death is eternal Instead know Death is moment-less, only life is eternal Life mixes to: seconds, years, months, days. As jumbled glimmering glances tumbling amidst jostling Moving to a beat... As a spring sun beats down Warming life, my life, growing again as a weed Amidst the seconds that rain As time is felt and time is life  and life is time. When I was a child I constantly tested how high my sneakers could bounce me. One day the sneakers might bounce me high enough to touch a cloud. The day I did touch the sky was without sneakers as an ocean wave slapped me backwards into drowning. No one knew I was drowning, that my body was quitting, my mind had switched over and everything was shutting down and, well, I was over the world; I could touch and hold Earth in my hands as I looked over th e Earth in my moment of death. I didn’t know to be afraid; instead I expl ored the nature of my life. In one moment, I touched my entirety. Then my brother pulled me out, back into: Breath! Wonderful breath burst back into my lungs. As a child, I knew one moment I was dying, and in the next moment I was living again. Both moments we re wonderful! I was truly living in the moment. After recapturing my breath, after gaining bearings ag ain, I went straight back to playing in the water and had a great day in the ocean surf. Years late r, when I asked my brother about that day, he didn’t even realize he save d my life! He just pulled his silly brother out of the water when his little brother wa s under the water a little too long. He had no idea my spirit was packing up to go boun ce around into another cycle of my life. It was death I found the passport Indeed custom's rubber stamp marked the departure Death and memories did co mingle I found a snapshot Indeed a black and white image recorded the event Leading to a discovery No time passed, no time existed A day, a month, a second, a year were all the same in the passport"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   76 Ironic to find immortality within death itself The secret, the truth, the path of immortality Is simply to live in the moment The secret of children  when we feel we can never die Is the difference between be ing an adult and a child All simply being within the moment and not outside The moment is eternity The moment is life everlasting Within the moment a smile can be found To enliven the spirit To fire the blood back to pounding Back into the beat Of ever flowing life.   What happens when a boundary isn’t a real boundary? Adults assume a death boundary exists ba sed upon pretty strong circumstantial evidence: everyone dies, no one comes back (or very few). I believe this evidence produces a purely one-sided model of death. A view comparable to saying the world is flat, complete with waterfalls into space, based just by looking out to sea and seeing a “boundary ” of a horizon. My experiences of living , of passing thru the transitional time of death has led me to conclude that my “expression of life” is instead constantly moving thru, circulating thru all the possibilities of what we call life. Death isn’t a boundary; it’s a transition back into other expressions of our self.

Drowning is the most terrible death”. I lose my words as I personally know drowning and indeed dying, can be a most wonderful experience. How do you convey an experience to a person wh o is so in fear of any death? I want to ask “Do you worry about sleep, when the consciousness magically fades into the black for a few hours?” I know the answer will be: “No: Because I wake up and remember myself”. The analogy will break dow n at this point, as dying, doesn’t bring you back the next day. Death brings one b ack into another expr ession of their own life, but it doesn’t normally round trip a pe rson back into the same body the next day. So where does this leave me in explanation? What is my path concerning death?  Many paths exist; start with the core of life Living in the moment is the simplest to attain... just by being in the moment. No guru or tricks are required: It takes only patien t self-exploration. W e feel most alive w hen young when every second is an eternity. So no surprise people try to re-capture life as once before bouncing childlike between the moments. .... Oh, it helps..... But it isn't the answer. How can it be when: we are not children anymore?

This is true. Do you desire to live forever? Taoists 1 in the “know”, (not that there is a “know” ) , would chuckle at immortality; skeptics will always scoff, and those afraid of death will always cling to the hope of immortality. Over the years quite a bit of mythol ogy has accumulated regarding Taoism and immortality, so let’s straighten a few curv es of this mythology. Taoists have a history of long lives due to lifestyle. The ideals of Wu Wei remove stre ss, dietary traditions ensure healthy eating habits and daily r ituals foster harmony between physical and meditative practices to establish fitness. Th e Taoist lifestyle creates a delicate balance promoting a long peaceful life. Taoists practice longevity, not immortality. Immortality isn’t define d by physical time. A body will not last forever; the very nature of the body is to observe time in its limits. Even in the best conditions eventu ally accidents, disease, entropy or crazed weapon-swinging humans will mark an ending to a body’s time. The whims of a larger universe dictate finite final bounds for a given lifespan 2 . A mind will not last forever. A limit exists to how much of the “self” can reside in a mind. Memories fade. In living, a person tr anscends through an experience of many minds. Aging itself is the process of ch ange that shifts the mind around. A person might have a fundamental core perception of self, yet the manifestation of self changes throughout a life. I persona lly have lived at least eight 3 distinctly different lives. How can the mind be immortal, when it shifts so readily into new life? It’s possible to approach a steady state in mind, body and spirit to live quite a long time indeed. Yet the distinct limits of th e mind and body also dictate the nature of immortality to be quite differe nt than what most expect. 1) As with any group of people, Taoism ha s many different schools of thought. Some Taoist’s do seek physical immortality. However, immortality of the body has never been something outlined within the Tao-Te Ching. 2) In math terms the limit of a sequence of ev ents in a life span is convergent. Now to those interested in math analogies I ask: does a series of life events add up as being conditio nally convergent (free will) or does life converge absolutely (predetermined)? A Taoist will answer only with laughter, b ecause it’s both, and then forgets the whole question to go enjoy basking in the sun. 3) The lives I have lived so far are: infant, child , teenager, young adult, father, questor and sage."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   80 Immortality isn’t outside of our existence. A person is an expression of our lives, our mind, our body, our spirit, our ego, our fetch, our being, our soul, our multiple forms... once leaving all the “ ours ” a person isn’t anymore. Instead all the “our” building bl ocks return to the la rger nature of the universe, to continue onward in a different cycle 1 . Heaven and other forms of an ultimate personal expression exist: within the “ours”. Everyone is immortal in the expression of how they live. Make of your life that which you want to be eternal. Immortality is within our existence . Immortality isn’t after death and afterlife isn’t an accurate statement. The problem is one of orientation. The ego is so geared to looking forward, that before death, the ego assumes the vast vista of an immortal existence is likewise always ahead 2 . Discover it’s in the now within life that immortality exists. If a life is limited in time, then how is living within your life immortal? Each moment is timeless... Living is an expression of all our possibilities... Reincarnation isn’t after life: reincarnation is experienci ng each life possibility... Time is an illusion of consciousness... Consciousness is the wave of our existence flowing forever through the collection of one’s lives ... All moments are interconnected throughout yourself , throughout every expression of ever continuous lives... It’s possible to bounce within life. All mo ments are accessible. Our consciousness appears linear, yet with meditation, with practice, it’s possible to touch our overall existence, or to re-experience individual moments... Personally I find it easiest to just relax a nd actively embrace my experiences, making this life worth living. Searching for proof could be endless, or simply can be summarized as one’s life. Between the choice s, it makes most sense to live the current life with enjoyment and peace. 1) Some would say that heaven is this re joining to the larger universe. To a Taoist , this is also an acceptable view point. Hea ven indeed is a mixing of the stars as much as to mixing to our lives . Like the Tao, heaven is something that isn’t explainable in a single term definition: as it’s outside the ego. As a side note : the Tao is not heaven, as th e Tao crosses both life and heaven . 2) It’s like stepping out of th e subway station, and then getti ng confused in your directions.

It’s the moment when ego stops its movement. Death is just the point when a person’s consciousness fully lets go 1 . Without ego in the way, the clarity of self examination and acceptance of life becomes an unprecedented experience. At this juncture it becomes possible to embrace one’s entirety without any hesita tion. Once a person relaxes fully within death to embrace this entirety, the consci ousness rebounds back into one of the countless possibilities which defines each pe rsonal existence. In this cycle of existence a person is both immortal and mortal. Embrace your nature as both, live your mortal existence in peace, to have heaven in your immortal existence as well. 1) It’s interesting as from the Buddhist point of view, this would be the point at which a Buddha suppresses the consciousness on a permanent basis ending, in effect , the Buddha’s immortal existence. ========================= == Proofs =========================== The view I have stated is my own, base d upon life experiences, visions, perceptions and faith within my own nature. Belief of my statements, proofs based upon my life are meaningless for anyone else. Likewise having others believe in me, ha s no meaning back onto myself. The belief game, the proof game, the miracle game are shams. Tricks of the light used to prop ourselves to stand tall, until realizing each ra y of light was merely a flickering shadow. Discovery of a Personal Tao is to cross the line to accept views based, not upon the outside world or others, but instead upon oneself. Much of what people seek on the deepest level within a “universal truth” cannot be proven, will have contradictions, and will not even make sense when one has the correct answers. This is unavoidable due to the incomplete nature of each person relative to a larger universe. Yet, and here is the contradiction, we are complete within our own personal nature. It is within this finite absolute limit of being alive, that I can find my eternal nature as I am completely and always myself. I am eternal within my own nature. I rejoice within this.

So this le ft me with the problem of also answering what ego was all about. Ego is the sheepdog of the spirit, keeping our form.  Ego is a very small part of our overall nature, yet it seems to command an overly large presence. Why does Ego try to steal the show? Ego is the herding dog, the trickster, the ri ngmaster keeping us together.

Definitions      ================== ========= Thoughts ========== ================ A definition could be based on the future, in which case it's a pattern. A definition of the past is a memory. In the “ now ” we are alive where all \"definitions\" are meaningless until the moment passes. Th e act of later adding value to the “ now ” would be called intro / retro - spection for the past and expectation for the future. Each of which is an organized method of \"lying\" to oneself. An ability of humanity is storing memori es in order to build up patterns. This summarizes down to the basis of being \"I \". We as living creatures constantly recompile our own terms of existence relativ e to terms of the past and future. Our behavior/actions are then dire ctly related to how much of the future and past we mix together to form the “I\". An infant of 1 is n’t an \"I\" or \"Me\" ye t: how can the child be so when not yet having the time to compile th e concept of self relative to a past / future combination? For this reason an infant is always one with the Tao. Remembering the past and predicting the fu ture are both powerful tools we possess. To a Taoist: life is defined as it happe ns not by the tools used in life. ================== ========= Water ============ ============== Does water predict where it will flow? Does it remember where it has been? Water just flows to its nature. In doing so, it sh apes the world, flies as vapor, cascades in rain and is the basis of all life on Eart h.

The importance in Taoism is to understand when changing the world all actions of change echo back into ourselves. The modern material culture is not in bala nce with nature. It might be economically cheap to use a slash and burn style of manufacturing 1 , yet the hidden overhead price will be a burden of waste and disease. Adding to the problem is humanities habit of creating vast estates of toxic dum ping grounds: simply by tossing trash 2 about. Unfortunately we are seeing the effects of this in our health today as it reflects back to create toxic human bodies. The roots of our cancer are directly ti ed to the lack of respect people show to th e world and life around us. Know nature always has a balance. Nature’s accountants never use dollars in its balance sheet. Nature’s currency is life itself. For this reason all life is equal. It’s possible to find a balance (even in a material culture), but without respect, humans live no differently than bacteria 3 trapped in a Petri dish: doomed to consume all resources and then peri sh within the waste by-produc ts. So know the choice isn’t life itself, but our choice is one of lifestyle, expressing ourselves with or without respect. To be alive means accepting involvement with in the web of life. Removing ourselves from this web removes us from the basic interconnections which form our fundamental physical natures. ========================= == Paths =========== ================ In the near future the most powerfu l will be those able to live simply. 1) Modern natural resource management: mines, strip mines, cl ear cutting, when you take something out of the land, the disturbance ripples out and affects all the life in the surrounding area. Each and every product a consumer buys will result in the death of some life somewhere on Earth, this is part of the price of getting that c onsumer product built and delivered for perso nal use. This statement is neither right nor wrong, it’s simply fact . We are all consumers, life touc hes life, life consumes to be alive and often times it’s harsh. 2) This habit is an expression of power, or marking territory. A person littering: thro wing a bottle out over the river is saying I have the power to throw my trash over you. Humans and tr ash are of a similar nature as a wolf piss marking a tree. 3) Humans are animals, and the second a person thinks humanity is higher than other life, becomes the defining point for a person to lose parts of their own human nature . Sadly bacteria tend to live in more natural harmony than the average human, which is why bacteria tend to kick our butts around when we get sick."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   91 "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   92 Flow   A utumn Again Leaves as words flowing down Ground, paper, leaves, words Mixing together statements Drifting expressions Tracing skeletons bare to what we were.

It’s very possible to be a Christian and a Taoist, or indeed to mix any religion with Taoism. What is a religion? I define religion as: A system of belief, attitudes and practices set towards the service and worship of a God or the supernatural. The Tao is not God, and the Tao is not supern atural. As such Taoism is not a religion; it’s simply living to your nature with harmony relative to the Tao. To confuse the issue people have taken Ta oism and have converted it to a religion. So while Taoism is not a religion, a religion called Taoism does exist. On one level, these Taoist religions are simply a set of practices th at help a person achieve balance within life. The “religious” forms of Taoi sm take a slightly Buddhist approach in elevating to a “deity” level wise immortal Taoist elde rs, each acting as guides in understanding the Tao. These Taoist religions are heavily influenced by the works of earlier Taoist sages. Typically westerners separate Taoism as a “philosophy” and as Taoism a “religion”. This style of separation has been very misleading, as this limits the way westerners think of Taoism. Labeling leads to missing a whole range of subtleties within Taoism by starting with narrowed, predefined concepts of a Taoist practice. To further complicate everyt hing Taoism has influenced and changed religions such as Chinese and Japanese Buddhism. At tim es it can be confusing to understand the distinctions between some Buddhist teachings and Taoism itself. So what would Taoism say about religion in general? Taoism doesn’t say anything about religion. My personal view is that all religions are true to the faith which fosters the belief. God, or all gods, are true and are of the Ta o, when a person’s belief is true to his or her faith. This flows into a concept that al l Gods / God are of a personal nature, even when being shared through an organized re ligion. No single religion represents the entirety of humanity, as humanity itself is a spectrum of faith. This overall spectrum blends together to create a representation of humanity which is then within and at one with the Tao. As a result, Taoists aren’t necessarily religious, but typi cally blend aspects of their religious upbringings and cultures with their personal practices.

A Personal Tao shouldn’t be confused with the concept of a personal god. A Personal Tao rises out of all the different concepts of Taoism a nd should be understood as being: A system of belief, attitudes and practi ces set towards the service and living to a person’s own nature. ====================== The Questi on of God ====================== For many, the issues of Religion and God are co-mingled to the point of being simmered down to the question: Does God exist? Many phrase this as a black or white question with definite answers: God either does or doesn’t exist. If you are an atheist, then God doesn’t exis t; if you practice a religion, then God exists relative to your belief structure. Taoism offers the third path: Skip the que stion! The question of God’s existence is irrelevant . God could or could not exist, and ei ther state doesn’t change the way we lead our lives. Our lives are expressions of action between ourselves and the universe. To respect our surrounding environment is a furthering of respect to ourselves. This manner of living doesn’t change regardless of the nature of God. This doesn’t make a Taoist Godless; ra ther a Taoist considers God a wonderful question to meditate against (much like sharpening a knife against a rock) but to put to the side when dealing with daily concerns. This is where the Personal Tao steps into the equation. If a person has faith in a higher being (if they know the expression of their life matters relative to this belief) then it’s acceptable to live to those beliefs. The point where belief becomes unacceptable is upon forcing faith unto someone else or even oneself. Forcing a view typically come s out of an unsurity of faith. Forcing belief is the attempt to keep faith thru a process of action and subjugation. Such actions flow against finding a true Personal Tao.

This offers a real problem for a Taoist, as each Taoist must find a personal path and acceptance of inner faith. While Taoist texts will offer hints for living wisely, they will not open up the univers e’s door with a set of SUV keys to 4- wheel-drive thru bramble patches. In stead these books speak in metaphors: “Flow as a river undercutting around the bramble bush and have a nice day.” Taoist texts will often elaborate telling you: “When falling off a cliff directly into the brambles, consider how amazing and flexibl e the brambles are in their nature, helping in part to break your fall, then with calmness, let gravity tumble you clear of the brambles”. At this point most readers st op and wonder what the hell they just read. Some people actually prefer to be told or taught directly how to live, which many organized religions happily try to do. This means many religious texts will just say “ Thou shalt not jump in the bramble bush ”. Taoism instead encourages a person to just be them selves and explore the brambles. The problem I have with many religions is being told directly what faith should be, which ends up as someone else’s vers ion of faith. This, in turn, means people are left to break tenets of their religious background or belief system, in order to be themselves. This creates an internal ba ttle between their nature and an imposed outside vision. Everyone has some variati on in their being; it’s part of our humanity. Taoism has the advantage of always being practiced to your own faith, as you actively pursue what feels right inst ead of what has been labeled as right. Nothing is more natural than being a Taoist . It’s being true to the self. The bigger problem is discovering your nature and what inner faith holds true for you. My upbringing was Taoist, yet my parents didn’t practice Taoism. My father was an atheist, my mother an animist, and my friends were various Christian denominations. Strangely, my parents and other adults never tried too hard to impose any of their own nature onto my soul. Instead, I was le ft alone to wander to the whims of my nature. Some days I would just meander along a river all day, some days I would just talk to different people listening to their life stories, some days I would play with the trees, and ot her days I would explore and mix into the streets of New York City. Since I didn’t cause too many problems, I was returned the courtesy of unhampered freedom. In this wandering, I discovered myself and later realized it was also called Taoism. The path was surprisingly simple. When coming across something that made sense, I tried it. Over time I discarded items which didn’t feel right, discovering the wisdom of newer truths, all the while always permitting myself to just be myself. I discovered that truth is ever shifting, based ma inly upon perception; living recommends a path of shifting along. Truth breaks when a person doesn’t flow with the reality of the world. At this point it shoul d be mentioned that we have inner truth and outer truths . Overall truth is the balance between these inner and outer truths. In searching fo r truth, at some point a pe rson will encounter religion. No matter how much one searches the outside world, at some point, inner personal questions surface which cannot be resolved by simple observation or interaction with the outer world. Religion is one of many tools which can be used to help find answers to difficult questions."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   97 If you are secure and know yourself truly, and know your faith is true, then skip the rest of this section. Your path is tr ue, and that is wonderful and indeed you are finding your own Personal Tao. If you are wondering and have doubts: seem ingly can’t find answers that make sense with religions you encounter. Many other people have the same problem. I watch people who try so hard to find a religion that fits them. Looking, trying on churches like clothes, reading diffe rent spiritual texts, trying out recommendations of others... looking some more, and then some more and more and more: All the searching becomes “ever mores”... Each act of reaching out is like a fly, flies buzzing around, which end up being distractions that we swat away. The buzz isn’t about finding a religi on; it’s a search to establish a firm acceptance of ourselves and the larger uni verse. The goal is a “surety of self” within the tumbling tide of life. Religions come with a pre-packaged set of practices to help guide one into that surety of self. Of course seemingly coun tless religious packages exist. Typically, people make due with something which f eels close to the mark or with the religion that was handed to them at the st art of their lives. Living like this, just making due, can leave one with constant doubt, anxiety and feeling lost. Finding self doesn’t have to be a proce ss of discovering religion (or scientific facts). Religions (and Science) are both a path for discovering how a person fits in with the world. So to those having problems trying to find something which feels right, the solution is simple: Flip the spiritual quest around and instead spend some time with yourself. Begin writing a j ournal, which in turn will become a set of personal scriptures to help discover how to be yourself. A person needs only to accept themselves, to find their place with in the larger world. It’s accepting the bad -the absolution- which is often the gr eatest gift of a religion. This absolution is the gift of acceptance. A beautiful ev ent within religion is when a clergy member takes the time to truly accept you fi rst; this makes it easier in turn to accept yourself later. It’s a spiritual tric k to aid someone to learn how to accept themselves. So the spiritual practice of any religion can be understood as accepting yourself for your own nature, which becomes wondrous upon the acceptance. Religions teach this from the outside while Taoism teaches this from our inner selves. Both paths are options; it’s just a que stion of how to reach the goal.

The fi rst step is to list the principles behind our actions. Writing such a list was a critical milestone in my spiritual growth. It opened my life to be lived rather than just passing the time. I am in no way stating other people should live to th ese guidelines. Instead this is the process I used to come to terms, with my own pe rsonal acceptance of living. Thes e “guidelines” shift with the movement of my life. Realistically, guidelines don’t determine how I live; instead by living I will express who I am. With care, I aid those who are exte nded expressions of my nature. My children, partners, parents, friends, pets, any spirit who lives within my essence: are all extensions of my own nature. I must take the time to care appropriately for those who are dependan t upon my own nature. This is an ever changing and shifting balance. Blind co-dependence is not something I encourage, as it subtracts from my natu re. However, mutual sharing of spirit is very beneficial as it enhances my nature. Caring for the ones I love thusly fulfills a major part of my own essence. Be true to myself If I cannot be true to myself, I end up destroying myself. I cannot aid another by destroying myself. Even if it means disappointing others, it’s important to take care of my very own nature. To those in my heart, it’s bette r to disappoint than to disappear. To those outside of my spirit its better to disappear than disappoint. I cannot give away my soul to another, as to do so would destroy that nature. My spirit can freely entangle with others, but our nature is always uniquely our own. Giving your soul away is to not be true to yourself. Connect to the world as I want to be treated. My actions reflect back to me on every level. While I can act as I please, I also have no desire for people to treat me without respect. I will almost always try to treat others with respect and patience. At times, I will act outside this rule, since to gain respect sometimes means responding to people using their own rules which can be quite different than mine. 1) Many different maps exist. One of my favorites is the mandala. Na vajo and Buddhist traditions use the mandala to create a visual map to our spiritual world. Not every principle can be expressed in words, many times the best way to reveal something is art itself."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   99 Connect to those outside my nature with decisive action. It subtracts from my nature to give mixed signals to othe rs. When connecting to something or someone outside me, th e way I represent myself reinforces my own nature. When dealing with those outside of my spirit, I will be decisive and clear in my actions. I have learned part of acti ng decisively is to base actions clearly on my own nature. To those unwilling to accept me for my true nature, I will then reflect them. To some this means I am a chameleon, bl ending in. To others I will seem to be a fool. In either case it’s a waste of time trying to convince people about who I am. I am always myself. But it’s foolish to not accept each person as uniquely themselves. To thos e unwilling to accept me I often will reflect them. In most cases it typically means I be come the fool. Perhaps I do this to protect myself, at times I do this in the hopes I will shatter a tarnished mirror. But I act the fool wh en, {as quite simply}, I just wish to be left alone. Most people (even those who once love d you) leave fools blissfully alone. Now to illustrate why these are living guidelines Having been the chameleon for many year s, and having played the part of the fool, I have come to the conclusion that either role, while a quite safe place, is no longer a place I wish to hide. This rule has changed recently to become: To those unwilling to accept me for my true nature, no action is required: just silently let them be themselves as I remain myself. Once in my life I was a chameleon and a f ool. Those were part of my nature, to protect myself as I needed time to deve lop and grow in a culture which almost crushed my spirit. Now that I have fu lly and truly accepted my nature I can shed these aspects, safely becoming myse lf. I am grateful for the time within the protection of those two roles and a chance to try out the many different aspects the role of chameleon and fool permitted me to experience. But for now I have settled into a more reflective role. In time I will change again. I own nothing; I am merely a passing custodian of items outside of my nature. I pretty much share everything. Thinking I own something is an illusion. I might hold control over something, but possession is not ownership. The moment I believe I own something is th e moment I am no longer free to be my own nature. I openly share what I have with those who show respect to the items and myself . A custodian has a responsibility of respect; a person who shares with me, has the re sponsibility of returning some respect back. When multiple people become a custodian of an item, I am more careful on how openly the item gets shared as I must also respect and consider the other custodians.

This is a very nice way to live. It leads to a balance of becoming part of an ever growing community of those I love and connect to within life. ========================= == Paths =========== ================ Here are two stories from my path as sample s of the guiding principles within my life. Example of caring for those whom I love, while being true to myself. Olympia is a special place; unfortunately th e Pacific Northwest is the source of a few pretty serious allergies which cause me quite a bit of pain. For health reasons, I would have long ago meandered to Central America or other warmer climates better suited to my nature. However, after my divorce I didn’t want to leave my two children. That left me in a terrible position. Stay some where which was literally tearing my mind and shredding my body (severe allergies can really mess a person up I discovered), or to leave which would have consequences fo r my children. Several additional factors in the situation left me at a point of internal conflict. I decided to stay in Olympia for my childre n, but I also decided th e reason to stay in Olympia should be to support my nature. I had a need to understand the depression, and as it later turned out the allergies which were the source of that depression. I decided my staying in Olympia needed to be the time to understand why it felt like the Pacific Northwest was driving me away. The reason to stay was to discover more about myself. The solution took years to uncover. I had to stop and examine my nature. I spent time to understand my need s thru activities such as spoken word poetry to closely examine my mind and spirit. I learned more about my body, beginning to seriously explor e yoga and martial arts whic h healed my physical self, and in turn strengthened my overall system to better resist the allergies. I spent time to determine what foods I should or shouldn’ t eat, as it turned out food also played a role in the allergies. I then discovere d how the body works internally, so I could perform deep internal exerci ses to aid my liver and kidne ys, which in turn helped purify the body of the allergens. A ll these activities led me to discover interconnections between mind, body and spir it. Over 5 years I took the time to understand myself so I could also support those I love. As a result of this hard work, patience and time I was able to be true to myself and care for my children."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   101 Many times staying and not running is the hardest thing a person can do    Allow time to discover yo urself, a process that sp ans an entire lifetime.

One evening, Julie and I were walking home . Along the way, a pitbull attacked us. In that moment I acted decisively. I became my full self and demanded directly to the dog to stand down. The dog and I sized each ot her up in one of those perfect seconds that last a little longer than a second. The dog reacted as if I would have taken it down completely 1 because I knew and decisively to ld the dog as much with my full expression of self. Then the pitbull walked aw ay. If I didn’t act as myself, if I had any mixed emotions, doubts or fear, the pitbul l would have then had doubt about my nature, and it would have attacked me, since a pitbull’s nature is to attack when in doubt. Instead Julie and I walked away 5 sec onds later with no harm to anyone. While this is an extreme example, in some aspects, it shows the truth of clearly communicating with decisiveness. 1) Just because I am a Taoist and peaceful 99% of the time doesn’t mean I am always passive. Being a Taoist means always living relative to your nature and the situation you are within. If a situation requires forceful actions then you need to be p repared to use forceful actions with full commitment.

Part of me now is still thi nking as an engineer: my thoughts { build a map, determine past and future expec tations, list the changes, chart patterns of unfulfilled expectations ...} The same moment, the poet side of my na ture slaps me to the curb telling me just to stop Don’t do anything, stop for a moment Feel the breath, touching fingers, fee ling soft lips pushing a deep breath, Break free not in thinking, but in action Eyes close down... - - , and then, I walked away from this ... {To outside of here} Right now I am typing, now 10 minutes ago I was just under a che rry tree, witnessing flower petals dancing upon the wind. Right now you are reading this in my distant future.... These moments are connected All these nows , tied together as the very same moment, all the same, we are together, because there are no expectations, Right now we aren’t boxing ourselves into manmade boundaries. Instead we are flowing to a larger world, pushing us up and out of chairs, mixing in with spring’s scent of lilac highlighted to the sound of the wind hopping between trees.

If people live in a culture where personal value is based upon expectation, what happens when discovering life exceeds any bounds of expectation. Is your nature enough to fulfill yourself? Or Will you limit your nature upon expectation?"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   109 ================== ======== Thoughts = ================ ========== An expectation isn’t reality. It’s a hope of things to be, a useful tool in a fortune telling sort of way, char ting a course of action. Expectations: a package deal, bundled down with an emotional ribbon of attachment. It’s the attachment which forms the core problem of expectation. The advantage of attachment is that a person gains additional strength by personalizing a process. However, the counterbalancing issue: life c onstantly changes, or we encounter other people with attachments to plan s opposite of our own intention 1 . I have personally discovered that very ra rely do I meet my expectations. For this reason I personally ignore expect ations most of the time. It takes too much energy to attach and then un-attach myse lf constantly, trying to fit to the whimsy of the world. I have chucked the expectation routine out the door. Much like the intro to this section, discovering the world presents constant opportu nities: to change, tr y alternative paths, find smoother answers to your goals. It ma kes life less stressful, when living openly in this manner. I have also discovered that with enough will and enough determination many impossible things become real, yet in this path the world will push back, cracking our soul, aging us till we fit properly within a newer balance. Force always reacts back with an equal force. So in this, I have found it to be a truer path by flowing ac tions with the world. Let the world itself assist you in the endeavor of your plans. This way, when the world uses force against you, then ironically that force can be redirected back to empower your actions. In the end, I still plan all the time, but the trick is not getting overly attached to those plans. This permits a flowing process of cha nge from plan to plan or from plan to happenstance, or happenstance to plan: life a nd I just shift along. At times I still get attached to a few plans, but I have learned to pick and choose those times carefully to match the needs of my spirit.  1) Often times, since we misunderstand our own intentions, we ourselves end up in direct oppos ition of our own expectations. Our own conflicting expectations often cancel out, cau sing personal failures in overly forced actions."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   110 While living to your expectations doesn’t go against the Tao per se, it is as opposite to the Tao as I can define. Expectations are a methodology to force the world to fit to your mold, compared to the typical Taoist response of accepting / flowing along with the world as it happens. Yet each Personal Tao is unique, meaning for some, it’s in their nature to hammer the world into an expectation. Typically I have noticed these individuals tend to be the most amazingly fantastic builders/creat ors equally counter- balanced with discontentment over the products of their life. These are the individuals constantly on the move to hammer down ye t another outstanding flaw or problem, never to discover completion, as their contentment comes from the chase of perfection itself. This, in turn, ends up being their Personal Tao. Living to expectation limits the nature of th e Tao, to self imagination. Imagination is powerful, but we have definite limits. As much as I can imagine, or as much as a single person could express, an infinitely larger realm exists outside of how we each define life. Living to expecta tions, limits a person to a very small slice of what is available to live. Even worse, people lead ever diminishing lives when basing personal self worth upon their expectations. Is “self worth” a unit of production? 1 If expectations are rarely met, how does it re flect within our personal self value or upon our relationships based purely upon expect ation? Living to expectation ends up leaving quite a few people unfulfilled, leading very limited lives.   1) The consumer society has an interesting twist to this expectation puzzle. The c onsumer society manages expectations by teaching people that contentment is something purchased at wholesale. The majority of the United States’ economy is based on a pyramid scheme of expectations within an “American dream” to be materially well off and comfortable.

The answer is to dream a thousand dreams. I reveal these dreams to myself and over time to others. This confuses people as th ey mistake these dreams as statements of action, as something I will do. I suppose the dreams are presented to others in a matter of fact form, a proto plan, like placing a seed into the soil to grow. Dreams and seeds are very similar. Dreams require a mixture of your own essence and outside reality to germinate. In this sense, your soul is the soil, and speaking the dream aloud is to blow a spark of life that others help fertilize. These are the conditions to germinate a strong dream. Many dreams w ill not grow, but some will reach for the sky, and those end up as the bean stalks upon which legends are fed. Some would say this is setting intention, but closer to the mark, this is placing your spirit truthfully into the dream. As ma ny dreams strangely become a reality for myself, people seemingly expect this is w ho I am, that the dream was my path, my expected destination. Not the case! As dreams shift, no dream can be a whole statement; in fact they almost always sh ift in time, randomly, meaning I end up doing something other than the original idea or dream itself. I haven’t changed, nothing has changed; I merely unfolded with the plan, with the dream as it happened. Yet the expectations that others had of my lif e were broken, since it didn’t follow a pre- determined course of action. How could it ? It started as dream, which got bounced around by others, layering additional dimens ions. The world buffets it around, then suddenly everything is placed in a position wh ere another dream is a closer fit, and the whole process starts again taking everyone wonderfully along for the ride. Most of the time, as the wo rld knows of my dreams, the world and my friends help some of these dreams become true. More often the case, dreams remain a dream and it passes quickly by as a pleasant daydream. Other times old dreams reawaken and become reality, simply because everythi ng takes a while to align. Having had the dreams, having told others, allows a long leve r of time, of the years, to work in my favor; it permits me to notice when everything is right. Then when it all feels right, to then leap the dream into reality. This is a question of style. Some of us are built out of brick and mortar; solid engineered perfection. Others of us float to our dreams; ever shifting to the whims, the currents, the clouds. The challenge is to avoid getting tr apped by expectations while permitting plans and dreams to flow freely to your needs."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   112 Cuttings Sunflowers - Christian Ethan Mosconi 2005 Not all flowers bloom, lying on the cutting room floor.

To learn of myself, I explored spoken word 1 poetry. On one level, becoming a spoken word poet was an interesting choice, as late r I remembered, oh yah: I have this lisp. I know I have a lisp, but it doesn’t define me to me. Over the years the lisp has relaxed quite a bit, to be very minimal, but it’s a part of me and while I never hear my lisp, at times I remember and smile knowing it’s ther e to distinctly mark me. It’s funny, I remember being eight years old and purposel y making the decision to keep the lisp. I knew it was wrong to have others tell me how I should define myself. The importance of my becoming a spoken word artist was to learn how to focus an experience into a coherent topic fo r direct communication with others 2 . My written- word poetry in comparison was turned inwa rd for self communication. Over time my poetry has merged into combining aspects of both spoken word and written word. The spoken word poetry tends to expose my acti ons and feelings to the world (body and spirit), while the written poetry moves with the spinning of my mind. Combining these two forms helps me discover a more complete expression of my own nature. The lesson I learned from being both a spoken and written word artist is how we are each a poem of our own personal expre ssion. Our portraits glimmer from many different angles of expression. Finding ourse lves is as much a matter of speaking out loud, as to think and accept what we feel in side. We have to speak to be heard, for silent we only take upon our internal m eaning, and the corresponding nature that others will assign to us. Read the poems in the book aloud and within your mind and you will discover different meanings in each poem. The poem in this section especially calls out to be read aloud to a mirror, to an audience. Disc over that your own nature calls out to be spoken for. 1) Spoken word poetry is quite different th an written poetry. The word choices and grammar are changed entirely for verbal impact. When spoken, the poet mixes in body language for add itional meaning. The words tend to be very exposing while nuances are carried thru voice tone. Another difference is th at the mental medium is quite different: a listening mind interprets language differently than the mind which reads a poem. Overall the spoken word style is a very vibrant, dynamic performance art which reveals our humanity in raw and cu tting angles. Performing spoken word becomes a disturbingly honest opening of one’s soul revealed for all to see and hear. When done to form, it isn’t acting; it’s performance art of a very personal nature. 2) If someone else cannot understand my writing, then it is often true that I don’t truly understanding my poetry."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   115 Mantra The sound of our soul, echo’s in our breath. ================== ======== Thoughts = ================ ========== A mantra is a simple harmony. Mantras ar e statements, sounding out of ourselves, repeated, repeating, spun outward into vibration, repeating ever again until a connection to understanding occurs. Right now you are working upon a mantra. The greatest mantra is one we all have, each and every day, hundreds, upon thousands of countless statements, which we call... Breath Breath itself is the personal mantra of our life. 20,000 times day, a person tells the world in whispers, sighs, shouts, words, ga sps, breathing in and out: the mantra of their life, twenty thousand times a day: Breath This mantra is our nature: Do you take a breath, a deep breath to re lax within? In road rage, do you shout slapping breaths of “Fuck you”? Ever hit yourself in a sharp intake of breath?   What is the beat of your breath when pushing yourself? Do you taste the scent of spring upon an inhalation? Each instance, each breath is our personal mantra expressing our nature. To reveal yourself, pay attention to this personal mantra. More powerfully make it a practice, learning to work with your breath; improvi ng and actually experi encing the statement of your life. Many practices exist to help a person fo cus in how breath moves life along. Practices of breathing might surprise you; it isn’t all Yoga and Taoist ways. As an example, I discovered becoming a spoken word artist was also my personal mantra of how to express and live within the breath of speaking aloud my nature. You can be your own guide, in lear ning to live within breath. The start of any breathing pr actice is simple: understand th at your breath is with you at this very moment. Take the first step in, feel , knowing life moves relative to the inner metronome tempo that’s within breath itself."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"A Personal Tao: www.personaltao.com Table of Contents: www.personaltao.com/tao/readonline.htm PersonalTao@Gmail.com Copyright © 2005-2006 Amberjack Software llc www.personaltao.com   116   ========================= == Paths =========== ================ It doesn’t take the last breath of li fe to discover your personal mantra. Why do people express wishes upon a dying breath.... When within life, we each have 20,000 ch ances a day to make those wishes true? For some, 20,000 chances a day is a bit ove rwhelming to ponder. So my path is simple: It only takes one br eath, one action timed within the breath, to make a wish come true. Take the time to notice an d act upon a breath once a day, once a month, once in a while: all these actions do add up to make a difference. It just means not using your last breath to do so.

Feel it in your hands. Now spin it upon a potter’s wheel. What is shaped? A bowl comes out. However, the bowl is defined by an empty space, a space enclosed by the bowl’s very form. The em pty space holds the water, fulfilling the purpose of the bowl. The actual physical form of the bowl is reflected by the empty space it projects. The final use and form of the bowl is determined in the moment of artistry used to spin out the shape. In this example the bowl is made from cl ay. The clay forms the body, but the actual bowl projects out as more than a clay shel l; it must include the “empty space” in its definition. In fact a bowl is more about the “empty space” than the materials comprising the bowl. In living, we each have a physical form which is mirrored by an empty space. The process of shaping this space is the very definition of a person’s free will. Free will is the ability to express the very nature of the empty space. Free will is the whim of the moment, the place before the dream, the moment of shaping . In part, our initial empty space is formed by parents, elders, teachers, culture, our bodies and tendencies of the mind. Yet each person has an incredible degree of freedom to shape his or her own empty space. At certain times this process is more dramatic than others, such as being a t eenager, or experiencing a mid-life crisis. These moments stand out as a time to ques tion earlier frameworks that shaped our forms. These times can be difficult due to th e twisting of our core shape and beliefs: a time when our very nature is in flux. Often a person reshapes their empty space without the benefit of outside perspective, adding to th e frustration and chances of something “breaking” . A person never truly breaks, but radically changing one’s own empty space reflects out to form a vast ly different person after the experience. ========================= Consciousness ======================== Consciousness is the awareness of one’s empty space. To fill the empty space painters splash out art, poets weave words, scientists document facts, parents embrace children, prophets preach, couch potatoes watch television... and the list goes on. The point is: being consci ous, people feel a need to fill this space.

Others feel the mind should provide a definable labe l for their reflected nature. This is the very search for the meaning of life: a pers on trying to figure out what to place within their empty space. The meaning of life isn’t something that fills the empty space. Perhaps this is why people have such a hard time defining the soul. We know the soul includes the empty space. For some the soul takes on the ethereal aspects of the empty space as the indefinable qualities of lif e. A Taoist knows the soul is always at hand. To be an artist is to touch a nd reveal the empty space of the soul. The meaning of life is the artist ry to craft the empty space. ================== ========= Paths ============= ================ It’s time to come full circle in the book. Another definition of the Tao is that it’s the empty space. A Personal Tao could be described as the pr ocess of defining one’s empty space. It’s the expression of free will to have a hand in shaping your own empty space. Free will means no single, predefined final form to this empty space is forced upon a person. The empty space is defined only upon using and completely living life. Yes a limit exists to the number of destinations that are available, yet living is the freedom of action to shape our life. Instead of worrying about the shape of life, follow Wu-Wei, flow to what feels right without thought: express the empty space w ith peace, love and exploration. Such action becomes true artistry upon one’s soul. The only limit being the imagination itself. Be free, be yourself.
