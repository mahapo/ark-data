The book that came to be known as the Chuang Tzu is an anthology of early Taoist thought. At least seven of its thirty-three surviving chapters can be attributed to the philosopher Chuang Chou (369-286 BCE). The book ' s appeal to Chinese intellectuals through the millennia derives as much from its content as from its style. Chuang Tzu's message of free- dom and nonconformity liberates the Chinese mind and provides a wholesome antidote to the ethical and social values embraced by the Confucianists. The writer was a born storyteller and a supreme artist with words: he used all the resources of language that were at his disposal—from anaphora to zeugma, hyperboles and litotes, parallelism and antithesis, paradox and humor, and, most devastating of all, a device known as the non sequitur. Chuang Tzu drew from a vast storehouse of ancient Chinese myths, legends, and unrecorded history, as well as from an ency- viii ix"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Foreword clopedic knowledge of what may be regarded as the \"unnatural natural history,\" to weave together—by means of parables and anecdotal debates—the vision of a skeptic and mystic, in a world beset by constant and dangerous moral choices. Complete or partial English translations of Chuang Tzu are available in many versions—including those from the last cen- tury by Herbert Giles (1889) and James Legge (1891); the more scholarly, modern contributions by Arthur Waley (1939) and Bur- ton Watson (1964 and 1968); the more poetically nuanced ones by Lin Yutang (1948) and Thomas Merton (1965); and the still more recent scholarship of Angus C. Graham (1981) and Victor H. Mair (1994). However, Sam Hamill and Sandy Seaton's new retransla- tion of this much-beloved Taoist classic has much to commend itself, largely by virtue of its boldness of approach and its innova- tive use of language. Let me elaborate. The book is a collaborative effort by two of the most talented wordsmiths of their generation, and it employs a language that is vibrant and colorful. It aims at readability even to the extent of ig- noring formal fidelity in translation. In tackling the problem of translating from one language to another, it has been generally as- sumed that there are two approaches possible: the literal or the free. But the more seasoned translators have come to realize that there is a third alternative, which is preferable. And that is to temper faithfulness to the original with expressiveness in the tar- get language and to combine straightforwardness with elegance; ultimately, to achieve what have been recognized as the three desiderata of translation: hsin (fidelity), to (expressiveness), and ya (elegance). For a translation from a tersely worded philosophical text, it must be obvious to many that a literal approach is the least re- warding and ought not to be exclusively relied upon. If care is not taken in this regard, one can expect to find, as one does in Fung Yu-lan's translation, such a passage: \"The universe is a finger; all things are a horse. The possible is possible. The impossible is im- possible. The Tao makes things and they are what they are. What are they? They are what they are. What are they not? They are not x Foreword what they are not\" (Chuang-tzu, 1931; 1989 reprint p. 45). Even in the newest, more lucid translation by Victor Mair ( Wandering on the Way, 1994), one encounters this passage as: \" Heaven and earth are the same as a finger; the myriad things are the same as a horse. Affirmation lies in our affirming; denial lies in our deny- ing. A way comes into being through our walking upon it; a thing is so because people say that it is. Why are things so? They are so because we declare them to be so. Why are things not so? They are not so because we declare them to be not so\" (p. 16). Contrast the above with the bold reduction of these arguments into just a few words by Hamill and Seaton: \"Heaven-and-earth is one finger. All ten thousand things are one horse. Okay? Not okay. Okay? Okay. Walk in the Tao. Accomplish it all. Say words, and they're so. How so? Is so? How not so? Not so so!\" (chapter two). Deliberate mischief? Absolutely justifiable. Chuang Tzu, one must also bear in mind, is not only a philoso- pher but a poet. In one passage, Chuang Tzu used the noun spring as a verb, which so captivated Burton Watson that, as he ex- plained in the Introduction (The Complete Works of Chuang Tzu, p. 19), he attempted to emulate it by translating the passage as: \" . . . never be at a loss with joy . . . and make it be spring with everything\" [italics mine] (chapter five, Ibid., p. 74). How much more natural to find the same passage in Hamill and Seaton trans- lated as: \"Never let joy be lost . . . eternally in the springtime of things,\" though one knows that it is not a literal translation. Throughout the translation, the two translators dare to be orig- inal (and controversial), occasionally inventing a new idiom, as seen in their onomatopoeic use of words such as hua or kerplop- almost intentionally to suggest some of the wit and whimsicality of the original text. Now the characters who appeared in the sto- ries and anecdotes in the Chuang Tzu can, broadly speaking, be classified into three categories: the first consisting of historical figures like Confucius or the logician Hui Tzu (Hui Shih, circa 370–310? BcE), the second consisting of mythological or leg- endary beings like Fu Hsi (China's Prometheus) or the Yellow Emperor. But a third and equally large group is made up of figures, xi"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Foreword or creatures, created from the baseless fabric of the author's vi- sion—like a Pistol or a Caliban—to whom Chuang Tzu often gave fanciful names. And these proper names, if allowed to remain in their original, transliterated status, will mean very little to Eng- lish readers. But if an attempt is made by the translator to allude to the moral or physical qualities of this person (or creature) so described or caricatured, it poses a challenge of the greatest mag- nitude. One character is given by Watson in the Chinese original as \" Nieh Ch ' ueh, \" but the same figure appears in A. C. Graham's translation as \" Gaptooth \" and in Victor Mair's as \"Gnaw Gap.\" Hamill and Seaton gave this name as \"Mr. Chipped Tooth.\" I mprovements of this sort abound in the various chapters of this new version. Another example is found in chapter eleven, where a character with the name of Cloud General (Yun-chiang) is said to roam the universe in search of an answer for good gov- ernment and chances to meet a being who lectures him on the value of transcendence through nonaction. This character in the Chuang Tzu is given the name of Hung-meng with the second character, meng, written without the water-radical. Whether or not the change was deliberate on Chuang Tzu's part, one can never be sure today without access to more reliable textual evi- dence. But most commentators, from Hsiang Hsiu (d. 272) and Kuo Hsiang (d. 312) down to our time, have accepted this rhymed- compound or binome as a cognate of meng-hung with the second character written with the water-radical. While the compound of Hung-meng occurs only in Chuang Tzu, the compound in the re- verse order of meng-hung (with the water radical) occurs three times in the Hua-nan Tzu (circa 140 BCE), another ancient Taoist classic, and it is always glossed by early commentators as mean- ing \"the undifferentiated ether of the universe before creation.\" But, when written without the water-radical, the word meng by itself means \"ignorance\"; the word occurs in the Book of Changes (I-ching) as number four of the sixty-four hexagrams, translated by Richard Wilhelm as \"Youthful Folly\"—it is made up of the trigrams ken, above, meaning \"keeping still, moun- tain,\" and k'an, below, meaning \"the abysmal, water\" (I, 20). Foreword And, since the Chinese language allows a word to have many meanings, it would not be wrong to accept the first word hung as also meaning \"a large wild goose\" (and that meaning also goes back to ancient times, to the Book of Poetry, or Shih-ching). With all these options open, how would a translator approach the task of translating the name of this singular creature? And the manner by which he is introduced? Here is Herbert Giles: \"The Spirit of the Clouds . . . happened to fall in with the Vital Princi- ple. The latter was slapping his ribs and hopping about\" (p. 129). \"Vital Principle\" was introduced as \"Vast Obscurity \" in Victor Mair (p. 97), where he was said to be \"just at that moment enjoy- ing himself by slapping his thighs and hopping like a sparrow.\" And this creature addressing the Cloud Chief was described by Watson as \"Big Concealment, still thigh-slapping and sparrow- hopping\" (p. 121). All these are worthy attempts at rendering this highly amusing episode in modern-day English. But the first prize, I dare say, must go to Hamill and Seaton, whose version reads: \"Cloud General . . . bumped into Big Goose Dummy. Drumming on his tummy, Big Goose Dummy was about to take off like a hopping sparrow.\" Punning, of course, involves the risk of censure by the purist, especially when an attempt at etymo- logical reconstruction may turn out to be wrong or misguided. But a success of this sort also needs to be recognized: at the very least it evokes the most glorious as well as the most glaring of the kinds of excesses indulged in by Ezra Pound. Thus, a much-admired Taoist classic of ancient China—which age cannot wither nor whose infinite wisdom, grace, and subtlety can be staled by numberless borrowings and pilferage through the ages—has been given a new lease on life, in colloquial American English that is exciting to read. IRVING YUCHENG Lo Fearrington Village Palm Sunday, 1998 xii"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction O ONE WROTE THE CLASSIC BOOK NAMED FOR THE grandfa- ther of philosophical Taoism, Chuang Tzu. Neither Master Chuang Chou nor the other ancient Chinese philosophers of the Chou dynasty (third century BCE) wrote books. They recorded verses, songs, brief essays, conversations, and anecdotes, writing them on strips of bamboo that eventually were bound together and rolled into scrolls. Each \"chapter\" of Chuang Tzu was com- posed of one scroll. It is generally thought that chapters 1 through 7, the \"Inner Chapters,\" are the compilation of Chuang Tzu him- self or of his immediate followers, and that the \"outer\" and \"mis- cellaneous\" chapters were added, edited, or abridged by various hands. At the time of the Han dynasty (first century BCE), the Im- perial Library edition contained fifty-two chapters. The present form of the \"complete\" Chuang Tzu in thirty-three chapters was edited by Kuo Hsiang in the third century CE. Chuang Tzu inhabits a territory where history and myth be- come one. Little is certain about his origins or his life. Like the Chan (Zen) Buddhist masters who, several centuries later, drew xv"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction heavily from both his technique and his teaching, Chuang Tzu believed that we are each the source of our own suffering and that much of our suffering is a direct result of our insistence on judg- ing things \"good\" or \"bad\" while refusing to accept what simply is. He believed that people waste their lives clinging to things. His use of paradox and startling juxtaposition probably inspired the Zen koan. Chuang Tzu delighted in questions that demolish our ridiculous insistence on \"rational\" behavior. The teachings of Master Chuang, along with those of the equally mythologized Lao Tzu and his Tao Te Ching (if there was a Lao Tzu and if he did write Tao Te Ching), are the primary teachings of philosophical Taoism. Chuang Tzu lived in a time when the literate classes were schooled in the moralistic teach- ings of Confucius, especially the Classic of Filial Piety and the Analects, so it is hardly surprising when the Taoist sage skewers the pompous and scoffs at conventional assumptions about \"righteousness\" and \"benevolence.\" He was as devoted to what Carl Jung, more than two millennia later, called \"self-actualiza- tion\" or \"individuation\" as was Confucius to the ideal of social benevolence. In the centuries that followed, Taoism provided a balance to Confucianism, and the two teachings were blended in social philosophy. Buddhism eventually provided the third of the interlocking Three Systems (san chiao) that dominated Chinese thinking and social policy into the present century. The importance of Chuang Tzu is almost inestimable. He has been studied by every major Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Southeast Asian poet and philosopher of the past two thousand years. Li Po quotes him; Tu Fu turns to him for solace; BashO won't leave home without him. In the West, Ezra Pound, ever the Confucian, quarrels with him; Gary Snyder becomes his compan- ion. He is read for pleasure, for edification, and for sheer, unfet- tered delight. Given Chuang Tzu's convictions about language—specifically, that words have no absolute meanings except as can be mutually agreed on—and given his insistence on centering and spontaneity as the source of art and life, the book called Chuang Tzu must be xvi Translators' Introduction approached by the translator as a work of art presenting an enor- mous range of problems and possibilities. We have tried to de- velop a systematic approach to our translation in an effort to record and mirror Chuang Tzu's art, while trying hard not to try too hard. We have been as consistent as possible in the rendering of terms from one chapter to the next in order to reduce confusion, even though we know that little or none of the material following the \"Inner Chapters\" was composed by Chuang Tzu himself. His followers and companions knew him better than we can. When they use his vocabulary, it is usually with a clear and conspicuous purpose in mind. Thus we are convinced that where the English language context may call for variety in the rendering of a given term, consistency in translating such terms almost always pro- vides a greater depth, as well as a broader texture, allowing the recreation (in both senses of that word) of conscious irony. T'ien hsia, for instance, literally means \"beneath heaven\" and refers to \"the empire,\" the legal realm of the legitimate emperor or \"Son of Heaven.\" It is a consciously political term. But to Chuang Tzu it also meant \"the whole world,\" or \"all that is under the sky,\" or even \"the totality of phenomenal reality on earth.\" And in some contexts it is used to mean simply \"every- body.\" Other translators have used the state, the world, and so forth, depending on context. We've kept the set phrase All-under- heaven because we believe that, as in the original, its repetition in various contexts allows the ironic play between meanings such as \"the empire\" and plain old \"everybody\" to resonate, clar- ify, or magnify. Translating the terms t'ien, ti, and /en (heaven, earth, and people) presents another set of problems. T'ien, \"heaven,\" does not mean, as it might in folk religion, a place with angels and pearly gates and a white-bearded old granddaddy, and it doesn't suggest a god such as Yahweh. Nor can it be translated merely as laws of nature, or natural law, although that is part of its meaning. It may mean \"sky,\" or something like \"nature,\" or something like \"god.\" We have chosen to translate it literally xvii"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction as heaven, to allow for an accretion of meaning depending on context. fen, a simple two-stroke stick figure, is the Chinese character for \"person\" or \"humankind.\" Only in specific contexts does it mean \"male.\" It is also used in certain contexts to refer to all things artificial, that is, made by human hands. The three-word set t'ien, ti, and jen was, for Chuang Tzu, the denotation of a philosophical or even cosmological concept. Heaven is all yang, earth all yin, and humankind composed of a balance of the two. Together they were known as the Three Pow- ers, forces thought to rule human life and society and thus were considered in decision making at every level. This translation makes use of more etymological study than probably any previous version. Particularly in its early periods, when written vocabulary was limited and pictographic and ideo- graphic elements still outnumbered the less interesting, partly phonetic elements (that are 80 percent of modern characters), it is sometimes easier to see the range of meaning of a Chinese char- acter by analyzing its meaningful elements than by consulting a dictionary. For example, look up the characters hao and jen (a homonym of the aforementioned ten) and you will find \"good\" as the definition of each. Hao is a drawing of a woman with an infant, a perfectly eloquent and earthy word. fen, on the other hand, is an abbreviated human figure beside the number two, a wonderful abstraction meant to represent the way humans will or must treat one another because they are human—species soli- darity, a great idea first promoted to the level of philosophy by Confucius himself. Master Chuang, like the great T'ang poets who went to school on his work, clearly made artistic use of visual elements in writ- ten characters. Thus we have been required to pay attention to the semiological as well as the etymological aspects of his lan- guage. An author may create strong visual reinforcement for purely linguistic effects by choosing characters with pictorial el- ements that suit the theme, even when the meanings of the char- acters are not dependent on the particular pictorial element in Translators' Introduction question. To represent \" fecund moisture,\" for instance, one may choose characters—nouns, adjectives, verbs, and even pronouns and prepositions—that contain any of several representations of water: the full character for water, reduced in size and placed within, above, or beneath the main body of the \"new\" character; or three little dots, droplets of water, placed to the left; or even a broken line over a full line over a broken line, a graph that forms one of the eight trigrams of the I Ching. The famous poem \"Quiet Night,\" by the T'ang poet Li Po, uses only twenty written characters. But the poet includes two moon characters and four other moons: two in the repeated word bright, one in the preposition before (or in front of), and one hidden in the verb to gaze. Fully 30 percent of the words in the poem contain visual representations of the moon, an object and an image that is central to the theme of the poem. \"Quiet Night\" is a renowned tour de force, but the technique is not unusual. All the punning on feet that takes place in chapter 5 of Chuang Tzu is drawn di- rectly from the original, where the foot element is conspicuously present in a much higher proportion of characters than in any other chapter. (Feet, particularly amputated feet, remain a source of cautionary and faintly macabre humor throughout the book.) Where Master Chuang's language offers such resources, we, as translators, have received them gratefully. A dizzying array of literary techniques is brought to bear in the written composition of Chuang Tzu, particularly in the \"Inner Chapters.\" It remains nevertheless a compilation of verses, fa- bles, recorded conversations, and anecdotes in the classic oral tra- dition, tales meant as much to be listened to as studied textually. With this in mind, we have sought a prose style that will fall as naturally on the ear as good conversation, without sacrificing the elliptical or enigmatic qualities of the original. Master Chuang enjoyed rambling, so much so that he felt no need to bind this thought to that, this tale to that verse. Connections are there more often than not, but they are there to be discovered by the en- gaged reader.

His mind and writing are the mind and writing of a poet, whether in prose or in verse. Our translation is based on the text available in the Harvard- Yenching Concordance. The concordance itself was particularly useful in enabling us to check the frequency of use of certain pieces of vocabulary and even, with a little manipulation, the frequency of use of phonetic and signific elements that might have semiological significance. Without this great segment of the wonderful Harvard-Yenching Index Series, we would have had little to support our intuitions. We also made constant refer- ence to Weiger and Karlgren, the Shuo-wen, and the Harvard- Yenching Erh Ya, for etymologies; and Chinese and Japanese commentaries, particularly to Wang Shu-min's remarkably suc- cinct assemblage of text and commentaries, Chuang Tzu ch'iao ch'uan (Taipei, 1988). We also turned once again, with genuine pleasure, to the avail- able English translations, including the free poetic partial trans- lations of Thomas Merton and Martin Buber, the latter translated from the German by Jonathan Herman in I and Tao (State Uni- versity Press of New York, Albany, 1996). Any translator of this ancient text stands on the shoulders of, if not always giants, an at least slightly leaning tower of predecessors that includes both Chinese scholars and modern translators. Some have one leg shorter than the other, perhaps having lost a foot (or a footing) somewhere along the way. The text has been amazingly well maintained, and often brilliantly interpreted in both commen- taries and translations, which have aided us every step of the way.

When it is moved to fly, it soars all the way to the Southern Darkness, which is also called the Pool of Heaven. That honorable tome Best Laughs of Ch'i records many won- ders, including this: \"When the P'eng takes off for the Southern Darkness, the ocean's waves are beaten flat across a thousand miles or more.

A little water poured into a crack in the floor is enough to float a mustard seed, but place the cup in the water poured from it into that crack, and shallow water leaves it grounded. Likewise with the wind: when it's not strong, it can't help lift big wings. It takes a gale force wind of ninety thousand li for a P'eng to ride the wind, sky across its back, and nothing to hinder its southward journey. The cicada and the fledgling dove both laugh, saying, \"When we want to fly, we can easily reach the lower branches of small trees; or, if we fall short, we return to the ground. Why would anyone want to fly up thirty thousand miles and head south?\" For a hike in the woods near home, one usually takes along three meals and returns well fed. Traveling thirty miles, one grinds grain the night before departure; those who travel a thou- sand miles require three months' provisions. But a couple of wee- vils in the meal won't know the difference. Small understanding doesn't get to where great understanding gets. Youth doesn't know what age teaches. How do I know? The morning mushroom doesn't know dawn from dusk. The sum- mer cicada knows neither spring nor autumn. And so it is with youth. In Southern Ch'u, there is a tree called the Dark Spirit Tree. A full five hundred years is only a single spring to this tree, five hundred years merely a single autumn. In really ancient times, there was the Tachun tree that counted eight thousand years as one spring, another eight thousand for a single autumn. And yet Master P'eng, who lived a mere nineteen hundred years, is all one hears about these days. Everyone's just got to be like him! How pathetic! In T'ang's Interrogations of Ch'i, the story is repeated: \"In the bare bald north, there is a dark sea called the Pool of Heaven, in which there is a fish called K'un that is thousands of miles across and no-one-knows how long. And there is a bird called P'eng, 2 Free and Easy Wandering with a back like Mount T'ai and wings as broad as the clouds in the heavens. It flaps up hurricanes as it climbs thousands of miles, cutting through the very souls of clouds, lifting the blue sky. Then it turns south without resting until it arrives in the depths of the Southern Dark Sea.\" The sparrow, less than a foot in length, laughs, saying, \"Oh, that one! What does he think he's doing? A little hop and a flap and I'm up; a few yards and I'm down again. I flutter among weeds and brambles. Now that's flying to get where you're going! And that one! Just where does he think he's going?\" There's that dis- tinction between Great and Small! And it is equally true of the one who knows how to perform ef- ficiently at a certain official position, one whose behavior may serve as a model for neighbors, one whose powers may serve the needs of a certain lord, or even of a state. Such a person makes a self-assessment in the same way small creatures do. Master Sung Jung Tzu would burst out laughing. The whole world could prize him and he would work no harder; the whole world could call him wrong, and yet he would persist. He knows what is Inner and what is Outer; he knows the difference between true honor and disgrace. It's as simple as that. In this world, few can equal him when it comes to instinctively knowing and doing what is right. But despite his proximity to perfection, he has not yet attained the perfection of a tree. Lieh Tzu made the wind his chariot and traveled lightly and with considerable ease. How wonderful to travel fifteen full days before needing to return! Few in this world ever find a compara- ble happiness. And yet, despite successfully avoiding walking, he was nonetheless dependent.

When the clan gathered to discuss the offer, one man said, 'We've made this salve for generations and have noth- ing to show for it but a few pieces of gold. Now, in one morning, we can make a hundred. I say sell it.' The stranger bought the se- cret recipe. And off he went for an audience with the King of Wu. There was trouble with Yueh—as always—and he got himself ap- pointed general. That winter, they fought a great naval battle, ut- terly routing the Yueh people, and the salve helped the Wu navy crews. He was rewarded with a fiefdom drawn from Yueh terri- tory. So. In their ability to treat chapped hands, the stranger and the clan were equal. But one ended up with a fiefdom while oth- ers couldn't escape the bleach and labors of the silk trade. It's only a difference in use. \"Now you have five-bushel gourds. Why didn't you make a tub of one, or a boat to float on lakes and rivers? You complain that they were too awkward to use to hold anything, when in fact they already contained nothing. Your head's still stuck in the brambles!\" Hui Tzu sniffed and replied, \"I know a huge tree local folks call the trea, trunk so thick, so gnarled and knotty that the carpenter can't cut it for use, branches too twisted for compass or square. Although it stands beside a busy road, no carpenter ever gives it a second look. Your words are just as big, just as knotty and as worthless! Nobody has any use for them, either!\" Chuang Tzu laughed. \"Haven't you ever watched a wildcat or a weasel as it keeps low to the ground, bowing in wait for its prey before it leaps east or west, never avoiding high or low, only to end up snared in some hunter's net? But look at the yak: big as Free and Easy Wandering clouds in the sky, big enough to call huge, but useless when it comes to catching mice. \"Now you have this huge tree. You think it's terrible that no one can cut it for use. Why not let it be a tree?—in the Village of No-Thing, where the wilds spread out in every direction to- ward No-Place.

He looked out toward the heavens. His breath came softly, steadily. He appeared to have lost himself.

The man who leans here is not the one who did before.\" Tzu-ch'i replied, \"Dear Yen, it is good of you to ask. Just now, I lost myself. Could you tell? You've heard the piping of people, but not yet of the piping of earth; when you know the piping of earth, you will not yet have heard the piping of the heavens.\" \"I dare ask their secrets,\" Tzu-yu stated. Tzu-ch'i smiled. \"Well. Hmm. When the Great Clod belches, a prompt response may squelch it. But once begun, ten thousand holes emit an angry wail. Are you the only one who hasn't heard the roaring? In the high mountain forests there are huge trees—a 8 hundred feet around ringed with cavities, holes like noses, mouths, ears, like sockets or goblets, like mortars. Like babies, they begin with grunts and 'wah-wahs' and such. And then there are roars like the surf's, sounds like shouted orders, raging screams, growls and snarls. When a breeze comes up they call, 'H000,' and as the breezes pass they cry, 'Y000.' Small cold breezes make small harmonies; whirlwinds make great har- monies. And when the great winds pass, all the cavities and holes are filled with emptiness again. Have you alone not heard it, not seen things wavering, quivering, only to return to rest again?\" Tzu-yu said, \"So the piping of the earth comes from its many holes, just as the pipes and flutes we play come from varieties of bamboo. But may I be so bold as to inquire about the piping of the heavens?\" Tzu-ch'i said, \"It blows upon the ten thousand things, yet blows upon no two the same. It permits each to become itself, each choosing to be itself. But from whom, such a breath?\" G REAT UNDERSTANDING CUTS ITSELF OFF ANDS FALLS IDLE; small understanding grows lazier still. Big words can burst into flames and begin conflagrations; small words are mere chatter. The souls of sleepers may wander off in search of mates, but when awakened they ally themselves with all that is outer, their hearts wrestling with indecision, deceit, and seductions. Small fears unsettle the heart; great fears twist the bowels with indecision. Some souls fly off like arrows from the crossbow, turning every this and that into a \"right\" or a \"wrong.\" Some remain stuck like squatters guarding whatever it is they think they've won. They die like autumn into winter, dwindling like daylight in the late season. They drown in their own maneuverings. No one can help them rise and begin anew. Their own choices determine their op- pression.

Fungus sprouts in mustiness. Day and night follow each other. Who knows which came first or what are the sources of the sun and moon? Enough. Aren't they enough, sunrise and sunset? Are they not our progenitors? Without them, there is no I. Without \"I,\" there is no thing to cling. Although this knowledge is clear to me, I do not know what's responsible for making it so. It's as if there were such a thing as a True Lord, but I find no evidence of such—I can go forward believing, and yet I can find no such form. Is there fact without form? The hundred joints, the nine openings, the six vis- cera come from the womb and I, a child, exist. Which of these parts shall I then treat as one of my family? Will you speak up for all of them? You will have a favorite. If they are all your servants and handmaids, consider: are servants and maids sufficient to rule as governors? Can they all take turns at governance? Is there a True Lord among them? If I should seek to ascertain the facts of this and cannot, the facts remain unaffected. From the moment we first accomplish a form for ourselves, we cannot forget that we merely await its exhaustion. We raise our swords to fence with the things of this world or we waste them, as they waste us, like a horse raced into utter exhaustion. No one can stop us. Isn't it pathetic? Heartless? Winter comes, the string of our lives runs out, and we have slaved to accomplish an end we never see, hearts wasted in wearisome labors, never knowing a home we may return to. Isn't it pitiful? You may say, \"At least I' m not dead,\" but what good is that? Your form will change, and your heart with it. Can't we call this truly pitiful? But this is human life. Can it be lost among small weeds? Is it only I, myself, who am lost? Are others not equally lost? If you follow the dictates of an accomplished heart, you have found a teacher. And who can fail to find such a teacher? Must it be that only those who understand the cycles of succession choose the heart as their teacher? Fools, too, may do so. But to choose a right or wrong without an accomplished heart is like de- All Things Being Equal parting now for Yueh, only to arrive there long ago. This is con- fusing what does not exist with what does, trying to make some- thing from nothing. Even the great Sage Yu couldn't find a way to do that! How could I alone learn how this might be done? But words, words are not mere puffs of breath. Words speak. But if definitions have not already been agreed upon, can they really say anything? What differentiates words from the chirps of fledgling birds, if anything? Is there a difference? If the Tao remained obscured, how could we know the natural from the artificial? And if words are clouded, where is the \"right\" or the \"wrong\"? Tao! How could we go on without it? How can words exist and still be impossible? Tao is obscured by small \"ac- complishments\" in the same way words are obscured by rhetori- cal flourishes. Thus we arrive at the rights and wrongs of the Confucians and the Mohists: one takes the other's right as wrong and its wrong for right. If you want to right wrongs and wrong rights, nothing serves like the bright light of this sort of wisdom. There is no thing that is not that; there is no thing that is not this. That doesn't see itself as that. Self-knowledge precedes knowing others. So it's said, \"That arises out of this, but this is also caused by exactly that. This is the theory that this and that are born together.\" And al- though this is true enough, where there's birth, there's death; where there's death, birth. Where there's a possible, there is the i mpossible; with the impossible, the possible. Cause right and you cause wrong; cause wrong, cause right. Right? So be it. The sage doesn't belabor the point but stands revealed in clear daylight. He knows all this: that this is that and that is this, and he knows also that the that and the this make One of right and wrong. Does he still have a this and a that, or does he not have a this or that? When even This and That have lost all sense of themselves, we call it the Pivot of the Tao, and when the pivot is born into the middle of the great circle, it serves without end. What is so is eternally so; what is not is not forever. And they say, \"There is nothing like the light of wisdom.\" 11 1 0"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu To use a finger to make the point that a finger is not a finger is not as good as using a nonfinger to make the same point. To use a horse to prove that a horse is not a horse is not as good as to use a nonhorse to prove that a horse is not a horse. Heaven-and-earth is one finger. All ten thousand things are one horse. Okay? Not okay. Okay? Okay. Walk in the Tao. Accomplish it all. Say words, and they're so. How so? Is so? How not so? Not so so! There is no thing that is not acceptable. Sprouts rise up, and mighty pillars, lepers and lovely women, strange and extraordinary things in Tao they are one. To divide One is to \"accomplish,\" and whatever is accom- plished is destruction; whatever is unaccomplished cannot be destroyed: it is eternally beginning again at the beginning, One. Only those who have arrived know this coming-again-into-One. They do not make use of their knowledge but dwell in the diurnal, and every day is what is used. Who uses it, understands it. Who understands gets all that's needed—and time—and this is all. When one relies on this alone and doesn't know it's so, that is Tao. To exhaust the spirit and the mind by laboring to make things One, never realizing that they are all the same—I call this \"Three in the morning.\" Why \"Three in the morning\"? There was a monkey keeper who fed his monkeys nuts. When he said, \"I'll feed you three in the morning and four in the afternoon,\" the monkeys were furious. So he suggested, \"Four in the morning and three in the afternoon,\" much to the monkeys' delight. The words say the same thing, and yet one phrasing produced anger, another delight. The keeper simply made use of this knowledge. The sage brings what is into harmony with right-and-wrong and rests under the tree of the balance of nature. This is called going t wo ways at once. The ancients' knowledge was complete. How complete? There were some who refused to acknowledge that there were things. That complete. Nothing could be added to that. Then came some who acknowledged the existence of things but refused to dis- criminate among them; then some who discriminated but re- fused to label one \"right\" and another \"wrong\"; then right and All Things Being Equal wrong became matters of adjudication and Tao became deficient; and because Tao became deficient, those who loved the Tao came to attempt to \"accomplish\" things. But are there really such things as \"accomplishment\" and \"deficiency,\" or are there not? There are. As when Chao Wen played the lute. And there are not. As when Chao Wen did not play the lute. Chao Wen's lute, music master Kuang and his baton, Hui Tzu leaning on the Wu tree: how much these three learned! All so mastered their respec- tive arts that we still remember them today. What they cared for they differentiated, they made a \"that\" of it. What they cared for they desired to illuminate, but that was not the illumination of enlightenment. So we are left with Hui Tzu's obscure arguments about \"hardness\" and \"whiteness\" and Wen's disciples who ran out his string and their own as well—and accomplished noth- ing. Or perhaps they did accomplish something. If so, so have I. And if this is not \"accomplishment,\" then neither \"things\" nor I have ever accomplished anything. For this reason, blazing chaos is the light that guides the sage. Rather than merely using things, the sage dwells in the ordinary. This may be called illumination. N OW I WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS. WHETHER THEY ARE THE right or wrong kind of words, they are at least some kind of words, and are no different than the words of others, so they're just okay. But please permit me to say them.

There is not yet beginning to be not yet beginning to be being. Oh, suddenly there's being and not being. Now I just had my say. But I don't know whether my saying has said anything or nothing.

Going on like this, even the most clever calculationist would never be done with it! Much less the rest of us. So: if by going from nothing to something we arrive at three, how much more might we get by going from something to something? Don't be going from anywhere to anywhere. Here is where it is! Before Tao was subjected to discriminations, words had not yet come to have precise definitions. But once \"right\" was distin- guished, boundaries became defined. Let me say this about boun- daries: there is a left and a right; there is sorting and assessment; there is division and discrimination; there is competition and conflict—the philosophers called these the Eight Virtues! Beyond the Six Realms, the sage embodies childlike clarity: he doesn't try to sort things out. Within the Six Realms, he sorts, but does not assess. On the true motives of former emperors as they are presented in the Annals and Classics, he assesses, but does not discriminate. There are things the dividers cannot divide, things discriminators cannot discriminate. \" What things?\"—the sage embraces things, though throngs of men discriminate among them and make a great show of their discrimination. Therefore I say, \"Those who discriminate can- not see.\" The Great Tao has no title. Great discrimination has no words. Great compassion is not compassionate. Great modesty is re- served. Great courage is not aggressive. The Tao that shines forth is not Tao. Discriminating words never reach their mark. Com- passion may be constant and yet accomplish nothing. Purity may be met with disbelief. Aggressive courage gets nothing done. These five fall within the circle, but tend to wander off .. . Therefore: he who knows enough to stop at what he does not know is there. That's all. Who knows the wordless explanation All Things Being Equal and Tao that is not Tao? Know this and become the Storehouse of Heaven: where things may be put but never fill; where things may be taken yet never depleted. Yet he himself does not know why or how. He will be called the Pao-kuang Star, tip of the Dip- per's handle, forever cycling slowly around the center, predicting coming seasons. M.R.

Monkeys mate with monkeys, bucks with doe, fish with fish. All men consider Mao Chiang and Lady Li to be eternal beauties, but when fish see them, they dive quickly to the bottom; when birds see them, they fly off; and when deer see them, they bolt and run.

If the Great Swamp dried up and burned, he wouldn't feel the heat; if the great river froze, he wouldn't feel the chill; if fierce ex- plosions sundered the mountains and storms disrupted the seas, he wouldn't even be startled. It's his nature to rise on clouds in the air and straddle sun and moon, to wander beyond the four en- closing seas. Neither life nor death can change him, so how could puny things like profit and loss affect him?\" Chu the Magpie said to Mr. Tall Wu Tree, \"The great master says he does not take charge of worldly affairs; he neither pursues profit nor avoids loss. He doesn't enjoy seeking. He isn't married to the Tao. He makes pronouncements without speaking; speak- ing, he says nothing. He rambles beyond the dirt and dust of this world.

Who dreams of drinking the wine of luxury may wake weeping in the sunrise. Who dreams of weeping may at dawn take up the hunt. As they dreamed, they didn't know that they were dreaming.

Tell me.\" Yen Hui said, \"I will be principled and selfless, constrained and unified in purpose. Will that do?\" \"It will not do. The prince is full of yang and loves to show off. He's inclined toward pleasures of the flesh and is very unstable. Ordinary people dare deny him nothing. He takes from others what they hold most dear in order to force their submission to his will. Can't you see? He is incapable of practicing even the most simple, ordinary manners. Is it likely he'll find the Power of True Virtue? He will cling to his own ways, refusing to change. He may outwardly accept your advice, but inwardly he will not. How could such a vulgar course lead to success?\" \"Well then,\" Yen Hui replied, \"what if I'm inwardly straight but outwardly crooked, and whatever I do, I support it by citing the precedents of the ancients? Whoever is straight within is a companion of nature. Whoever is a companion of nature is a Son of Heaven and knows that he and the emperor are both Sons of Heaven equally. So I would have no need to seek praise for the 'goodness' of my words, nor any fear of reproach. If I can act just so, people will call me an innocent child. That is what I mean by being a companion of nature. \"Those who are crooked on the outside are the companions of men. Bowing and scraping, making the body crooked, these are merely the good manners of ministers at court. Men all act this way. Who does as others do avoids blame. This is what I mean by being the companion of men. And supporting whatever I do by citing the ancients is simply being a companion of the ancients. Although my words may instruct or reprimand, they are the words of the ancients, not my own. If I manage things just so, although I am upright, I will not be blamed. This is what I mean by being a companion of the ancients. If I can be just so, will that work?\" \"It will not,\" Confucius replied. \"It will not work. You have here a grand multiplicity of methods, none of which is really ap- propriate. If you manage to stay firmly within them, you may wiggle your way out of mutilation, but even so, that's as far as you'll get. What's to get him to change? In your heart, you're still too much the preacher.\" \"I can't get any farther,\" Yen Hui said. \"May I ask what meth- ods you'd employ?\" \"Fast,\" Confucius said, \"and then I'll tell you. But having the method is one thing, carrying it out is another. Will it be easy? Whoever thinks it might be easy is surely unsuited to the task.\" \"My family is practically penniless,\" Yen Hui said. \"I haven't tasted wine or spiced meat in months. Does that count as fasting?\" \"That's fasting for a sacrifice, not the fasting of heart and mind.\" \"May I ask then about the fasting of heart and mind?\" \"Set your heart and mind on the One,\" Confucius replied. \"Don't listen with your ear; listen with your heart and mind. Then stop listening with your heart and mind and listen with your ch'i, the very energy of your being. Hearing stops with the ear. Heart and mind stop with words and symbols. The ch'i is empty. Being so, it is able to attend upon all phenomena. Tao 25 24"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"In the Human World THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu comes to roost in emptiness. This emptiness is the fasting of the mind.\" When next they met, Yen Hui said, \"Before I tried it, I was still Hui. Now that I've gotten it, I'm not sure there's a beginning to be a Hui. Is this what you call emptiness?\" \"The whole thing.\" Confucius paused. \"Now I can say to you, you may enter and go rambling around in that cage of his and yet remain untouched by fame and honors. If the prince calls you to an audience, sing like a bird. If he does not, be silent. Where there is no gate, no evil can enter. Make the One your home and dwell there when there's nothing else you can do. Then you'll be close to really being there. To stop leaving tracks is easy; but to walk without touching the ground is difficult. In the service of men, it's easy to be false; in the service of nature, it's difficult. You have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without them. You have heard of those who know with knowledge, but never of the knowing that is without knowledge. In the empty chamber, the light lives on. There, good fortune and blessings stop and remain still. And if you don't stop, that's what's called meditating on horseback—where the body sits while the mind races on. If you keep eye and ear connected to what's inside, and keep heart and mind and knowledge outside, the very spirits of earth and air will throng to dwell within you, and how much more will mere men then be drawn to you? This is the ten thousand things, ever- changing. It is the bond shared by Yu and Shun, the practice of Fu Hsi and Chi Ch'u from beginning to end. And how much more does it deserve to be spread among ordinary people?\" T HE DUKE OF SHE, Tzu KAO, WAS ABOUT TO DEPART ON A mission to the state of Ch'i. He consulted Confucius, saying, \"The king has charged me with a heavy responsibility. Ch'i will most likely make a great show of respect but be in no hurry to do anything more. You can't just push even an ordinary man into doing things. How much more true must that be when one is dealing with a feudal lord? I'm deeply afraid. You've often told me that whether the affair is great or small, except by following the Tao, few reach full completion. If you don't achieve your goal, you'll suffer gossip. If you do, you'll suffer from the inevitable shifting balance of yin and yang. The ability to not suffer, regard- less of succeeding or not succeeding—only the possessor of the Power of Virtue can attain that. You know I eat only plain food, so there's no need for cooling remedies in my larder. Well, this morning I received my orders, and this evening I'm drinking ice water. It's as if my insides were cooking. I haven't even got to the substance of my task yet and I'm already suffering from the im- balance of yin and yang! If I fail, everyone will condemn me. As a minister, I just don't have sufficient footing to undertake this em- bassy. Is there something you can tell me?\" \"In All-under-heaven,\" Confucius replied, \"there are but two Great Precepts: one is destiny, the other duty. That a child loves its parents is destiny: there is no cutting free of heart and mind from this. That a minister must serve his sovereign is duty: there is no place you can go, no place you can flee to in this world of men where there is no ruler. Thus these are called the Great Precepts. \"To serve your parents willingly and to dwell wherever they choose is the ultimate goal in filial devotion. In serving one's lord, to accept whatever charge one is given and go wherever it leads— that is truly fulsome loyalty. To serve your own heart and mind so that neither sadness nor joy comes too easily to the fore, to know what you can't change and accept it as destined—that is getting on toward the Power of Virtue. \"Whoever serves another as a minister of state,\" Confucius said, \"will often fail to gain his own satisfaction. He will do what is actually to be done, and forget himself. What time will he have for loving life or hating death? I think you are ready for that sort of service now. \"But I have something else to tell you, too. Whenever relations are between those who live close to each other, there will be mu- tual trust on the basis of physical familiarity.

Whether words are pleasing to both sides or whether they are angering, this can be one of the most difficult tasks in the world. If the message is mutually pleasing, there will be a tendency to pretty it up. If the message stirs anger, there'll be a tendency to exaggerate the conflict. Whatever even appears exaggerated in any way is foolish and reckless. Where there is recklessness, will there be trust? When there is no trust, even the messenger is in danger. That's why the Fa-yen says, 'Communicate the plain facts; don't embellish them when you speak.' Follow that advice, and you'll get out whole. \" When men test one another at martial feats, things always start out sunny bright yang, but often quickly turn cloudy dark yin, and then they bring all their most devious arts to bear. Like men who begin drinking wine in full accord with ceremony, they start out in good order but all too soon begin to be disorderly. And they usually end up with all sorts of lewdness. So it goes with other affairs as well,\" Confucius continued. \"What begins in sin- cerity may end up in duplicity. What begins small and simple may become large and complicated before it's through. The speaker is like a man on stormy waters: his course may lead to success or to doom. Stormy waters move with changes. Success and failure walk the cliff's edge of change as well. Thus anger may seem to arise without cause. First there may be clever speeches and slanted phrases, then, like wild beasts squealing, shrieking in rage, roaring in death throes, all raw and unformed their very ch'i may come rushing out. Once both sides are enraged, the seeds of destruction are close at hand. \"Response and rejoinder will come from hearts and minds made inhuman, and they themselves won't even know that it is so. When you act without knowing why you are acting, who can tell where things will end? That's why the Fa-yen says, 'Don't stray from orders. Don't press for a quick conclusion. Going be- yond these limits is going to excess. Going beyond your commis- sion to reach a settlement is a dangerous thing.' A nice job may take time. A bad job may take forever to repair. Can you be otherwise than careful? Just take advantage of things as they are. Let your heart and mind roam free. Accept what you can't get and nourish your center on that acceptance. Then you're there. That's all. What else is required? Nothing but that you be willing to act in accord with your own destiny, even if that means going to your death. This is the only difficulty.\" W HEN YEN Ho WAS ABOUT TO BECOME TUTOR TO THE Crown Prince, son of Duke Ling of Wei, he went to seek counsel from Ch'u Po-yu, saying, \"We have one here who seems to be a natural- born killer. If I can't bring him to heel, I fear for the whole coun- try; but if I try to bring him to heel, I'll be walking the edge of the precipice myself. He knows enough to recognize the faults of oth- ers, but not enough to recognize his own. This being so, what can I do?\" \"Good question,\" Ch'u Po-yu replied. \"Go well armed with caution. Make yourself just like a woman, let your form conform while heart and mind find harmony. And although it may be han- dled just so, there is still a present danger, as with dual loyalties. Don't let your conformity become too deeply internalized nor let your inner harmony become too apparent or you'll fall into certain ruin, you'll crumble and perish. If your inner harmony becomes too obvious, you'll be talked about, and as your fame grows so will your blame, and you will eventually be seen as evil.

Large enough to shade thousands of oxen, it was a hun- dred spans around and rose high as a mountain, it lowest branches some eighty feet above the ground. More than a dozen of these lower branches were large enough to be hollowed out into boats. Sightseers were packed together like at the marketplace. Woodworker Stone barely gave it a glance, continuing along his way without looking back. But his apprentices couldn't keep from gawking, then had to run to catch up. One said, \"Since we took up our axes to follow you, Master, we've never seen such beautiful material. But you didn't give it a second look! You went right on by. How can this be?\" \"Enough!\" Stone cried. \"Don't talk about it. That wood is trash. Make a boat from it and the boat will sink. For coffins, it rots too fast. For utensils, it's too brittle. It seeps too much sap to use for a gate or door. Make a pillar, and it will attract worms. It's not good timber for anything. It can't be used. That's how it got so old.\" After the woodworker returned home, the great tree appeared to him in a dream, saying, \"You compare me to cultivated trees, the hawthorne, the pear, the orange, all the shrubs and trees that bear fruit? When their fruit is ripe they're stripped, peeled, and generally abused, big branches broken off, little ones dripping sap from wounds. They have a wonderful ability to make a miserable life of usefulness. The string of their days and years cut off, they are beaten and torn up by unruly saps. So it is for all things in the world. That's why I strive to master the arts of uselessness. Al- though it nearly killed me, I've got it now. It's really useful to me. If I were of any use, do you suppose there'd be any chance for me to have grown so large? You and I are both things. Why pass judg- ment? You're a man born to die. Are you mere trash? Why call me trash?\" When the woodworker Stone awakened, he told his apprentices about his dream. \"If it's trying so hard to be useless, why has it become a shrine?\" they wanted to know. \" That's a secret,\" Stone replied. \"Don't mention it to anyone. It's just pretending. This way it can also be protected from people who don't appreciate uselessness. If it weren't portraying a shrine, it might still be cut down and cut up.

Summer and winter, forever green. Of all those who have taken their lives from the sky above, only Yao and Shun could stay still at the One.

When men got close to him, their thoughts were always on him, and they could never leave. When women saw him, they pleaded with their parents, 'Rather than becoming the head wife of any other man, I would be this man's concubine!' This has happened at least ten times already. And yet no one has ever heard him take the lead part. He always assumes the harmony behind the voices of others. He didn't have a government office that gave him the power of life and death over people, nor a full storehouse to appeal to people's bellies. And as I said, he was ugly enough to amaze All-under- heaven. All he did was sing harmony. He didn't know anything about anything, but right where he was. Yet men and women flocked together like geese around him. \"I thought he must be an extraordinary man, so I called for him 37 3 6"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu and had a look for myself. He was frighteningly ugly! But I kept him around, and it was barely a month before I began to get some idea of him as a man. In less than a year, he had my full faith. I had no chief minister then, so I offered him the reins of the state. Be- fore answering, he moped around as if he were going to beg off, which made me feel ashamed. But I persisted and handed the gov- ernment of my realm to him. Then, in no time at all, he simply left me. I was cut to the quick, as if I'd lost my very realm, as if there were no one with whom I could share the enjoyments of the kingdom. Just what sort of person was he?\" Confucius replied, \"Once when I was on a mission in the state of Ch'u, I saw piglets suckling their dead mother. After a while, looking startled, they ran off. They could no longer see them- selves, or even their own kind, in her. Love for the mother is not a matter of form; it is a matter of what creates that form. If a man dies in battle, he won't mind if he's buried without decorations. When a man has no feet, he has no reason to love shoes. In both cases, they have lost the root of love. That's a radical loss. \"Those who will be consorts of the Son of Heaven do not pare their nails or pierce their ears. A man who takes a wife is allowed to stay outside the court, freed from official duties. If a whole body is enough to put one on such a special footing, how much more exalted must be the position of one whose power of virtue is entirely intact? \"Now this Horse-face Ai of yours: before he spoke a word, men trusted his word. Without any merit earned, he was cherished. He caused people to hand over their states to him, their only fear being that he might decline. He must have been one whose talent was perfect, the power of whose virtue was without form.\" \"What do you mean by 'perfect talent'?\" Duke Ai wanted to know. \"Death and life,\" Confucius said, \"persisting and perishing, ex- haustion and completion, poverty and wealth, worthiness and worthlessness, blame and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—the alternation of these things is the work of destiny. Day and night, they roll on, and 'knowing' can't even see back to their The Sign and Seal of the Power of Virtue birth. Therefore they haven't sufficient footing to muddle the harmony. There is nowhere for them in the storehouse of the spirit. Let your mind be in harmony. Take delight. Understand. Never let joy be lost, day or night, ceaselessly, eternally in the springtime of things, always connecting, making the very seasons come alive within your heart and mind. This is what I mean when I speak of perfect talent.\" \"What do you mean when you speak of the power of his virtue being without form?\" \"At peace, like still water and its fullness. To go as water is the method. To keep guarded what is within, so that it is not easily ruffled by anything outside. The Power of Virtue lives in the ac- complishment of such perfect harmony, and when the Power of Virtue is without form, nothing can be separate from it\" Later, Duke Ai spoke to Min Tzu about it. \"I used to sit facing south and lord it over All-under-heaven,\" he said. \"I held the reins of the people and was anxious for their lives. I thought I un- derstood everything. Now that I've heard the words of someone who is really there, I' m afraid I didn't really have the facts.

He goes as nature goes, and seeks no benefit from life.\" \"If he takes no benefit from life, \" Hui Tzu asked, \"how can he have a body?\" \"The Tao provides his figure, heaven his form. There is no good nor had to harm his body,\" Chuang Tzu said. \"You, now! You put your spirit aside and belabor your vital essence: \"Leaning on your tree, you mumble; Propped on your desk, you doze. Heaven gave you form, all right, And you waste it all just warbling On and on about hard and white.\" The Great Ancestral Teacher [CHAPTER 6] f HOSE WHO KNOW HEAVEN AND KNOW HUMANKIND ARE there. ] l Those who know heaven know heaven gives one life. Who- ever knows humankind uses knowing to nurture what cannot be known. They will run out the string of their years and not find it cut off in the middle. This is the fullest knowledge. And yet, though this is so, there is a problem: knowledge waits on cer- tainty, but certainty is never quite certain. How can I know that what I call \"heaven\" is not really \"humankind,\" or that what I call \"humankind\" is not really \"heaven\"? Only when there is one who is truly human can there be True Knowledge. What is a true human? The True Ones of antiquity didn't reject being solitary, didn't crow about accomplishments, and didn't lay plans. Just so! When they failed, they 4elt no regret. When they succeeded, they didn't grow self-satisfied. Just so! They climbed high without fear. They went into the water without sinking. 41 40"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu They went into fire without feeling the heat. This is how close their knowledge had risen toward the Way. The True Ones pf antiquity slept without dreams and awak- ened without anxiety. They did not need to sweeten what they ate. They breathed deep. The True One breathes from the heels; ordinary people breathe from their throats. The crooked retch up their words like vomit. In those whose lusts are deep, the motion of heaven is shallow. The True Ones of antiquity didn't know to take joy from life, didn't know to despise death. Coming forth, they didn't rejoice; going hack, they did not resist. Gone suddenly on the wing, or coming on the wing, that's all. Never forgetting the womb we spring from, they face the win- ter wherein their strings will end. Receiving and enjoying, forget- ting and beginning again, this is what is called \"not letting the heart and mind devour the Way, not letting humankind 'help' heaven.\" This is what I mean when I say, \"True Human.\" Because people are so, heart and mind let go, their faces grow quiet, their brows calm. They are cool as autumn, warm as spring. Knowing joy and anger like the circling seasons, people know the potency of all things. There is no knowing their limits. Thus, when the sage of old raised armies, he might lose his land, but never the hearts and minds of his people. He anointed ten thou- sand generations with his bounty, but not merely for the affection of the people. Those who delighted in bringing success to things were not sages. Those who felt affection were not truly benevolent. Those who acted at the appointed times were not worthy. Those who could not reconcile damage and advantage were not princes. Those who lost their bodies in the search for fame were not knights. And those who lost their bodies without regard for the True? They weren't even fit to be lackeys. Famous men like Hu Pu-hsieh, Wu Kuang, Po Yi, Shu Ch'i, Chi Tzu, Hsu Yu, Chi T'o and Shen-t'u Ti were the lackeys of lackeys. They strove to achieve others' ends, never achieving their own. The True One of antiquity was a lonely peak standing apart from the crumbling range, a solitary figure who didn't need to The Great Ancestral Teacher form a \"party.\" Seeming always to lack, the True One accepted nothing, standing four-square without being rigid, being plain rather than flashy, smiling as if happy, but quick to do what he had no choice but to do. What gathered within the True One put a glow on the face. What he gave did not go beyond the power of his virtue. He could be harsh as any in his world, arrogant and un- controllable, a hard man, heart gone elsewhere, words forgotten. He took punishment to be the body, ritual to be the wings. He took knowledge as timeliness, and the Power of Virtue as his only force. Taking punishment as the body, he was kind when he had to kill. Taking ritual as wings, he moved freely in his world. Tak- ing knowledge as timeliness, he saw that there were times when he had no choice but to act. Seeing the Power of Virtue as his only power, he was one whose own two feet were sufficient to get to the top of any hill. Yet people persisted in thinking he worked hard to get there. What he loves is One. What he doesn't love is One. What he takes as One is One. What he doesn't take as One is One. What is at one is the companion of heaven. What is not at one is the companion of humanity. When neither heaven nor humankind is victor or vanquished, we find what is meant by the True Human. Life and death are fate. They are constant as dawn and dark. This is \"heaven.\" Humankind has those things it cannot have: this is all in the fact of things, the way things are. These things all have heaven as a progenitor and all embrace it. How much more shall they embrace that which is greater? People accept their princes as their superiors and lay down their lives for them. How much more shall they be willing to die for that which is true? When the source runs dry and fish are stranded on dry ground, together they will breathe moisture on one another and wet one another with their spit. But how much more would they enjoy forgetting each other in a river or a lake? Rather than praising Yao as a sage or cursing Chieh as a tyrant, it is better to forget them both and enter the flow of the Way.

If I take life as good, I must therefore take death as equally good. You may sink your boat in a creek, hiding it as well as a moun- tain may be hidden in the mist, and call it safe. Then some mid- night a strong man comes along and loads it on his back and off it goes. Completely in the dark, some still don't see that although you can hide the small within the large, there may still be things that get lost. But if you hide All-under-heaven within All-under- heaven, there's nothing to get lost. This is the great fact that dawns from the heart of things. Yet you will dare to try on a human form, already in itself so close to punishment, and still you will seek joy there. But having that form, ten thousand changes will come and go before you even begin to know an end. Can there be a victor here in the quest for that joy? So the sage of old wandered in a world of things that can never be lost, and dwelt there like an infant. Living long is a good; dying young is a good. Springing from the womb is a good; running out the string in the winter of life is a good. All people take him as a model. How much more so may they take as a model the string that runs through the ten thousand things, that which all and every single change awaits? The Way is of fact and faith. Yet it does not act. It has no form. It can be passed on, but it can't be re- ceived. It can be gotten, but it can't be seen. It is its own root, its own branch. Before there were heaven and earth, from the begin- ning within the beginning, solid as an infant, it was. It gave spirit to the spirits, spirit to the gods. It is beyond the Great Ultimate Poles, the T'ai Chi, and yet not high. Beneath all the Six Direc- tions, it is not deep. It is longer than antiquity itself, yet it is not old. Hsi Wei got it, and drew the line between heaven and earth. Fu Hsi got it, and united with the Breath Mother. The Dipper got it and from the earliest times has turned unerringly. The sun and moon got it and have never rested. K'an P'i got it and united with K'un Lun. Ping Yi got it and explored the Great River. Chien Wu got it and made his dwelling in the Great Mountain. The Yellow Emperor got it and rose into the cloudy heavens. Chuan Hsu got The Great Ancestral Teacher it and dwelt in the Palace of Mysteries. Yu-chiang got it and took his stand at the Northernmost Pole. The Queen Mother of the West got it and made her seat at Shao-kuang. There is no know- ing her beginning, nor knowing her end. Peng Tzu got it and lived from the time of Shun to the time of the Five Lords. Fu Yueh got it, and after he was minister to the Warlike Ting, who made All- under-heaven his own, he made the Eastern Anchor Point his chariot, and straddling the Basket and the Tail, took his place among the constellations.

How can this be?\" \"I've heard the Way, that's all.\" Nan-p'o Tzu-k'uei said, \"May I study the Way with you?\" \"Oh, no! No way. You're not the man for it. There was Pu-liang Yi,\" she said. \"He had the talent to make a sage, but not the Way. I have the Way of the Sage, but not the talent. I wanted to teach him. You'd think I could have made him bear the fruit of sage- hood. But it wasn't so. To deal with the talents of a sage through the Way of the Sage also depends upon changes. But I kept at it, showing by not showing, and after three days in the cocoon of meditation, he was able to put All-under-heaven outside him. Once he could put it all outside himself, I stayed with him, and in seven days he was able to put things outside himself. Once he was able to put things outside him, I stayed with him, and in nine days he could put life outside him. Once he could put life outside him, it dawned on him, and in the light of that dawn, he could see that he was alone. When he saw that he was alone, he knew past and present as nothing, and knowing past and present as nothing, he was able to enter into no-death/no-life, to see that what kills life is not death, that what lives life is not life.

Without a doubt in heart or mind, they became fast friends. Then, suddenly, Tzu Yu fell ill. Tzu Ssu went to inquire after him. \"Isn't it amazing, \" Tzu Yu cried. \"The creator of things is twisting me like this—a crooked hump for a back, my guts on top, my chin hiding out in my navel, my shoulders higher than my head, and my neck bones pointing toward heaven! The ch'i of my yin and yang is as messed up as wet feathers!\" But with heart and mind unconcerned, he wobbled to the well and peered in. \"Oh,\" he said, \"the creator of things is making me all twisted.\" Tzu Ssu asked, \"Don't you hate it?\" \"Perish the thought! How could I hate it? It may well turn my left arm into a rooster. Then I can keep watch in the night. It may well turn my right arm into a crossbow bolt, and then I'll have owl to roast. It may well turn my buttocks into wheels, and then, with my spirit for a horse, I'll never have need for a carriage. The Great Ancestral Teacher \"I got my life,\" Tzu Yu continued, \" when the season came. I lose it as it flows away. I'm at peace with the seasons, and dwell in their flow where neither sorrow nor joy can enter. In the old days, they called this 'cutting free from the noose.' If you can't cut yourself free, things will knot you up. But things have never been victorious against heaven. What is there to hate?\" Then Tzu Lai suddenly fell ill, his lungs rasping at the edge of death. His wife and children gathered about him wailing and weeping. Tzu Li, who had come to ask after him, cried, \"Shoo! Get out! Don't interrupt the change that is dawning in him.\" Then he leaned in the doorway and said to Tzu Lai, \"Isn't this amazing! Creation! Change! What will it do with you? Where will it go with you? Will it make you a rat's liver or a bug's elbow?\" Tzu Lai replied, \"When father and mother tell their son to go east or west or north or south, their wish is his command. Yin and yang are surely no less than parents to a man. They have urged me on toward death. If I refuse to listen, am I not merely one who can't recognize the dawn? What fault of theirs would that be? \"The Great Clod loaded me down with this form,\" he contin- ued, \"and burdened me with life.

So they were friends together. Quietly, an idle moment passed. Then Tzu Sang Hu died. He hadn't been buried when Confucius heard of it and sent Tzu Kung to help with ceremonies. Tzu Kung found one of the friends weaving frames for the molting of the silkworm cocoons while the other played a lute. The two harmonized, singing: \"Oh, Sang Hu came; oh, Sang Hu came! Now he's gone back to being what he truly is, While we must go on being human!\" Tzu Kung rushed in, asking, \"May I dare to ask how you can be singing in the presence of the corpse? \" The two looked at him. \"What does this one know about the meaning of ritual?\" Tzu Kung returned to report to Confucius. \"What sort of men are these? They know no discipline at all, putting even the bones of the ceremony aside. They sat beside the corpse and sang, with no expression on their faces. I don't know what to call them. What sort of men are these?\" Confucius said, \"They ramble outside the boundaries. I ramble within. Within and without—the twain shall never meet. My sending you to offer condolences was crude. They are coeval with that which creates and changes, and they wander the single ch'i of heaven and earth. For them, life is a tumor, a growth hanging from them with death as its only excision. They forget their own livers and gall bladders and leave even their eyes and ears behind. They reverse the wintry end and the womb of beginning. They haven't a clue. Blindly, they make their imperial progress beyond the dusty realm, wandering toward the cause of nondoing. Why should they make a show of vulgar ceremony for the eyes and ears of the common herd?\" The Great Ancestral Teacher Tzu Kung asked, \"Why then, Master, do you remain within these boundaries?\" \"I am one,\" the master said, \"whom heaven condemned to go with clipped wings. And you, too.\" \"Tell me more about boundaries.\" \"Fish were created together with the waters,\" Confucius said. \"People were created together with the Way. What is at one with water goes deep in a pool and finds all its needs fulfilled. What is at one with the Way, having no duties, lives a settled life. So it is said, 'Fish forget one another in the rivers and lakes; people forget one another in the arts of the Way.\" \"What about people,\" Tzu Kung wanted to know, \"who don't fit within boundaries?\" \"Misfits,\" Confucius said. \"Misfits are those who don't fit within humanity's boundaries, but nevertheless fit exactly within heaven's. The small man of heaven is a prince among men. Humanity's princes are the petty men of heaven.\" Yen Hui asked, \"When the mother of Meng-sun Ts'ai died, he wailed in mourning but without tears.

Al- though he failed at all three, he is nevertheless considered a model of true mourning throughout the state of Lu. Can there re- ally be one who can't get any real substance, but can still win a good name?\" \"Meng-sun did it all,\" Confucius said. \"He got out ahead of 'knowing.' There are things that he would have simplified, but couldn't, but he simplified quite a bit. Meng-sun doesn't know the why of life nor the why of death. He doesn't know what comes before and what comes after. He's almost changed into a thing, and he's just waiting for his not-knowing to change.

How could you still go wandering without direction, following any random path?\" \"Although that maybe so,\" Yi-erh Tzu said, \"might I not ram- ble around the edges?\" \"Won't work!\" Hsu Yu declared. \"A blind man can't see the eyes in a beautiful face.

What I saw before was just the blockage of his energy.\" Lieh Tzu entered and reported this to Master Winepot. \"This time,\" Master Winepot said, \"I showed him my Heav- enly Field, where neither appearance nor substance enters and the workings come straight from my heels. He most likely saw 'the good' at work. Bring him around again.\" When Lieh Tzu brought the medium once again, he emerged saying, \"Your master is inconsistent. I can't read anything from his face. Get him to straighten up, and I'll give him a reading.\" Lieh Tzu reported this to Master Winepot, who replied, \"I've just shown him the Great Unconquerable Liquid Centering. He most likely saw the workings of my ch'i coming into balance. Where the water in the wake of a Great Sea Creature makes a whirlpool. Stop up water and it makes a whirlpool; let the water flow and it makes a whirlpool. There are nine kinds of whirlpools. I have three dwelling here in my Great Liquid Center.

Lieh Tzu followed but couldn't catch up to him. Eventually he returned and reported to Master Winepot, \"He's gone. I couldn't catch up and now I've lost him.\" \"This time,\" Master Winepot said, \"I showed him my ancestral Answers for Emperors and Kings teacher before it began to begin.

He did all the chores for his wife and fed the pigs as if they were people. He showed no affection for the affairs of the world, giving up the os- tentatious for the plain.

But those whose sight is extra bright are confused by the five colors, made depraved by artful decoration and by the bright blue-greens and yellows of shining brocade garments. Am I wrong? Look at Li Chu. And those whose hearing is extra keen are confused by the five notes, and made depraved by the six tones and the sounds of metal, stone, silk, and bamboo in the high ceremonial songs \"Yel- low Bell\" and \"Ta Lu.\" Am I wrong? Consider Shih Kuang. People with an extra finger of \"benevolence\" pluck at their virtues and finger their nature just to hear the sounds of their own names, making All-under-heaven march to the fife and drum of the method that just doesn't make it. Am I wrong? Look at Tseng Tzu and Shih. And people with the webbed toes of rhetoric just heap up bricks and knot together rat-tails of argument, rambling among \"hard\" and \"white,\" \"same\" and \"different,\" for no more than a mo- ment's reputation. Am I wrong? So much for Yang Chu and Mo Tzu. All these share Ways that are no more than extra fingers and webbed toes. None of them is about to set All-under-heaven straight. One who wants to set things straight can't lose sight of the facts of nature and destiny. For one like this, what's united is not webbed, what stands apart is not extra, what's long knows no ex- cess, and what's short is not without sufficient footing. The duck's legs are short, but if you stretch them, he'll be anxious. The crane's legs are long, but if you shorten them, he'll be sad. It's just so with nature: the long has nothing to be broken off; the short, nothing to be drawn out. And there is no reason to grieve. If \"benevolence\" and \"righteousness\" are not facts of human- ness, how much sadness do \"men of benevolence\" bring about? Cutting apart webbed toes brings on weeping. Gnaw off that extra finger and there will be howls. Perhaps the webbing leaves you with too few toes, the sprouting with too many fingers, but alter- ation results in common grief. In these times, \"people of benevolence\" stand with glazed eyes gazing out upon the calamity of this world of grief, while those who aren't benevolent bite off the facts of nature and destiny to get wealth and status. Therefore I say, \"benevolence\" and \"right- 59 5 8"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu eousness\" are not facts. Yet from the time of the Three Dynasties, what a clamor, oh, what a clamor they've caused! Those who wait for the curve, the line, the compass and the square to set things straight are paring away at their own nature. Those who use cords to bind and glue to stick things firmly are making inroads into the power of their virtue. Those who bow and scrape to ceremonial ritual and music and prattle on about \"benevolence\" and \"righteousness\" in an effort to satisfy the hearts and minds of All-under-heaven lose the constancy of the way things go. All-under-heaven has a constancy in the way it goes on, and in accord with this constancy, what is curved is not made by means of a craftsman's tool, what's straight doesn't depend on the car- penter's line; the round doesn't need the compass, nor does what's square need squaring. Things that aren't broken don't need glu- ing. What cleaves together doesn't need binding. In All-under- heaven, all things pass into being, none knowing by what they live and grow. Likewise all things attain what they attain, and there is no knowing how or whence they get it. In this, the an- cient past and the present are not two. Nothing's been broken off. Nothing is missing. So how is it that \"benevolence\" and \"righteousness\" go on and on patching and pasting, rambling at work within the Way and its Power, making every heart under heaven wonder, \"This? Or that?\" Small doubts make methods change. Great doubt makes nature change. How do I know? Since the sage Shun grasped \"benevolence\" and \"righteousness\" to instruct All-under-heaven, everyone's gone racing off after fame for \"benevolence\" and \"righteousness.\" Isn't this letting \"benevolence\" and \"righteous- ness\" change their nature? Let me explain. From the time of the Three Dynasties on down, everyone has let things change their nature. Mean men risk their bodies for profit. Knights risk theirs for fame. Great ministers risk their bodies for the sake of their families, the sage for All-under-heaven. All these may differ in what they do and in the fame or infamy they gain, but in wound- ing their nature by risking their bodies, they are one. Webbed Toes An expert shepherd and a little girl both herded sheep. Both lost their flocks. What was the expert doing? He was studying some writing he'd brought along. And the little girl? She was playing. What these two were doing was completely different, but they were equals in losing their sheep. Po Yi died for fame at the foot of Mount Shou-yang. Robber Chih died for gain on top of the Eastern Height. What the two died for wasn't the same. Their wasted lives and wounded natures were equal. How can we praise Po Yi and blame Robber Chih? Of all those who put their lives at risk in All-under-heaven, if they do it for \"benevolence\" and \"righteousness,\" the vulgar name them \"gentlemen.\" And if they risk life for wealth, they call them \"mean.\" But what they risk is one. So there's a gentleman and a mean man here, risking their lives and wounding their na- ture, a Robber Chih and a Po Yi. But how to tell which is the gen- tle man and which the mean? Those who train their natures in \"benevolence\" and \"right- eousness,\" although they become the equals of Tseng Tzu and Shih, are no more than that expert shepherd I mentioned before. If they bend their natures to the five flavors, although they become the equals of the Grand Chef Yu Erh, they are not what I call expert. Give over their natures to the Five Notes? Though they equal Shih Kuang, they will not know what I call hearing. If they give themselves over to the Five Colors, though they be- come the equals of Li Chu, they will not learn what I call seeing clearly. What I call expertness isn't what followers of \"benevo- lence\" and \"righteousness\" believe. My expertise lies in the Power of Virtue. That's all. What I call expert isn't what's called being benevolent and righteous. It's bearing up under the facts of nature and destiny. What I call hearing is not what you do with your ear to the door. It's listening to yourself. What I call seeing clearly doesn't involve seeing anything else, just seeing yourself clearly. One who can't see himself but can only see others can't gain himself, but gains only for others. He gets what others need, oblivious to his own needs. One who is always at the service of others is never his 61 6 0"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu own, is a slave. And it's in this that Po Yi and Robber Chih are to- gether—the same: obscene, depraved, and crude. And me? My heart is fearfully short of the Tao and the Power of Virtue. At best, I wouldn't dare to fall into the grasp of \"benevo- lence\" and \"righteousness,\" and at worst, I won't dare to be ob- scene, depraved, or crude. Horses' Hooves [CHAPTER 9] ORSES ' HOOVES CARRY THEM THROUGH FROST AND SnOW. Their coats protect them from cold winds. They munch grass and drink water. On winged feet they fly over dry land. This is the true nature of the horse. Even if horses had great towers and fine halls, they'd have no use for them. Then along comes some Po Lo and says, \"I'm good at ruling horses.\" He puts fire and knife to them in the name of grooming. He brands and breaks them. He binds and hobbles them with full tack and imprisons them in stalls inside a stable. This alone kills two or three of every ten horses. Then he starves them and leaves them thirsty. He makes them trot and prance and run in line. He teams them side by side. He troubles them with bits and breast- bands and harries them with the crop or the whip. By this time a good half of the rest have died. The potter cries, \"I'm good at ruling clay! I can make it round with the compass or square with the square.\" The carpenter cries, 62 63"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu \"I'm good at ruling wood. I can make it crooked with the curve- arc or straight with the line.\" But by nature, how much do the clay and the wood care to be made to match compass or square, curve-arc or line? Yet generation after generation honors Po Lo, saying, \"He was good at ruling horses.\" They honor the potter and the carpenter, saying, \"They are good at ruling clay and wood.\" And they make the same error with regard to those who \"rule\" All-under-heaven. I'll stand here and sing it straight from the heart: those who are good at ruling All-under-heaven are not right. People have a constant nature. They weave to clothe them- selves, they till to eat. This is called sharing the Power of Virtue, being one without forming classes. This was called Heaven's Mandate, given freely. Thus, a generation that's gotten there, to the Power of Virtue, walks true to the earth and sees true to the lie of the land. They act in concert with the seasons; their moun- tains know no outlaw's tracks and trails; their marshes know no boats or bridges. The ten thousand things flock and grow, side by side. Birds and beasts flourish in their flocks. Grasses and trees grow tall. You can leash a bird or beast and ramble. You can bend down the branch and peer into the nests of magpie or crow. So: a generation that's gotten to the Power of Virtue lives as one with birds and beasts and stands side by side, of one clan, with the ten thousand things. What would they know of \"gentleman\" and \"commoner\"? They are as one in non-knowledge. The power of their virtue is not separate. They are as one, undesiring. This is called the simplicity of unworked wood. In the simplicity of un- worked wood, the nature of the people is achieved. Then along comes some sage, hobbling cripple-footed after his benevolence and righteousness, and everyone in All-under- heaven begins to know doubt. And by the flourishes of their music, the gesture of their ritual, All-under-heaven begins to be divided. If the unworked simplicity of things were left unshat- tered, who could make vessels for the sacrifice? If the white jade were left unsmashed, who could make little jade baubles for the court ceremony? If the Tao and its Power were not thrown out, Horses' Hooves where could benevolence and righteousness find room? If nature and fact had not been separated, what would be the use of music and ritual? If the Five Notes were not cast into chaos, who would need the Six Tones? The destruction of the simplicity of the un- worked merely for the sake of making vessels is the crime of the craftsman. The destruction of the Tao and its Power for the sake of benevolence and righteousness is the error of the sage. Now horses, living on the land, eat grass and drink water. When happy, they twine their necks and rub together. When angry, they turn their backs to one another and kick. This is what horses know. But add a yoke and a moon-shaped plate on the fore- head, and horses know boundaries and limits, they know they are enslaved. Then, slyly, they look sidelong and arch their necks to bite. They thrash about, trying to expel the bit and shake free of the reins. They have learned now, from their capable hearts, how to be outlaws. This is the crime of Po Lo. In the time of Ho Hsu, humans lived without \"knowing\" what they did, and went without \"knowing\" where. With food in their mouths, they were happy, drumming their bellies as they wan- dered. This was all people were able to do. Then along came some sage, twisting and bending to rites and music in order to \"reform\" All-under-heaven's form, and hanging forth the sprouting extra fingers of benevolence and righteous- ness to try to move the hearts and minds of All-under-heaven. It was only then that the people began to prance on tiptoe, addicted to \"knowing\" and struggling to go home to bed with profit. There was no stopping them. This also is the crime of the sage. 65 6 4"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Baggage Gets Stolen Baggage Gets Stolen [ CHAPTER 10] I F YOU ' RE GOING TO PREPARE FOR THIEVES WHO SLASH baggage, rifle bags, and smash open boxes, you'll use good cord and tight lashing, strong locks and latches. This is what this genera- tion is in the habit of calling \"knowing.\" It maybe just so, and yet when a big strong thief gets here, he'll shoulder the boxes, heft the bags and sling the baggage over his back, and run off. His only worry will be that you may not have made your locks and latches fast or lashed your cords tight enough. So. The one who's earned a name for \"knowing\" has really just been storing goods for the Big Thief. Let me explain. What the world calls a knowing person is merely one who piles up goods for the Big Thief, right? And what the world calls a sage is just the Big Thief's guard. How do I know? Consider the ancient state of Ch'i. Its neighboring towns were within sight of one another, so close they could hear each other's cocks crow and dogs bark. There were hunting grounds for net and snare, and farmlands for spade and plow filling more than two thousand square li within its four borders. The way its ancestral temples and its altars to the soil and grain were established, and the way its towns and villages were ruled—was there even one in- stance that didn't follow the method of the sage? It was such a place, and yet T'ien Ch'eng-tzu, in the dawn of a single day, mur- dered the Prince of Ch'i and robbed him of his land. Nor was the domain itself all that he stole. He stole the very methods of sage rule! Thus, although Tien Ch'eng-tzu gained a name as a thieving bandit, his own body enjoyed the same peace as that of Yao and Shun. The small states didn't dare say that he was not what he should be, and the great states didn't dare bring charges. For gen- erations, his progeny have ruled in Ch'i. Is this not, truly, robbing not only Ch'i, but also stealing the methods of the sage's knowl- edge? All that to guard the body of a thieving bandit! I'll try to explain. Among those known by the world today as \"one who has arrived at knowing,\" is there even one of them who isn't just storing up stuff for the Big Thief? Among those who are called \"one who has arrived at sageliness,\" is there even one who isn't just guarding stuff for a Big Thief? How do I know this is true? In ancient times, Lung-feng was beheaded, Pi Kan was disembow- eled, Chang Hung was torn asunder, and Tzu-hsu was crushed. Though these four masters were all worthies, they themselves could not avoid getting their wings clipped. When one of Robber Chih's band asked, \"Do thieves have the Tao?\" Chih replied, \"How could we get along without the Way? There's the wild idea about what might be hidden in a room, and that's 'sageliness' for your thief. Being the first to enter—there's your courage. Being the last to exit—that's righteousness. Know- ing whether or not you can pull off a job—that's knowing. Divid- ing the take—there's your benevolence. All-under-heaven has never seen a really Big Thief who hasn't mastered these five things.\" Now look at it this way—a good person who doesn't get the Tao of a sage can't establish himself, nor can a Chih who doesn't get the Tao of a sage get along without it. In All-under-heaven, the 67 6 6"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu Baggage Gets Stolen good are few, the not-good are many. So the sage profits All- under-heaven but little, and injures it much. So it is said, \"When the lips are gone, the teeth get cold,\" and, \"It was the thin wine of Lu that got Han Tan besieged.\" Causes may be clear, or they may be obscure. Thus it is that when the sages came to life, great thieves arose. Cudgel the sages, and forget the thieves. Then All- under-heaven will begin to be ruled. Just as when the streams dry up, their beds are empty; and when the hills are leveled, the pools are filled; so when the sages die, big thieves won't arise. With All- under-heaven equal and at peace, there'll be no reason for sages or thieves. But if the sages don't die, big thieves won't stop. The more weight we give to the rule of the sage, the more we give to the profits of Robber Chih. When we give the people the standard peck and bushel, we teach them to cheat by the peck and the bushel. When we give the people scales and steelyards to weigh with, we teach them to cheat with the scale. When we give them contracts and official seals to bind good faith, we give them contracts and seals to steal with. And when we force them to re- form with benevolence and righteousness, we teach them to steal with benevolence and righteousness. How do I know? The man who steals a belt buckle gets exe- cuted while the man who steals a kingdom becomes a feudal lord. Within the gates of feudal lords, benevolence and righteousness thrive like babies. Is this not simply stolen benevolence and righteousness, and isn't this the whole \"knowing\" of the sage? So men rush after the Big Thieves, trying to make lords of them- selves. They steal benevolence and righteousness, the pecks and bushels and scales, contracts and seals of profit. Carriages and crowns have no power to persuade them, nor can ax and block dissuade them. These merely add weight to the profit of Robber Chih and make him even less dissuadable. This is the error, the excess, of the sage. It used to be said, \"Fish mustn't leave the pool, the state's in- struments of profit must not be shown to the people.\" Now these \" sage\" people are mere instruments of profit to the state. They aren't the instruments of the enlightenment of All-under-heaven. When you cut loose from the sages, you cut off the big thieves. Throw out your jade! Smash your pearls! Then the little thieves won't get started. Burn your contracts and break your seals, and the people will stop haggling. Overthrow the methods produced through the knowledge of the sage, and you'll begin to be able to talk common sense with people again. Mix up the Six Tones. Burn flutes and lutes and plug Blind Kuang's ears, and then they'll begin to really hear again. Destroy decorations, mix the Five Col- ors, paste Li Chu's eyes tight shut, and in All-under-heaven, they'll begin to see the light again. Destroy the curve-arc and the line, cast out the compass and square, break the fingers of Crafts- man Ch'ui, and in All-under-heaven, they will begin to know their own skills again. So it was said, \"The greatest of skills has the appearance of clumsiness.\" Wipe out all traces of Tseng Tzu and Shih, gag the mouths of Yang Chu and Mo Tzu, throw out benevolence and righteousness, and the power of the virtue of All-under-heaven will be born of dark mystery, equal to heaven again. When people begin to see the light, All-under-heaven will no longer burn. When people begin to hear again, All-under-heaven will no longer be bound. When people know what they know again, All-under- heaven will no longer know doubt. When people begin again to know the Power of Virtue, All-under-heaven will no longer be de- praved or crude. Tseng Tzu and Shih, Yang Chu and Mo Tzu, Mas- ter Kuang, the Craftsman Ch'ui, and Li Chu all of them sought the power of their virtues outside themselves, dazzling All-under- heaven into a blind confusion. Their methods were useless. Do you alone not know of that ancient generation that got to the Power of Virtue—Yung Ch'eng, Po Huang, Li Hsu, Fu Hsi, and the rest? In those days, the people used knotted cords to keep their records. They made good food and beautiful clothing. Joy was just a habit to them. Peace flourished within their ancient doorsills, tranquility beneath their roofs. Although they were within sight of neighboring lands and shared cock-crow and dog- bark, these people grew old and died without ever bothering to go visiting. Such a time you may call well ruled. 68 69"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu But now something makes the people stretch their necks and raise their heels to stand on tiptoe and cry, \"Look! There's a wor- thy man over there!\" And they pack up their provisions and hus- tle off after him. Thus they cast aside their near and dear and lay aside their duty to their host. Their footprints link the borders of feudal lords, their carriage tracks criss-cross a thousand li. This is the fault of those above, the result of their addiction to \"knowl- edge.\" When those above are sincerely addicted to this kind of knowing, they can't know the Tao. Then All-under-heaven knows the Great Chaos. How do I know this is so? The great knowing, the technology of bow and crossbow, net, stringed arrow, and all sorts of ingenious devices, throws the birds into chaos in the skies. The great knowl- edge that lets people make hooks, lures, nets, and weirs, sets fish into chaos in the water. Fences, pitfalls, snares, and cages arise from great knowledge, and they set animals in the wild into chaos. The knowledge that creates deceit and poisonous ambiguity, that fiddles with distinctions about hard and white, that stirs the dust about sameness and difference—this knowledge is great indeed. It is by this knowledge that doubt is made the habit of the people. The crime is addiction to knowing. Thus it is that in All-under- heaven they know only to seek after what they do not know. None of them knows to seek after what they already know. They all know to call false anything they think not good, but they don't know to call false what they take to be good. And this is the Great Chaos—it blots out the light of sun and moon from above; below, it burns the vital spirit of hill and stream; between, it skews the succession of the seasons. Crawling bug or fluttering thing, there is none that hasn't lost its true nature, the heart it was born with. That's the power of addiction to technical knowledge—it throws All-under-heaven in chaos. Since the Three Dynasties, it's come down just so. The people who sow and multiply are set aside, while the lackey flatterer is advanced. Simplicity and not-doing are abandoned. What's taken to heart is the song-and-dance that tumbles All-under-heaven. Staying Home, Possessing Nothing [ CHAPTER 11 ' VE HEARD OF STAYING HOME AND BEING SELF-POSSESSED in All- under-heaven; I have not heard of \"ruling\" All-under-heaven. If you stay home, do you need to fear that you will corrupt the heart All-under-heaven possessed at birth? If you possess yourself alone, must you worry that the Power of the Virtue of All-under- heaven will slip away? And if the heart that All-under-heaven was born with is not corrupted and the power of its virtue is not displaced, will All-under-heaven need anyone to possess and rule it? In ancient times, when Sage Yao ruled, he made All-under- heaven happy. People all took joy in their natural hearts, and their hearts were never quiet. When the tyrant Chieh ruled, he made All-under-heaven sick to death of life, so people felt only the hard lot of the hearts they'd been born with. Those hearts knew no sim- ple satisfaction. To know no peace and know no satisfaction is to be without the Power of Virtue, and who could last long without 71 70"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu that power? When the people were too happy, they leaned toward yang. When they were too angry, they leaned toward yin. When both yang and yin were in excess, the seasons fell out of sequence, hot and cold could no longer harmonize, and their disorder wounded human form. People let happiness and anger lead them from their marks and they began to dwell in inconstancy, so that the tigers of anxiety took up residence in their hearts and minds. They couldn't get what they needed. They were always stopped midway and never accomplished their ends. Then, for the first time, there began to be ideas in All-under-heaven that were not simple, actions that were not plain. And so Robber Chih, Tseng Tzu, and Shih came along. Now, even if All-under-heaven were made the reward of the \"good,\" it still wouldn't be enough, and if All-under-heaven were used to punish the evil, it wouldn't be suf- ficient. Despite the greatness of All-under-heaven, there's not enough of it to provide reward and punishment. Yet ever since the birth of the Three Dynasties, everyone has been haggling and struggling over nothing more than reward and punishment. What time would they have for the facts of nature and destiny? For these, the enjoyment of sight means debauching themselves in sex; enjoyment of hearing means debauching themselves with music. Enjoying benevolence? Throwing the Power of Virtue into chaos. Enjoying righteousness? Perverting principle. Enjoying ritual? Embracing artifice. Enjoying ceremo- nial music? Drawing near depravity. Sageliness? Mere magic arts. Enjoying knowledge? Picking nits. When people are at peace with the facts of nature and destiny, these eight things may exist or may perish. When the people are not at peace with the facts of nature and destiny, these eight things begin to twist and warp the people and bring chaos to All- under-heaven while seeming to be approaching honor and cher- ishing these things. Such is the state of doubt in All-under- heaven. They don't just commit their excesses and get on with it —they fast before speaking of them; they kneel upon mats and make offerings to them; they drum, dance, and sing hymns before them. And there's nothing I can do. Staying Home, Possessing Nothing If a prince can't have what he wants and is stuck instead with holding sway over All-under-heaven, there's nothing better than nonaction. Not-acting, he can be at peace with the facts of his na- ture and destiny. Since ancient times, one who valued his own body above All-under-heaven could be trusted with All-under- heaven; one who loves his own body more than he loves running All-under-heaven may be given rulership. Thus a prince who can refrain from cutting himself free of his five vital organs, who can keep from teasing apart his seeing from his hearing, will be able to dwell a long time in his corpse with the vision of a dragon, silent as the source, with the voice of thunder. As his spirit moves, heaven and earth will follow. Pliant to nonaction, the ten thousand things will trail behind him like little clouds of steam. And what time shall he have for \"ruling\"? T S ' UI CHU ASKED LAO TAN, \" IF YOU DON ' T RULE ALL-under- heaven, how can you perfect the human heart and mind?\" Lao Tan replied, \"Don't fuss with heart and mind. It can be pushed down or boosted up, but up or down is a prison, a death sentence for heart and mind. Pliant to the soft and gentle or hard, heart and mind can cut, carve, and polish. Its heat can burn fire; its cold freezes ice. It's so quick that in the space of a nod it can flit twice beyond the four encircling seas and back again. Its dwelling place is the silence of the source. Its motion is the drape of con- stellations whirling down the sky. It's a racing courser, beyond being bound. No more than this is the human heart and mind. \"In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor was the first to use benevolence and righteousness to fuss with the hearts and minds of humankind. Yao and Shun worked themselves raw to nourish the forms of All-under-heaven. They grieved their vital organs for the sake of benevolence and righteousness, and bore down upon their very blood and ch'i to set up laws and standards. Yet there were still those they could not win over. So it was that Yao had to send Huan Tou to Mount Chung, banish the three Miao tribes to 73 7 2"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu Three Cliffs, and ship off Kung Kung, the minister of public works, to the City of Darkness. This is not what I'd call winning over All-under-heaven. \"Then we get down to the age of the Three Kings, when All- under-heaven lived in terror. At the bottom were your Robber Chihs; at the top, Tseng Tzu and Shih. Then the Confucians and the Mohists arose together. Then even happiness and anger came into doubt. Then ignorance and knowledge competed at cheating. Good and bad called each other false. Truth and falsehood turned to slander, and All-under-heaven withered. The power of great virtue no longer held all things together as One. Nature and des- tiny went soft and runny and ran off. All-under-heaven was ad- dicted to knowledge, and the people grew distracted. Then came the executioner's ax, the amputator's saw, to bring people to order; then came the rope and the tattoo branding of prisoners to teach about murder; and finally, decisively, the hammers and drills that bored seven holes in Muddle. All-under-heaven was in thorny chaos. The crime lay in fussing with people's hearts and minds. So worthy people slunk off to live beneath great mountain peaks, and lords of ten thousand chariots hid, trembling in their own ancestral shrines. \"The executed dead of this generation lie in a heap. Prison slaves are yoked together in a crowd. And those who suffered am- putations gaze upon one another constantly as Confucians and Mohists strut out from among the masses of cuffed, shackled men. \"My heart cries out, 'Can this be so? They know no fear. They will not listen to their hearts. They know no shame.' That's how it is. \"Nor have I yet seen the knowledge of the sage that was not the latch of the yoke, or benevolence and righteousness that were not the clasps of shackles. Thus we come to see that Tseng Tzu and Shih are no more than the first whistling arrows that sound the attack of Tyrant Chieh and Robber Chih. \"So I say: cut down the sage. Reject his kind of knowing, and All-under-heaven will be ruled.\" Staying Home, Possessing Nothing T HE YELLOW EMPEROR STOOD AS SON OF HEAVEN FOR NINEteen years, All-under-heaven turning at his command. Then he heard that Kuang Ch'eng-tzu was up on Mount Empty Togetherness and went to visit him. \"I've heard that you have made it to the true Tao,\" he said. \"May I enquire about its essence? I want to find the essence of possessing heaven and earth, nurturing the five grains, and nour- ishing the people. I want to learn to manage yin and yang to aid all living things. How am I to do it?\" \"All you really want to know about,\" Kuang Ch'eng-tzu replied, \"is the material qualities of things. All you'll manage is their dissolution. Since you came to rule All-under-heaven, the ch'i of the clouds falls like rain before it's fully gathered; the leaves of grass and trees fall before they're even yellow; the light of the sun spills out on the waste. You're a slick-tongued seducer. How would that give you footing from which to speak of true Tao?\" The Yellow Emperor withdrew, gave up All-under-heaven, built a special hut, got a white rush mat, and stayed alone for three months. Then he went to see the master once again. When he found him, Kuang Ch'eng-tzu was napping, facing south. The Yellow Emperor crept forward humbly, bowing his head low, and asked, \"I have heard that you, my master, have arrived at true Tao. May I dare ask how to rule my body so that it may endure a great long time? \" \"Now that's a good question, isn't it?\" Kuang Ch'eng-tzu jumped up. \"Come. I'll speak to you of the true Tao.

Therefore I have kept up this body for twelve hundred years, and my form has not withered.\" Bowing low, the Yellow Emperor said, \"Kuang Ch'eng-tzu's true title is 'Heaven'!\" \"Approach,\" said Kuang Ch'eng-tzu, \"and I'll give you the word. Things can never be exhausted, and yet humankind insists there is an end to the string. There is no measure to things, yet humankind claims they have their poles. Whoever gains my Tao is an emperor above, a king here below. All the doctrines of the hundred schools that prate of illumination are born of dust and will return to dust. But when I leave you, I go to enter the Gate of the Inexhaustible, to wander the wilds beyond all poles. I go to join, and so to constitute, the winged and mysterious brilliant blazing triad—heaven, earth, and humankind. Heaven, earth, and I are constant. Could I face the bonds of dusk? The dusk is far from me. All humanity is bound to die. I alone remain, the glori- ous master child.\" C LOUD GENERAL WANDERED EASTERLY. EMERGING FROM under the Fu-yao tree's branches, he bumped into Big Goose Dummy. Drumming on his tummy, Big Goose Dummy was about to take off like a hopping sparrow. When Cloud General saw him, he hes- itated, then stopped, amazed. \"Say, Old One,\" he asked, \"who are you and what are you doing?\" Big Goose Dummy kept drumming on his tummy, flapping and hopping like a sparrow. \"I'm rambling.\" \"I have something to ask about,\" Cloud General said. Staying Home, Possessing Nothing \"Oh ? \" \"The ch'i of heaven is out of harmony,\" Cloud General said, \"and the ch'i of earth is gnarly and knotted. The Six Ch'i are out of tune, the Four Seasons out of order. Now I want to harmonize the essence of the Six Ch'i for the benefit of all living things. How am Ito undertake such a task?\" Still drumming his tummy and scratching his head and spar- row-hopping about, Big Goose Dummy muttered, \"I don't know. I don't know.\" So Cloud General didn't get his answer. Three years later, however, when he was wandering east in the wilds where people are even dumber than in Sung, he ran into Big Goose Dummy again. Cloud General was happy, and ran up, shouting, \"Oh, Heaven! Have you forgotten me?\" He bowed his head to the ground and begged for another audience. \"I wander and ramble without knowing what I seek,\" Big Goose Dummy said. \"A madman, a king dog, I don't know where I' m going. The wanderer, unhaltered, is not deceived by what is seen. What more do you want?\" \"I'm quite a mad-dog king myself,\" Cloud General said. \"But the people all follow my trail. I can't get what I want for them, and it is for their sake that I now beg you to speak a single word.\" \"What throws the warp of heaven into chaos, what rebels against the facts of things?\" Big Goose Dummy replied. \"What can keep mysterious heaven from accomplishing its ends? What scatters herds of beasts, makes birds cry in the night, and brings bad luck to bugs? I have the idea that it's excess ruling hu- mankind!\" \"What can I do about that?\" Big Goose Dummy said, \"I have an idea: poison. Or take off and fly home.\" \"Meeting with you,\" Cloud General said, \"is difficult. Let me hear just one word.\" \"My idea?\" Big Goose Dummy said. \"Nourish your heart and mind.

I T IS THE HABIT OF PEOPLE OF THIS GENERATION TO LIKE what's like themselves and to despise what is unlike themselves. They desire what's similar to themselves and despise what's dif- ferent. But at heart, they want to stand out in the crowd. Now whoever has a desire to stand in a crowd at all will never stand out. To rely on the desires of the crowd is not as good as crowding the crowd. Those who have designs upon the government of a state pos- sessed by another think only of the glories of the Three Kings, and not of how their hearts and minds will become mere targets of calamity. They'd simply trust the kingdoms of humankind to chance. How many chances are there that they won't destroy the kingdom? Not one in ten thousand will survive. And when you destroy a single kingdom, there are more than ten thousand human lives destroyed. How sad that those who would possess a kingdom don't know this! Possessing territory is a big thing. One who possesses a big thing can't just be treated like a thing himself. Because he's not a thing, he can treat things as things. One who clearly sees the way of thinging things is not just a thing. How could he rule only the Staying Home, Possessing Nothing common folk in All-under-heaven? He'd enter and exit the Six Harmonies and wander the Nine Lands. A sole possessor has achieved what we call \"getting into the aristocracy.\" But the doctrine of the truly great one comes forth like the shadow from the form, the echo returning to the sound. If you are possessed by a question, he will answer. With all that he holds dear, he's the companion of All-under-heaven. He dwells beyond the echo and moves outside direction. He will lead you by the hand beyond the circle of vexations, leading you to wander the realm of causelessness, to come and go without direction, unborn and constant as the sun. When he speaks in hymns of the form and the body, he unites them in the Great Unity. In this Great Unity, there is no self. Without a self, how can you possess pos- sessing? He who fixes his eye on possessing is what we used to call a prince. He who fixes his eye on nothing is a friend of heaven and earth. T HINGS MAY BE LOW AND MEAN, BUT THEY MUST BE BORNE up. People may be rough, but they must be your cause. The busi- ness of the state is difficult, but it must not be left undone. Meth- ods may be as hard to find as the tracks of a single beast among the herd, but they must be followed. Righteousness is distant, yet we must dwell there; benevolence is a bias we must make broad. Ritual must be kept full but used sparingly. The Power of Virtue is the center of the target and must be held high. The Tao is One, and not without change. Heaven is of the spirit and must be the source of action. So the sages watch heaven, but don't try to aid it. They find the power of their virtue but are not bound by it. They go forth with the Tao, but make no plans. They come together with benevo- lence, but do not set their hearts on it. They're full of righteous- ness, but they don't treasure it. They accept ritual but not taboo. They conduct the business of the state and don't withdraw from it.

So they are of things and do not leave them. Things alone are not enough to get things done. There is work that must be done. Whoever doesn't see heaven's brightness will not be pure in the Power of Virtue. Whoever does not follow Tao can't get there from here. Whoever cannot see the brightness of Tao?—Sadly, that heart is false. What is it I call Tao? There is the Tao of heaven. There is the Tao of humankind. To do not-doing and be honored, that is heaven's Tao. To do doing and thereby get entangled, bound up in things, is humanity's Tao. Heaven's Tao leads the way while the Tao of humankind follows. Heaven's Tao and the Tao of humanity lie far apart. Now this is worth looking into. Heaven and Earth [FROM CHAPTER 12 r ZU-KUNG WENT SOUTH TO CH ' U, AND, RETURNING BY way of I l the state of Chin, he was passing along the south shore of the Han River when he saw a big fellow working in a one-acre field of vegetables. He was climbing down into a pit well with a pitcher, then climbing out and pouring the water on his crop. It looked like he was working himself to the bone without getting much advantage from his efforts. \"There's a mechanism for this,\" Tzu-kung said, \"and with it, in a single day you could inundate a hundred acres. It doesn't take much effort, and it yields a great advantage. Wouldn't you like to have one?\" The gardener rose up and gave him a look. \"How's it work?\" \"It's a machine constructed of wood, heavy at one end, light at the other. It lifts the water like a dipper, lots of it, so much that it gushes out as if it were boiling over. It's called a well sweep.\" The gardener made an ugly face, then said with a laugh, \"I've 8o 81"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu heard my teacher say, 'Where there are machines, there will be machine problems; where there are machine problems, the me- chanical will find entry into the hearts and minds of the people; when people's hearts and minds become mechanical, what's pure and simple is spoiled. Without the pure and simple, the spirit knows no rest. And when the spirit knows no rest, even the Tao can't carry you on.' It's not that I don't know about your machine, but that I'd be ashamed to use such a thing.\" Autumn Floods [ CHAPTER 171 H W EN AUTUMN FLOOD SEASON ARRIVED, ALL THE streams poured into the Yellow River, and it grew so broad that from one bank you couldn't tell horse from ox on the other. The River God, delighted with himself, took himself to be the big ram in the herd, the prettiest thing in the world. He wan- dered eastward with the flowing river until he came to the North- ern Sea. Facing east and looking out, he could see no end to those waters. He nodded and rolled his eyes, and then, looking out over the sea toward its god, North Sea Jo, he sighed and said, \"The country folk all say, 'Someone who's heard the Tao a hundred times thinks he's better than the common Joe.' They could have been speaking of me. I've heard people slight Confucius's knowledge and make light of the righteousness of Po Yi, without beginning to doubt them. But now that I've laid eyes on your inexhaustible vastness, I realize that if I hadn't come to study at your gate, I'd 82 83"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu have been in danger of being the laughingstock of those who are really in the know.\" \"A frog in a well can't have much to say about the sea,\" North Sea Jo replied. \"It's bound by its own empty space. A summer bug won't have much to say about ice. It's trapped in its tiny time. A cloistered scholar can't have much to say about the Tao, being all wrapped up in his doctrine and dogma. Now that you've seen the great sea, you see where you've come from—you've already begun to talk about Great Principle. \"Of all the waters of All-under-heaven, none is bigger than the sea. The ten thousand streams return to it forever, and yet it is never filled. It boils away at Wei Lu, but the sea has never emp- tied. It doesn't change with spring and autumn. It knows no drought. It is so much bigger than the flow of the Yellow River that it simply can't be measured. And yet I haven't let this make me take myself for 'big.' I take my form from heaven and earth, and my ch'i from yin and yang. Between heaven and earth, I'm like a little rock or a bush on a mountainside. If my mode of being is minor, how could I take myself to be major? \"The place of the Four Seas between heaven and earth is no more than the place of a pile of field stones in the Great Swamp. The place of the Middle Kingdom within the Four Seas is no more than the place of a single seed in a granary. When we speak of all things, we call them 'the ten thousand things,' and humankind is but one of those ten thousand. People crowd the Nine Provinces with their crop-growing, their boats and carts going to and from the marketplace, yet what is the place of humankind but as a sin- gle one of the ten thousand things? \"What is it the Five Emperors passed freely down, what the Three Kings struggled over, what people of benevolence grieve over and scholar-knights labor for? No more than this one thing. Po Yi gave it up for fame; Confucius talked about it for the sake of being known as learned. They were just taking themselves for something really big. Wasn't that just like you taking yourself for big water?\" Autumn Floods \"Okay,\" the River God answered, \"so I'll take heaven and earth for big, and the tip of a hair for little. Okay?\" \"Wrong,\" North Sea Jo answered. \"There is no limit to things, no stopping time, no divisions of the constant, and no cause of ends and beginnings. Great Knowing encompasses both the far and the near, neither diminishing the small nor enhancing the large. It examines both present and past, looking deeply without grief, without stretching on tiptoe to grasp what's at hand, be- cause it knows there's no stopping time. It looks deeply into full- ness, as into emptiness. Gaining, it knows no happiness; losing, it knows no pain. It knows allotted portions are not constant. The length of a lifetime can't be compared with the length of time be- fore one's birth. Trying to cross the boundaries of the largest thing using the smallest as your vessel, won't you just get so lost that you lose even yourself? Look at it this way—how could you be certain that the tip of one hair was sufficient to measure small- ness or that heaven and earth are a measure of what's big?\" The River God answered, \"Nowadays the disputers agree that the smallest things are without form and that the biggest can't be contained. Do you believe that?\" \"When you look at the big from the viewpoint of the small,\" North Sea Jo replied, \"you can't take it all in. When you look at the small from the viewpoint of the big, you can't make it out at all. The smallest thing is the smallest of the small; the biggest is the biggest of the big. They're different, and it's convenient to note that, but it is also mere circumstance of existence. If things are to be called fine or gross, they must first have form. Without form, you can't divide things into big and bigger or small and smaller. If you can't contain them, you can't count them. You can talk about the gross and you can think about the fine, but what words can't express and ideas can't delve into—these have noth- ing to do with either fine or gross. \"So great people don't hurt others.

They don't recruit helpers for their work, but they don't show off their independence. They don't despise the mean and greedy, and while they stay clear of those bad habits, they don't make a display of their difference. They go along with the crowd and don't look down on its glib, fawning leaders. The rank and rewards of the world can't move them. The punishment and blame of the world can't shame them. They know 'right' and 'wrong' are not so easily divisible—no more than 'big' and 'little.' I've heard it said that those with the Tao will not be heard of, that getting the Power of Virtue is not 'get- ting.' Great people have no selves. They find their parts in life. Now that's being there.\" The River God asked, \"Whether you start outside of things or stay within them, where do you have to get to in order to discern the noble from the mean, big from little?\" \"Looking at it from the Tao, there is no noble and no mean. From the point of view of things, each takes itself for noble and all others for mean. From the common point of view, noble and mean don't inhere in the individual. They are mere products of opinion. From the point of view of difference, if we take something for big because it's big in some way, then there's not one among the ten thousand things that is not big. If we take something for small be- cause it's small in some way, then there's not a thing among the ten thousand things that is not small. When you know heaven and earth as seeds of grain and grass, when you know that the tip of a hair is a mound or a mountain, then you know something about difference and measurement. As to their worth, they have worth according to what they are, and of the ten thousand things that exist, there's not a one that doesn't. Or, if they don't exist, there's not a one that's not worth nothing. Just so, you know that East and West, although mutually opposed, would be nothing without the other being something. That's how shares of worth are settled. When we look at things from the point of view of our own inter- est, what's right is right, and there's not one of the ten thousand things that is not right; and what's not right is not, and there's Autumn Floods not a one of the ten thousand things that's not not. When you know how both Sage Yao and Tyrant Chieh each took himself to be right and the other not, then you understand all about picking and choosing. \"Since ancient days,\" North Sea Jo continued, \"Yao gave way to Shun, who ruled in his turn as emperor; but when K'uai yielded to Tzu Chih, Chih perished; T'ang and Wu fought to be kings, and each ruled; Po Kung fought and was destroyed. From this you can see that giving way and fighting are only rituals, the behavior of a Yao or a Chieh, the noble and the mean. Each has its season. None has been constant. \"You can use a beam or a pillar for a battering ram against a city wall, but not to plug a little hole. Which is to say, there are differ- ences in tools. The stallions of Ch'i-chi and Hua-liu could run a thousand li in a single day, but they weren't as good at catching rats as a weasel or a cat. Which is to say, there are differences in talents. The horned owl can catch a flea at night and see the tip of a hair, but in dawn's light it is so blinded that it can't tell moun- tain from grave mound. This is all to say, things have differences by nature. \"So when they say, 'Let's make Right our teacher and do away with Wrong, let's make Rule our master and leave Chaos alone!' they haven't yet lit on the principle that illuminates heaven and earth, nor on the facts of the ten thousand things. This is like say- ing that heaven's your teacher, but not earth; or yin, but not yang. There is no possibility of such thinking getting anyone into the light, but they keep talking that way nonetheless. They are stu- pid—or think we are. \"The imperial rulers chose their own successors regardless of family connections. In the Three Dynasties, family lines were the basis of succession. Whoever fell short of the habit of his times was called a usurper. Whoever measured up to such habits was called a rightful successor. Quiet, River God! Be quiet. How would you presume to know at whose gate to study the 'noble' and 'mean,' or in whose school to learn 'big' from 'little'?\" \"Then what should I do?\" the River God asked. \"And what 87 8 6"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu should I not do? Shall I give up or accept, hold to or push away? How shall I live out my string of days?\" \"Viewed from the Tao,\" North Sea Jo replied, \"what's noble and what's mean? They are merely overflow and backwash. Don't leash your knight's heart or you hobble yourself on the high Way. What is much and what little? They're thanks to the patron or alms to beggars. If you go beyond the One, you will fall long and short of the Tao. Be as awful as the prince of the land who doesn't keep the power of his virtue discreet, gentle as the harvest god who never hides abundance. Be as vast as the endless Four Directions that know no bounds. Embrace with your heart each of the ten thousand things. Which deserves more? This is called being unbiased. The ten thousand things are one, and equal. Which is short, which long? The Tao is without beginning and without end, and yet things have their lives and deaths. You can't depend on their becoming. One is empty. One is full. There is no standing in their forms. Passing years can't be held back. Turning seasons can't be stopped. Waxing and waning, filling and emptying, they run out their string and then are born again. This is why, when we speak of True Righteousness, we must first find connection with the principle of the ten thousand things. The life of things is the rush and race of horses, not a mo- tion that is not a change. There is no time that is not movement. What to do then? And what to not do? Just be firm about letting things go.\" \"So what's so noble in the Tao?\" \"Who knows the Tao must get to principle. Who gets to princi- ple will stand enlightened about power. Whoever is enlightened about power won't be damaged by things. Those who get to the Power of Virtue can't be burned by fire or drowned in water. Nei- ther cold nor heat can damage them, nor wild beasts injure them. This is not to say that they take these things lightly, but that they can tell home from precipice. They are at peace with good luck and with ill, and careful where they come or where they go. So there is nothing to harm them. So it is said, 'Heaven's is inside, humankind's is outside.' The Power of Virtue is heaven. Those Autumn Floods who know the motions of heaven and of humankind take root in heaven and find themselves in the position to gain the Power of Virtue. There, whether you may dawdle or hurry, bend down or stretch up, you will always return to the necessary. That may be called the ultimate.\" \" What do you mean by Heaven, and what do you mean by Hu- mankind?\" the River God wanted to know. \"Horses and oxen have four legs. That's heaven,\" North Sea Jo replied. \"Haltering the horse's head or piercing the ox's nose— that's humankind. So it's said, 'Don't let humankind destroy heaven!' Don't let 'therefores' interfere with fate. Don't let gain lead you astray, toward fame. Be careful! Guard your heart, don't lose it. This is called getting back to the truth.\" T HE ONE-FOOTED K ' UEI WISHES IT WERE THE MANY-FOOTED Hsien. The Hsien wishes it were a snake. The snake wishes it were the wind, and the wind, the eye.

The one-footed K'uei said to the many-footed Hsien, \"I hop around on my one foot, and I'm pretty good at it, but you use ten thousand feet. How can you manage that all alone?\" \"That's not how it is,\" the Hsien replied. \"Haven't you ever seen anybody spit? Pittooey! And out come big drops like pearls and little drops like mist.

How do you do it?\" \"My heavenly mechanism moves me,\" the snake replied. \"How could I change it?

With bare blades crossing before him, to look on death as life—that's the courage of the oath- sworn warrior.

I thought I'd gotten there. Now I've heard the words of Chuang Tzu, and I'm lost in them, beyond harmonizing.

This is joy for a fish.\" \"You're not a fish,\" Hui Tzu said, \"so how do you know what's joy for one?\" \"You're not me,\" Chuang Tzu replied, \"so how do you know I don't know what's joy for a fish?\" \"I'm not you, so I most assuredly don't know what you know. 93 9 2"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu You ' re most assuredly not a fish, so my proposition concerning you not knowing what is joy for a fish remains unrefuted.\" \"Oh, please.

Nowadays, what's to be done, and what can be depended on; what is to be avoided, and in what may we abide? What should be ap- proached, and what left behind; what enjoyed and what despised? What All-under-heaven honors is wealth and noble standing, long life and a good reputation. What it enjoys is security for the body, fine flavors, pretty clothing, bright colors, and music. What it looks down upon is poverty and lowly standing, short life and bad reputation. What it finds bitter is the body not being well or safely housed, the mouth not getting fancy flavors, the ear not get- ting music. If it doesn't get these things, it grows sad, even fearful. People are concerned only with external form. Isn't this stupid? So it is that the rich embitter their lives with incessant work, piling great heaps of things they could never use up. What they try to do for their forms is all, in fact, external even to their forms. 94 95"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu Those who chase titles of nobility work night into day, the tigers of anxiety always wandering the fields of their hearts and minds. What they do for the sake of their forms puts them very far indeed from their forms. Humankind and grief are born together. The long-lived learn, in the confusion of senility, only to live in cease- less fear of death. How bitter is that? How far are they from really doing something for their forms? And the ardent scholar-knight, sworn to offer his life for the sake of others? The world holds him in high repute, but that's not enough to keep his body alive. I'm not sure if the good of this \"good repute\" is really good. If it is really good, then \"good\" is not enough to keep a body alive. But if it's not really good, at least it's good enough to keep some others alive. So it's said, \"When loyal counsel goes unheard, step back and do not strive.\" When Tzu-hsu strove with his ruler, he ended with a mutilated form. True, if he hadn't striven, he'd have had no fame, no good repute. Was his \"good repute\" really good? Or not? What people nowadays do in their search for joy—I'm not sure it really bears final fruit in joy. I see the present habit of pursuing joy as the stampeding of a herd, a rushing headlong almost as if in fear of losing their own lives. And yet they call it joy. I'm not sure whether this is joy. Perhaps it is not. I take nondoing to be real joy. But it is currently a habit to say that it has a bitter flavor. Therefore I say, when you get to joy, there's no joy; when you get to praise, there's no praise. In All- under-heaven, the fruit of right and wrong can't even be agreed upon. Yet although that is so, nondoing can easily settle on what's right and wrong, easily get to joy, and keep a body alive. It's just nondoing that keeps the baby growing. Let me try to put it into other words. Heaven's nondoing keeps it pure. Earth's nondoing keeps it calm. So the two, in nondoing, harmonize together, and the ten thousand things all change. Vast and imperceptible, they come forth from no place. Imperceptible and vast, they are the perfect image of nonbeing, and the ten thousand things in their variety grow forth from their nondoing. Getting to joy So it has always been said, \"Heaven and earth do nondoing, and no thing is left undone.\" Oh, humankind! Who can get to doing nondoing? C HUANG Tzu ' s WIFE DIED, AND WHEN Hu' Tzu CAME TO offer his condolences, he found Chuang Tzu hunkered down, drum- ming on a pan and singing. Hui Tzu said, \"You lived with this woman, raised children with her, and grew old together. To not weep at her death is enough, already! But this drumming and singing, isn't this a bit too much?\" \"No,\" Chuang Tzu replied. \"That's not how it is. When she was first born into death, how could I have not felt grief? But I looked deeply into it and saw that before she was born into life, she was lifeless. Not only was she lifeless, but she was formless. Not only was she formless, she didn't even have any ch'i. Some- where there in the vast imperceptible there was a change, and she had ch'i; then the ch'i changed, and she had form; the form changed, and she had life. Now there has been another change, and she is dead. This is like the mutual cycling of the Four Sea- sons. Now she lies resting quietly in the Great Chamber.

Did you do wrong, and so bring shame upon your father, mother, wife, and children, and so end thus? Did you freeze or starve, and so end thus? Or was it just the turning of your springs and autumns, one after another, that led you to such an end?\" Having spoken, Chuang Tzu took the skull as his pillow and went off to sleep. In the middle of the night, the skull came into his dream and said, \"You talk like one of those disputers. I marked your words. You mark mine: of all entanglements of human life that you mentioned, the dead have not a single one. Do you wish to hear me speak of death?\" \"Please do!\" \"In death,\" the skull replied, \"there is no lord above and no slave below. Nor are there any of the chores and duties of the Four Seasons. The eternity of heaven and earth is our spring and au- tumn. The joy of the king facing the sunny south upon his throne can't surpass ours.\" Chuang Tzu didn't believe it. \"If I got the Official in Charge of Fate to bring you back to life,\" he asked, \"to put flesh back on your bones and return you to your father and mother, your wife and children, and all your old friends down home, would you want that?\" The skull furrowed its brow deep as if it were about to suffer the punishment of having one's foot cut off, and replied, \"How could I give up the joy of the south-facing king and take up the suffering of humanity again?\" Getting to Joy W HEN YEN HuI WENT AWAY, EAST INTO CH ' I, CONFUCIUS wore a troubled expression. Tzu Kung rose from his mat and came before Confucius and said, \"Your disciple dares to ask about Hui's jour- ney east to Ch'i. Why are you looking so sad? \" \"It's good of you to ask,\" Confucius replied. \"I very much ap- prove of Kuan Tzu's words of old: 'A little bag can't hold some- thing really big. You can't get water from a deep well with a short rope.' It's true. Fates are appointed, and forms are fitted to their appointed functions. There's nothing that can be added or sub- tracted. I'm afraid Hui will start talking to the Marquis of Ch'i about the Tao of Yao and Shun and the Yellow Emperor, or even get into Sui Jen and Shen Nung. Then that \"lord\" will search in himself, and finding nothing even vaguely similar, will begin to feel doubt. When princes doubt, death draws near. \"Haven't you heard about the sea bird that landed long ago be- side the city wall of Lu?\" Confucius continued. \"The Marquis of Lu gave it a ceremonial welcome and offered libations to it in the ancestral temple. He ordered the grand music of the Chiu Shao to be performed for it, and the great sacrifice of an ox, a sheep, and a pig was made as an offering of food. The bird looked mystified and sad. It wouldn't eat a sliver nor drink a single cup. After three days, it died. This was treating a bird like you'd treat yourself, not treating a bird like a bird. \"To treat a bird like a bird, you perch it in a deep grove and let it wander over sandy islets and let it float on rivers and lakes. You feed it eels and minnows and let it fly in a well-ordered flock until it stops. Then you leave it free and easy to choose where it may dwell. Birds despise the simple sound of human voices. How could that sea bird put up with all that racket they put it through? If the grand music of Hsien Ch'ih and the Chiu Shao were per- formed in the wilds of Lake Tung-t'ing, the birds would fly off, the beasts flee, and the fish dive deep.

Getting to Living [CHAPTER 1 9 ] A NYONE WHO ' S GOTTEN TO THE FACTS OF LIFE WON ' T try to make life do what living can't. Anyone who's gotten to the facts of fate won't try to make \"knowing\" serve where nothing works. To nourish the physical form it is necessary first to have things. But there are those who have things to spare who still aren't able to take care of their forms. To have life, it is necessary not to be separated from one's form. Yet there are those who've kept their forms, but still have lost living. When life comes, you can't reject it. You can't stop it when it goes. That's sad, but true. There are those of this world who think nourishing only the form is enough to nurture the perpetual in- fant that is life, but the fruit of such nurturing is not living. What is enough, then? Although they can't do enough, they can't do nothing, either. They can't avoid doing something. For those who would reject doing for the sake of form alone, there's nothing better than rejecting the world.

Let life be enough, and its essence will be undiminished. When your form is whole and your essence eternally beginning again at the begin- ning, you are one with heaven.

M ASTER LIEH Tzu I NQUIRED OF THE GUARD OF THE PASS, Kuan Yin, \"People who've 'gotten there' can go underwater without getting stuck there. They can walk through fires without getting hot. They can rise high above the ten thousand things without fear. What I'd like to ask is, how do they get to that point?\" \"They do it by guarding their pure ch'i,\" Kuan Yin replied. \"It's not the sort of thing you can learn, like a skill, nor is it the result of daring. Stay a moment, and I'll explain. \"Whatever has an appearance or a semblance, whatever makes a sound or has a color—they're all things. One thing can't be much different from another. Which should take precedence? They're all just bright appearances. \"But what creates things is formless and stays at the still point of the changeless. Now, whoever gets hold of this and dwells in it alone may not be detained, may not be stopped by things. People like this can inhabit a place where there is no excess, can hide in a space that has no hint of a boundary, and can ramble free and easy from the endings to the beginnings of the ten thousand things. They will be at one with the heart they were born with, nourish their ch'i, harmonize the power of their virtue, and get Getting to Living through to that which creates things. What is heaven-born they sustain, complete, within them. What is of the spirit is never re- jected. How could mere things confound them? \"So it is when a drunken man falls from his chariot—though he might be injured, he won't be killed. His bones are put together like everyone else's, but his injury is different. His spirit was whole: he didn't know he was riding; he didn't know he'd fallen out. Fear of death had no way to penetrate his breast. And so he confronted things without a flutter of fear. If one may find a wholeness in wine like this, how much more wholeness may one draw from heaven? The sage resides in heaven; there is no thing there that can harm him. Such a one, though bent on revenge, doesn't wreak it on the weapon of his enemy any more than even the most ill-tempered of men, being struck by a falling tile, would blame the tile. Such a one will bring equality to All-under- heaven, and do away with sentences of death or maiming. So goes the Tao. \"Don't start with the heaven one can know, but with heaven's heaven. Begin with this heaven, and the Power of Virtue comes to life. Begin with the heaven invented by people, and the thieving begins. Don't oppress heaven nor despise humankind, and the people will come to know what's true.\" C ONFUCIUS, EMERGING FROM A GROVE IN CH ' U, SAW A hunch- back snapping up cicadas with the tip of a rod, as easily as if he were picking berries. \"An artist!\" Confucius cried. \"Is there a Tao to this?\" \"I have Tao,\" the hunchback replied. \"For five or six months, I balanced two clay pellets on the tip of the stick, and they never fell off. By then, only the tiniest cicadas got away. When I could balance three pellets at a time, I lost only about one in ten. Then I practiced with five pellets, and never dropped a one. Then it was just like picking berries.

How could it come to pass that I shouldn't get them?\" Confucius turned back to his followers and said, \"'Use the knight's heart, undivided. There the spirit will congeal.' That old saying certainly applies to this hunchbacked gentleman.\" Then Yen Hui said to Confucius, \"When I was crossing the rough, dangerous waters at Ch'ang-shen, the ferryman handled the boat like a spirit. So I asked him, 'Can one learn to handle a boat like this?' And he replied, 'It can be done. Many good swim- mers have the ability. And then there are your divers. They can do it before they've ever even seen a boat.' I asked him for more, but he wouldn't say. Dare I ask you to explain?\" Confucius answered, \"That many good swimmers can do it is because they've forgotten water. As for divers being able to mas- ter boating before ever seeing a boat, well, they look at the rough and dangerous depths as you would look on a highland cart track. An overturned boat is no more to them than a stuck cart is to you. Stuck or tipped over, when it's something you've seen ten thou- sand times before, it's not something that really gets to you. So you can go on without fear. \"Shooting for chips,\" Confucius continued, \"a man might show great skill with the bow; for a brass buckle, he'll try to keep it simple, and take aim. Start him shooting for good yellow gold, and he might as well be blind. His skill remains the same, but as his attention turns toward the prize, externals intrude. When exter- nals intrude, what's internal can get twisted.\" W HEN T ' IEN K ' AI-CHIN HAD AN AUDIENCE WITH DUKE WEI of Chou, the duke said, \"I hear that Chu Hsien has made a study of living.

What could I have learned from the master?\" Getting to Living \"Don't be so humble,\" Duke Wei prodded. \"I'm listening.\" K'ai-chih said, \"I've heard the master say, 'Being good at living is just like being a good shepherd—keep your eye out for strag- glers, and whip them back into the herd.'\" \"What does that mean?\" Duke Wei asked. \"In Lu,\" K'ai-chih said, \"there was Shan Pao, who lived under an overhang in the mountains and consumed only water. He had no intercourse with ordinary folks. At seventy, he had the com- plexion of an infant. Unfortunately, a hungry tiger found him and devoured him. \"Then there was Chang Yi. There wasn't a mansion or low hut where there was a party he'd pass up. At forty, he was struck by a raging fever and died. \"Shan Pao cared only for internal things, and a tiger ate his out- sides. Chang Yi cared only for external things, and a raging fever took his insides. Of these two masters, you could properly say, 'He didn't whip up his stragglers.' \"Confucius said, 'Hiding what's inside like some treasure, try- ing to show off like the shining sun, or making yourself stand right in the middle, on both legs, solid as a tree, here-and-now? The third of these courses will doubtless lead you to get a reputa- tion for going to extremes.' \"Now, when people are setting out across dangerous country where it's said one in ten may be waylaid, fathers and sons, older and younger brothers will take sword and halberd in hand, and will have a full party of armed followers before they set out.

He fell ill and remained in his chambers for several days. Among the scholar-knights of Ch'i, there was a certain Huang- tzu the Bold Speaker. He said, \"Sir, you are wounding yourself. What power has a ghost to injure a duke? When one's store of ch'i is exhausted, dispersed and not recovered, then there's not enough to let you do anything. If it rises and doesn't fall, then you get real good at being angry. If it goes down and doesn't come back up, you get real good at forgetting things.

When a lumberjack studied it, then chose to spare it, Chuang Tzu asked why. \"There's no good material in it.\" \"This tree,\" Chuang Tzu replied, \"because it has no value as material for anything, will live out its full string of days.\" Coming out of the mountains, the master stopped by the hut of an old friend. Delighted, the friend instructed a servant to kill and cook a goose. \"One goose can cackle,\" the servant asked, \"and one can't. Which shall I kill?\" \"Kill the one that can't,\" the host replied. The next day, Chuang Tzu's disciples asked, \"That mountain tree yesterday got to run out its destined string of years because it was of no use. Then the host's goose was cooked because of its lack of usefulness. Where, Teacher, do you stand on this?\" Chuang Tzu laughed. \"Will I stick somewhere between use- fulness and uselessness? Somewhere between seems like the right answer, but it's not—because there, you can't keep from being drawn in. But that's not the case if you just get to the char- iot of the Tao and the power of its virtue. Then you'll drift or ramble where there is neither praise nor blame. Be a dragon. Be a worm. Change with the season. No need to specialize in any- thing. You may rise or go down, making harmony your measure. You can drift or ramble with the ancestor of the ten thousand things, a thing among things, not treating things as mere things. What would there be then to draw you in? Moving like water— this is the method of Shen Nung and the Yellow Emperor. It doesn't work to get wound up in treating things like things out- side yourself, or to labor at handing down codes of human behav- ior. If you go that way, joining together leads only to coming apart, completion only to destruction, worthiness to conniving, and unworthiness to being duped. What, after all, is worth get- ting, what thing would you let pierce your heart? What is there to hold to? It's sad, but if it's not yet in your hearts, my young knights, put this there—only the little village home that is the Tao and the power of its virtue.\" W HEN I-LIAO OF SHIH-NAN HAD AN AUDIENCE WITH THE Marquis of Lu, he noticed that the marquis looked unhappy. \"My prince looks so unhappy. What troubles you?\" \"I've studied the Tao of former kings,\" he answered, \"and I have cultivated the way of former princes. I've shown respect to ancestral spirits and honored the worthy. I follow them as if they were my own parents and never live apart from them. And still, I can't seem to avoid calamity. And that's why I am so unhappy.\" \"The arts you practice to avoid calamity are shallow,\" Master Shih-nan replied. \"The furred fox and the spotted leopard perch in groves on the mountain or crouch in caves in the cliffs. They stay quiet, going about by night, remaining at home in daylight. Even 113 11 2"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu when they're hungry and thirsty, they stay stealthy, sneaking out only along hidden paths beside rivers and lakes to hunt for their food. Yet no matter how set against it they may be, they can't es- cape the calamity that is the net or the trap. And what's at fault? It's their fine pelts that make for their disaster. \"And is this not true today,\" he continued, \"isn't the state of Lu my prince's pelt? I want my prince to skin his form, to wash all desire from his heart, and to go wandering in the wilderness where there are no people. In the south of Yueh, there is a city called the Kingdom of Sturdy Virtue. Its people are ignorant and simple, short on selfishness, and lacking desire. They know about making stuff, but not about hoarding; about giving, but not about receiving. They can't tell where 'righteousness' fits. They don't know what rituals they ought to carry out. Like madmen and wild women they go about, treading the Great Path. Births make them happy. They bury their dead. I want you to leave this coun- try, break free of its customs. Get on the road that leads there, and go on.\" \"That way is long and dangerous,\" the marquis said. \"There are mountains and rivers. I haven't a cart or a boat.\" \"If you stop dwelling in haughtiness,\" Master Shih-nan said, \"and leave all conventional dwelling behind, that alone will serve quite well for conveyance.\" \"But there are no people in that dark forest. Who would be my neighbor? Where would I go for provisions? How shall I eat? How could I ever get there?\" \"If you cut down on your expenses,\" Master Shih-nan replied, \"cut down on your desires, then even no provisions will be suffi- cient. On foot, you can ford rivers, you can drift out to sea until you can gaze off forever without seeing the shore. Go forward, go on and you'll never know an ending. Those who come to see you off may leave the shore and hurry home. You will have gone a long way indeed.\" Shih-nan continued, \"One who owns people is bound; one who is owned by people, miserable. So it was that Sage Yao would not own men, nor would he be owned. I want only that you be un- The Mountain Tree bound, freed from unhappiness, so you may wander with the Tao to the Great Emptiness. \"If you're crossing the river in an outrigger and an empty boat rams your craft, even if you're a hot-blooded man, you won't be enraged. But if there's someone in the other boat, you'll yell at him to get out of your way. If he doesn't hear you, you'll yell again. And if he still pays no heed, you'll yell a third time, and follow that with really ugly sounds. You weren't angry the first time, but you are now. It was empty. Now it's full. If you empty yourself before you go rambling in the world, who will harm you?\" C ONFUCIUS WAS SURROUNDED ON THE BORDER OF CH ' EN and Ts'ai, and for seven days had no firewood for cooking. T'ai-kung Jen went to console him. \"You almost died, eh?\" \"It's so.\" \"You hate death, don't you?\" \"It's so,\" Confucius repeated. \"Let me try telling you how to keep from dying,\" Jen said. \"In the Eastern Sea, there's a bird called the Lazybird. It's not much of a bird. It's always ruffled and molting, and apparently has no abil- ities. They must help one another in order even to fly, and when they perch, they are propped one against another. None dares go to the front of the flock when it moves ahead, or to straggle when it moves away. When feeding, none goes first. They all prefer the leavings. Because none is cut from the flock, no one can get at them to do them harm. Thus they stay clear of calamity. \"As they say,\" he continued, \" 'the straight tree's cut first, the sweet well the first to be drained.' Your intention has been to wear your knowledge like a hair ornament to startle the ignorant and to cultivate yourself so as to appear enlightened before ordi- nary folks. You shine and flash as if you were carrying the sun and moon in your hands. So you can't stay clear. \"Long ago, I heard an accomplished one say, 'The braggart has no merit. When merit is accomplished, it begins to decay; when 115 11 4"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Mountain Tree THE ESSENTIAL CHUANG Tzu fame is accomplished, it's already on the wane.' Who can put merit and fame away and get back in the great flock of people? For such a one, the Tao flows. It doesn't stay put in bright light. He gets where he's going and doesn't try to make fame a dwelling place. Simple and constant, almost crazy, he brushes over his foot- prints and sweeps aside his influence. He doesn't do merit and fame. Therefore, he doesn't blame others and others don't blame him. You never hear about one who's really gotten there. Why do you want to be famous?\" \"Isn't that good!\" Confucius exclaimed. He then took leave of his traveling companions, sent off his disciples, and went to the Great Swamp, where he wore skins and bound his hair in cloth and lived on acorns and chestnuts. When he wandered among the animals, their herds didn't flee, and when he went among birds, their flocks didn't fly. If neither bird nor beast despised him, could people? C ONFUCIUS ASKED OF MASTER SANG-HU, \" I ' VE BEEN DRIVEN from Lu twice now. In Sung, they cut a tree down on me. I had to cover my trail when I left Wei. I've been in abject poverty in Shang and in Chou. I was surrounded on the border of Ch'en and Ts'ai. Since I've suffered these various calamities, I don't seem to be as well connected as I was. My friends and disciples are scattering. What's the matter?\" \"Are you the only one left,\" Master Sang-hu asked, \"who hasn't heard of Lin Hui? When he fled on the collapse of the city-state of Chia, he cast down his jade seal of office—worth a thousand gold coins—and carried away his baby on his back. Somebody said, 'As far as value is concerned, a baby's not worth even a bolt of cloth. And bother—a baby is a lot more bother. You threw away your jade seal and carried off your baby. Why?' Lin Hui answered, \"The seal and I were united only for profit, while this had to do with heaven. Things brought together for the sake of profit, when they meet poverty, misfortune, calamity, or the threat of bodily harm, will cast each other off. Things that belong together because of 'heaven,' meeting poverty, misfortune, calamity, or threat of bodily harm, will cling even more closely together. To cast off and to cling together are far apart indeed.\" \"A gentleman's friendship,\" Master Sang-hu continued, \"is like cool water; a petty man's friendship is like sweet wine. A gentleman's conversation leads to strong affection while a petty man's sweetness becomes cloying and grows divisive. Those who come together for no good reason will part for the same.\" \"I respectfully accept your instruction,\" Confucius said, and with a light and lively step and easy manner departed for home. He gave up his studies and gave away his books. His disciples no longer came to bow before him, but their affection for him in- creased. On another day, Master Sang-hu said, \"When Shun was about to die, he charged Yu, saying, 'Use caution. As for the form, let it follow along. As for feelings, let them go where they are led. What follows is not left behind, and what goes where it's led is not be- labored. If you're neither left behind nor belabored, you won't de- pend on cultivation to support your form, and when you don't de- pend on cultivation to support your form, you certainly won't depend on things.'\" C HUANG Tzu PATCHED HIS OLD COAT WITH PIECES FROM A bolt of rough cloth, lashed on his sandals with hemp rope, and went off to see the King of Wei. \"The old master is in great distress, eh?\" the king asked. \"Poor, but not in distress,\" Chuang Tzu replied. \"If one has the Tao and the power of its virtue and yet does not practice it, that one, you could say, was in distress. When your clothes are thread- bare and your shoes worn out, that's just being poor, not being used up. It's merely what I call 'not having yet met the proper sea- son.'

Yen Hui, arms folded across his chest, turned and studied him. Confucius worried that Hui might admire him excessively and thereby do injury to himself. \"Hui,\" he said, \"it is easy to avoid being injured by heaven. It is difficult to avoid being benefited by humankind. There is no beginning without an end. Humankind and heaven are one. Who is it, now, who's been playing?\" \"I dare to ask,\" Hui said, \"what you mean by 'It's easy to avoid being injured by heaven.\" \"Hunger, thirst, cold and heat, dwelling in poverty and having your way blocked—these are heaven and earth doing what they do. Just things moving with the flow. They are what we mean when we say, ' Everything passes.' A minister of state doesn't abandon his lord. How much more true shall this be of those who are servants of heaven?\" Hui then asked, \"What do you mean by, 'It's hard not to be ben- efited by humankind'?\" \"When you are first employed, everything comes to you. Rank and wealth come along together as if they were inexhaustible. This is the harvest of things, but it's not something to do with the self. The true destiny of a person is beyond this sort of thing. A gentleman is not a bandit. A worthy man is not a sneak thief. If I want things, what am I?\" Confucius continued, \"So it is said, 'There's no bird wiser than the swallow.' Its eye won't alight twice on a spot it finds less than fitting. Even if it drops the fruit it's eating there, it will just let go and get away. It fears people, but it makes its dwelling among them, finding security in eaves and food at their altars to the soil and grain.\" Hui asked, \"What do you mean by, 'There's no beginning that is without an end'?\" \"The ten thousand things change,\" Confucius said, \"but we do not know what brings about that change. How shall we know their endings? How shall we know where they are born? Just stay straight and wait for them. That's all.\" \"But what do you mean by 'Humankind and Heaven are one'?\" Confucius answered, \"There is humankind because there is heaven. There is heaven because there is heaven.

The weird jaybird observed, aiming to take advantage itself, but in turn losing sight of its own true condition. \"Aiiee!\" Chuang Tzu cried. \"Things are so bound together! Different kinds of creatures all bound together in this.\" He'd just put away his crossbow and turned to leave when one of the lord's foresters came running up and began to berate him. When Chuang Tzu got home, for three long months he refused to come into the courtyard to speak with his students. Lin Chu came to him and asked, \"Why is it that you have given up hold- ing audience for us in the courtyard?\" \"For the sake of my form, I almost lost myself,\" Chuang Tzu replied. \"Peering into muddy water, I took it for a clear pool. I've heard Lao Tzu say, 'When you go where common men go, do as they do.' Just now I was wandering at Tiao-ling and forgot myself.

What sort of thinking and what sort of worrying about things in your mind does it take before you know Tao? In what place, in what guise, may I find peace in the Tao?

Once we've become things, how could it be any- thing but difficult to get all the way home to the root? Easy, per- haps, for one who is great. \"Life is a follower of death,\" he continued. \"Death gives birth to life. Who knows where the thread of self begins? Human life is gathered ch'i. Gather ch'i, and that's life. Disperse it, and that's death. Life and death are disciples. They follow one another. Can I call either a calamity? The ten thousand things are one in this, then: what's big and pretty is called wonderful, what's ugly is called rotten. But rotten things change into wonders, and won- ders rot in time. So it is said, 'Get through to this: All-under- heaven is one ch'i.' Therefore, the sage threads all things like shells on a single string.\" Knowing asked the Yellow Emperor, \"When I asked Do-nothing Say-nothing, he didn't answer. He didn't just not answer, he didn't even know about answering. And when I asked Mad Mouther, he got into telling me but couldn't finish. It wasn't that he didn't tell me. He was in the midst of telling me when he just forgot. But Knowing Wandered North when I asked you, you knew the answer. How can you say, 'We're not even close'?\" \"The one who doesn't know is right,\" the Yellow Emperor replied. \"The one who forgot is pretty close. You and I aren't even close because we know.\" When Mad Mouther heard about this, he said, \"That Yellow Emperor is one who really knows about words!\" H EAVEN AND EARTH POSSESS GREATNESS AND BEAUTY AND use no words. The Four Seasons possess the Brilliant Method but don't discuss it. The ten thousand things possess the perfect principles but do not speak.

The ten thousand things can't help but lead people like these. That's what Tao is. \"The most learned may not know this, the logician may not find its sweet solution. And so the sage breaks with learning and logic. What can be poured into without ever overflowing? What can be drawn from without ever emptying? That is what the sage holds to.

That Way of the Gentleman of yours is a long way from this.

And if some live long while others die young, how great, really, is the difference? With only a moment to enjoy, how could there be time to decide whether Yao or Chieh was right or wrong? \"Fruits and creeping melon vines each follow their own rule,\" Lao Tzu continued. \"The ways of human groups also, although difficult to perceive, can be made out.

Since he was in doubt, he divined, and the answer came, \"Kill the turtle and use its shell in divina- tion.

In his lust for get- ting, he forgot all claims of kinship, paying no mind to his parents or brother, even refusing to make ancestral sacrifices. Wherever he went, in great states guards patrolled city walls, while in small ones people took to their strongholds. All the ordinary people suffered. Confucius said to Liu-hsia Chi, \"A father must be able to com- mand his son. An elder brother must be able to instruct his younger brother. If this is not so, there can be no value in kinship.

With Yen Hui driving the chariot and Tzu-kung on his right, Confucius drove off to an audience with Robber Chih. Recouping his forces on the sunny side of Mount T'ai, Robber Chih was mincing a human liver for his lunch when Confucius arrived, dismounted, and presented himself to the usher with two bows. \"I am of the K'ung clan of the state of Lu.

To understand the Weave of Heaven and Earth, and to have the ability to do, and the eloquence to speak about all things—this is called Middling Virtue. To be bold, fierce, deter- mined, and daring, and to gather a throng of warriors to lead—this is called Lower Virtue. Whoever has the power of even one of these virtues has enough to set himself upon the South-facing Throne, and to be titled the Lonely One, sole and only emperor. \"Now, the general,\" he continued, \"embodies all three at once. You're eight feet and two spans tall, with a face and eyes full of light. Your lips are red as cinnabar, your teeth white and regular as a string of shells. Your voice rings like the legendary Yellow Bell. And yet your only title is 'Robber Chih.' I'm deeply ashamed for you and beg to be permitted to get you a better one. \"If it's agreeable to the general,\" Confucius said, \"to listen to his servant, his servant begs to be sent as ambassador south to the lands of Wu and Yueh, north to the realms of Ch'i and Lu, east to the states of Sung and Wei, and west to Ch'in and Ch'u, to get them to build you a wall of several hundred li, and establish there a capital of several tens of myriads of people, where you will be honored as one among the feudal lords. You will give All-under- heaven a new birth, disarming and disbanding your troops, gath- Robber Chih ering and nurturing your brothers and kin, and together with them performing the sacrifices due your ancestors as the found- ing ancestors of a state. This is worthy, knightly behavior, and the answer to the dreams of All-under-heaven.\" \"Come here, Ch'iu,\" Robber Chih spat. \"Those who can be ruled by thoughts of profit or reformed by admonishments are all what I'd call low, mean, benighted people. The fact that I'm big and good looking, that people sigh in their hearts when they see me, that's all just inherited straight from my mother and father. You didn't tell me that. Did you think I didn't know? I've also heard it said that people who are addicted to praising you to your face will tear you down when your back is turned. Now, you, Ch'iu, offer me a big walled town full of people, thinking to rule me with thoughts of profit—as if I were a common fool. How long could I keep the place? As big a city as it might be, there's no city equal to All-under-heaven. Yao and Shun held All-under-heaven, but their sons and grandsons didn't hold on to enough ground to stick an awl in. T'ang and Wu each stood as the Son of Heaven, but their descendants have been totally annihilated. Wasn't that precisely because they had profited so much? \"I've heard that in ancient times,\" Robber Chih continued, \"when beasts were many and people few, that people lived in nests in trees to escape them. They ate acorns and chestnuts by day and perched in the trees at night. That's why they were known as the Nesters. They didn't even know about clothes. In the summer, they collected firewood to burn in the winter. So they were called People Who Know How to Live.

Robber Chih \"Who does the world call 'worthy knights'? Po Yi and Shu Ch'i—but Po Yi and Shu Ch'i threw away the lordship of Ku-chu and chose to starve to death on Mount Shouyang. Their flesh and bones went unburied. \"Pao Chiao made good conduct his only adornment,\" Robber Chih continued, \"but when he realized that even the acorns he ate 'belonged' to some lord of the world, he embraced a tree until he starved. When Shen-t'u Ti offered admonishment no one would listen to, he loaded a boulder in his pack and jumped into the river to feed the fish and turtles. Chieh Tzu-t'ui got all the way to loyalty. He sliced his own thigh to feed Duke Wen. But then, when Duke Wen turned his back on him, he went off in a rage and hugged some tree while the forest burned around him. When the girl Wei Sheng had sworn to meet under the bridge didn't show up, and the water rose to meet him instead, he kept his appointment and died there, embracing a pillar of the bridge. These four were no different than road-kill—flattened dogs, pigs fleeing the slaughterer, beggars with their alms gourds. They were all so caught up in getting a name that they took life itself lightly, forgetting that they must first nurture their bodies if they would live long. \"Who does the world call loyal? There's none to match Prince Pi-kan and Wu Tzu-hsu. Wu was thrown into the river to drown. Pi-kan had his heart cut out.

But all the swordsmen who are granted an audience with the king have hair like brambles and bristling beards,\" the prince replied. \"They wear loose caps with coarse straps dangling, . and robes cut short behind.

The crown prince escorted him to an audience with the king. The king bared his sword's white blade as he awaited them. Chuang Tzu entered the palace doorway unhurriedly, and when he saw the king, he didn't bow. The king demanded, \"What have you got to show me now that you've gotten the crown prince to put you forward?\" \"I've heard the Great King delights in swords, so I've brought mine to the king's audience.\" \"And what special powers have you with the sword?\" \"My sword?

But let me demonstrate.\" \"You, sir, go and take your rest in your quarters,\" the king said. \"Await my command. When the show is arranged, I will call for you.\" For seven days, the king held combat. Some sixty swordsmen were killed or wounded. He finally chose five or six to submit themselves and their swords to the test before the court. Then he summoned Chuang Tzu. \"Today we'll show these knights some honest swordsmanship,\" he smiled. \"I've been waiting for this,\" Chuang Tzu replied. \"Long sword or short, sir?\" the king asked. \"Oh, any kind will do,\" Chuang Tzu smiled. \"In fact, I brought three that might be fit for a king. If you don't mind, I'll speak of them before submitting them to the test. I have the Sword of the Son of Heaven, the Sword of the Feudal Lord, and the sword of the ordinary man.\" \"What's this Sword of the Son of Heaven like?\" the king demanded. \"The Sword of the Son of Heaven takes the valley and the great stone wall of the state of Yen as its point, the realms of Ch'i and Tai for its blade, the lands of Chin and Way for its forte and foible. The states of Chou and Sung are its hilt, and Han and Wei are its pommel. It's securely wrapped by the four barbarian tribes and tied with the string of the Four Seasons. Its scabbard is the Sea of Po, and its belt is the Mountain of the Enduring Heart. The Five Elements give it order, and the example of the Power of Virtue provides its judgments.

Such is the Sword of the Son of Heaven.\" King Wen looked confused, as if he'd lost a trial with himself. \"And the Sword of the Feudal Lord,\" he asked, \"what about that?\" \"The Sword of the Feudal Lord has knowing and courageous knights for its point, pure and chaste knights for its blade, worthy and excellent knights for its forte and foible, loyal and sage knights as its hilt, and bold warriors and bravos as its pommel.

Your servant dares to suggest that this is unworthy of you.\" Speaking of Swords The king took Chuang Tzu in hand and led him into the High Hall. The chief chef prepared a meal, but the king just circled around it. \" Oh, Great King,\" Chuang Tzu urged, \"sit quiet. Settle your ch'i.

The swordsmen submitted themselves to their swords in their own chambers. 151 15 0"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Old Fisherman The Old Fisherman [CHAPTER 31 C ONFUCIUS WENT TO STROLL IN BLACK CURTAIN GROVE. When he got to the knoll called the Apricot Altar, he sat down to rest. His disciples dug out their books while he fingered his lute and sang. He wasn't half through his song when an old fisherman appeared, climbed from his boat, and approached. His beard and brows were turning white, his hair hanging uncombed down his back, his broad sleeves flapping. He came up the bank and stopped when he got to dry ground. With his left hand on his knee and his right propping his chin, he listened. When the piece ended, he called to Tzu-kung and Tzu-lu, and the two disciples approached him. He pointed at Confucius and asked, \"What does he do?\" \"He's a gentleman from the state of Lu,\" Tzu-lu replied. When asked to which clan the master belonged, Tzu-lu answered, \"He's a K'ung.\" \"This Mr. K'ung—what's his calling?\" Tzu-lu hadn't yet formulated his answer when Tzu-kung spoke up. \"Master K'ung's nature is submissive to the principle of loy- alty and to his standing by his word. He himself practices benev- olence and righteousness, refines and perfects rites and music, and identifies what is proper in human relationships. Loyal to his lord above him, he passes down means of transformation, to the profit of all. Such is the calling of Master K'ung.\" \"Is he a lord, with lands?\" \"No. ,, \"Is he an officer of some king or feudal lord?\" \"No,\" Tzu-kung answered again. The visitor laughed as he turned to go, saying, \"Benevolence, eh? Benevolence. But I'm afraid he won't get out alive. To embit- ter the heart and mind and belabor the form, to walk his truth along a cliff like this . . . woo-hoo! He's split a long way from the Tao.\" When Tzu-kung reported back to Confucius, the master put aside his lute, jumped up and said, \"He's a sage!\" Confucius went down after him, arriving at the edge of the marsh just as the old man was grasping his pole and pulling his boat back into the water. Looking over his shoulder and seeing Confucius, he came back and stood before him. Confucius backed away, then, after bowing twice, came forward again. \"What do you want?\" the fisherman asked. \"Just now,\" Confucius said, \"the elder made some rather mys- terious remarks, and then departed. Unworthy, I don't under- stand your meaning. I humbly await the fresh breeze of your at- tention. If you will favor me with the sound of your voice, I might yet learn something.\" \"Ho! Deep indeed is your addiction to learning!\" Confucius bowed twice again, and when he rose, said, \"From my youth until this very day, I have cultivated learning—sixty- nine years. But I haven't yet heard the teaching that gets there. Dare I listen with other than an open mind and heart?\" \"Birds of a feather flock together, and all sing the same song.

When someone does something that's none of his business, that's called excessive. To bring up topics no one has mentioned is called artful insinuating. To permit another's ideas to change your speech is fawning. To speak without distinguishing right from wrong is simpering flattery. To love talking about other peo- ple's moral weakness is called slander. To break up friendships and drive a wedge between relatives is called being worse than a thief. To praise or blame falsely for any purpose is shameful wickedness. Without regard to right or wrong, to try to face both ways at once and to use the desires of others against them is called treachery. In the world outside, these eight afflictions spread chaos among people; within the self, they inflict deep wounds. No gentleman will befriend one who engages in them, nor will any lord employ such a one. \"As for the four calamities,\" the old fisherman continued, \"being addicted to undertaking great projects and changing sim- ple, constant ways for the sake of heaping up the dirt of merit and fame—this is called ambition; to monopolize knowledge and in- sist upon having your own way, and misappropriating others' things for your own benefit is called avarice; to see your own ex- cesses while refusing to change, or to listen to reproof only to grow worse, is called deaf obstinacy; to praise those who agree with you only to refuse to see any good, even when it's there, in those who differ is called boastful egotism. These are the four calamities. If you can get away from the eight afflictions and stay away from the four calamities, you might begin to be teachable.\" Confucius looked crestfallen. He sighed, and after bowing twice again, said, \"I've been driven twice from Lu. I had to cover my trail when I left Wei. In Sung, they cut down a tree on me. I was surrounded on the border between Ch i en and Ts'ai. I don't know how I've lost out.

True anger can be awesome even before it's visible. True affection brings har- mony even before it brings a smile. When truth is inside, the spirit can move abroad. That's the noble value of truth. \"It has uses when dealing with people: in serving loved ones, it is kindness and devotion; in serving the ruler, it is loyalty and straightforwardness; at a drinking party, it's joyful merriment; at a funeral, it is sorrowful mourning. The purpose of loyalty and straightforwardness is meritorious service. The purpose of a drinking party is merriment. The purpose of funerals is the ex- pression of sorrow. The purpose of serving loved ones is their comfort. The most elegant plan for achieving all this meritorious accomplishment doesn't involve following any single set of foot- The Old Fisherman prints. When you comfort your loved ones, there's no need to the- orize about means; joyful drinking doesn't require quibbling about the cups; to express sorrowful mourning, there's no need to look up appropriate ritual.

So the sage follows heaven as surely as water flows downhill and finds value only in truth. He doesn't get snared in the grasp of custom. \"The stupid run against this, \" he continued. \"They can't fol- low heaven. Their hearts overflowing with 'humanity,' they don't know the value of truth and so they follow along after every change in custom, and never get enough. It's so sad that you fell into the mire of human deceit so young, and have heard the great Tao so late.\" Confucius bowed twice again, rose, and said, \"But now I've at- tained it, it's a blessing from heaven.

But he didn't even turn to- ward them. He stood waiting until the waves had settled in the wake and the sound of poling faded away. Only then did he dare mount.

We hope it will help readers distinguish between real historical people and places, mythical people and places, and ad hoc creations of this most imagina- tive of authors. Any names not found here may be safely assumed to be those of either purely fictional characters, or of minor historical charac- ters used by the author to give a patina of historicity to his fictional en- terprises. In addition to names, we offer some definition and explanation of a few important terms and repeated themes, and an occasional comment on word play, both apparent puns and graphic play made possible by the nature of the Chinese characters. Unless they are mentioned more than once in the work, we will not generally identify figures whose only in- tended function is obviously rhetorical.

CH ' ANG HUNG A high official in the reign of one of the kings of the Chou dynasty (until the Ch'in dynasty [221–206 BCE], earthly, as op- posed to mythical or supernatural rulers, were referred to as kings rather than as emperors). Context clearly indicates his intended func- tion in the text. CHAO WEN The legendary and perhaps also historical master of the in- strument usually translated as lute (sometimes as zither). The lute of Chuang Tzu's time was probably fairly closely related to the modern ch'in, an instrument very closely related to the Japanese koto. Some ch'in music and a lot of koto music is readily available on record, tape, or co, for those who'd like to get and inkling of what Chuang Tzu was thinking of, or remembering, as he made this reference. CH ' EN AND Ts'AI These were petty feudal states in the Spring and Au- tumn period of the Chou dynasty. They are famous,primarily for re- jecting Confucius, who was, at the time, a politically dangerous guest. CH'I A strong North China state in the Spring and Autumn period. It had more or less collapsed by Chuang Tzu's time. CH ' I-CHI AND HUA-LIU These horses, credited with running a thou- sand li (one third of a mile to the 1i) in a day, certainly qualify for mythical, not just legendary, status. CHI CH'U A mythical culture hero, not quite on a par with Fu Hsi, whose exploits are noted later in this glossary. CHIEH Also called Chieh Kuei, he is perhaps the last historical ruler of the first Chinese dynasty, the Hsia, which—although long regarded as legendary in the West—has lately been finding supporters as an iden- tifiable stage in the historical development of China, if not as a \"dy- nasty.\" He is the first of the \"bad last\" rulers made necessary in tradi- tional Chinese historiography by the ideological position that says legitimacy (\"The Mandate of Heaven\") has a moral base. If he was overthrown by the founder of the Shang dynasty (the agreed-upon \"first historical dynasty\"), he must have been evil. Presented as a paragon of arrogance, brutality, and lust, he was nonetheless only Glossary sent into exile by the founder of Shang. Kuan Lung-feng, mentioned as having been murdered by him, had remonstrated when Chieh's abom- inable behavior (hot yang sexuality) caused two important rivers to dry up in shame. CHOU There are several. In Chinese, because their names are, in most cases, written with different characters, it's less confusing than it may be in English. The Chou mentioned in the same breath with Chieh of the Hsia is Chou Hsin, the \"bad last\" ruler of Shang. Sexual misbe- havior, specifically over attentiveness to a concubine, was, as with Chieh, a prominent factor in his evil reputation. At the request of his favorite, T'a Chi, he reportedly had built a pleasure grounds stocked with ponds of wine and featuring naked people hanging from the trees. When King Wu, founder of the Chou dynasty (a different char- acter is used for this Chou) overthrew him, he had Chou's own palace burned down around him. Too much yang, aided and abetted by too much yin, in the person of the concubine, causes the immorality that brings the downfall of the realm. The Chinese character thou used as the name of the dynasty (mentioned immediately above), in which Chuang Tzu lived and wrote, is, perhaps not merely coincidentally, also the character used for Chuang Tzu's personal name. CHUANG CHOU Also called Chuang Tzu, or Master Chuang, was the presumed author of the book called Chuang Tzu. His dates are now thought to have been in the latter half of the fourth century BCE. The character written to represent the syllable Chuang shows a strong man hiding under some leaves. Without the leaves, the remainder of the character means strong, robust, mature, in the prime of life. In modern Chinese, and most likely for quite a long time, the three stages of human life have been called ch'ing nian (the green years), chuang nian (the prime of life), and lao nian (the aged years). Readers of this book will doubtless recognize the lao of lao nian as the lao in the name Lao Tzu, the author of the other main Taoist classic, the Tao Te Ching. If the various Chuang Tzus presented here, from the \"real\" Chuang Tzu, the witty author of the \"Inner Chapters\" (1-7), to the fic- tional sword-fighting Chuang Tzu of chapter 30, share one thing, it is precisely the vigor of a human being in the prime of life, just as the words of Lao Tzu are clearly representative of the wisdom of age. Chuang Tzu's personal name, Chou, is the same as the name of the dynasty he lived under. Chuang Tzu is certainly representative of the 161 16 0"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Glossary prime of life of Chou culture, whether the pun works or not. Pseudo- nyms were common among Chinese authors, and if Chuang Tzu were a conscious pseudonym, it would help account for the lack of actual historical information about the author. Incidentally, although Lao Tzu is mentioned in the Chuang Tzu , and several lines that appear in the Tao Te Ching also appear here, some scholars believe it's likely that the Chuang Tzu actually existed as a complete text before the Tao Te Ching. CH'ul Sometimes referred to as Craftsman Ch'ui, the mythical inven- tor of the carpenter's compass and square, emblematic of the damage done to nature by even the most fundamental technological advances. CONFUCIUS Born in the state of Lu, Master K'ung, K'ung Ch'iu (551-479 BCE), was one of the world's great teachers. His importance is attested to by the fact that Chuang Tzu makes him the focal point of many of his wittiest sallies. It should be noted that the Chuang Tzu version of Confucius is almost always satirical, and most often wholly fictitious. In the Robber Chih story, Robber Chih refers to the master by his personal name, Ch'iu, something that would have been un- thinkable even in Confucius's own time, and something almost, if not quite, sacrilegious, by the time the Robber Chih chapter was written. On the other hand, it should be noted that the Confucius of the \"Inner Chapters\" (the first seven ) is treated pretty gently, and even in the later chapters he is given quite a few good lines. His followers are uni- formly given a good going-over, however. DUKE HUAN Ruler of the feudal state of Ch'i (reigned 685-643 BC - E), he was the first of five \"hegemons\" to dominate China, without formally overthrowing the Chou dynasty, during the era known as the Spring and Autumn period (722-481 BCE). Kuan Chung was his prime minis- ter. DUKE WEI This may be the historical son of Duke Huan. Fu Hsi The first of the five mythical rulers, a culture hero, he in- vented—among many other things—hunting, fishing, the tending of flocks, musical instruments, and the eight original trigrams from which the I Ching, or Classic of Change, was later constructed. HANTAN Capital of the feudal state of Chao; its people affected a stylish walk. Glossary HAO A small state in east central China. HEART AND MIND The single character we translate as \" heart and mind\" is the character hsin, in early forms a recognizable picture of a human heart. Any understanding of the meaning of the word is com- plicated by the fact that in some periods of early Chinese history, it was assumed that the heart was the organ of mental activity. People of European culture generally think of the mind as the organ of intellec- tual activity, and locate it in the brain. We believe that Chuang Tzu conceives of mental activity as properly involving both reason and emotion, logic and intuition. The word hsin, \"heart,\" is also often in- terpreted by Chinese philosophers as a shorthand for hsing, \"nature.\" Chuang Tzu appears to believe that it is in our natures to apprehend re- ality with both the heart and the mind at once. Hsi SHIH Woman of legendary beauty. HUAN Tou A minister under the legendary first Sage Emperor, Yao, he makes several appearances in the Confucian Shu Ching, \"Classic of History.\" He was banished during the period when the second Sage Emperor, Shun, ruled in conjunction with Yao. Hui Tzu Hui Shih, or Master Hui, was a historical person and a con- temporary of the historical Chuang Tzu. He was the most important figure in the school of the logicians or sophists. Chuang Tzu's sarcas- tic treatment of Hui Tzu as a man bound up in the spider web of words is tinctured by an appreciation of his intellect and wit. A real human friendship, and not merely an intellectual competition, ap- pears to lie at the foundation of Chuang Tzu's depiction. JAN CH ' I U Also known as Tzu Yu, he was a disciple of Confucius. In the Book of Mencius, Confucius is quoted as cursing Jan Ch'iu for his mistreatment of the people during his service as an official of a great family. The character presented here by Chuang Tzu seems stiff and a little less than straightforward. Considering Jan Ch'iu's later career, it may be that Chuang Tzu is also satirizing Confucius's rather gnomic teaching style here as well. KING WEN The Cultured King, sometimes called simply Wen, he was the ruler of the Chou state before it supplanted the Shang dynasty.

The play between wen and wu, the civil and military virtues, is a major theme of Chinese mythology. KUAN CHUNG See Duke Huan. Kuan Chung's thought was associated with the development of Legalism, a school of totalitarian political philosophy that reached its highest point only after Chuang Tzu's death. Chuang Tzu would have abhorred the Legalists' approach to government, and his portrayal of Kuan Chung as dismally stupid is likely a fair indication of his presentiments about Kuan's philosophy. The historical Confucius admired Kuan Chung, while Mencius, the great Confucian who was nearly a contemporary of Chuang Tzu, also despised him. He is regarded as China's first economist. KUAN LUNG-FENG A virtuous minister of Chieh, the \"last bad\" ruler of the Hsia dynasty. KUAN YIN (BORDER GUARD) He was the person credited with coercing Lao Tzu into writing down the Tao Te Ching (to earn passage through the pass).

LIEH Tzu The third of the famous Taoists after Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu, Master Lieh is seen here in several different lights. He rides Glossary the wind, but as Chuang Tzu suggests, he seems to find it hard to get beyond that sort of magic. In a few anecdotes he is, maybe, a wise man. In some he is, perhaps, a fool. A number of puns throughout the book having to do with the perils of discipleship are culminated in the story about Lieh Tzu and his master, Winepot, when the master suggests that Lieh Tzu follow the fleeing shaman/physiognomist. The eponymous book attributed to him is a late compilation, con- taining, among other things, most of the Lieh Tzu stories from Chuang Tzu.

In most cases where the text defines the function of a name, we have not in- cluded the name in the glossary. Here we grant her equal time with her rival, Hsi Shih. MASTER WINEPOT Lieh Tzu's master is a fictional creation of Chuang Tzu. The name has been previously translated as Master Pot, or left in transliteration as Hu Tzu, but it seems clear that Chuang Tzu wants to portray Lieh Tzu as the disciple of a Winepot. The passage begins with Lieh Tzu's intoxication with the powers of the shaman physiog- nomist; the word for \"drunkenness\" is used only one other time in the entire book (perhaps tellingly, in the passage in which Kuan Yin compares alcoholic and true enlightenment). The word hu, meaning explicitly \" wnepot,\" is found in the poetry of both T'ao Chien and Li Po, and the two famous poets were both drinkers and Taoists. The po- tentially ironic link between chemical and spiritual intoxication, drunkenness and enlightenment, was no more lost on Chuang Tzu than on these poets. MIN Tzu Min Tzu-ch'ien was a disciple of Confucius. He is said by Mencius to be an equal of Yen Hui, Confucius's favorite, as an exem- plar of virtuous conduct. Mo Tzu Mo Ti was the historical founder (fourth century BCE) of a re- ligion based on universal love, economy in ritual, and belief in a here- after. His followers are called Mohists. See Yang Chu. 165 16 4"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Glossary NONDOING Not not doing, but doing without ado. The ability to accomplish through nondoing is in the nature of the sage. For the Taoist, it is achieved through meditation, \"sitting forgetting,\" which, in allowing the meditator to be free of words, puts him or her in iden- tity with Tao. Nondoing is, thus, perfect doing, doing without effort or interest, without beginning or end, in the manner of Tao itself. It comes naturally to all beings, but must be unlearned, by forgetting, by those who have forgotten how to nondo. It is doing the best you can in a paradoxical sense: What is beyond the facts and your fate, you can't do; anything else you can do without overdoing is your best, even if it's not very good. NORTH SEA Jo God of the Northern Sea (that is, the Yellow Sea, east of North China, into which the Yellow River flows). Something amaz- ingly close to the Jo-Joe pun we offer here is in the original, where the name of the god is repeated as an element of the next phrase, making fun of the snobbishness of the relatively enlightened. Chuang Tzu ap- pears to share Shakespeare's infamous willingness to risk the world for the sake of a pun. P'ENG One of the truly great imaginative creations of Chuang Tzu. The modern Chinese character consists of a phonetic element, which gives the pronunciation, and a signific element, which means \"bird,\" the conventional interpretation being that it is the bird (signified) whose name is pronounced p'eng, like the phonetic element. But the phonetic element itself was originally used to stand for the bird's name, and the character formed by that phonetic standing alone is clearly a drawing of a very large bird in the earliest script. Its alterna- tive and now dominant meaning is also \"friend,\" \"companion,\" or \"match.\" Chuang Tzu is \"of a feather\" with this bird. P'ENG Tzu There is considerable disagreement about the age of this celebrated Chinese version of Methuselah. PI KAN A historical figure, Pi Kan appears several times in the Book of Documents. He was a loyal minister of Chou Hsin (aka Shou), the \"last bad\" king of the Shang. Chuang Tzu sets the pattern for the tra- ditional Chinese historical worldview here, finding both nobility and stupidity in a loyalty that is fatal. Po Lo A legendary horseman, judge of horseflesh, and trainer of ex- ceptional steeds. In a culture where warfare made horses and horse- Glossary manship highly valued, Chuang Tzu's choice of Po Lo as an emblem of the brutality of technology must have been particularly telling. Po Yr Po Yi and Shu Ch'i were brothers. Exemplars of loyalty, after giv- ing up a claim to their father's throne in the principality of Ku-chu, they refused to shift their feudal allegiance to Chou after it overthrew Shang, and died of starvation on the side of Mount Shouyang. THE POWER OF VIRTUE This is our translation of the Chinese term te, usually translated as power or as virtue. It is the power found when one identifies with Tao and is thus able to practice nondoing with per- fect effect. This is virtuous behavior in a mystical, rather than con- ventional, sense. It is ultimate power, but like nondoing itself, it is conditioned by facts and fate. The ultimate power of a waterfall is dif- ferent from the ultimate power of a human being, even when both are fully realized. SHEN-T ' U Ti An ad hoc creation, apparently. We are not sure what all the tree and pillar hugging is about in chapter 29. SHIN Shih Yu, a historical paragon of Confucian righteousness, is paired with Tseng Shen (Tseng Tzu) to embody the more rigid of the Confucian virtues. SHOUYANG Also known as Thunderhead Mountain, it is located east of the great northward bend of the Yellow River in the heart of Shang and early Chou territory. SHUN The second of the Three Sage Emperors, Yao chose Shun as joint ruler and successor on the basis of his filial piety. There are several wonderful mythical tales about the trials he endured as a youth. SLAVE CREEK There are several streams with this name in present and historical China, but it appears that the name was most likely chosen by the author for its thematic suggestiveness. (See Warrior River.) SUNG A small state in the center of Chou dynasty China, on the south side of the Yellow River in its middle reaches. The Yellow River shifted its bed disastrously several times in recorded history, reaching the sea either north or south of the Shantung peninsula. One of the prime southern alternate courses to the sea ran through the middle of Sung. Sung was also the home of the philosopher Mo Tzu. For some reason (anti–Mo Tzu propaganda?), its people often appear to have been the butt of jokes about their stupidity. 167 16 6"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Glossary TAO The Way. Lao Tzu says, in Ursula Le Guin's translation, The way you can go isn't the real way. The name you can say isn't the real name. * A major identifying feature of the Way is that words falsify it. Chuang Tzu avoids the term wherever possible, for the obvious reason. The author of chapter 31 of the Chuang Tzu, through the persona of the foolish Confucius, speaking of the Old Fisherman, provides us with an operational definition: Now, the Tao is that of which all the ten thousand things are followers. All things that get it live; all things that lose it die. To turn from it in your work is to be defeated; to fol- low it is completion. THE TEN THOUSAND THINGS This term has been generally conceived of by translators as meaning all phenomena. We are inclined to believe it is limited to all living things, but we aren't altogether sure what Chuang Tzu considered to be nonliving. T'IEN CH'ENC-Tzu A historical character. The text of Chuang Tzu is corrupt here with regard to the timing of his usurpation, but the man exists in other historical texts of the period. TIGER YANG A generic bandit. This family name is the Yang of yin and yang, indicating his fiery nature, which, taken to an extreme, makes him a Tiger. The lines he appears in are among the funniest ironic anticlimaxes in all the world's literature. The joke's on Conf a- cius, as it usually is in the Chuang Tzu, outside the \"Inner Chapters\" at least. TSENG Tzu Tseng Shen, or Master Tseng, was a major disciple of Con- fucius. An exemplar of filial piety, he is sometimes held responsible for the overemphasis on that single virtue in Confucian orthodoxies from the Han dynasty onward. He is paired with Shih Yu to embody the more rigid of the Confucian virtues. * Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching: A Book About the Way and the Power of the Way 1Boston: Shambhala Publications, 1997). Glossary TZU-CHANG Historically, a disciple of Confucius. Keep in mind that, like Confucius himself in these pages, all the disciples are subject to the humorous whims of the author. Tzu-Hsu A loyal and sagacious minister who aided several kings of the southern state of Wu in their ongoing struggle against the neighboring state of Yueh. TZU-KUNG Another disciple of Confucius, also called Tuan-mu Ssu, he was particularly known for his eloquence. Tzu-LU Disciple and military aide de camp to Confucius. In the AnaIects, there is a very clear bond of affection between the two very different men. The authors of the Chuang Tzu trade on the reader's knowledge of that bond. Tzu SANG An ad hoc creation; the name means \"Mr. Mulberry.\" Tzu Yu An ad hoc creation; the name means \"Mr. Chariot.\" WARRIOR RIVER Neither ancient commentaries nor modern geograph- ical works offer any indication that this place name corresponds to an actual location. As with Slave Creek (also in chapter 17, \"Autumn Floods\"), the name seems chosen for its suggestive effect. It high- lights the philosophical conflict between Chuang Tzu and his friend Hui Tzu, and lets Chuang Tzu cap his nonsensical linguis- tic trickery in the passage with a pun at the combative sophist's expense. WEI, WEY, WAY Feudal states whose names are written with com- pletely different characters but are transliterated the same (tradition- ally as Wei). Wu Semi-barbarous area in what was in Chuang Tzu's time far south- east China. In the expanded geographical area of modern China, the same area is in east central China. It was proverbially at war with the neighboring state of Yueh. YANG CHU The thought of Yang Chu, a historical person (fourth cen- tury BCE), is regarded as foreshadowing Taoism per se. He appears to have advocated a fairly selfish egoism but was not a hedonist. His rel- atively self-centered philosophy makes a matched pair with Mo Tzu's self-sacrificing idealism. 169 16 8"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"' ,J S - 3 / r f Glossary YAO The first of the Three Sage Emperors who preceded the founda- tion of the legendary Hsia dynasty, Yao ignored his own son, married two of his daughters to Shun, and passed the throne on to him. The basis of the Chinese attitudes toward legitimate sovereignty can be found in the myths dealing with Yao, Shun, and Yu the Great. His- toricized myths about the trio of Wen, Wu, and Chou Kung, founders of the Chou dynasty, further explicate the issues. Confucius idealizes both sets. Chuang Tzu brings them back to earth. YELLOW EMPEROR Huang Ti, the Yellow Emperor, the mythic founder of the Chinese polity, was a culture hero credited with many inven- tions essential to civilized life. The two schools of Taoism after Chuang Tzu are called Huang-Lao (the school of the Yellow Emperor and Lao Tzu) and Lao-Chuang (the school of Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu). The former school was the basis for magical popular religions, and the latter for elite philosophical thought. The attitude of the au- thors of the Chuang Tzu toward the mythical Yellow Emperor is one of unfaltering mockery, as might be expected under the circum- stances. Chuang Tzu has no truck with such a mundane thing as the simply supernatural. YEN Hur Also called Yen Yuan, he was the favorite disciple of Confu- cius. Brilliant, and an exceptionally sensitive and hard-working stu- dent, he died young. Yr Yi and P'eng meng are legendary master archers. Yu THE GREAT Third of the Three Sage Emperors, he worked for years to drain away the \"great flood\" (chain and control the Yellow River delta and estuaries) and was rewarded with the throne by Shun. He passed it on to his own son, thereby beginning the Hsia dynasty, the first (protohistorical?) period of rule by ordinary humans. YUEH Anciently, a state identified with the southeast coast of modern China. It was proverbially at war with its neighbor, Wu. 17 0"}]
