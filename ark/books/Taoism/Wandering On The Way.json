Although this fascinating collection of essays, tales, and anec- dotes presents many difficult problems of interpretation, for tw o decades it has been the work that I wanted more than any othe r to render into English . To prepare myself for the task, I gathere d together scores of traditional and modern commentaries . Al - though I have consulted them closely and carefully during th e course of my research, I seldom refer to them directly in th e Notes on the Translation . The main reason for this is that I vie w the Chuang Tzu primarily as a work of literature rather than as a work of philosophy and wish to present it to the reading publi c unencumbered by technical arcana that would distract from th e pleasure of encountering one of the most playful and witt y books in the world . There have been a few previous translations of the Chuan g Tzu into English, French, German, Mandarin, Japanese, an d other languages (the majority of them incomplete or abridged , others very much out of date) although nothing like the hun- dreds that have been done for the Tao Te Ching, that other well - known Taoist classic . A couple of these renditions are quite"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Xl i competent, but I believe that none of them has succeeded i n capturing the quintessential spirit of the book . Both the style an d the thought of the Chuang Tzu are extraordinary . If we try t o approach them by ordinary means, we will surely fail . Therefore , in making this translation, I have not been afraid to experimen t with new modes of expression to simulate the odd quality o f writing in the Chuang Tzu . The chief aim of this book is philologi- cal accuracy . Beyond that, however, I wish to present Chuang Tz u as a preeminent literary stylist and to rescue him from the clutche s of those who would make of him no more than a wafflin g philosopher or a maudlin minister of the Taoist faith . Conse- quently, this is the only complete translation of the Chuang Tz u that renders the poetic portions of the text as verse in English . Furthermore, I have endeavored to reflect the overall poetic qual- ity of the book in my translation . As the noted sinologist Burto n Watson has so aptly observed (Basic Writings, p . 17) : Chuang Tzu, . . . though he writes in prose, uses word s in the manner of a poet, particularly in the lyrica l descriptions of the Way or the Taoist sage . In th e broader sense of the word, his work is in fact one of th e greatest poems of ancient China . To ignore the poetics of the Chuang Tzu by treating it simply as a piece of philosophical prose would do it a grave injustice . The main reason I fell in love with the Chuang Tzu so lon g ago, and why my fascination with the book has only increase d over the years, is the sheer literary attraction of this strange an d wonderful collection of Taoist writings . Reading the Chuan g Tzu, even after the hundredth time, gives me pure pleasure an d helps me to relax in times of stress or anxiety . As imaginativ e literature, there is no other Chinese work that even remotel y compares to it before the introduction of Buddhist narrativ e and dramatic traditions from India and Central Asia . Th e Chuang Tzu, however, is not simply entertaining . It is also a highly edifying work in the sense that it is full of profoun d wisdom and insights on life . Inasmuch as this is a book that has meant so much to me fo r decades, I wanted to share it with others . That is the simples t explanation for the genesis of the present work . Another impetu s for the creation of this translation is my strong feeling that th e Chuang Tzu deserves to be better known in the West . Th e popularity of the Tao Te Ching outside of China is nothing shor t of phenomenal . Almost unbelievably, a new translation of tha t little book appears at the steady rate of about one per month . There are now so many different English editions of the Tao T e Ching available that enthusiasts who have no familiarity wit h Chinese are emboldened to make their own translations b y relying solely on previous versions . As a sinologist, I will no t comment on the reliability of such secondary renderings, but a t least they demonstrate that the Tao Te Ching has by now become a thoroughly domesticated American classic . It is sad, by contrast, that few Americans beyond scholarl y circles have ever even heard of the Chuang Tzu, much less experi- enced the thrill of dipping inside its covers . In a way, I feel a sens e of injustice that the Tao Te Ching is so well known to my fello w citizens while the Chuang Tzu is so thoroughly ignored, because I firmly believe that the latter is in every respect a superior work . We may account for the enormous popularity of the Tao Te Chin g by pointing to its brevity and its ambiguity : everybody can no t only find in it what they want, they can find what they're lookin g for quickly . The Tao Te Ching in its many American renditions is a kind of Taoist fast food—you devour it in several bites and i t doesn't cost much . The Chuang Tzu, on the other hand, is mor e like a banquet or a buffet—you are obliged to spend more tim e savoring its tremendous variety of delightful dishes, and o f course you have to pay a bit more because it is bigger . This is a book to help you slow down and unbend . Som e readers may be so captivated by it that they will want to plung e from beginning to end in just two or three sittings . For most,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Xi V however, a more leisurely approach is recommended . You ca n open the Chuang Tzu to virtually any of its scores of sections an d experience them separately, or you can read one of its thirty - three chapters at a time . The point is that no matter where in th e Chuang Tzu you turn, there is food for thought . Here you will learn about the usefulness of uselessness, th e joy of wandering, the insignificance of the difference between bi g and little, what it means to follow nature, and a thousand othe r stimulating topics . Within the pages of the Chuang Tzu, you wil l discover the weirdest cast of characters this side of Bedlam, mos t of them invented out of whole cloth by the author(s) . You wil l laugh uproariously at the eccentricities and antics of the mos t zany bunch of sages ever assembled . This is not some dry , moralistic treatise, nor is it a demanding, philosophical disquisi- tion . Rather, the sublime wisdom of the Chuang Tzu is imparte d to us by poking holes in our conventional knowledge an d assumptions about what is good and bad . It accomplishes all o f this, furthermore, with a divine sense of humor throughout . Th e Chuang Tzu deals with very heavy stuff, but it does so with a feather-light touch . Before proceeding further, I should explain what the nam e of the book means and how it should be pronounced . . \" Chuang \" is the surname of the supposed author of this marvelous wor k and \"Tzu \" simply implies \"master\" in the sense of a leadin g figure in a given school of thought in ancient China . Hence, w e may render \" Chuang Tzu \" as \" Master Chuang .\" (I generally refe r to the title of the book as the Chuang Tzu and the name of th e reputed author as Master Chuang .) While the pronunciation o f the title is not such an easy matter as its meaning, I woul d console my poor reader who is afraid to attempt it by saying tha t speakers of Sinitic languages themselves have pronounced (an d still do pronounce) the two sinographs (Chinese characters ) used to write it in widely varying ways depending upon wher e and when they lived . For example, a Cantonese of today woul d read them quite differently from a Pekingese, and a resident of the Chinese capital 2,600 years ago would have pronounce d them in a manner that would be unrecognizable to either th e Cantonese or the Pekingese . Therefore, it does not really matte r that much how each of us says the title of the book in his or he r own idiolect . For those who are fastidious, however, the \" cor- rect\" pronunciation in Modern Standard Mandarin may b e approximated as follows . The \"Chu - \" part of Chuang sounds lik e the \" ju \" of juice or jute, except that the \" u \" functions as a glide t o the succeeding vowel and thus comes out as a \" w\" ; the \" -a- \" must be long, as in Ma and Pa ; the \" -ng \" is the same as i n English . Perhaps the best way to approximate Tzu is to lop of f the initial part of words such as \"adze,\" \"fads,\" and so forth , striving to enunciate only the \" d \" and the sibilant that come s after it, hence -dze or -ds . To end this little lesson in Mandari n phonology, then, we may transcribe Chuang Tzu phonetically a s jwawng dz or jwahng dzuh . \"Chuang Tzu\" is the traditional sinological transcription o f the name of the putative author and of the title of the boo k attributed to him that is translated here . Recently a new tran- scription system has come into vogue in China according t o which the name is transcribed as \"Zhuang Zi :\" The Mandari n sounds these two transcription systems indicate remain the sam e (as given at the end of the previous paragraph) . Even though the Chuang Tzu was written over two millenni a ago and in a language that is at times well nigh impenetrable, i t still has a vital relevance today . Communist theorists in Chin a continue to debate vigorously the significance of the text , whether it is materialist or mystical, positive or negative . Ther e are those who also perceive distinctly modernist strains in th e Chuang Tzu . Considering the wide familiarity of the contempo- rary world with his compatriot, Lao Tzu (the Old Master), wh o is a far less interesting and stimulating writer, it is likely that w e will be hearing more of Master Chuang in the not-too-distan t future . As we shall see in the Introduction under the heading \" The"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"XV l Question of Authorship, \" the Chuang Tzu was clearly not al l written by a single thinker . Nonetheless, there is an essentiall y inimitable spirit that informs the book as a whole . For th e purpose of discussion, we may refer to that spirit as Chuang Tz u (Zhuang Zi) or Master Chuang (Master Zhuang) . In spite of the fact that it is richly rewarding, the Chuang Tz u is not an easy book . It has been a challenge to me, the translator , to devise means for bringing it alive in English while at the sam e time remaining faithful to the extraordinary qualities of th e original Chinese text . I predict that the Chuang Tzu will be equall y challenging to you, the reader . But, in the end, you will emerg e from your encounter with this wonderful anthology a wiser an d happier person . That is my promise to you, reader, so long as yo u promise not to get hung up on mere words . For, as the Chuang Tz u (end of Chapter 26) says : A fish-trap is for catching fish ; once you've caught th e fish, you can forget about the trap . A rabbit-snare is fo r catching rabbits ; once you've caught the rabbit, you ca n forget about the snare . Words are for catching ideas ; once you ' ve caught the idea, you can forget about th e words . Where can I find a person who knows how t o forget about words so that I can have a few words wit h him? INTRODUCTIO N THE HISTORICAL CONTEX T The core of the Chuang Tzu was probably originally composed i n the latter half of the fourth century B .C .E ., but the text as a whol e was not completed until toward the end of the second centur y B .C .E . To understand the nature of its compilation, we need t o become familiar with the historical background and intellectua l currents of the era when the book came into being . The Chou dynasty (circa 1I11—255 B .C .E .) was founded o n feudalist principles that worked fairly well for a little over fou r centuries . During the Spring and Autumn period (771—47 6 B .C .E ., however, the authority of the Chou kings began to b e undermined . While the Chou dynasty had not yet broken u p entirely, it was divided into spheres of influence controlled by a dozen or so small feudal duchies . Late in this period, the shi n ( \" retainer ; knight\") arose as an important new intellectual forc e in China . Gradually, they evolved from a warrior class to a n influential group of scholars and political theorists who activel y sought to alter the policies of the various dukes . Confucius is a good example of one such knight-scholar . Many of China's mos t prominent early thinkers came from this class, one of the four"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Xi X main classes of Chinese society during the latter half of the Cho u period, the other three being farmers, artisans, and merchants . The Spring and Autumn period was followed by the War - ring States period, also called the period of the Contendin g Kingdoms (475—22I B .C .E .) . The deterioration of the Cho u dynasty continued apace, with the imperial house being reduce d to mere symbolic status . Real power was vested in the hands o f the kings of the increasingly independent states who vied fo r hegemony . The number of significant states during this perio d was reduced to only half a dozen (see map, p . lv) . Amon g themselves, they continually struggled for supremacy . Out o f this constant conflict, two of the warring kingdoms, Ch ' in in th e far northwest and Ch ' u in the south, finally emerged as the ke y powers . In 223 B .C .E ., Ch'in defeated Ch'u and captured th e heartland of China . A couple of years after that, Ch'in (whenc e the name China) established the first unified Chinese empire, th e basic bureaucratic structure of which lasted until 191I, thoug h undergoing countless rebellions and dynastic changes through - out history . To be brief, we may say that the Warring State s period witnessed the demise of the old feudal regimes and thei r replacement by a centralized monarchy . In spite of the political disruption and the social chao s of the Warring States period, intellectually this was by fa r the most exciting and lively era in the whole of Chinese his- tory . Peripatetic philosophers wandered through the length an d the breadth of the land trying to get the attention of any rule r who might be willing to put their ideas into practice . Th e Warring States period offers many interesting parallels wit h developments in Greek philosophy that were going on at th e same time . We shall touch upon some of them here and in th e Notes, but others deserve separate, intensive investigatio n for comparative purposes . Suffice it for the moment to say tha t the majority of China ' s seminal thinkers lived during thi s period and that it corresponds to the classical period of Gree k philosophy . CONFUCIANISM AND MOHIS M To understand the Chuang Tzu, it is necessary to realize tha t virtually all of the philosophical schools of the Warring State s period were in dialogue with each other and, furthermore, tha t their vigorous debates are reflected in the pages of this book . Consequently, we would do well to make a survey of the mos t important thinkers of the age, especially those to whom th e Chuang Tzu reacts most strongly . The first intellectual tradition to coalesce as an identifiabl e school was that of the Confucianists . They were under th e leadership of their namesake, the renowned early Chines e thinker, Confucius (551—479 B .C .E .) . Confucius was active a t the very end of the Spring and Autumn period, just before th e outbreak of the Warring States period . Appearing during a tim e of sociopolitical upheaval, Confucius strove to restore order b y propagating his doctrines . Confucius was a man of great stature, both physically and i n terms of his reputation . A profoundly conservative moralist wh o hearkened back to an imagined golden age at the beginning o f the Chou dynasty, it was he who set the tone of reversion instea d of progress that characterized the mainstream of Chinese socia l and political thought until this century and still has a profoun d influence on traditional Chinese intellectuals . His rationale fo r glorifying the past was based on the firm belief that the legend- ary sage-kings of antiquity could provide a model for goo d government in his own chaotic times . Confucius' teachings are preserved in the Analects whic h consists largely of conversations between him and his disciples . In the Analects, Confucius asserts that a king should rule throug h virtuous suasion rather than through sheer power . His idea l leader was the superior man (c/i ntzu), a person who was guide d by the highest principles of conduct . Confucius and his fol- lowers were very much concerned with issues of benefit an d harm, right and wrong, good and bad . The Confucians were"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"XX moral absolutists, stressing yi ( \" duty ; righteousness ; justice \" ) an d jen (\"humaneness ; benevolence \" ) . At the same time, they wer e very much status-oriented in their approach to social relation - ships, insisting that there was an unalterably fixed pattern o f domination and subservience between ruler and subject, fathe r and son, husband and wife, elder brother and younger brother . For Chuang Tzu (Master Chuang), the Confucianists wer e much too stiff and stuffy, too hidebound and hierarchical . Master Chuang took great delight in making fun of Confuciu s and his disciples . So formidable were Master Chuang ' s indict- ments of the Confucianists that the syncretists who were some - what sympathetic to them tried to co-opt him by writing severa l sections subtly espousing their cause and sneaking them into hi s book . These will be pointed out below (\"Structure and Compo- sition of the Text\") and in the appropriate chapter introduc- tions . The Mohists, who were active during the fourth and thir d centuries B .C .E ., were the first to challenge the heritage of Con- fucius . Their founder, Mo Ti or Mo Tzu (Master Mo), live d during the second half of the fifth century, having been born a few years after Confucius ' s death . It is significant that Maste r Mo was almost an exact contemporary of Socrates and that ther e are so many analogies between the system of thought that h e propounded and various schools of Greek philosophy from th e same period, but especially the Stoics . Tradition holds tha t Master Mo was originally a follower of Confucianism until h e realized that it overemphasized rituals at the expense of ethics, s o he parted company and founded his own school . Master Mo was a skillful military engineer but devoted hi s talents solely to defensive works . In this sense, he might best b e characterized as a militant pacifist . From the titles of ten impor- tant chapters of his works, we can gain an idea of the sorts o f issues that occupied him and his followers : religion (\"The Wil l of Heaven \" and \"Elucidating the Spirits \" ), philosophy ( \" Reject- ing Destiny \" and \"Universal Love\"), politics (\"Elevating the )X l Worthy,\" \"Conformity with Superiors,\" and \"Rejecting Aggres- sion \" ), morals ( \" Economy in Funerals,\" \"Economy in Expendi- tures, \" and \"Rejecting Music \" ) . Master Mo was associated wit h workers, craftsmen, and tradesmen, quite unlike Confucius an d his followers who were aristocratic in their orientation . Th e Mohists were fiercely egalitarian and tested all dogmas b y whether or not they benefited the people . For Mo Tzu, every - thing was measured in terms of social utility . He criticized th e Confucians for their skepticism of heaven and spiritual beings a s well as for their fatalism . Consequently, a debate of huge propor- tions ensued between the Confucians and the Mohists . Th e Mohist style of argumentation was dry and wooden . This is on e of the reasons why their teachings virtually disappeared after th e third century B .C .E . and have only been brought to light again i n this century . Because of the ostensible similarity in their doc- trines, Christians have been especially interested in the Mohists . The Mohists were scientifically minded . Their works in- clude estimable treatises on optics and other technical subjects . So practically oriented were they that they even adopted the us e of some simplified sinographs in an attempt to ease the burde n of a difficult writing system . The Mohists subscribed to a n ascetic discipline and behaved like religious fundamentalists . After the death of the founder, Mohism was organized into a church headed by a succession of Elder Masters that lasted fo r several centuries . As a man, Master Mo was admired by all, bu t his teachings are considered by most Chinese to have been fa r too demanding . In a nutshell, we may describe Master Mo as a Spartan, populist activist and theoretician of rather dour disposi- tion who advocated universal love, inveighed against excess an d luxury, and believed that the only justifiable war was a defensiv e one—not at all to be scoffed at but, by the same token, not at al l to the lighthearted taste of Master Chuang either . He considere d the Mohists to be far too preachy and pragmatic, too mechanica l and maudlin . We will encounter much wry ridicule of them i n these pages ."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"XXI I OTHER DOMINANT PHILOSOPHIE S Chinese historians speak of the Hundred Schools of Though t that flourished during the Warring States period, a round num- ber serving to indicate the many competing schools . It wa s indeed the most vital period in the development of Chines e thought . All the schools came forth in response to the burnin g realities of the day and suggested a broad spectrum of solution s to cure the ills of the body politic . The leading thinkers wer e often government officials themselves or itinerant scholars wh o traveled from one feudal state to another promoting their pro - grams for social and political reform, trying to find a sympa- thetic ruler who would put them into action . The ideas of thes e Hundred Schools are preserved in the conversations betwee n their masters and disciples, in memorials and other types o f documents, and in treatises of varying lengths . The chief con- cepts that all of the schools debated included the following : Tao (pronounced dow)—the Way, or to be more ety- mologically precise, the Trac k Te (pronounced duh)—integrity or virtue ; ety- mologically rendered as \"doughtiness \" Jen (pronounced ren)—benevolence ; etymologicall y equivalent to \"humaneness \" Yi (pronounced yee)—righteousness ; etymologicall y rendered as \"justice \" T ' ien (pronounced teeyan)—heaven ; etymologicall y equivalent to \"divinity \" Each school had its own particular Way or Track . The Confu- cians, for example, promoted the Way of man, and the Taoist s advocated the Way of the Way (cosmos or a universalize d concept of nature) . The Chuang Izu responded to nearly all th e other schools of thought during the middle and late Warring XXii i States period . Since Master Chuang reacted to these schools , elements from a wide variety of sources are operative in his book . To understand the Chuang Tzu, then, it is necessary to have som e sense of the competing schools of thought that were presen t during the Warring States period, beyond just the Confucian s and the Mohists . During the fourth century, a new figure enters the fray . Thi s is the individualist Yang Chu . Most of what we know abou t Yang Chu may be found in the seventh chapter of the Master Lie h which bears his name . It shows him as an unorthodox personage , but not as someone who was truly licentious . His enemies calle d him an egoist and it was unfairly said of him (by a prominen t Confucian) that he would not sacrifice a hair to benefit all unde r heaven . (What he actually said was \"If nobody would sacrifice a hair, if nobody would try to benefit the world, then the worl d would become orderly .\" In other words, we should live and le t live, not imposing ourselves on others nor letting others impos e themselves on us . The Confucian distortion is both obvious an d self-serving .) This was in direct contrast to Master Mo who wa s renowned as an extremely hard worker for the public good . Th e Yangists were intent upon protecting themselves from the dan- gers of involvement in political strife . Yang Chu held that ma n must nourish his Heaven-endowed nature by keeping it intac t and striving for happiness . We may characterize his philosoph y as a brand of moderate hedonism . It was in this context, then—after Confucius, Mo Tzu, an d Yang Chu—that Master Chuang appeared upon the scene . It i s not surprising that these three thinkers loom so large in hi s book, because they had set the terms of the Warring State s period's intellectual debates . But Master Chuang does somethin g very unusual . Instead of joining them in a debate, he deflate s them by undermining both their basic premises and the method s by which they argued them . Over and over again, Master Chuan g demonstrates the futility of debate . Simultaneously with hi s attacks on disputation, however, a new group materialized who"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"XXI v espoused argument as a legitimate professional pursuit in its ow n right . Appearing in the late fourth century, at about the same tim e as Master Chuang, were the Sophists or Logicians . Perhaps i t would be more accurate to refer to them by the literal translatio n of their designation in Chinese, the School of Names (o r Terms), or the School of Names and Debate, because they di d not actually develop any syllogistic reasoning nor discover an y laws of thought . In diverse ways, this new school affected all th e other schools that were active during the fourth century . Th e leaders of the Sophists were Hui Shih and Kungsun Lung . Lik e the Mohist school, from which they derived, they were in favo r of universal love and opposed to offensive war, but they differe d from their predecessors in practicing disputation for its ow n sake . It was the Sophists who devised a whole set of celebrate d paradoxes, such as Kungsun Lung ' s famous \"A white horse is no t a horse . \" Many of these paradoxical statements are preserved i n the Chuang Tzu, but they are included there almost as a sort o f joke . Master Chuang was actually a close friend of Hui Shih ' s . He mischievously debated with him and poked fun at his logic - chopping . It is worth noting that the author of the final chapter of th e Chuang Tzu gives great prominence to Hui Shih, not only b y placing him in the culminating position, but simply by devotin g so much space to this otherwise largely neglected philosopher . There is, in fact, some evidence that this section of Chapter 3 3 may originally have been part of a separate chapter devoted t o Hui Shih . Like Master Mo, he truly deserves to be called a philosopher in contrast to the vast majority of other earl y Chinese thinkers who dealt primarily with social and politica l problems rather than logic, ontology, epistemology, and s o forth . Master Mo, interestingly enough, is similarly highlighte d in this survey by being placed first and by being awarded gen- erous coverage . Another major personality who appeared on the scene at XX V about the same time as Master Chuang was Mencius (circa 372  289 B .C .E . . Whereas Master Chuang satirized Confucius, M o Tzu, and Yang Chu, Mencius ardently defended Confucius an d criticized the other two . For his advocacy of collectivism base d on universal love, Mencius singled out Mo Tzu as Confucius' s most dangerous rival . His focus was on human nature, a subjec t that had actually been brought to the fore by Yang Chu . Still , Mencius criticized Yang Chu sharply for his assertion of th e primacy of the self over society . Mencius emphasized that hu- man nature is basically good and that all men could becom e sages by fulfilling their inherent potential . He tempered th e aristocratic side of Confucianism by being a champion of th e common people and speaking out for humane government . Thi s he did by stressing the role of the scholar-official in inculcatin g moral values in the ruler who, as a result, would be encouraged t o treat his subjects more kindly . Of all the early Confucia n thinkers, Mencius was the most concerned with individual hu- man development, but always within the context of creating a good society . During the third century, Master Hsiin, anothe r Confucian thinker who was influenced by several other schools , declared human nature to be fundamentally bad, that it coul d only be kept in check by education and strict moral inculcation . Given these presuppositions, it is not surprising that he believe d in authoritarian principles of government . By the end of the fourth century, all but the Confucians ha d recognized that the authority of the ancient sages could n o longer be depended upon as an adequate guide to the contempo - rary world that had changed so tremendously . Master Chuan g was among those who denied the relevance of the ancient sage s for the contemporary world . Furthermore, while Confucia n humanism definitely put man at the center of things, Maste r Chuang thought of man as but one among the myriad things . Wing-tsit Chan (Source Book, p .178) has pointed out that th e Confucians have by and large been critical of Master Chuang . Hsiin Tzu (Master Hsiin, flourished 298238 B .C .E .) said that"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"XXV I he was \"prejudiced in favor of nature and does not know man . \" Chu Hsi (I130-1200), the preeminent Neo—Confucian, com- plained, \"Lao Tzu at least wanted to do something, but Maste r Chuang did not want to do anything at all . He even said that h e knew what to do but just did not want to do it . \" This antagonism to Master Chuang on the part of th e Confucians is understandable, of course, because Maste r Chuang himself was so critical of them . Master Chuang ofte n plays tricks on us by sometimes having Confucius speak like a Taoist and sometimes like himself . We can never be sure which i s which unless we pay very close attention to the drift of an entir e tale . The multiplicity of ambiguous personae in the Chuang Tzu i s part of the exhilarating reading experience that it presents . Sometimes even Master Chuang himself is made to appea r antithetical to what we would expect of Master Chuang b y sounding Confucian, pedantic, or technical . To summarize this survey of Chinese thought during th e Warring States period, we may say that the Confucians wer e primarily interested in family relationships as the model fo r organizing good government, the Mohists were preoccupied b y societal obligations, the Yangists were concerned with the preser - vation and enhancement of the individual, the Sophists wer e consumed by questions of logic, and the Legalists were focuse d wholly on the advancement of the ruler and his state . In opposi- tion to all of these were the Taoists who viewed human societ y and politics as inevitably corrupting and sought to merge wit h the Way by returning to nature as contemplative quietists an d hermits . Perhaps the best and most authoritative introduction t o Warring States philosophy is the concluding chapter of th e Chuang Tzu itself . A systematic account of the outstandin g thinkers of the age, this chapter presents—in tightly argued , analytical fashion—many of the themes and figures that appea r in narrative form elsewhere in the book . From a strictly scholarl y point of view, therefore, it may well be the most valuable chapter XXVI i of the Chuang Tzu, even though it was clearly not written b y Master Chuang himself, but probably by the editor(s) of th e book who brought together the disparate materials that go t o make it up . \"All Under Heaven\" amounts to a critical review o f the major (and some minor) thinkers of the pre-Ch'in period . Considering the unprecedented nature of its accomplishment , the last chapter of the Chuang Tzu is a most remarkable docu- ment, a veritable intellectual tour de force . RELATIONSHIP TO THE TAO TE CHIN G Of all the philosophers who were active during the Warrin g States period, Master Chuang's closest affinities are naturall y with Lao Tzu (the Old Master or Masters—there were probabl y more than one of them) . Like the Old Masters, Master Chuan g held that what can be said of the Way is not really the Way, an d there are many other points of similarity between them . The Ol d Masters were the originators of the sayings that were compiled a s the Tao Te Ching around the end of the third century B .C .E . Maste r Chuang quotes from the Tao Te Ching repeatedly ; dozens o f examples could be cited . Those who are well acquainted with th e Tao Te Ching will frequently notice echoes of that text in the page s of the Chuang Tzu . What is intriguing, however, is that the y usually are not exact quotations . In other instances, saying s attributed to the Old Masters are not to be found in th e standard edition of the Tao Te Ching . This indicates that the Tao T e Ching was still probably circulating as oral tradition at the time o f Chuang Chou and had not yet coalesced as a written text , certainly not the text that we know today . The Tao Te Ching is extremely terse and open to man y different interpretations . The Chuang Tzu, on the other hand, i s more definitive and comprehensive as a repository of early Taois t thought . The Tao Te Ching was addressed to the sage-king ; it i s basically a handbook for rulers . The Chuang Tzu, in contrast, i s the earliest surviving Chinese text to present a philosophy for the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"XXVii i individual . The authors of the Tao Te Ching were interested i n establishing some sort of Taoist rule, while the authors of th e Chuang Tzu opted out of society, or at least out of powe r relationships within society . Master Chuang obviously wante d no part of the machinery of government . He compared the stat e bureaucrat to a splendidly decorated ox being led to sacrifice , while he preferred to think of himself as an unconstrained pigle t playing in the mud . The Tao Te Ching offers the Way as a guid e for life and it propounds nonaction as a means to achieve one ' s purpose in the workaday world . Master Chuang believed that th e Way had supreme value in itself and consequently did no t occupy himself with its mundane applications . Rather tha n paying attention to the governance of human society (the funda- mental concern of most early Chinese thinkers), he stressed th e need for transcendence and the freedom of the individual fro m such worldly concerns . In spite of all the differences, however , Master Chuang was clearly attracted by the doctrines of the Ol d Masters and many of his writings may be thought of as expande d metaphors or meditations on the brief sayings of those earl y Taoist luminaries whose ideas have been enshrined in the Tao T e Ching . There is no text listed in the earliest authoritative catalogu e of Chinese books as having been written by the Old Master s (Lao Tzu), nor is there a Tao Te Ching in 5,000 sinographs (it s legendary length) or in eighty-one chapters (the number in th e received version) that can be dated to the pre-Ch ' in period . Thi s fits with my contention that a single Old Master never existed , that the text associated with the Old Masters is a Chin perio d (or from a time shortly before then, in the latter half of the thir d century B .C .E .) compilation of adages and wise sayings attribute d to a type of sage, many of whom were active during the Sprin g and Autumn and Warring States periods (722—22I B .C .E .) , and that the text in question only came to be called the Tao T e Ching several centuries later under the impact of the rise of XXi X religious Taoism (which itself came into being as a result of th e massive influence of Buddhism upon Chinese society an d thought around that time) . The questions of the dating an d authorship of the Chuang Tzu are no less complicated than thos e for the Tao Te Ching . We shall devote a special section to the m below . Although the problems surrounding the authorship of th e Tao Te Ching and the Chuang Tzu may be dissimilar, their respectiv e literary forms can give us some insight into their composition . The Tao Te Ching is written entirely in verse, snatches of which ar e also to be found in other texts dating to about the same period i n which it took shape . One of the functions of gnomic verse , especially when it is rhymed, is that it is easily memorized . Indeed, in traditional societies where the technology of writin g is not widespread, the regular structure of verse itself is a sort o f mnemonic device . In contrast, unrhymed prose with its varyin g cadences is much harder to commit to memory and is a sign o f the emergence of cultures premised upon the written word as th e primary technology for preserving and transmitting informa- tion . The Tao Te Ching is renowned for its density and brevity . Th e Chuang Tzu, on the other hand, is best characterized as bein g written in a \" rambling\" mode . This expansive style reflects th e freedom of life advocated by Master Chuang . The very firs t parable in the book, about the inability of little fowl to compre- hend the stupendousness of the giant P ' eng-bird, is typical of th e relaxed quality of the book as a whole . The shape of the Tao Te Ching is exactly what we woul d expect of a body of sage wisdom that was normally conveye d orally—it was poetic and communal in the sense that its author - ship was shared (that is, it cannot readily be attributed to a single, easily identifiable creator) . The Chuang Tzu evinces a stag e when writing was just starting to free itself from the exclusiv e control of priests and diviners (esoteric specialists in sacred lore"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"XX X and ritual), and authorship by identifiable intellectuals was be - ginning to take on a more definite role in Chinese society . Therefore, the Chuang Tzu is fundamentally a work of prose, bu t it still includes sizable chunks of verse having an oral heritage , some of it gnomic as with the Tao Te Ching, some of it epi c (though severely fragmented, as was all early Chinese myth tha t encountered the stridently anti-mystical strains of Confucian - ism), and some of it oracular (notably the stunning series o f cosmic riddles that opens Chapter I4) . I consider the vers e portions of the Chuang Tzu as being oral wisdom embedded i n the prose matrix of a single thinker and his followers an d redactors . The transitional nature of the Chuang Tzu is furthe r evident in the fact that much of its prose is highly rhythmic an d parallel, partaking of certain qualities of verse . It might hav e been possible to set off more passages as verse or semiverse, but I have resisted the temptation to do so on the grounds that th e Chuang Tzu, in the final analysis, is a work of prose . We mus t remember, however, that the Warring States philosophers, o f whom Master Chuang was one, were mostly peripatetic per- suaders who went about trying to convince the rulers of th e contending kingdoms to adopt their policies and, through them , to bring peace to the empire . The word for persuasion i n Classical Chinese is shui, which is cognate with shuo ( \" to say , speak \" ) . Hence, even though the Chuang Tzu represents one of th e earliest attempts in China to write discursive prose, it is stil l imbued with the oral tradition out of which it grew . The third major Taoist text, the Lieh Tzu, is of questionabl e authenticity . Most scholars would agree that it was put togethe r during the third century C .E . and that it was much colored b y Buddhist sources . Nonetheless, the Lieh Tzu does contain som e passages that undoubtedly are based upon pre-Ch'in lore . Maste r Lieh figures prominently in the Chuang Tzu and was even awarde d his own chapter (32) . The fourth major Taoist collection is th e Master Huainan which dates to around I30 B .C .E . It is a highl y eclectic work, selecting elements from a variety of sources . XXX I THE QUESTION OF AUTHORSHI P The Chuang Tzu in its present form was certainly not written b y Chuang Chou, the putative author . Before explaining how w e know this to be the case, let us examine what facts may b e gleaned about the life of our supposed author . Born aroun d the year 369 B .C .E ., Chuang Chou was from Meng, a distric t of the northern state of Sung (it lay south of the Yellow Rive r near the border between the modern provinces of Shantung an d Honan) . Though Sung was considered to be a northern state , Meng was very close to the border with the powerful souther n state of Ch ' u and consequently strongly influenced by souther n culture . It is not surprising that later, in an imperial proclama- tion of the year 742, the Chuang Tzu was awarded the honorifi c title True Scripture of the Southern Florescence (Nanhua then ching) . Not much else is known of Chuang Chou's life except that h e seems to have spent some time in Ch'u and in the Ch'i (a norther n state) capital of Lintzu where he must have associated wit h scholars from the celebrated Chihsia \" academy \" that was locate d there . Chuang Chou probably died in about 286 B .C .E . In fact, th e evidence for the existence of a historical Chuang Tzu (Maste r Chuang) is only slightly greater than that for a historical Lao Tz u (Old Master), the alleged author of the Tao Te Ching, which i s virtually nil . In fact, as we have seen, the Old Master was mos t likely not a single historical personage at all but a congeries o f ancient sages . Nonetheless, the great historian Ssuma Ch'ie n managed circa I04 B .C .E . to devise a sort of \"biography\" fo r Chuang Chou in scroll 63 ofhis celebrated The Grand Scribe's Record s (Shih chi) . Ever since that time, devotees have believed that Chuan g Chou really did exist and that it was he who wrote the Chuang Tzu . Here is what Ssuma Ch'ien actually had to say about Maste r Chuang : Master Chuang was a man of Meng and his give n name was Chou . Chou once served as a minor function-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"XXXi i ary at Lacquer Garden and was a contemporary of Kin g Hui of Liang and King Hsŭan of Ch ' i . There was noth- ing upon which his learning did not touch, but its essen- tials derived from the words of the Old Masters . Therefore, his writings, consisting of over a hundre d thousand words, for the most part were allegories . H e wrote \" An Old Fisherman, \" \"Robber Footpad, \" an d \"Ransacking Coffers \" to criticize the followers of Con- fucius and to illustrate the arts of the Old Masters . Chapters such as \"The Wilderness of Jagged \" and \"Mas- ter K ' angsang \" were all empty talk without any sub - stance . Yet his style and diction were skillful and he use d allusions and analogies to excoriate the Confucians an d the Mohists . Even the most profound scholars of the ag e could not defend themselves . His words billowed with - out restraint to please himself . Therefore, from kings an d dukes on down, great men could not put him to use . King Wei of Ch'u heard that Chuang Chou was a worthy man . He sent a messenger with bountiful gifts t o induce him to come and promised to make him a minister . Chuang Chou laughed and said to the messen- ger of Ch ' u, \"A thousand gold pieces is great profit an d the position of minister is a respectful one, but haven ' t you seen the sacrificial ox used in the suburban sacri- fices? After being fed for several years, it is garbed i n patterned embroidery so that it may be led into th e great temple . At this point, though it might wish to be a solitary piglet, how could that be? Go away quickly, sir , do not pollute me! I'd rather enjoy myself playin g around in a fetid ditch than be held in bondage by th e ruler of a kingdom . I will never take office for as long a s I live, for that is what pleases my fancy . \" Judging from the dates of King Hui of Liang (reigned 370 — 355 B .C .E .), King Hsiian of Ch'i (reigned 3I9—30I B .C .E .), and King Wei of C h ' u (reigned 339—329 B .C .E .) who are mentione d in this account, Chuang Chou was roughly a contemporary o f Mencius (372—289 B .C .E .) . Ssuma Ch ' ien states that Chuan g Chou was born in Meng, located just north of Shang Hill Cit y (Shangch'iu shih) in eastern Honan province . The location o f the Lacquer Garden, where he is supposed to have held a mino r position, is not certain . In fact, Lacquer Garden may not even b e a place name at all but only a general designation for a planta- tion . Some scholars hold that it was located about fifty mile s northeast of the modern city of Kaifeng (also in Honan prov- ince) . It is noteworthy that none of the five chapters from th e Chuang Tzu cited by Ssuma Ch'ien as written by Chuang Cho u himself occur among the \"inner,\" supposedly more authentic , chapters of the book . We must remember that this skimpy biographical sketch wa s written more than two centuries after the time of Chuang Cho u and that, during the intervening period, there were no othe r works that provided any useful information about his life . Fur- thermore, most of Ssuma Ch'ien's brief portrait of Chuang Cho u is drawn from anecdotes in the Chuang Tzu itself . Since the Chuan g Tzu is full of hyperbolic invention, this means that they have n o necessary basis in fact . Aside from those recounted by Ssum a Ch'ien, there are a number of other memorable anecdotes abou t Chuang Chou in the later chapters of the Chuang Tzu, but thes e are largely apocryphal . According to these anecdotes and to th e hagiographical legends that have grown up around him, it woul d appear that Chuang Chou was a highly unconventional perso n who paid no attention to physical comfort or social status . He i s said to have worn raggedy clothing and to have tied his shoes o n with string to prevent them from falling apart . Although he wa s poor, Chuang Chou by no means thought of himself as unfortu- nate or miserable . There are a number of tales in the Chuang Tzu that indicat e that Chuang Chou did not consider death as something to b e feared . For example, when his philosopher-friend Hui Shih came"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xxxi v to console him upon the death of his wife, he found Maste r Chuang sitting sprawled out on the floor beating on a basin an d singing . \"When she first died, how could I of all people not b e melancholy? But I reflected on her beginning and real- ized that originally she was unborn . Not only was sh e unborn, originally she had no form . Not only did sh e have no form, originally she had no vital breath . Inter - mingling with nebulousness and blurriness, a transfor- mation occurred and there was vital breath ; the vita l breath was transformed and there was form ; the for m was transformed and there was birth ; now there has bee n another transformation and she is dead . This is like th e progression of the four seasons—from spring to au- tumn, from winter to summer . There she sleep s blissfully in an enormous chamber . If I were to hav e followed her weeping and wailing, I think it would hav e been out of keeping with destiny, so I stopped .\" (18 .2 ) When Master Chuang himself was about to die, his disciple s planned an elaborate burial, but he protested, saying that all h e wanted was for heaven and earth to be his inner and oute r coffins, the sun and moon to be his paired jades, the stars an d constellations to be his pearls, and all natural phenomena to b e his mortuary gifts . Apparently, Master Chuang viewed death as a natural process or transformation . Death to him was but th e giving up of one form of existence and the assuming of another . Master Chuang believed that the wise man or woman accept s death with equanimity and thereby achieves absolute happiness . Occasionally, the names of ancient Chinese philosopher s afford a clue to their affiliations or intentions (like Master Mo - [\"Ink,\" as used by carpenters in drawing a straight line], Maste r Kuan [ \" Tube,\" purpose unknown], Old Master [a hoary sage], and Lieh Yŭk'ou [ \" Resist Tyranny \" ]) . Chuang Chou's surnam e and name, which ostensibly mean \"Solemn Round,\" do not hel p us much in this regard because he was anything but sedate , though he may well be thought of as slipperily circular . The connection between Chuang Chou and the Chuang Tzu , though less tenuous than that between Lao Tzu and the Tao T e Ching, still presents obstacles of its own . As a historical per- sonage, Chuang Chou remains an enigma . Inasmuch as there ar e almost no hard facts available about Chuang Chou the man, w e are forced to rely on information that may be gleaned from th e Chuang Tzu itself in an attempt to figure out what sort of perso n he was . As we have seen, however, this is not a very reliabl e procedure either, given the playful propensities of the author(s ) of the text . Even the synoptic Chapter 33, \" All Under Heaven, \" gives only an enigmatic, though endearing, account of Chuan g Chou the individual . Whether or not there ever was a Chuang Chou (ther e probably was), of one thing we can be sure : he did not write all o f the Chuang Tzu . The sheer amount of blatantly contradictory ' ideological materials that occur in the various chapters alone i s proof enough of that . The literary quality of the chapters is als o tremendously uneven, some of them being among the fines t masterpieces of Chinese writing, brilliantly conceived and ex - pressed, while others are tritely composed and sloppily executed . The Sophist, Kungsun Lung, is mentioned three times in th e Chuang Tzu . Since he was active after Chuang Chou, this indicate s that the Chuang Tzu was compiled after the time of the maste r himself . In the survey of schools of thought that constitute s Chapter 33 and elsewhere in the text, Chuang Chou is discusse d from a historical viewpoint . This is further evidence that th e Chuang Tzu was put together by someone other than Chuan g Chou . In order to find out who that might have been, we need t o discuss in more detail the separate strands and layers of th e book ."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"XXXV I STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION O F THE TEX T Since the middle of the third century C .E ., scholars have regarde d the Chuang Tzu as a composite text . The current edition (stan- dard from the fourth century C .E .) has thirty-three chapters, bu t there is good evidence that a fifty-two-chapter edition of th e Chuang Tzu existed as late as the first century B .C .E . Kuo Hsian g (d . 3I2 C .E .), basing his work on that of a previous commentato r named Hsiang Hsiu, wrote the first extant and what man y consider to be the best commentary on the Chuang Tzu . By doin g so, he secured its position as the primary source for early Taois t thought . Kuo Hsiang was undoubtedly also the compiler of th e Chuang Tzu in its present form . The Chuang Tzu as we now have it is divided into three parts : the Inner Chapters (1-7), the Outer Chapters (8—22), and th e Miscellaneous Chapters (23—33) . The first seven chapters, th e Inner Chapters, are considered by the majority of scholars t o reflect best the thought of Master Chuang himself . Of the thre e sections, they are the most often translated and are widel y considered to be the most authentic . This is not to assert , however, that they are the only excellent parts of the book . Man y connoisseurs of the Chuang Tzu, for example, would claim tha t the most beautiful chapter is I7, which includes the magnificen t , dialogue between the Earl of the Yellow River and the Overlor d of the Northern Sea . And Chapter 29, which contains the long , bizarre conversation between Robber Footpad and Confucius, i s held by many devotees of the book to be the most humorous . The great discrepancies among the contents of the variou s chapters are due to a number of factors . First are the doctrina l differences among the Taoist factions that came after Maste r Chuang and were identified with him . Some of these wer e undoubtedly affected to one degree or another by other school s and hence would have brought in material from them . Next ar e the non-Taoist thinkers who recognized the enormous appeal of XXXVI i Master Chuang and wanted to appropriate part of his popularit y to advance their own programs . The incorporation of section s by such thinkers in the Chuang Tzu further complicated the text . The Chuang Tzu is thus a very heterogeneous work that does no t speak with a single voice . The number of ways of looking at th e Chuang Tzu are as plentiful as the disparate facets of the text itself . No one has yet discovered a trustworthy method for firml y attributing even the Inner Chapters to Chuang Chou, although a growing consensus tends to do so . Beyond the first seven Inne r Chapters, some scholars see a number of other identifiabl e strands operative . Chapters 8—IO and parts of II reflect a primitive, naturalist cast associated with the followers of the Ol d Masters (Lao Tzu) . Chapters I2—I6 and perhaps 33 are said t o belong to the Syncretists who probably edited the book as a whole . Their role will be further examined in the followin g paragraph . Chapters I6—27 are thought to represent the ideas o f later members of Master Chuang's own school . Finally, there ar e the individualists of a somewhat Yangist disposition who see m to be responsible for Chapters 28—3I . This breakdown by n o means exhausts the complexity of the Chuang Tzu, but it does giv e some notion of the difficulties inherent in dealing with earl y Chinese texts . The precise responsibility for the composition of the sepa- rate portions of the Chuang Tzu is shrouded in mystery . Nor ar e we on much firmer ground when it comes to determining wh o first collected them into a single volume . Several critical scholar s now believe that the Chuang Tzu was compiled by Liu An (d . I2 2 B .C .E .), the Han dynasty Prince of Huainan, with the assistanc e of attendants at his court . The lavish, un-Chuang Tzu-ish prais e of the sovereign in some of the Outer Chapters and Miscella- neous Chapters seems like the kind of sycophancy expected o f the court literati who danced attendance upon Liu An . Liu A n and his circle of scholars did espouse a brand of philosophica l syncretism (aimed at reconciling differing schools of though t into a single system) that seems to be compatible with the overall"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"r \t XXXI X composition of the Chuang Tzu and especially the signaturelik e final chapter . Still, we lack hard data to ascribe with confidenc e the initial editing of the Chuang Tzu to anyone in particular . Kuo Hsiang's standard edition of the Chuang Tzu that ha s been transmitted down to us contains many commentaries tha t appear to have worked their way into the text . In the presen t translation, I have removed some of the more egregious instance s (they have been transferred to the section at the back entitle d Deleted Passages) . All thirty-three chapters of the Kuo Hsian g edition of the Chuang Thu have titles, but they do not derive fro m the period of the initial composition of the text and thus are no t to be taken overly seriously . The original heart of the Chuang Tzu probably consisted o f relatively short, vivid parables and fables such as the openin g paragraphs of the book . Another good example is the first para- graph of 5 .5 . The ensuing paragraphs beginning \"Thus \" an d \"Therefore \" may be later explanatory additions . This pattern i s frequently repeated elsewhere in the book : a short, graphic tale o r parable followed by more abstract expositions of the point that i t makes, e .g ., 24 .10 . The two types of materials frequently clash i n mood and in style . Naturally, it is the concrete narratives that ar e more memorable than the abstract expositions . In short, Chuang Chou did not write the Chuang Tzu . For th e sake of convenience, however, we may collectively refer to th e nominal author(s) of the core passages of the Chuang Tzu a s Master Chuang (Chuang Tzu), which is to say that we associat e the text with the school of thought that was grouped around tha t shadowy name . IMPORTANCE OF THE CHUANG Tz u After the Old Master(s), the fathers of the Taoist church hav e always looked upon Master Chuang as the most importan t fountainhead of their tradition, but one wonders how much o f Taoist religion the wag would have been able to stomach . A wide spectrum of Chinese thinkers has similarly tried to pre-emp t Master Chuang, or parts of him, for their own . But this i s perhaps the most serious mistake in dealing with the protea n Master Chuang, namely, to treat him as a systematic philoso- pher . Master Chuang's game is to put dents in, if not annihilat e altogether, human thought processes . Rather than rationality, i t is intuition that he favors . Such a figure can scarcely be taken as a model upon which to build a system of thought . The impor- tance of the Chuang Tzu lies far more in its function as a literar y repository than as a philosophical disquisition . There are scores of famous passages from the Chuang Tz u that are among the most memorable in all of Chinese literature . Here I shall cite only two : The emperor of the Southern Sea was Lickety, th e emperor of the Northern Sea was Split, and the empero r of the Center was Wonton . Lickety and Split often me t each other in the land of Wonton, and Wonton treate d them very well . Wanting to repay Wonton's kindness , Lickety and Split said, `All people have seven holes fo r seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing . Wonton alon e lacks them . Let's try boring some holes for him .\" S o every day they bored one hole, and on the seventh da y Wonton died . (7 .7 ) This demonstrates graphically the disastrous consequences o f going against nature . What makes us remember the lesson is no t so much the contents of the doctrine espoused but the inimitabl e manner in which it is expressed . Once upon a time Chuang Chou dreamed that h e was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting about happily enjoy- ing himself He didn't know that he was Chou . Suddenl y he awoke and was palpably Chou . He did not kno w whether he were Chou who had dreamed of being a"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"x l butterfly or a butterfly who was dreaming that he wa s Chou . Now, there must be a difference between Cho u and the butterfly . This is called the transformation o f things . (2 .14 ) Here Master Chuang is playing on the theme of trans - formation . So striking is the imagery that whole drama s have been written on this theme . If Master Chuang had bee n merely a pedestrian, prosaic philosopher, no one would pay an y particular attention to his claim about the \"transformation o f things? ' Conveyed by the literary grandness of Master Chuang is a grandness of soul . Through it, we are led to liberation . In th e very first chapter, Master Chuang tells us that there are varyin g degrees of happiness . The greatest happiness is achieved throug h a higher understanding of the nature of things . For the ful l development of oneself, one needs to express one's innate ability . This is te, whose basic meaning for Master Chuang, as for th e Old Masters, is integrity or character . re is the manifestation i n the individual of the universal Way/Track or Tao . The Tao i s thus immanent in all creatures and things, even in excrement . (22 .6 ) That which belongs to beings and objects by nature i s intrinsic or internal ; that which is imposed upon them by man i s extrinsic or external . All the myriad things in the world ar e different by nature and they have different innate abilities, bu t they are equal (each in their own way, of course) when they freel y exercise their innate abilities . In other words, for Master Chuan g equality exists only in the universal Way that both permeates an d embraces the enormous variety of the myriad things . Yet, instea d of letting a duck keep its short legs and the crane its long leg s (8 .1), man intervenes and tries to impose an artificial equalit y (that is, uniformity) by making them have legs of the sam e length . This runs counter to the nature of both the duck and th e crane . Artificiality forcibly attempts to change things according X1 i to its own conceptions and enforces uniformity (not equality) . This is the purpose of all morals, laws, institutions, and govern- ments, namely, to promote sameness and to eradicate difference . The motivation of those who promote uniformity may b e entirely laudable . For example, if they believe that something i s good for themselves, they may wish to see others enjoy it too . I n the process, however, they are more than likely to demean, if no t destroy, those whom they intend to help because they oppos e their individual natures . We may say, then, that Master Chuan g was the first great proponent of true diversity and that he had th e good sense to recognize that it could not be achieved throug h government fiat . Master Chuang strenuously opposed the formal mecha- nisms of government . In his view, the best way to govern i s through no government at all . In this, he agreed with the Ol d Masters, but for different reasons . The Old Masters were deepl y concerned with governance, but advocated a minimalist polic y simply because they felt that the more government there was th e less effective it would be . For Master Chuang, however , the whole notion of government was problematic because of th e opposition between man and nature . Better to let things tak e their own course, he would say, and not govern them at all, no t even minimally . Lest he be misinterpreted, it is questionabl e whether Master Chuang ' s position is tantamount to anarchy, an d he was by no means in favor of violence . It was not Maste r Chuang ' s business to describe what sort of governing apparatu s there should be ; his purpose was to tell us what governmen t should not do . According to Master Chuang, every person can achiev e happiness for himself or herself . Just let them be . Maste r Chuang ' s social and political philosophy is quite different fro m every other thinker in early China in that it was directed towar d the private person rather than to groups . He encouraged individ- uals to seek inner happiness rather than trying to enforce happi- ness through government policy . To him this was a contradiction"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"in terms . As soon as government intervenes in natural affairs, i t destroys all possibility of genuine happiness . Another lesson taught by Master Chuang through his para- bles is that of the humble artisans whose perfect mastery of thei r craft reveals a mastery of life itself . Butchers, wheelwrights, bell - stand makers, and others are shown to possess a superior wisdo m that cannot be expressed in words and can only be acquire d through experience and practice . Modern critics often assert that Master Chuang was an anti - rationalist . The situation, however, is not quite so straightfor- ward as that . While he is dubious about the efficacy of reason t o solve all human problems, he does not assert its utter futility . T o come to grips with Master Chuang's ambivalent attitude towar d human rationality, we must explore the sources of his disconten t with it . Master Chuang's animus toward rationality stems fro m historical circumstance . It was the Mohist plodding predilectio n for logic that left Master Chuang so disenchanted with this dul l species of rationality . Master Mo's doctrines were so unusual i n the context of Chinese thought that they had to be defended i n open debate . As a result, he and his followers were the firs t thinkers in China regularly to engage in formal disputation . Honing their elocutionary expertise in this fashion, the Mohist s came the closest of all schools in ancient China to constructing a coherent system of logic . Their initial success with this ne w technique of persuasion encouraged other schools to follow sui t in developing the techniques of debate they had introduced . Consequently, philosophical disputation became endemic to th e period . More than ever before, debaters paid attention to defin- ing their terms, structuring their arguments, and seizing upo n the fallacies of their opponents . Ultimately, as with Hui Shi h and Kungsun Lung, logic became a pursuit for its own sake . Master Chuang was a younger friend and perhaps even initially a disciple of Hui Shih . His intimate familiarity with paradox an d sophistry indicate that he must have dabbled with logical subtle - ties himself when he was young, but he obviously outgrew them . Master Chuang ' s fascination with Hui Shih ' s brand of ratio- nality stemmed from a desire to probe the limits of reason, no t to deny its validity altogether . Master Chuang uses reason to pu t reason in proper perspective . The late Mohist Canons (circa 300 B .C .E .) contain the mos t logically sophisticated texts from early China . In them, we se e clearly the resort to reason as the arbiter of conflicting view - points . This approach, which had already become the hallmar k of Greek philosophy and subsequendy characterized the whol e of the Western philosophical tradition, in the end was de- cisively rejected by later Chinese thinkers who preferred to rel y more on moral persuasion and intuition . Master Chuan g played a vital role in the emergence of Chinese skepticis m toward rationality, turning it on its head and satirizing i t trenchantly . In the Chuang Tzu, arguments that seem to have th e appearance of reason are ironically designed to discredit it . Master Chuang was also very much interested in the intricat e relationship of language and thought . His work is full o f intentional non sequiturs and absurdities because he uses thes e devices to explore the inadequacies of language itself, an ap- proach similar to that later taken by Zen masters with thei r koans . Again, we find Master Chuang ironically using a devic e to cast doubt upon the infallibility of that same device . Thi s proves that he abandoned neither language nor reason ; he onl y wished to point out that overdependence on them could limi t the flexibility of thought . Another key theme in the Chuang Tzu is that of relativity . A person who understands that big and little, soft and hard, goo d and bad are not absolutely counterposed transcends the ordinar y distinctions among things and the distinction between self an d other . In this way, he or she identifies with Unity and essentiall y becomes immortal . Above all, Master Chuang emphasized spontaneity . He wa s a mystic who recommended freedom from the world and it s conventions . Most philosophers of ancient China addressed"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Xl1 V their ideas to a political or intellectual elite, but Master Chuan g focused on those who were striving for spiritual achievements . The Chuang Tzu was involved in a vibrant interaction wit h Buddhism as this originally Indian religion developed in China . Chinese Buddhists received more inspiration from the Chuan g Tzu than from any other early Chinese text . This is especiall y true of members of the Zen (Ch ' an) school . We may, therefore , say that one of the major contributions of the Chuang Tzu t o Chinese culture was the role that it played in the evolution o f Zen, which has now become a world religion, particularly in it s Japanese guise . But this is a phenomenon that occurred lon g after the composition of the original text . There is, however , evidence of Indian influence in the very formation of the Chuan g Tzu, some of which has been pointed out in the Notes on th e Translation (see, for example, the entries on \"breathing . . . fro m the heels\" and \"bear strides and bird stretches \" in the Glossary o f Terms) . We should also pay attention to the ancient Irania n elements in the Chuang Tzu . To give only one instance, the stor y of Chi Hsien and Master Hu (7 .5) is about a contest of spiritua l powers between an Iranian-style mage and an Indian-style sage . The mage, Chi Hsien, also appears in I4 .I playing the role o f dispenser of cosmic wisdom who can answer riddles that woul d stump even an ancient Chinese sage . The puzzles that he solve s have an even broader, trans-Eurasian compass since they take th e form of an extended series of riddles uncannily like those pose d by early Indo-European seers and priests . Also awaiting furthe r investigation is the striking resemblance of the colloquy on th e joy of fishes between Master Chuang and Master Hui (I7 .7) t o many philosophical dialogues found in the works of Plato . Master Chuang was not an isolated Chinese thinker, but th e impressive product of a long process of national and interna- tional cross-fertilization . Master Chuang is claimed by both religionists and philoso- phers, but I think of him more as a fabulist, that is, as a compose r of fables and apologues . It is as a literary stylist that Master XI V Chuang had his greatest impact on culture—probably mor e than any other single Chinese author, succeeding generations o f writers have turned to him for allusions, themes, turns of phrase , and modes of expression . Painters likewise have found abundan t stimulation in the tales of Master Chuang . The Chuang Tzu is, first and foremost, a literary text an d consequently should not be subjected to excessive philosophica l analysis . Unfortunately, this is practically the only way tha t scholars have viewed the text during this century . In my estima- tion, this distorts its true value . What is more, the Chuang Tzu i s not merely a literary text ; it is actually an anthology or compila- tion of literary texts . Hence it is even less susceptible to systema- tic philosophical analysis . This is by no means to say that th e Chuang Tzu is devoid of importance for the history of Chines e philosophy . To be sure, it contains much valuable informatio n that documents intellectual trends during the Warring State s period, but these must be sorted out very carefully . Because o f the heterogeneous nature of the text, it is extremely difficult, i f not altogether impossible, to determine a system of thought t o which Chuang Chou subscribed . The Chuang Tzu is a monumen t of Chinese literature ; it is in this light that we should read an d interpret it ."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"NOTES ON TH E TRANSLATIO N Among the dozens of scholarly commentaries that I have exam- ined during the course of my translation and annotation, th e most useful are listed in the Bibliography .

The monu-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"XlVii i mentally difficult nature of Classical Chinese has become eve n more accentuated in this century with the demise of the imperia l institutions that fostered and sustained this \"unsayable \" hierati c language as a mechanism of control through the powerful literat i officials who had spent decades in mastering it . Since I9I9, les s than a decade after the revolution of 1911, which toppled the las t dynasty, the Manchus, Classical Chinese has been replaced as th e official written medium of China by the demotic vernacular , Modern Standard Mandarin . Today, modern citizens of Chin a are at least as far removed from the language of the Chuang Tzu a s modern speakers of English are from Beowulf, or as moder n speakers of Greek are from Plato ' s Republic—if not further . Classical Chinese is by its very nature problematic in that i t has been dramatically divorced from spoken language for no les s than two millennia and may always have been so because of th e fact that it was written in a script that was only partiall y phonetic . The language of the Chuang Tzu is even more peculia r in that it purposely distorts and impishly tampers with th e conventions of Classical Chinese itself . To render faithfully a n extraordinary text like this into a living language such as Englis h or Mandarin requires a stupendous act of transformation, no t merely a mechanical translation . Against this need for a creativ e response to the Chuang Tzu ' s linguistic mischief is the duty of th e conscientious philologist to be as consistent and accurate a s possible . In the Introduction, I have stated that I believe the vers e portions of the Chuang Tzu to be more nearly reflective of ora l tradition than is the prose matrix in which they are embedded . But to assert that an early Chinese work such as the Tao Te Chin g or the verse portions of the Chuang Tzu were of oral derivation i s not to assert that the texts as they have been recorded accuratel y mirror the rhythms, structure, and grammar of the Eastern Cho u speech upon which they were presumably based . To be sure , precise linguistic evidence indicates that, in the process of com- mitting utterances to writing in ancient China, various conven - Xii x tions were employed that automatically omitted or simplifie d certain syntactic, morphemic, and grammatical features of th e spoken languages . This was largely due to the partially phoneti c nature of the Chinese script which made it virtually impossibl e to capture in writing with fidelity and facility all of the signifi- cant elements of speech . Consequently, while written Chinese verse may not be a direct reflection of spoken language, it nonetheless reveals a bia s in favor of gnomic and oracular modes of discourse whic h normally are associated with the realm of orality . The Chines e prejudice in favor of poetry at the expense of prose persiste d throughout the imperial period and hearkens back to antiquit y when knowledge was transmitted by seers and sages who com- manded a body of wisdom verse . Chinese prose itself was contin- ually contaminated (or, from another viewpoint, we may sa y \"embellished \" ) by the cadences and structures of poetry, and it i s often well-nigh impossible to determine whether a given piece i s written in prose or in poetry . This also accounts for the distinc- tive Chinese literary genres known as the rhapsody (fu) an d parallel prose (p'ient'iwen), which lie somewhere between th e realms of prose and poetry . Throughout Chinese history, ther e have been occasional efforts to \"reform \" and \" purify \" Chines e prose by making it less euphuistic, mannered, elevated, an d poetic, and more straightforward, simple, practical, and prosaic . But, until the cataclysmic political revolutions of this century , which radically transformed the fundamental premises of Chi- nese society, there was always a continual reversion to poetry a s the preferred form of writing . As we have seen in the Introduction, the Chuang Tzu is a n anthology composed of heterogeneous components . The man y disparate voices in the text make it one of the most difficult o f early Chinese works with which to grapple . The translatio n strives not to homogenize these various strands into a single , undifferentiated style, but to let the various voices of the whol e text, no matter how discordant they may be, sing through by"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"1 themselves . Where the original shows the hand of a genius, th e translation attempts as best as possible to re-create in English it s excellences, but where the original is awkward or clumsy, th e translation makes no effort to camouflage its inferiority . Even with the superior parts of the text, there is a natura l tendency for translators to improve them to suit the tastes o f Western readers . For example, Classical Chinese nearly alway s relies on the word yiieh to introduce a quotation . It basicall y means just \"said\" (or \"asked \" if a question is involved), bu t translators are given to rendering it as \"responded ;\" \"exclaimed, \" \" cried, \" \"expostulated,\" and so forth . This dressing up of the tex t gives a false sense of the quality of the original work . The reader should also be warned about the recurrence i n the book of certain tales and parables, sometimes only barel y modified . Another perhaps somewhat jarring quality of th e book for a modern reader is the manner in which it jumps fro m one tale or parable to another within a given chapter . If on e understands that these phenomena are due to the fact that th e Chuang Tzu is essentially an anthology, rather than the product o f a single mind, this will make it easier to accept . Furthermore, no t only is the Chuang Tzu an anthology, it is an anthology tha t expresses the viewpoints of many different schools that debate d with and borrowed from each other . Generally, however, eac h chapter expresses certain broad themes and the tales and parable s within it are intended to illustrate them . These primary theme s have been highlighted in brief introductory notes by the transla- tor at the beginning of each chapter . Occasionally, the sam e story will be repeated in several chapters of the book with a slightly different twist because a different message is intended . Yet, regardless of the lack of seamless unity to the book, th e scintillating language and wonderful imagery are sure to capti- vate the reader . Aside from its notorious heterogeneity, another aspect o f the Chuang Tzu that makes it so hard to deal with is the fact that i t is occasionally textually corrupt . This is the result of a long and l i complicated process of redaction and transmission . All consci- entious students of the text are frustrated by those parts of th e Chuang Tzu that are manifestly garbled or have evident contradic- tions . In many instances, I have been able to solve these problem s by resorting to various text-critical methods, but in some I hav e simply had to make difficult decisions about what I thought th e authors were really trying to say . In my deliberations on the mos t complicated points, I have usually come up with two or thre e alternative interpretations, but in the end had to choose the one I thought most probable for the translation . My policy is always to stay as close as possible to th e Chinese text without becoming unintelligible or overly awkwar d in English . Occasionally, I have had to add a few words fo r grammatical or syntactical clarity in English . As a rule, however , I have endeavored to keep such additions to a minimum, no t going beyond what is in the Chinese text itself This accounts fo r the spareness of the English rendition, which is a deliberat e attempt to convey a sense of the terseness of the Chines e original . In a few cases, I have provided brief parenthetica l explanations to help the reader who has no background i n Chinese history or culture . The notes in the Glossary shoul d suffice to solve most of the remaining difficulties initiates wil l encounter . For all of the reasons outlined in the preceding paragraphs , the reader will swiftly come to the realization that the Chuang Tz u is not as easy to read as a collection of Chinese folk tales . Whil e the demands placed upon the reader are thus heavier, the reward s are correspondingly greater . So as not to interfere with the reader's appreciation of thi s inimitable work itself, I have refrained from excessive annotatio n and commentary . In general, I have provided only those note s that I felt were essential for comprehending unfamiliar material . These are listed in the Glossary, which is divided into thre e sections : Names, Places, and Terms and Allusions . I have found it convenient to invent one new word to match"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Ii i an ubiquitous Chinese technical term, namely, \"tricent \" (thre e hundred [paces]) for Ii (one third of a mile), on the model of th e word \"mile, \" which literally means \" a thousand [paces] . \" Thi s was necessary to avoid confusion because the syllable li may als o be employed to indicate so many other important concepts i n Chinese, e .g ., \"principle ;\" \"ritual / ceremony / etiquette ;\" \"bene- fit/profit/gain, \" \"one third of a millimeter, \" and so forth , which are also often cited by sinologists in their romanize d form . It has been my practice to translate (rather than simply t o transcribe) the names of characters who appear to be fundamen- tally the product of the author ' s (or, more precisely, the authors' ) imagination . Often these names constitute puns or are otherwis e intimately operative in the unfolding of a given tale ; to ignor e them would be to eviscerate a key feature of the diction . Sobri- quets and other types of pseudonyms are also often translated i f their meaning is sufficiently transparent, even for historica l figures, since they were often chosen by individuals to express a n aspect of their personality that they wished to emphasize . When, however, an individual is already relatively well known i n Western sinology by the transcribed form of his name, then I provide only that . Ideally, all transcribed proper nouns should be given in th e reconstructed form that is appropriate for the time when an d place where they were current . Unfortunately, our reconstruc- tions of the sounds of ancient and archaic Sinitic languages , topolects, and dialects are still grossly inadequate, so we mus t resort to the makeshift of citing them in Modern Standar d Mandarin . This is often deceiving, especially when the phoneti c quality of a word is operative in what an author is trying t o express . In the present translation, I have regularly given th e archaic pronunciation of the names of two southern states t o indicate that they were originally inhabited by speakers of non - Sinitic languages . For the information of sinologists and other scholars who may need to know, the basic text that I have relied upon i n making this translation is that of CH'EN Kuying, although I d o not always follow his recommendations for emendations an d excisions . Therefore, those who may wish to compare this trans- lation with the original Chinese should also consult the standar d edition as presented in the first section of the Harvard-Yenchin g Concordance . The latter, incidentally ; has been my most importan t tool in producing this rendition . When deciding upon the bes t English equivalent of a given word or expression in the Chuan g Tzu, I have constantly checked its occurrences elsewhere in th e text . Without the Concordance, this would have been a maddening , virtually impossible task . The next most important research work that I have relie d upon are the splendid scholarly tomes in Japanese by AKA- TSUKA Kiyoshi . There are two primary reasons for this . First , Akatsuka points out those portions of the Chuang Tzu that are i n verse . This is not evident from the format of the original, sinc e ancient Chinese texts consisted wholly of unpunctuated string s of sinographs . To determine whether or not a given passage is i n verse, one must analyze the rhymes at the ends of clauses an d sentences . Because the phonology of archaic Sinitic and Moder n Standard Mandarin is so different, this is no mean task . Th e second great contribution of Akatsuka lies in interpreting th e semantic content of the names of the fictional figures wh o people the pages of the Chuang Tzu . This, too, requires formida- ble learning because many of the names are disguised by th e device of employing homophonous sinographs to write them . Few commentators, interpreters, and translators pay any atten- tion to these two tremendously vital aspects of the Chuang Tzu . Consequently, in my estimation, they do not succeed in convey- ing to their readers the unique literary qualities of the work . Bot h in identifying portions of the text that were originally compose d in verse and in construing the names of characters who appear i n it, I have gone beyond Akatsuka, but his superb contributions i n these areas have lightened my burden immeasurably .

They become indecisive, dissembling, secretive . Small fears disturb them ; Great fears incapacitate them . Some there are who express themselves as swiftly as the release of a crossbow mechanism, which is to say that they arbitrate right an d wrong . Others hold fast as though to a sworn covenant, which i s to say they are waiting for victory . Some there are whose decline i s like autumn or winter, which describes their dissolution day by day . Others are so immersed in activity that they cannot b e revitalized . Some become so weary that they are as though seale d up in an envelope, which describes their senility .

Or do they take turns bein g lord and subject among themselves? If not, do they have a Tru e Lord over them all? Whether or not we succeed in specifying Hi s attributes has neither positive nor negative effect upon the trut h of the Lord . Once we have received our complete physical form, w e remain conscious of it while we await extinction . In our strif e and friction with other things, we gallop forward on our cours e unable to stop . Is this not sad? We toil our whole life withou t seeing any results . We deplete ourselves with wearisome labor , but don ' t know what it all adds up to . Isn't this lamentable ? There are those who say that at least we are not dead, but what' s the good of it? Our physical form decays and with it the min d likewise . May we not say that this is the most lamentable of all ? Is human life really so deluded as this? Am I the only one who i s so deluded? Are there some individuals who are not deluded ? 4 If we follow our prejudices and take them as our guide, who wil l not have such a guide? Why should only those who are intel- ligent make such mental choices for themselves? The foolish d o the same thing . If one claims that right and wrong exist befor e they are established in the mind, that is like saying one sets ou t for Viet today but arrived there yesterday . To do so is to mak e something out of nothing . Even Holy Yŭ couldn't make some - thing out of nothing . How could I alone do so ? 5 Speech is not merely the blowing of air . Speech is intended to sa y something, but what is spoken may not necessarily be valid . If it is not valid, has anything actually been spoken? Or has speec h never actually occurred? We may consider speech to be distinc t from the chirps of hatchlings, but is there really any differenc e between them ? How has the Way become so obscured that there are tru e and false? How has speech become so obscured that there ar e right and wrong? Could it be that the Way has gone off and is n o longer present? Could it be that speech is present but has lost it s ability to validate? The Way is obscured by partial achievements ; speech is obscured by eloquent verbiage . Thus there are contro- versies between Confucians and Mohists over what's right an d what ' s wrong . They invariably affirm what their opponents den y and deny what their opponents affirm . If one wishes to affir m what others deny and deny what others affirm, nothing is bette r than lucidity . Everything is \"that \" in relation to other things and \"this\" i n relation to itself . We may not be able to see things from th e standpoint of \"that, \" but we can understand them from th e standpoint of \"this .\" Therefore, it may be said that \"that\" derive s from \"this \" and that \"this \" is dependent upon \"that . \" Such is th e notion of the cogenesis of \"this\" and \"that . \" Nonetheless, fro m the moment of birth death begins simultaneously, and from th e moment of death birth begins simultaneously . Every affirmatio n is a denial of something else, and every denial is an affirmation o f something else . \" This \" and \"that\" are mutually dependent ; righ t and wrong are also mutually dependent . For this reason, the sag e does not subscribe to [the view of absolute opposites] but see s things in the light of nature, accepting \"this \" for what it is . \"This\" is also \"that\" ; \"that\" is also \"this .\" \"This\" implies a concept of right and wrong ; \"that \" also implies a concept o f right and wrong . But is there really a \" this \" and a \"that \" ? Or i s there really no \"this\" and no \"that\"? Where \"this \" and \"that \" cease to be opposites, there lies the pivot of the Way . Only whe n the pivot is located in the center of the circle of things can w e respond to their infinite transformations . The transformations"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"1 6 1 7 of \" right\" are infinite and so are the transformations of \" wrong . \" Therefore, it is said that nothing is better for responding to the m than lucidity . 6 To use a finger as a metaphor for the nonfingerness of a finger i s not as good as using nonfingerness as a metaphor for th e nonfingerness of a finger . To use a horse as a metaphor for th e nonhorseness of a horse is not as good as using nonhorseness a s a metaphor for the nonhorseness of a horse . Heaven and eart h are the same as a finger ; the myriad things are the same as a horse . Affirmation lies in our affirming ; denial lies in our denying . A way comes into being through our walking upon it ; a thing i s so because people say that it is . Why are things so? They are s o because we declare them to be so . Why are things not so? The y are not so because we declare them to be not so . All things ar e possessed of that which we may say is so ; all things are possesse d of that which we may affirm . There is no thing that is not so ; there is no thing that is not affirmable . Thus, whether it be a tiny blade of grass or a mighty pillar, a hideous leper or beauteous Hsi Shih, no matter how peculiar o r fantastic, through the Way they all become one . To split some - thing up is to create something else ; to create something is t o destroy something else . But for things in general, there is neithe r creation nor destruction, for they all revert to join in Unity . Only the perceptive understand that all things join in Unity . For this reason they do not use things themselves but lodge i n commonality . . . . It is all a result of their understanding th e mutual dependence of \"this\" and \"that .\" To have achieved thi s understanding but not be conscious of why it is so is called \" Th e Way . \" To weary the spiritual intelligence by trying to unify thing s without knowing that they are already identical is called \" three i n the morning .\" Why is this called \" three in the morning\"? Once upon a time, there was a monkey keeper who was feeding littl e chestnuts to his charges . \"I'll give you three in the morning an d four in the evening, \" he told them . All the monkeys were angry . 'All right, then,\" said the keeper, \"I'll give you four in th e morning and three in the evening . \" All the monkeys were happ y with this arrangement . Without adversely affecting either th e name or the reality of the amount that he fed them, the keepe r acted in accordance with the feelings of the monkeys . He to o recognized the mutual dependence of \"this\" and \" that . \" Conse- quently, the sage harmonizes the right and wrong of things an d rests at the center of the celestial potter's wheel . This is calle d \"dual procession . \" 7 The knowledge of the ancients attained the ultimate . What wa s the ultimacy that it attained? They realized that there was a stag e before there were things . This is the ultimacy they had attained , the utmost to which nothing can be added . Next, there wer e those who recognized that there were things, but that there was a stage before which things were distinguished . Next, there wer e those who recognized that there were distinctions among things , but that there was a stage before there was right and wrong . Now , the manifestation of right and wrong is what diminishes th e Way . What causes the diminution is what leads to the creatio n of preferences . But, after all, are there really diminution an d creation? Or are there, after all, really no diminution and cre- ation? That there are diminution and creation may be seen fro m clansman Chao's playing the lute . That there are no diminutio n and creation may be seen from clansman Chao's not playing th e lute . Chao Wen played the lute, Maestro K'uang beat the rhyth m with a stick, and Master Hui commented philosophically be- neath a parasol tree . The knowledge of these three masters wa s virtually complete, so they practiced it till the end of their lives . However, they believed that they were different from others in 1')"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"1 8 44, what they were fond of and wished to enlighten others abou t their fondness . Yet, try as they may to enlighten them, other s were not to be enlightened . Thus one of them ended his life i n muddleheaded discussions of \"hard\" and \"white .\" And Cha o Wen's son carried on his father ' s career his whole life without an y accomplishment . If this can be called accomplishment even I , who am without accomplishment, can be called accomplished . But if this cannot be called accomplishment, neither I no r anything else is accomplished . Therefore, the sage endeavors t o get rid of bewildering flamboyance . For this reason, he does no t use things himself, but lodges in commonality . This is calle d \"using lucidity .\" 8 Now I have something to say here . I do not know whether or no t what I have to say is of the same category as \"this .\" But, whethe r it is of the same category or not, like them it is a category, thus i n the end it is no different from \"that .\" Nevertheless, let me try t o explain myself . There is beginning . There is a time before beginning . Ther e is a time before the time before beginning . There is being . Ther e is nonbeing . There is a stage before nonbeing . There is a stag e before the stage before nonbeing . Suddenly there is being an d nonbeing . Still, as for being and nonbeing, I do not know whic h is really being and which is nonbeing . Now I have just sai d something, but I do not know whether what I have said is reall y saying something or not . There is nothing under heaven larger than the tip of a down y hair at the end of autumn, but Mount T ' ai is small . There is n o greater longevity than that of a child who dies in infancy, bu t Progenitor P'eng died young . Heaven and earth were bor n together with me and the myriad things are one with me . Sinc e all things are one, how can there be anything to talk about? Bu t since I have already said that all things are one, how can there be 1 9 nothing to talk about? One and speech makes two, two and on e makes three . Continuing on in this fashion, even the cleveres t mathematician couldn ' t keep up, how much less an ordinar y person! Therefore, if in proceeding from nonbeing to being w e arrive at three, how much farther we shall reach when proceedin g from being to being . We need not proceed at all if we understan d the mutual dependence of \"this\" and \"that . \" 9 The Way has never been divided up, speech has never bee n constant . It's all because of \"this \" that there are demarcations . Let me explain what I mean by demarcations . There are left an d right, discussions and deliberations, analyses and disputes, argu- ments and altercations . These are the eight types of demarcativ e assertions . The sages set aside without discussion what lie s beyond the world . The sages discuss what lies within the world , but do not deliberate upon it . As for annals and other records o f the statesmanship of the former kings, the sages deliberate ove r them but will not dispute about them . Therefore, wherever ther e is analysis, something is left unanalyzed . Wherever there i s dispute, something is left undisputed . You may ask, \"How ca n this be?\" The sages embrace all things, but ordinary peopl e dispute over them to show off to each other . Therefore it is said , wherever there is dispute, something is left unseen . The great Way is ineffable, great disputation is speechless , great humaneness is inhumane, great honesty is immodest, an d great bravery is not aggressive . The way that displays itself is no t the Way . Speech that is disputatious fails to achieve its aims . Humaneness that is constant cannot go around . Honesi .y that i s aloof will not be trusted . Bravery that is aggressive will no t succeed . One who does not abandon these five precepts will b e more or less headed in the right direction .

Nonetheless, I'll try to say some - thing about it . How can we know that what I call knowledge i s not really ignorance? How can we know that what I call igno- rance is not really knowledge?

Mao Ch ' iang and Hsi Shih were considered b y men to be beautiful, but if fish took one look at them they woul d dive into the depths, if birds saw them they would fly high int o the sky, if deer saw them they would run away pell-mell . Of thes e four, which knows the correct standard of beauty for all unde r heaven? As I see it, the principle of humaneness and righteous- ness, the paths of right and wrong, are inextricably confused . How would I be able to distinguish among them? \" \" If you ;\" asked Gnaw Gap, \"do not know the differenc e between benefit and harm, does the ultimate man likewise no t know the difference between them? \" \" The ultimate man is spiritous,\" said Princely Scion . \" If th e great marshes were set on fire, he would not feel hot .

Of the women who had seen him, mor e than ten petitioned their parents, saying, 'I would rather be hi s concubine than another man's wife .' No one had ever heard o f him advocating anything ; all he did was follow along with others . He did not occupy a lordly position whereby he could succo r those in distress . He had no accumulated salary whereby h e could fill people's stomachs . Furthermore, he was ugly enough t o terrify all under heaven . He always followed along and neve r took the lead . And his knowledge did not extend beyond hi s immediate surroundings . Yet male and female alike congregate d before him . Surely there must have been something that distin- guished him from other men . \"I summoned him to me and saw that, indeed, he was ugl y enough to terrify all under heaven . When he had lived with m e for less than a month, I began to take notice of his personality . Before a full year had passed, I began to put my trust in him . A s the state was without a prime minister, I offered the control o f the country to him . After a while he responded inarticulately, as 4 7 though he were vaguely declining . How embarrassed I was ! Finally, I handed the state over to him . Before very long, however , he left me and went away . I was distressed and felt as thoug h bereft, as though there was no one with whom to enjoy my state . What kind of person was he? \" \"Once when I was on a mission to the state of Ch ' u, \" sai d Confucius, \"I happened to see some little pigs suckling at thei r dead mother . After a short while, they all abandoned her and ra n away hastily . It was because they no longer saw themselves in he r and because they no longer sensed her to be their kind . Wha t they loved about their mother was not her physical form but tha t which animated her form . When men die in battle, they ar e buried without the feathered fans that normally adorn coffins . When a man ' s feet are amputated, he no longer has a reason to b e fond of his shoes . In both cases, it's because there ' s no basis — coffins or feet—for the fans and the shoes . \" The palace ladies of the son of heaven do not trim thei r nails nor do they pierce their ears .

Since he receives sustenanc e from heaven, what use has he for man? He has a human form, bu t is without human emotions . Because he has a human form, h e groups together with other men .

After a brief discours e on the Way comes a series of stories about the acceptance of one's destiny , whatever it may be . In contrast, humaneness and righteousness, two virtue s stressed by Confucians, are disparaged, as they are frequently elsewhere in the book . 1 To know the actions of heaven and to know the actions of man , that ' s the ultimate! She who knows the actions of heaven will liv e in accordance with heaven . She who knows the actions of me n can nourish what is unknown to her intellect with what is know n to her intellect . Thus she can live out the years allotted to her b y heaven and not die midway . This is the height of knowledge . However, there is still some difficulty . Namely, knowledg e has to depend on something for its consequent accuracy, bu t that which it depends on is particularly unstable . How do we"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"5 2 V know that what we attribute to heaven may not be due to man , and that what we attribute to man may not be due to heaven ? Only when there is a true man is there true knowledge . What is a true man? The true man of old did not oppose th e minority, did not strive for heroic accomplishments, and did no t scheme over affairs . Such being the case, he did not regret i t when he made a mistake nor feel smug when he was right . Suc h being the case, he could climb high without trembling, ente r water without getting soaked, and enter fire without feeling hot . Only one whose knowledge can ascend the heights of the Wa y can be like this . The true man of old did not dream when he slept and di d not worry when he was awake . His food was not savory, hi s breathing was deep . The breathing of the true man is from hi s heels, the breathing of the common man is from his throat . Th e words of those who unwillingly yield catch in their throats a s though they were retching . Those whose desires are deep-seate d will have shallow natural reserves . The true man of old knew neither fondness for life no r aversion to death, was neither elated by going forth nor reluctan t to return . Casually he went and casually he came . He neithe r forgot what his beginning had been nor sought what his en d would be . Happily he received and forgetfully he returned . Thi s is what is meant by not detracting from the Way with the mind , not assisting heaven with the human . This is what we call a tru e man . Such being the case, his mind was forgetful, his visage calm , his forehead beamingly broad . Austere as autumn, warm a s spring, his joy and anger were in touch with the four seasons . H e was compatible with all things but no one knew his limits . . . . The true man of ol d Was towering in stature but never collapsed , Seemed insufficient but accepted nothing ; Aloofly independent but not obstinate, 5 3 Amply empty but not ostentatious , Merry, as though he were happy , Demurring, as though he were compelled , Suffused with an alluring charm , Endowed with an arresting integrity , Stern, as though he were worldly , Arrogant, as though he were uncontrollable , Reticent, as though he preferred to clam up , Absent-minded, as though he forgot what to say . . . . Thus his likes were reduced to one and his dislikes were als o reduced to one . His \"one \" was one and his \"not one\" was als o one . Being \"one,\" he was a follower of heaven . Being \" not one,\" h e was a follower of man . He in whom neither heaven nor man i s victorious over the other is called a true man . 2 Life and death are destined . Their constant alternation, like tha t of day and night, is due to heaven . What men are unable t o interfere with are the attributes of all things . They particularl y regard heaven as their father and love it with their very person . How much more should they love that which surpasses heaven ! Men particularly regard their lord as superior to themselves an d would sacrifice their very person for him . How much mor e should they be willing to do so for what is truer than any lord ! When springs dry up, fish huddle together on the land . They blow moisture on each other and keep each other wet wit h their slime . But it would be better if they could forget themselve s in the rivers and lakes . Rather than praising Yao [sage] an d condemning Chieh [tyrant], it would be better for people t o forget both of them and assimilate their ways .

The idea of hiding the smaller in the larger i s appropriate, yet things may still disappear . But if we were to hid e all under heaven inside of all under heaven, nothing would disap - pear . This is the great attribute of the eternality of things . We ar e especially happy when we chance to take on human form . Wha t incalculable joy there is in these myriad transformations, such a s human form, which never begin to reach a limit! Therefore, th e sage wanders where things do not disappear and all are preserved . If people will emulate one who is good at being young and good a t growing old, good at beginning and good at ending, how muc h more should they emulate that to which the myriad things ar e joined and upon which the unity of transformation depends ! 3 The Way has attributes and evidence, but it has no action and n o form .

Sir Plow, who went to call on .him, said to his family , \" Shush! Go away!

Before he was buried, Confucius heard about his death and sen t Tzukung to participate in the funeral . When Tzukung ar- rived, he found one of them composing a tune and the othe r strumming on a lute . The song they sang along together wen t like this : Alas, Mulberry Door ! Alas, Mulberry Door !

They cultivate nonbein g and put physical form beyond them . They sing in the presenc e of the corpse without the slightest change of expression . There's no way I can describe them . What kind of people ar e they? \" \"They are people who wander beyond the spatial world, \" said Confucius, \" while I wander within it . Beyond and withi n are incompatible . It was uncouth of me to have sent you t o mourn him . They ' re about to become companions of th e Creator of Things, and wander in the unity of the vital breat h that joins heaven and earth . They consider life as an attache d cyst, an appended tumor, and death as the bursting of a boil , the draining of an abscess . Such being the case, what do they 6 1 care about the priority of life and death? They lodge in a common body composed of diverse elements . They forget thei r inner organs and are oblivious of the senses . Over and ove r turns the seamless cycle of beginning and ending . Faraway the y are, roaming beyond the dust and dirt of the mundane world , carefree in the karma of nonaction . So how can they b e bothered with worldly rites, merely to look good in the eyes o f ordinary people! \" \"Well, sir, \" asked Tzukung, \" to which realm do you adhere? \" \" I am one of heaven's condemned, \" said Confucius . \" Nev- ertheless, this is something we share in common . \" \" I venture to ask their secret ;\" said Tzukung . \" Fish delight in water,\" said Confucius, \" and man delights i n the Way . Delighting in water, fish find adequate nourishmen t just by passing through their ponds . Delighting in the Way , man's life is stabilized without ado . Therefore, it is said, ` Fis h forget themselves in the rivers and lakes ; men forget themselves i n the arts of the Way .' \" \"I venture to ask about the oddball,\" said Tzukung . \" The oddball may be odd to other men, but he is a pair wit h heaven .

Althoug h lacking these three qualities, he was held to be the best mourne r in the state of Lu . Can one really attain a name without th e substance?

Moreover, a s we are about to undergo transformation, how do we know tha t we aren ' t already transformed? As we are about to cease transfor- mation, how do we know that we have already transformed ? Perhaps you and I are in a dream from which we have not ye t awakened . He, however, had a vulnerable physical body but n o damage to his mind, a patched-together lodge but no expendi- ture of his essence . Mengsun was singularly awakened .

This is wha t happened to Maestro K ' uang . Will not the appendage of hu- maneness promote virtue and stopple one's nature, so as t o receive name and fame, causing the emulation of an unattainabl e model to the raucous accompaniment of all the reeds and drum s under heaven? This is what happened to Tseng Shen and Shi h Ch ' iu . Will not adding a web to one 's disputation, piling up an d knotting together forged phrases and hammered words, so as t o let the mind wander amid \" hard \" and \"white,\" \"identical \" an d \" different ;\" merely lead to the waste of useless words for a temporary reputation? This was what happened to Yang Ch u and Mo Ti . Therefore, these are all examples of the way o f superfluous webs and extraneous branches, not of the ultimatel y correct way for all under heaven . That which is ultimately correct does not lose the charac- teristics of its nature and destiny . Therefore, joining is accom- plished without a web, branching is accomplished withou t extraneousness, lengthening is accomplished without a surplus , shortening is accomplished without inadequacy . Thus, althoug h a duck's legs are short, if we extend them it will come to grief ; although a crane's legs are long, if we cut them short, it will b e tragic . Therefore, if what by nature is long is not cut short, and i f what by nature is short is not extended, there will be no grief t o dispense with . One suspects that humaneness and righteousnes s are not attributes of humanity! Otherwise, why would thos e humane men be so full of grie f Furthermore, he whose big toe is joined to his second toe b y a web would weep if it were torn apart ; he whose hand has a n extra finger would scream if it were bitten off . Of these two, i n the one case there is a surplus in number and in the other there i s a deficit, but the grief is the same . In today ' s world, the humane \t 77 people grieve over the world ' s troubles with bleary eyes ; th e inhumane people cast aside the characteristics of nature an d destiny in their greed for honor and wealth . Therefore, on e suspects that humaneness and righteousness are not attributes o f humanity . From the Three Dynasties on down, how much shril l contention there has been under heaven ! Furthermore, if we must depend upon the bevel, the ruler , the compass, and the L-square to make things correct, tha t would be to slice away their nature . If we must depend upo n cords, twine, glue, and lacquer to make things solid, that woul d be to invade their integrity . Bowing and scraping to the rites an d music, simpering and smirking with humaneness and righteous- ness to console the hearts of all under heaven, this is to forfei t constancy . Constancy implies the making of angles without a bevel, the making of straight lines without a ruler, the making o f circles without a compass, the making of squares without a n L-square, sticking things together without glue or lacquer, tyin g things together without cords or twine . Therefore, all unde r heaven are drawn into life but do not know why they are alive , and all are alike in attaining their ends without knowing why . Therefore, in ancient times and today, it has always been th e same : imperishable . Then why should humaneness and righ- teousness wander incessantly amid the Way and its integrity lik e glue, lacquer, cords, and twine, causing confusion for all unde r heaven ? If there is but small confusion, there will be a change o f direction ; if there is great confusion, there will be a change o f nature . How do we know this is so? The clansman of th e freehold at Yŭ summoned humaneness and righteousness to ve x all under heaven . When everyone under heaven goes rushin g about at the behest of humaneness and righteousness, does thi s not change their nature through humaneness and righteousness ? Therefore, I shall try to discuss this matter . From the Three Dynasties on down, everyone has altered hi s nature for the sake of something . The petty man sacrifices"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"7 8 himself for the sake of gain ; the nobleman sacrifices himself fo r the sake of a name ; the great officer sacrifices himself for the sak e of his family ; the sage sacrifices himself for the sake of all unde r heaven . Therefore, these various people, although of differen t occupations and dissimilar reputations, in damaging their natur e through personal sacrifice are identical . A slave boy and a ser f were out herding their sheep together and both lost their sheep . When the slave boy was asked how it happened, he said that h e was holding his bamboo strips and reading . When the serf wa s asked how it happened, he admitted that he was playing at dic e and making bets . Although the two of them were differentl y occupied, their loss of the sheep was equivalent . Poyi died fo r fame at the foot of Shouyang ; Robber Footpad died for gain o n top of Tungling . Although the two of them died for differen t reasons, the damage to their lives and the harm to their nature s was equivalent . Why must we approve of Poyi and disapprove o f Robber Footpad? Of all those under heaven who sacrifice them - selves, those who do so for humaneness and righteousness ar e commonly called \"superior men\" while those who do so fo r goods and wealth are commonly called \"petty men .\" Thei r sacrifice is the same, but one of them is accounted a superior ma n and the other a petty man . In regard to damaging life an d injuring nature, Robber Footpad was just like Poyi . Why the n should we choose a superior man and a petty man from betwee n them ? Furthermore, he who subordinates his nature to humanenes s and righteousness, although he may do so as thoroughly as Tsen g Shen and Shih Ch'iu, is not what I would call \"good .\" He wh o subordinates his nature to the five flavors, although he may do s o as thoroughly as Shu'erh, is not what I would call \"expert .\" H e who subordinates his nature to the five sounds, although he ma y do so as thoroughly as Maestro K ' uang, is not what I would cal l \" keen of hearing .\" He who subordinates his nature to the fiv e colors, although he may do so as thoroughly as Spidersight, i s not what I would call \"keen sighted . \" What I mean by calling a 7 9 person \" good \" does not refer to her humaneness or righteous- ness, for such a person would be \"good \" only in her virtue . Wha t I mean by calling a person \" good \" does not refer to so-calle d humaneness and righteousness, but simply to her acceptance o f the characteristics of her nature and destiny . What I mean b y calling a person \" keen of hearing ;\" does not refer to her hearin g anything else, but only to her hearing herself . What I mean b y calling a person \" keen sighted \" does not refer to her seein g anything else, but only to her seeing herself . He who does not se e himself but only sees other things, and who does not realiz e himself but only realizes other things, is one who realizes wha t others realize but does not himself realize what he realizes . H e strives to delight others but does nothing to delight himself . H e who strives to delight others but does nothing to delight himself , though he be a Robber Footpad or a Poyi, is equally debauche d and perverted . Because I feel shame before the Way and it s integrity, I dare not engage in the elevated manipulation o f humaneness and righteousness, nor in the debased conduct o f debauchery and perversity ."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"8 1 4 HORSES ' HOOVE S The sages (those honored by the Confucians) are rebuked for their pursuit o f knowledge and interference with the innate characteristics of things . Left to thei r own devices, human beings and animals would form harmonious natura l communities . 1 A horse ' s hooves can tread upon frost and snow, its hair ca n withstand the wind and the cold . It eats grass and drinks water ; it prances about briskly . This is a horse's true nature . Thoug h one might provide a horse with magnificent terraces and splen- did bedrooms, they are of no use to it . But then came Poleh, wh o said, \"I am skilled at training horses .\" And men began to sing e them, clip their hair, trim their hooves, and brand them . The y led them with bridles and hobbles, lined them up in stable an d stall, resulting in the deaths of two or three out of ten . The y made the horses go hungry and thirsty, raced them, and gallope d them, arrayed them in rows and columns . In front were th e tribulations of the bit and the ornamental halter, behind were the threats of the whip and the crop, resulting in the deaths o f over half the horses . The potter said, \"I am skilled at working clay . My roun d pieces fit the compass and my square pieces fit the L-square : \" The carpenter said, \"I am skilled at working wood . My angula r pieces fit the bevel and my straight pieces match the ruler :' Yet i s it in the nature of clay and wood that they should fit th e compass, the L-square, the bevel, and the ruler? Nonetheless , generation after generation extol them, saying, \"Poleh was skille d at training horses ; the carpenter and the potter are skilled a t working clay and wood . \" This is also the error made by thos e who govern all under heaven . I suspect, however, that those who are skilled at governin g all under heaven would not do so . Their people, having a con- stant nature, would weave cloth to wear and plow the land i n order to eat . This is called \"common integrity .\" They woul d remain unified and not split into factions ; this condition w e may style \"natural freedom . \" Therefore, in an age of ultimat e integrity, they would walk with quiet confidence, look ahea d with focused composure . In such an age, there would be n o paths and tunnels through the mountains, no boats or bridge s to cross the swamps . The myriad things would live in groups , their settlements lined up next to each other . Birds and beast s would form groups, the grasses and trees would thrive . Thu s birds and beasts could be tamed but still wander about ; on e could climb up to the nests of magpies and peep in withou t disturbing them . In a world of ultimate integrity, men would dwell togethe r with the birds and the beasts . They would come together i n tribes with the myriad things . What would they know of supe- rior men and petty men? Equally without knowledge, they woul d not stray from their integrity . Equally without desire, this i s called \"the simplicity of the unhewn log :' With the simplicity o f the unhewn log, the people would attain their nature .

If the white jade remained unimpaired, wh o would make scepters and tallies from it? If the Way and integrit y were not discarded, who would choose humaneness and righ- teousness? If the attributes of our individual natures were not se t aside, what use would there be for rites and music? If the fiv e colors were not confused, who would make colorful patterns? I f the five sounds were not confused, who would conform to the si x pitch-pipes? The carving of the unhewn log into instruments i s the fault of the craftsman ; the impairment of the Way an d integrity with humaneness and righteousness is the error of th e sage . Returning to the subject of horses, if they are allowed to liv e on the open land, they eat the grass and drink the water . Whe n they are happy, they cross necks and rub against each other . When they are angry, they turn back to back and kick each other . The knowledge of horses amounts to this and no more . But i f you put a yoke upon them and array them evenly with littl e moon-mirrors on their foreheads, all they know is to try to brea k the cross-bar, twist out of the yoke, smash the chariot cover , expel the bit, and bite through the reins . Therefore, to take th e knowledge of a horse and make it behave like a brigand is th e crime of Poleh . In the time of the clansman Hohsŭ, when people stayed a t home, they did not know what they were doing, and when the y went outside, they did not know where they were going . The y filled their mouths with food and were happy, strolling abou t with their bellies stuffed tight as a drum . The abilities of th e people were this and no more . Then along came the sages t o rectify the form of all under heaven with their bowing and 83 scraping to the rites and music . They unveiled their humanenes s and righteousness from on high to soothe the hearts of all unde r heaven, but the people began to be plodding in their fondnes s for knowledge .

This, too, is the error of the sages ."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"8 5 1 0 RANSACKING COFFER S It is the (Confucian) sage, with all of his cleverness and virtuousness, who give s rise to robbers and thieves . Echoing the Tao Te Ching, the author of thi s chapter longs for a time of primitive simplicity . 1 In guarding against thieves who ransack coffers, search throug h bags, and break open cupboards, people are sure to bind the m with ropes and cords, secure them with clasps and hasps . This i s what common opinion calls being wise . But if a giant thie f comes, he will put the cupboard on his back, pick up the coffer , carry the bag on a pole over his shoulder, and run away wit h them, fearing only that the ropes and cords, the clasps and hasp s may not be secure enough . This being so, is not he whom I jus t referred to as wise merely collecting things for the great thief ? Therefore, let me try to explain . Is not he whom commo n opinion calls wise collecting things for the great thief? Is not th e so-called sage a guardian for the great thief? How do we kno w this is so? Of old, in the state of Ch ' i, neighboring villages gaze d across at each other and could hear the sounds of each other ' s chickens and dogs . The area over which they spread their net s and which they plowed and cultivated was more than two thou - sand tricents square . Within their four boundaries, wheneve r they erected an ancestral temple or altar to the gods of the lan d and grain, and in carrying out the government of their villages , households, townships, neighborhoods, districts, and hamlets , they always modeled themselves after the sages . Of a sudden , however, Viscount Fieldborn murdered the ruler of Ch ' i an d stole his state . But was it only the state that he stole? Along wit h it he stole the laws of sagely wisdom . Therefore, while Viscoun t Fieldborn may have had the name of a robber and a thief, he wa s ensconced as firmly as Yao or Shun . The small states did no t dare to find fault with him, the big states did not dare to punis h him . For twelve generations, his family has possessed the state o f Ch ' i . Hence, not only did he steal the state of Ch'i, along with i t he took the laws of sagely wisdom and used them to guard hi s robbing, thieving person . Let me try to explain . Is not he whom common opinion call s ultimately wise collecting things for the great thief? Is not the so - called ultimate sage a guardian for the great thief? How do w e know this is so? Long ago, Lungp'ang was beheaded, Pikan ha d his heart cut out, C h ' ang Hung was disemboweled, and Tzuhsŭ' s corpse was left to putrefy . Therefore, even four worthies such a s these could not escape such horrible deaths . Therefore, th e followers of Footpad inquired of him, saying, \"Do waylayers als o have a way? \" \" Wherever one goes,\" said Footpad, \" there is always a way . By shrewdly surmising that valuables are stored in a room, th e robber shows his sageness . By entering first, he shows his bravery . By going out last, he shows his righteousness . By knowin g whether the robbery may be attempted or not, he shows hi s wisdom . By dividing the spoils equally, he shows his humaneness . There is no one under heaven who is not possessed of these fiv e qualities that can become a great robber . \" Viewed in this light, a good man who does not attain the"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"8 6 way of the sages cannot establish himself . And Footpad coul d not have pursued his course without the way of the sages . But th e good men under heaven are few and the bad men are many . Thu s the benefits of the sages to all under heaven are few and thei r harms to all under heaven are many . Therefore, we have th e sayings : \"When the lips are missing, the teeth will get cold \" ; \" The diluted wine of Lu led to the siege of Hantan\" ; \" When a sage is born, great robbers arise .\" If we were to assault the sage s and release the robbers and thieves, all under heaven would begi n to be governed . When the rivers run dry, the valleys are empty ; when the hills are leveled, the chasms are filled in . When the sag e dies, the great robbers do not arise . Then all under heaven will b e at peace and without event . If the sage does not die, there will be no end to great robbers . The more emphasis is placed on the sage in governing all unde r heaven, the greater the gain for Robber Footpad . If bushels an d pecks are devised for measuring, then he will steal by the bushe l and the peck . If weights and steelyards are devised for weighing , then he will steal by the weight and the steelyard . If tallies an d seals are devised for verifying, then he will steal by the tally an d the seal . If humaneness and righteousness are devised for reform- ing the world, he will steal by humaneness and righteousness . How do we know that this is so ? He who steals a belt buckle is executed ; He who steals a state becomes a feudal lord . It is within the gates of the feudal lord s That humaneness and righteousness are preserved . Is this not stealing humaneness and righteousness, sagenes s and wisdom? Thus those who follow after the great robbers an d exalt the nobles, who steal humaneness and righteousness to- gether with all the gains from bushels and pecks, weights an d steelyards, tallies and seals—even the reward of carriage an d crown will not dissuade them, even the threat of the executioner ' s 8 7 ax will not constrain them . This increasing of the gain to Robbe r Footpad, making it impossible to constrain him, is the error o f the sages . Thus, there is the saying, \"Fish cannot be removed from th e watery depths ; the profitable instruments of state cannot b e shown to the people . \" The wisdom of the sage is the profitabl e instrument of all under heaven and is not something that shoul d be revealed to all under heaven . Therefore, abolish sagehood an d abandon wisdom, then the great robbers will be stopped . Thro w away jade and smash pearls, then the petty robbers will not arise . Burn tallies and break seals, then the people will be simple an d unsophisticated . Crush bushels and snap steelyards, then th e people will not contend . Annihilate all the sagely laws unde r heaven, then it will be possible to begin to reason with th e people . Confound the six pitch-pipes, melt down the mout h organ, and do away with the zither, stop up Maestro K ' uang ' s ears, and all the people under heaven will begin to repossess thei r keenness of hearing . Eradicate patterned ornaments, disperse th e five tints, glue shut the eyes of Spidersight, and all the peopl e under heaven will begin to repossess their keenness of vision . Destroy bevel and ruler, abandon compass and L-square, crus h the fingers of craftsman Ch'ui, and all the people under heave n will begin to repossess their cleverness . . . . Discard the conduc t of Tseng Shen and Shih Ch'iu, clamp shut the mouths of Yan g Chu and Mo Ti, cast aside humaneness and righteousness, an d the integrity of all under heaven will begin to display it s mysterious identity . When people repossess their keenness o f eyesight, then all under heaven will no longer be glittery . Whe n people repossess their keenness of hearing, then all unde r heaven will no longer be cacophonous . When people reposses s their wisdom, then all under heaven will no longer be deluded . When people repossess their integrity, then all under heave n will no longer be perverse . Tseng Shen, Shih Ch ' iu, Yang Chu , Mo Ti, Maestro K ' uang, Craftsman Ch'ui, and Spidersigh t were all individuals who established their virtues outside of"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"88 r themselves and thereby disrupted all under heaven, useless t o the law . 2 Do you, sir, not know of the age of ultimate integrity? Long ago , there were the clansmen Jungch'eng, Tat ' ing, Pohuang , Chungyang, Lilu, Lihsŭ, Hsienyŭan, Hohsii, Tsunlu, Chujung , Fuhsi, and Shennung . At that time, the people knotted ropes t o keep records ; they considered their food to be savory, thei r clothes to be beautiful, their customs to be pleasurable, thei r dwellings to be secure . They could gaze across at the neighborin g state and hear the sounds of its dogs and chickens, but th e people would never travel back and forth till they died of old age . Such a time as this was one of ultimate government . Now , however, we have arrived at a situation where people crane thei r necks and stand on tiptoe, saying, \" There ' s a worthy man a t such-and-such a place . \" And they rush off to him carryin g whatever provisions they can muster . Thus, within the famil y they abandon their parents and outside they leave the service o f the ruler . Their footsteps extend unbroken across the territorie s of the feudal lords, their chariot tracks criss-cross a thousan d tricents away . This, then, results from the error of superiors wh o are overly fond of knowledge . When superiors are genuinely fond of knowledge but lac k the Way, all under heaven will be in great confusion . How do w e know this is so? The more knowledge there is of bows, cross - bows, hand-nets, stringed arrows, and snares, the more the bird s in the sky above are thrown into confusion . The more knowledg e there is of hooks, bait, nets, throw-nets, pull-nets, and baske t traps, the more the fish in the water below are thrown int o confusion . The more knowledge there is of palings, pitfalls , rabbit nets, and gins, the more the animals in the marshes ar e thrown into confusion . The more varieties of cunning, decep- tion, slipperiness, talk of \"hard and white, \" prevarication, claims 8 9 of \"identical \" and \" different \" there are, the more the commo n people will be deluded by disputation . Therefore, whenever al l under heaven is in great confusion, the fault lies in fondness o f knowledge . Thus, all men under heaven know how to seek wha t they do not know, but no one knows how to seek what he alread y knows . All men know how to condemn what they consider to b e bad, but no one knows how to condemn what they consider t o be good, and so there is great confusion . Thus, they rebel agains t the brightness of the sun and moon above, consume the essenc e of the mountains and rivers below, and disrupt the procession o f the four seasons in between . From wriggling insects to the tinies t flying creatures, there are none that would not lose their natures . Great, indeed, is the confusion that is brought to all unde r heaven from fondness for knowledge! From the Three Dynastie s on down, so it has been .

The secon d half of the chapter is a long exposition of the ultimate Way and the happ y freedom that it affords . 1 1 1 I have heard of preserving and accepting all under heaven, but I have not heard of governing all under heaven . One \"preserves \" for fear that all under heaven will prostitute their nature ; on e \" accepts \" for fear that all under heaven will alter their integrity . If all under heaven do not prostitute their nature, and if all unde r heaven do not alter their integrity, what need would there be fo r someone to govern all under heaven? Long ago, when Ya o governed all under heaven, he made everyone delightfully enjo y their nature, which means they were not placid . When Chie h governed all under heaven, he made everyone wearily feel th e bitterness of their own nature, which means they were no t content . To be neither placid nor content is a negation of integrity . There is no one under heaven, who can long endur e when her integrity is negated . Is a man too happy?—he will have an excess of yang . Is a man too angry?—he will have an excess of yin . When there is a n excess of yin and yang, the four seasons will not arrive on time , and the harmony of cold and heat will be incomplete . Woul d this not result in injury to the human body? If men are made t o lose a proper perspective on happiness and anger, to dwel l without constancy, to think without satisfaction, and to give u p midway without completing what they have started, all unde r heaven will begin to be arrogantly perverse and fiercely proud , then there will be conduct like that of Robber Footpad, Tsen g Shen, and Shih Ch'iu . Thus, the entirety of all under heave n would not be adequate to reward the good, nor would it b e sufficient to punish the bad . Therefore, all under heaven, great a s it is, is not adequate for rewards and punishments . From th e Three Dynasties on down, people have all the while been boister- ously occupied with rewards and punishments . What leisur e have they for being secure in the attributes of their nature an d destiny ? Furthermore, does he delight in keen eyesight?—he will b e seduced by color . Does he delight in keen hearing?—he wil l be seduced by sound . Does he delight in humaneness?—he wil l be confused by virtue . Does he delight in righteousness?—h e will be confounded by principle . Does he delight in rites?—h e will encourage ingenuity . Does he delight in music?—he wil l encourage lasciviousness . Does he delight in sageness?—h e will encourage artifice . Does he delight in knowledge?—he wil l encourage fussiness . If all under heaven are secure in the attribute s of their nature and destiny, it would make no difference whethe r these eight delights are preserved or not . But if all under heave n are not secure in the attributes of their nature and destiny, thes e eight delights will begin to warp and ravish, bringing confusion t o all under heaven .

These are not merely passing fancies that men wil l dispense with . Rather they fast before mentioning them, kneel a s they present them, and dance before them with drum and song . And then what can we do about them ? Therefore, when the superior man has no choice but t o oversee all under heaven, there is no better policy than nonac- tion . Having adopted a policy of nonaction, he can be secure i n the attributes of his nature and destiny . Therefore it is said , When a man values his body so that he ma y manage all under heaven , then all under heaven can be entrusted to him . When a man is sparing of his body so that he ma y manage all under heaven , then all under heaven can be delivered to him . Therefore, if the superior man can avoid dissipating his fiv e viscera and overexerting his keen hearing and eyesight, remainin g still as a corpse with a dragonish presence, silent in the depth s with a thunderous voice, his spirit moving while heaven follow s along with it, composed in nonaction while the myriad thing s are like so many motes of dust rising in the air, then what leisur e will he have to govern all under heaven ? 2 Ts'ui Chu inquired of Old Longears, saying, \" If you do no t govern all under heaven, how can you make men's minds good? \" \"You must be careful not to disturb men ' s minds,\" said Ol d Longears . \"When constrained, the human mind becomes de - pressed ; when encouraged, it becomes elated .

The 9 3 mind may be so agitated that, in an instant, it has twice reache d out beyond the four seas . At rest, it is deep-seated and calm . I n action, it is remote as the sky .

Consequently, Yao and Shu n worked themselves to the bone, till there was not a hair left o n their legs, toiling to nourish the bodies of all under heaven . The y tormented their five viscera with the exercise of humaneness an d righteousness ; they depleted blood and vital breath to set u p laws and regulations, but still there were some who would no t submit . For this reason, Yao and Shun banished Huan Tou t o Mount Ch ' ung, expelled the Three Miao tribes to Sanwei, an d exiled Kungkung to Yutu . This shows that they could not mak e all under heaven submit . Their ways were practiced down to th e kings of the Three Dynasties, by which time all under heave n were in a great panic . Of the lower type of characte r there were Chieh and Footpad ; Of the higher type of characte r there were Tseng Shen and Shih Ch'iu ; And finally the Confucians and the Mohists arose .

Th e criminal cause of all this was the disturbing of men ' s minds .

Therefore it is said, \"Abolish sagehood an d abandon knowledge, and all under heaven will be well governed . \" 4 The Yellow Emperor had been established as the Son of Heave n for nineteen years and his orders were carried out by all unde r heaven, when he heard that Master Broadly Complete was stay- ing on Mount Emptysame, so he went to see him . \"I have hear d that you, sir, are accomplished in the ultimate Way, \" said the 9 5 Yellow Emperor . \"I venture to ask what the essence of th e ultimate Way is . I wish to take the essence of heaven and earth t o assist the growth of the five grains for the nourishment of th e people . I also wish to direct the yin and the yang to confor m with the needs of all living beings . What should I do in order t o accomplish this? \" \" That which you wish to ask about, \" said Master Broadl y Complete, \" is the original substance of things . That which yo u wish to direct is the residue of things .

You have the mind of a garrulou s flatterer and are unfit to be told about the ultimate Way . \" The Yellow Emperor retreated, gave up all under heaven , built himself an isolated hut, spread a mat made of white couc h grass, and dwelt there unoccupied for three months . Then h e went again to request instruction . Master Broadly Complete was lying down with his hea d toward the south . With a deferential air, the Yellow Empero r crept forward on his knees . Bowing twice, he kowtowed an d inquired of him, saying, \" I ' ve heard that you, sir, are accom- plished in the ultimate Way .

Both the desire for others to be like themselves an d the desire that others not be different from themselves stem fro m their minds being set on distinguishing themselves from th e crowd . But have those whose minds are set on distinguishin g themselves from the crowd really done so? Better to go alon g with the crowd by being content with what one has learned, fo r it could never match the ingenuity of the crowd as a whole . Ye t those who desire to administer the state of another only hav e their gaze set on the profits of the rulers of the three dynastie s without seeing all of the troubles involved . This is to try one ' s luck with another's state . But how often can one try one's luc k without bringing ruin to his state? The chances for the preserva- tion of his state will not be one in ten thousand, while th e chances that it will be ruined are more than ten thousand to one . How sad it is that those who possess the land are unaware of this ! The possessors of the land possess the greatest of all things . Possessing the greatest of all things, they should not be influ- enced by things . Having a thing but not being influenced b y things, therefore they can treat things as things . He who per- ceives dearly how to treat things as things is himself not a thing . As such, he will not merely govern the hundred clans of all under 10 1 heaven .

The authors of these fou r chapters were probably responsible for the original editing of the Chuan g Tzuanthology . Whereas Heaven was the favored cosmic concept of the Confucians, th e Tao (Way) is obviously preferred by the Taoists and a nod is made in thi s chapter to the greatness of the Way . It is striking, however, that the autho r attempts to sanction virtue, the sage ruler, filial piety, and other Confucia n concerns that Master Chuang ridiculed at every opportunity . We are thu s confronted with the peculiar prospect of a superficial Taoist rhetoric being used t o propagate a basically Confucian agenda . 1 Although heaven and earth are great, their evolution is uniform . Although the myriad things are numerous, their governance i s unitary . Although the masses of men are multitudinous, thei r ruler is the one lord . The lord finds his source in virtue and hi s completion in heaven . Therefore it is said that the lords of dark antiquity ruled all under heaven through nonaction, through th e virtue of heaven, and that is all . If we observe words in the light of the Way, the names of al l under heaven will be rectified . If we observe distinctions throug h the Way, the usages appropriate for ruler and subject will b e clear . If we observe abilities through the Way, the officials of al l under heaven will govern well . If we observe generally throug h the Way, the application of the myriad things will be total . Therefore, the Way is that which pervades heaven and earth , virtue is that which accords with the myriad things ; administra- tive affairs are the means by which superiors govern the people ; and skill is that which lends art to ability . Skill is linked t o administrative affairs, administrative affairs are linked to righ- teousness, righteousness is linked to virtue, virtue is linked to th e Way, and the Way is linked to heaven . Therefore, it is said, thos e among the ancients who reared all under heave n Were without desire , Yet all under heaven had enough . They did nothing , Yet the myriad things evolved . They were silent as the watery depths , Yet the hundred clans were settled . A record says : Commune with the one , And the myriad affairs will be completed . Have no mind for achievement , And the ghosts and spirits will submit . 2 The master said, \" The Way is that which covers and support s the myriad things . Oceanic is its greatness! The superior man"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"1 0 4 must lay his mind bare to it . To act through nonaction is calle d heaven ; to speak through nonaction is called virtue ; to love me n and benefit things is called humaneness ; to make the dissimila r similar is called greatness ; to conduct oneself without ostenta- tion is generosity ; to possess a myriad dissimilarities is wealth . Therefore, to maintain virtue is called the guideline ; the comple- tion of virtue is called establishment ; to accord with the Way i s called completion ; not to allow things to distract the will i s called fulfillment . When the superior man understands these te n qualities, how commodious will be the greatness of his mind , how copious will be his flowing with the myriad things! Suc h being the case, he lets the gold lie hidden in the mountains, th e pearls in the depths . He does not profit from goods or property , does not associate with honor and wealth . He does not rejoice i n longevity, is not saddened by premature death . He finds no glor y in success, no shame in poverty . He would not grasp at the profi t of the whole world to make it his private possession, nor woul d he rule all under heaven as his personal distinction . His distinc- tion lies in understanding that the myriad things belong to a single treasury, and that life and death have the same appearance . 3 The master said, \"How deep is the dwelling of the Way! Ho w limpid its purity! Without it, metal and stone would have n o means to sound . Thus, though metal and stone have a voice, i f they are not struck they will not sound . Who can ascertain th e myriad things ? \" The man of kingly virtues proceeds in plainness and i s ashamed to be involved with affairs . He establishes himself in th e original source and his knowledge communicates with th e spirits . Therefore, his virtue is broad and his mind goes fort h when something stimulates it . Thus, without the Way, for m would not be born . Without virtue, life would not be manifest . To preserve the bodily form and finish out one ' s life, to establish 10 5 virtue and manifest the Way—is this not kingly virtue? Magnifi- cent in his sudden going forth and in his quick movements, th e myriad things follow him! This we call a man of kingly virtue . \"He sees into darkest darkness ; he hears where there are n o sounds . In the midst of darkest darkness, he alone sees a glim- mer . In the midst of soundlessness, he alone hears harmony . Therefore, in the deepness of the deep, he can perceive things ; i n the spiritousness of the spirit, he can perceive essences . Thus, i n his contacts with the myriad things, he provides for their need s through ultimate nothingness, gives them lodging through hi s timely diligence . . . .\" 4 The Yellow Emperor was wandering north of Redwater when h e ascended the heights of K'unlun and gazed toward the south . A s he was returning home, he lost his pearl of mystery . Knowledg e was sent to search for the pearl, but he couldn't find it . Spider - sight was sent to search for the pearl, but he couldn't find it . Trenchancy was sent to search for the pearl, but he couldn't fin d it, whereupon Amorphous was sent and he found it . \" Extraordi- nary!\" said the Yellow Emperor . \"In the end, it was Amorphou s who was able to find it .\" 5 Yao's teacher was Hsŭ Yu ; Hsŭ Yu's teacher was Gnaw Gap ; Gnaw Gap's teacher was Princely Scion ; and Princely Scion ' s teacher was Wearcoat . Yao inquired of Hsŭ Yu, saying, \" Can Gnaw Gap be th e companion of heaven? If so, I could rely on Princely Scion t o invite him to replace me on the throne . \" \"Perilous!\" said Hsŭ Yu . \"That would put all heaven in a precarious position . As a person, Gnaw Gap is intelligent , shrewd, quick-witted, and clever . His natural talents surpass"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"1 0 6 those of other men and, furthermore, he is able to utilize hi s human abilities to receive the aid of heaven . He is cautious i n preventing error, but he does not know whence errors arise . Le t him be the companion of heaven? He would avail himself of hi s human abilities and neglect heaven . Then he would make hi s own person the basis of everything and alienate all other forms , would rush about furiously out of respect for knowledge, woul d be driven by trivialities, would be stymied by things, would reac t to things in whichever direction he glanced, would react to a hos t of opinions, would evolve along with things and thus would no t begin to have any enduring principle of his own . How could h e be fit to be the companion of heaven? Nevertheless, there ar e clans and there are ancestors . He could be the father of on e group, but not the father of the fathers of many groups . Thi s sort of government would lead to disorder . It would be a disaste r for the north-facing ministers, a catastrophe for the south-facin g ruler . 6 Yao was inspecting Hua when the border warden of the plac e said to him, \"Aha! a sage! Allow me to ask blessings for the sage . Long live the sage! \" \"I decline,\" said Yao . \" May the sage become wealthy! \" \"I decline,\" said Yao . \"May the sage have many sons! \" \"I decline, \" said Yao . \"Longevity, wealth, and many sons, \" said the border warden , are what all men desire . Why do you alone not desire them? \" \" Many sons,\" said Yao, \"bring many fears . Wealth bring s many affairs . Longevity brings many disgraces . These thre e blessings are of no use in nourishing virtue . Therefore, I declin e them : ' \"At first,\" said the border warden, \"I thought you were a sage . 10 7 But now I see that you are a superior man . In giving birth to th e myriads of people, heaven is certain to assign them their duties . If you were to have many sons, you would assign them thei r duties, so what is there to fear? If you were wealthy, you coul d share with others, so what affairs would there be ? The sage dwells like a quai l and is fed like a hatchling , Moves like a bird through the ai r and leaves no traces . When the Way prevails under heaven , He enjoys prosperity along with all things ; When the Way is absent under heaven , He cultivates his virtue in retirement . Tired of the world, after a thousand year s He leaves it and ascends among the immortals . He mounts on the white cloud s And arrives in the land of Deus . The three tribulations never affect him ; His person is free from misfortune . \"So what disgrace would there be? \" As the border warden was leaving, Yao followed after him , saying, \"May I ask about . . . ? \" \" Away with you!\" said the border warden . 7 When Yao was governing all under heaven, he appointed Uncl e Complete Sir High as one of his feudal lords . Later, Yao passe d the throne to Shun, and Shun passed it on to Yŭ, whereupo n Uncle Complete Sir High resigned his position as feudal lor d and became a plowman .

He carried out no punishments, but the people were in awe . Now you, sir, use rewards and punishments, but the people ar e not humane .

Wh y don ' t you just go away, sir, and not interrupt my work?\" Wit h that, he busily set to plowing again and paid no more attentio n to Yii . 8 In the grand beginning, there was only nonbeing , But no being and no names . Out of it arose the One ; There was One, but still no form . From the One, things could be born, receiving what is calle d their virtue . That which still had no form was divided, yet ther e was no separation . This is called destiny . Through stasis and movement, things were born . As things wer e completed, various configurations were produced . These are called forms . The bodily form protects the spirit, the form and the spirit eac h having its own usages . 10 9 This we call nature . Through cultivation of nature, it returns to virtue, and whe n virtue reaches its pinnacle, it is the same as at the beginning . Being the same, it is empty . Being empty, it is great . This is lik e joining in with the chirping of birds . Having joined in with th e chirping of birds, one may join with heaven and earth . This joining is all blurry , As though one were stupid or muddled . This is called dark virtue , And is the same as the great confluence . 9 The master inquired of Old Longears, saying, \" There are me n who govern the Way as though they were banishing it . The y affirm what is not affirmable, declare what is not so to be so . Th e sophists have a saying, ` One can distinguish \"hard\" and \"white \" as clearly as though they were suspended in space : Can someon e like this be called a sage? \" \" Such a person ;\" said Old Longears, \" would be like a clerk a t his labors or a craftsman tied to his work, toiling his body an d vexing his mind . It is the hunting ability of the pointer an d retriever that constrains them, it is the nimbleness of the gibbo n and the monkey that brings them out of the mountain forests . Hillock, I will tell you what you cannot hear and what yo u cannot speak . Multitudinous are those who have heads and fee t but no minds and no ears, while there is absolutely no one wh o has a physical form that can coexist with the formless and th e shapeless .

As he was passing along the south bank of th e Han River, he saw an elderly man who was working in hi s vegetable garden . He had dug a channel to bring water from th e well and was carrying jars to pour on the garden . He exerted a tremendous amount of energy, but with little result .

When someone assents to whatever commo n opinion assents to and approves of whatever common opinio n approves, he is not declared to be a flatterer . Is common opinion , then, more stern than a parent and more respected than a lord ? If you call someone a sycophant, he will instantly chang e countenance ; if you call someone a flatterer, he will angril y change countenance, though he be a lifelong sycophant and a lifelong flatterer . He brings together similes and dresses up hi s diction to attract the multitudes, but from beginning to end , from top to bottom, he'll never admit his guilt . He lets his robe s hang down, displays their brilliant colors, posturing and puttin g on airs, so as to captivate the whole world, but he doesn't cal l himself a flatterer . He is just a follower of those others who goe s along with what they hold to be right and wrong, but he himsel f doesn ' t admit to being one of the crowd . This is the ultimat e folly . He who knows his folly is not the greatest fool ; he wh o knows his delusion is not greatly deluded . He who is greatl y deluded will not be released from delusion his whole life ; he who"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"1 1 6 is a great fool will not become smart his whole life . If three me n are walking along and one of them is deluded, they will reac h their destination because the deluded are in the minority . But i f two of them are deluded, they will walk in vain without eve r reaching their destination because the deluded are in the major- ity . Today, all under heaven are deluded . Though I pray for thei r guidance, it cannot be had . Is this not sad ? Great music will not have any effect on the ear of a villager , but he will laugh with glee when he hears \"Breaking the Willow \" or \"The Bright Flowers .\" For this reason, lofty words do no t remain in the minds of the masses . Refined words make n o impression because vulgar words are in the majority . A couple o f jugs will delude the bell-player, and his aims will not be achieved . Today, all under heaven are deluded . Though I pray for thei r guidance, how can it be had? Knowing that it cannot be had ye t forcing it upon them is but another delusion . Therefore, it woul d be best just to let them go and not push myself on them . If I d o not push, who among them will feel anxiety ? The leprous woman gives birth to her child in the middle o f the night . Quickly she snatches a torch and looks at it wit h dread, fearing only that the child may resemble herself . 1 5 A century-old tree is broken up and made into a sacrificial vesse l decorated with green and yellow, while the shavings are throw n into a ditch . If we compare the sacrificial vessel with the shaving s in the ditch, there may be a difference in their esthetic appeal, bu t they are alike in having lost their original nature . Though ther e may be a difference in the exercise of righteousness by the tyran t Chieh and Robber Footpad on the one hand, and Tseng She n and Shih Ch ' iu on the other, they are alike in having lost thei r original nature . Furthermore, there are five things that may lead to the los s of one's original nature . 11 7 First are the five colors which confuse the ey e And make it less keen . Second are the five sounds which confuse the ea r And make it less sharp . Third are the five odors which becloud the nos e And assail the sinuses . Fourth are the five flavors which dull the mout h And make it insensitive . Fifth are preferences and aversions which unsettle th e min d And make one's nature flighty . These five things are all injurious to life . Yet Yang Chu and M o Ti swagger about self-complacently, thinking they have hit o n the answer, but it ' s not what I would call the answer . When th e answer they have hit on constrains them, can it be the answer? I f so, then the dove or the owl in a cage may also be said to have hi t on the answer . Furthermore, preferences and aversions, sound s and colors are like so much firewood piled up within ; leathe r caps and hats with kingfisher feathers, and official tablets in- serted in long sashes restrain them from without .

Looking around from inside thei r ropes with a gleam in their eye, they think they have hit on th e answer .

He espouses conventional hierarchy, etiquette, and laws in a manne r that is quite alien to the Master Chuang of the Inner Chapters and many of th e Miscellaneous Chapters . With the appearance of Lao Tzu (the Old Master ) toward the end of the chapter, a more authentic voice is heard . 1 The Way of heaven revolves ceaselessly, so that the myriad thing s are brought to completion ; the Way of the emperors revolve s ceaselessly, so that all under heaven return to them ; the Way o f the sages revolves ceaselessly, so that all within the seas submit t o them . He who understands heaven, who is conversant with th e sages, and who comprehends the virtue of emperors and king s throughout the six directions of the universe and the fou r regions, acts spontaneously but is always obliviously still . Th e stillness of the sage is not because stillness is said to be good an d therefore he is still . It is because the myriad things are unable t o disturb his mind that he is still . When water is still, it clearly"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"1 2 0 reflects whiskers and brows . It is so accurate that the grea t craftsman takes his standard from it . If still water has suc h clarity, how much more so pure spirit! The stillness of the min d of the sage is the mirror of heaven and earth, the looking glass o f the myriad things . Emptiness, stillness, placidity, mildness, quietude, indif- ference, nonaction—these are the root of heaven and earth, th e substance of the Way and virtue . Therefore, emperors, kings , and sages rest in them . Resting, they are empty ; empty, they ar e full ; full, they are prepared . Empty, they are still ; still, they begi n to move ; moving, they attain . Still, they are nonactive ; nonactive , they entrust the responsibility for affairs to others . Nonactive , they are content ; content, anxiety, and trouble cannot discomfi t them ; so their longevity will be great . Emptiness, stillness, placidity, mildness, quietude, indif- ference, nonaction—these are the root of the myriad things . Un- derstanding this as the south-facing ruler, Yao was lord ; understanding this as the north-facing minister, Shun was hi s subject . Occupying a superior position with this understanding i s the virtue of emperors, kings, and the son of heaven ; occupying a n inferior position with this understanding is the Way of dark sage s and plain kings . Those who withdraw into retirement with thi s understanding and wander at leisure will win the admiration o f recluses from the rivers, lakes, mountains, and forests . Those wh o come forward into active life and succor the world with this under - standing will achieve great accomplishments and brilliant fame b y uniting all under heaven . Still, they are sages ; moving, they ar e kings . Nonactive, they are respected ; simple as an uncarved block , no one under heaven can contest with them for excellence . The clear understanding of the virtue of heaven and earth i s called the \" great root \" and \" the great ancestor :' It is that whereb y one is in harmony with heaven . Evenly adjusting all under heave n with it, one may be in harmony with men . Being in harmon y with men is called \" human joy .\" Being in harmony with heaven i s called \" heavenly joy .\" 12 1 Master Chuang said, \"My teacher, oh my teacher! He blend s the myriad things, but is not righteous ; his benefits reach to a myriad generations, but he is not humane . He is senior to hig h antiquity, but is not aged . He covers heaven, supports earth, an d carves out a host of forms, but is not skillful . This is what I mea n by heavenly joy . Therefore, it is said, ' He who knows heavenly jo y walks with heaven in life and evolves with things in death . I n stillness, he shares the same virtue as yin ; in movement, he share s the same current as yang .' Thus, he who knows heavenly joy wil l find no complaint from heaven, no censure from men, no en - cumbrance from things, and no reproach from ghosts . There - fore, it is said, `His movement is heaven ; his stillness is earth . Once his mind is fixed, heaven and earth are rectified . Hi s animus does not tire ; his anima does not weary . Once his mind i s fixed, the myriad things submit : In other words, extending hi s emptiness and stillness to heaven and earth, conversant with th e myriad things, this is called heavenly joy . Heavenly joy is th e mind of the sage whereby he rears all under heaven : ' 2 The virtue of emperors and kings is to take heaven and earth a s their ancestor, to take the Way and its virtue as their ruler, and t o take nonaction as their constant . Through nonaction, one ma y use all under heaven and still have a surplus . Through action, on e will be used by all under heaven but will be insufficient . There - fore, the ancients valued nonaction . When superiors and inferior s both subscribe to nonaction, this means that they share the sam e virtue . But when inferiors share the same virtue as superiors, thi s means that there are no subjects . When inferiors and superior s both subscribe to action, this means that they share the same way . But when superiors share the same way as inferiors, this mean s that there is no ruler . The superior must subscribe to nonactio n and use all under heaven ; inferiors must subscribe to action and b e used by all under heaven . This is the unchanging Way . Therefore,"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"1 2 2 those in antiquity who were kings of all under heaven, althoug h their knowledge embraced heaven and earth, did not themselve s formulate plans ; although their eloquence encompassed the myr- iad things, they did not themselves propound theories ; althoug h their ability reached to the ends of the seas, they did not them - selves act . Heaven produces not, yet the myriad things evolve ; earth grows not, but the myriad things are nurtured ; emperors an d kings act not, but all under heaven is accomplished . Therefore, i t is said, \"Nothing is more spiritual than heaven, nothing is riche r than earth, and nothing is greater than the emperors and kings . \" Thus, it is said, \" The virtue of kings and emperors is a match fo r heaven and earth .\" This is the way to mount on heaven and earth , to ride the myriad things, and use the masses of men . The root lies with superiors ; the particulars lie with infe- riors . The essentials lie with the ruler ; the details lie with th e subjects . The operations of the three armies with their fiv e categories of weapons are the particulars of virtue ; rewards an d penalties, profit and loss, the application of the five types o f punishment—these are the particulars of instruction . Ceremo- nies, laws, regulations, computations, usages, taboos, examina- tions, investigations—these are the particulars of government . The sounds of bells and drums, the appearance of plumes an d banners—these are the particulars of music . Weeping, crying , coarse garments, hempen headbands and armbands, the variou s gradations of funeral services—these are the particulars o f mourning . These five kinds of particulars require the operatio n of the essential spirit and the exercise of the arts of the min d before they can be put into effect . The men of old did study particulars, but did not give the m precedence . The lord precedes and his subjects follow ; the fathe r precedes and his sons follow ; the older brother precedes and hi s younger brothers follow ; the elder precedes and the youth s follow ; the man precedes and the woman follows ; the husban d precedes and the wife follows . The precedence of the honore d and the coming behind of the lowly are the course of heaven and 12 3 earth . Therefore, the sage adopts them as his symbols . Heaven i s more honored and earth more lowly—such are their positions a s gods . Spring and summer precede, autumn and winter com e after—such is the sequence of the four seasons . The myria d things evolve and develop ; even twisted little shoots have thei r own special shapes—such are the gradations of fullness an d decline, the flow of transformation and evolution . If even heaven and earth, which are of ultimate spirituality , have a sequence of more honored and more lowly, of that whic h precedes and that which comes behind, how much more so mus t the ways of men! In the ancestral temple, we venerate ou r relatives ; at court, we venerate the honored ; in the villages, w e venerate our seniors ; in the conduct of affairs, we venerate thos e who are worthy . This is the sequence of the great Way . If w e speak of the Way but negate its sequence, we negate the Wa y itself . How can he who speaks of the Way, yet negates the Way , adopt the Way ? For this reason, those in the past who clarified the great Wa y first clarified heaven, and the Way and its virtue were next . Having clarified the Way and its virtue, humaneness and righ- teousness were next . Having clarified humaneness and righteous- ness, the observance of duties was next . Having clarified th e observance of duties, forms and names were next . Having clari- fied forms and names, appointments according to qualificatio n were next . Having clarified appointments according to qualifica- tion, inquests and interrogations were next . Having clarifie d inquests and interrogations, right and wrong were next . Havin g clarified right and wrong, rewards and penalties were next . Hav- ing clarified rewards and penalties, folly and knowledge occupie d their rightful places, honor and meanness took their prope r positions . The humane and the worthy as well as the unworth y were employed in conformity with their attributes . It was neces- sary to distinguish their abilities and accord with their names . Thus did they serve their superiors and rear their inferiors , govern things and cultivate their persons . They made no use of"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"1 2 4 knowledge and schemes, turning only to heaven . This was calle d the great peace, the ultimate government . Therefore, the book says : \" There are forms and there ar e names .\" The ancients did have the concept of forms and names , but it is not what they put first . When the ancients discussed th e great Way, it was only after four steps that they mentioned form s and names, and only after eight steps that they spoke of reward s and penalties . If they had spoken of forms and names right fro m the start, it would have shown that they did not know what i s fundamental . If they had spoken of rewards and punishment s right from the start, it would have shown that they did not kno w what is primary . He whose words invert the Way or run counte r to it is to be governed by others . How could he govern others? T o speak of forms and names and of rewards and penalties righ t from the start shows only that one knows the tools of govern- ment, not the Way of government . Such a person can be used b y all under heaven, but is incapable of using all under heaven . He i s what may be called a sophist, a person of one narrow skill . Th e ancients did have ceremonies, laws, regulations, computations , and the detailed comparison of form and name, but these ar e what inferiors use to serve their superiors, not what superiors us e to rear inferiors . 3 Long ago, Shun inquired of Yao, saying, \"As king appointed b y heaven, how do you use your mind? \" \" I am not arrogant toward those who have no one to who m they appeal ; I do not abandon the poor people,\" said Yao . \" I grieve for those who die, commend young children, and sympa- thize with women . This is how I use my mind . \" \"This is fine, all right,\" said Shun, \"but it's not great . \" \"Well, then ;\" said Yao, \" what would you have me do? \" \" Heaven ascends, earth is calm ; the sun and moon shine, an d the four seasons proceed ;\" said Shun . \"Be regular as the alterna - 12 5 tion of day and night, beneficent as the clouds that marc h through the sky and dispense their rain . \" \" How majestic and grand! \" said Yao . \" You, sir, are a matc h for heaven ; I am but a match for man . \" Heaven and earth are what the ancients hold to be great, an d what the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun join in admiring . Therefore, what did the ancients who were kings of all unde r heaven do? They conformed to heaven and earth, and that is all . 4 Confucius went west to deposit some books in the royal librar y of the Chou dynasty . Tzulu [one of his disciples] counseled him , saying, \"I have heard that there was a librarian of the Cho u named Old Longears . He has given up his post and returned t o live in his own house . If you wish to deposit some books, sir, yo u might try going to see him for advice [on this important matte r of state] . \" \" Good idea,\" said Confucius . So he went to see Old Long - ears, but the latter did not accede to his request . Whereupo n Confucius launched into an exposition of the twelve classics t o convince him . Old Longears interrupted his . speech, saying, \" You ' re bein g too verbose . I just want to hear the gist of it . \" \"The gist lies in humaneness and righteousness,\" said Con- fucius . \" May I ask, \" said Old Longears, \"whether humaneness an d righteousness are human nature? \" \"Of course,\" said Confucius . \"If the superior man is no t humane, he will be incomplete . If he is not righteous, he will lac k vitality . Humaneness and righteousness are truly the nature o f man . What more need he concern himself with? \" \" May I ask,\" said Old Longears, \"what is the meaning o f humaneness and righteousness? \" \" To have a loyal heart and be without conflict, to show"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"12 6 universal love and be without partiality—these are the charac- teristics of humaneness and righteousness, \" said Confucius . \"Ai! \" said Old Longears, \" these last words of yours ar e dangerous!

If , sir, you wish to cause all under heaven not to lose that whic h shepherds them, then consider heaven and earth which assuredl y have constancy ; the sun and the moon which assuredly hav e brightness ; the stars and the constellations which assuredly ar e arrayed ; the birds and the beasts which assuredly group together ; the trees and bushes which assuredly stand tall . Merely liberat e your integrity as you walk along and comply with the Way as yo u hurry on, sir, and you will get where you're going . Why must yo u promote humaneness and righteousness so energetically a s though you were beating a drum in search of a lost son? Ai! sir , you are bringing confusion to the nature of man! \" 5 Fancypants Scholar went to see the Old Master and inquired o f him, saying, \"I have heard, sir, that you are a sage . By no mean s would I shirk the long journey, so I have come here wishing t o see you . Though I developed thick calluses during the hundre d stages of my trip, I dared not rest . Now that I have observed you , I find you're not a sage . There is leftover grain beside the ra t holes, but he who throws things away carelessly is inhumane . Raw and cooked food that you haven ' t consumed piles up i n front of you limitlessly . \" Indifferent, the Old Master did not reply . Fancypants Scholar went back to see him again the next da y and said, \"Yesterday I criticized you, but today I'm feeling reall y disheartened . Why is this? \" \"I believe,\" said the Old Master, \" that I have freed myself o f wanting to be a person of clever knowledge and spiritual sagacity . Yesterday, if you had called me an ox, I would have agreed with 12 7 you and, if you had called me a horse, I would have agreed wit h you too . If there is a fact and someone gives it a name that I refuse to accept, I'll be in double jeopardy . I acceded because I always accede, not for the sake of acceding itself ' Fancypants Scholar waddled backward out of the Old Mas- ter's shadow, then gingerly stepped forward and asked him , \"How should I cultivate my person? \" The Old Master said, \"Your appearance is haughty ; you r look is aggressive ; your forehead is protruding ; your mouth i s snarly ; your demeanor is self-righteous . You are like a hors e restrained by its tether . You wish to move but are held back . Yo u are set to release like the trigger of a crossbow . You are inquisi- torial and judgmental . Your knowledge is cunning and your gaz e is overbearing . All of this invites mistrust . If such a person wer e to be found on the borders, he would be labeled a brigand : ' 6 The master said, \"The Way does not exhaust itself in what i s great, nor does it absent itself from what is small . Therefore, th e myriad things are realized in it . The Way is so broad that there i s nothing it fails to accommodate, so deep that it is unfathomable . Form, virtue, humaneness, and righteousness are trifles of th e spirit, but were it not for the ultimate man, who could determin e them? The ultimate man holds the world—is this not a grea t responsibility? But it is not enough to burden him . All unde r heaven vie for the reins of power, but he does not accompan y them . He examines flawlessness, but is unmoved by profit . H e plumbs the truth of things and can guard what is fundamental . Therefore, he puts heaven and earth beyond him, leaves th e myriad things behind, and so his spirit is never encumbered . H e is conversant with the Way, joins with virtue, keeps humanenes s and righteousness at a distance, and treats ceremonies and musi c as guests . Something there is that steadies the mind of th e ultimate man . \""},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"1 2 8 7 Writing is that means by which the world values the Way, bu t writing is no more than words and words, too, have value .

Although the world values writing, I, for my part, d o not think it worthy of being valued, because what is valued is no t what is really valuable .

It temporaril y returns to par with the other heaven chapters by having a pseudo Master Chuan g discourse clumsily upon the relative merits of humaneness and filialness . Th e remainder of the chapter, however, includes the magnificent description of th e Yellow Emperor's transcendental ritual music and a group of interestin g colloquies between Confucius and Lao Tzu . 1 \"Does heaven revolve ? Does earth stand still ? Do the sun and moon jockey for position ? Who controls all of this ? Who unfolds all of this ? Who ties it all together ? Who dwells in inactivity , Yet impels things on their course? May it be that there are levers and thread s That drive them inexorably ? Or may it be that they just keep turnin g And are unable to stop by themselves ? Do the clouds make the rain ? Or does the rain make the clouds ? Who bestows them so generously ? Who dwells in inactivity , Yet urges things on to all this lusty joy ? The winds arise in the nort h And, first to the east, then to the west , They drift back and forth above us . Who breathes them ? Who dwells in inactivity , Yet does this fanning ? I venture to ask the reasons for all this . \" \"Come, and I shall tell you ;\" said the Magus Hsien whil e beckoning . \"Heaven has six poles and five constants . If emperor s and kings conform to them, there will be good government, bu t if they go against them, there will be evil consequences . Tendin g to the affairs of the nine regions, government will be complet e and virtue realized . Overseeing and illuminating the earth below , they will be supported by all under heaven . Thus they are calle d the August on High . \" 2 Tang, the Grand Steward of Shang, asked Master Chuang abou t humaneness . \"Tigers and wolves are humane, \" said Master Chuang . \"What do you mean?\""},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"1 3 2 \" Fathers and cubs are partial to each other, \" said Maste r Chuang . \"How can we consider them inhumane? \" \" May I ask about ultimate humaneness? \" \"Ultimate humaneness is impartial, \" said Master Chuang . \"I have heard, \" said the Grand Steward, \" that to be impartia l is to be without love and that to be without love is to be unfilial . May we say that ultimate humaneness implies unfilialness? \" \" Not so ;\" said Master Chuang . \"Ultimate humaneness i s exalted, so of course filialness is inadequate to describe it . This i s not to say that humaneness surpasses filialness, rather that it doe s not affect filialness . If someone journeys south until reachin g Ying and then faces north, he won't be able to see Dark Mountain . Why is this? It's because he ' s so far away from it . Therefore, it i s said, to be filial out of respect is easy, but to be filial out of love i s difficult . To be filial out of love is easy, but to forget one ' s parent s is difficult . To forget one's parents is easy, but to cause one' s parents to forget themselves is difficult . To cause one's parents t o forget themselves is easy, but to forget all under heaven is difficult . To forget all under heaven is easy, but to cause all under heaven t o forget themselves is difficult . Virtue that leaves behind Yao an d Shun and does not act will bestow benefit and nurture to a myria d generations, without all under heaven knowing . How can on e merely heave a deep sigh and talk about humaneness and filial- ness? Filialness, brotherliness, humaneness, righteousness, loyalty , trustworthiness, honor, and incorruptibility—these all enslav e virtue through self-constraint, but they are not worth putting a premium on .

Now, your master has likewise gathered up the straw dog s displayed by previous kings and keeps them next to his side whil e he wanders abroad, stays at home, and sleeps with his assembled 13 7 disciples . Consequently, they had a tree they were resting unde r chopped down in the state of Sung and their traces obliterated i n Wey, and they were impoverished in the capitals of the old Shan g duchy and the Chou kingdom . Weren't these his bad dreams ? When they were in the area of Ch ' en and Ts ' ai, Confucius an d his disciples were besieged and went without cooked food fo r seven days, till they were on the verge of death . Wasn't this hi s nightmare ? \" For traveling on water, nothing is better than a boat, an d for traveling on land, nothing is better than a cart . A boat ca n travel on water, but if on that account you try to push it alon g the land, you wouldn ' t travel more than a few yards in a whol e generation . Aren't antiquity and the present like water and land ? Aren ' t the Chou dynasty and the state of Lu like the boat and th e cart? Now, if one were to aspire to practice the ancient ways o f Chou in Lu, this would be like pushing a boat on land ; it woul d be all toil and no accomplishment . The person who tried i t would certainly meet with misfortune . He has yet to learn th e random rotation that responds to things inexhaustibly . \" Haven ' t you seen a wellsweep? When you pull on it, it goe s down, and when you let go of it, it comes up . Because it is pulle d by men and does not pull men around, it can go up and dow n without committing an offense against men . Therefore, th e decorum and regulations of the three august sovereigns and fiv e emperors were not prized because they preserved the status quo , but because they could bring good government . Thus we ma y compare the decorum and regulations of the three august sover- eigns and five emperors to the hawthorn, the pear, the orange , and the pomelo . Although their flavors are quite different, the y all taste good . \" Therefore, decorum and regulations should change wit h the times . Now, you may take a monkey and dress him up in th e robes of the Duke of Chou, but he ' s certain to bite them and tea r them, and he won't be satisfied until he ' s completely rid of them .

Likewise , when the beauteous Hsi Shih had heart pain, she would frown a t her neighbors . An ugly woman of her village, seeing Hsi Shih d o this, thought it made her look beautiful . So she went home and , pressing her hands over her heart, frowned at her neighbors . When the rich people of the village saw her, they would clos e their doors tightly and not go out . When the poor people sa w her, they would grab their wives and children and run away . Sh e knew that Hsi Shih ' s frowning was beautiful, but didn't know th e reason why her frowning was beautiful . It ' s a pity! Your master ' s end is imminent! \" 5 When Confucius was in his fifty-first year, he still had not hear d the Way . He went south to P'ei to see Old Longears . \" Have you come, sir ? \" asked Old Longears . \"I have heard, sir , that you are a worthy from the north . Have you also attained th e Way? \" \"I haven't attained it yet :' said Confucius . \"How have you sought it?\" asked the Old Master . \"I have sought for it in regulations and computations, bu t after five years I still haven't attained it? ' \"Then how did you seek it?\" asked the Old Master . \"I sought for it in yin and yang, but after twelve years I stil l haven't attained it : ' \"So! \" said the Old Master . \"If the Way could be presented , then everyone would present it to his lord . If the Way could b e offered, then everyone would offer it to his parents . If the Wa y could be told, then everyone would tell it to his brothers . If th e Way could be given, then everyone would give it to his descen- dants . However, the reason why one cannot do these things i s that if there is no host for it within, it will not stay, and if there i s no sign of it without, it will not proceed . If that which goes forth 13 9 from within is not received without, the sage will not let it g o forth . If that which enters from without has no host to receive i t within, the sage will not deposit it there . Fame is a publi c instrument upon which one may not draw too often . Humane- ness and righteousness are the inns of the former kings in whic h one should not dwell for long, but stay only one night . . . . \"The ultimate men of the past borrowed a way throug h humaneness and lodged temporarily in righteousness, so tha t they could wander carefreely in emptiness, eat in the fields o f plainness, stand in the garden of unindebtedness . Carefreenes s implies nonaction, plainness implies easy nourishment, unin- debtedness implies nonexpenditure . The ancients called thi s ' wandering about to pluck the truth : \" He who considers wealth to be right will not part with hi s earnings . He who considers prominence to be right will not par t with his fame . He who is partial to power will not share it s handle with others . Grasping them, he trembles ; letting go o f them, he grieves . Yet he has not the slightest introspection t o perceive that which he ceaselessly pursues . He is one of heaven' s condemned . \"Resentment and kindness, taking and giving, admonitio n and instruction, sparing and killing—these eight are the instru- ments of rectification, but only she who complies with the grea t transformation without impediment can make use of them . Thus it is said, 'Rectitude is rectification : The gate of heaven wil l not open for she whose mind does not believe this to be so . \" 6 When Confucius met Old Longears, he told him about humane- ness and righteousness . \"In winnowing, \" said Old Longears, \"the chaff can get i n your eyes and blind you so that heaven, earth, and the fou r directions will all change their places . If mosquitoes and"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"1 4 0 snipeflies pierce your skin, you won't be able to sleep the whol e night long . But there is no greater confusion than that caused b y humaneness and righteousness which maliciously muddle one ' s mind . If, sir, you were to cause all under heaven not to lose th e simplicity of the unhewn log, you too could move with th e abandon of the wind and stand forth in the wholeness o f integrity . Instead, why must you overexert yourself as though yo u were carrying a bass drum and looking for a lost son? The swa n does not bathe every day, yet it is white ; the crow does no t smudge itself every day, yet it is black . The natural simplicity o f black and white is not worth disputing over ; the spectacle o f fame and praise is not worth bragging about . \" Confucius did not speak for three days after returning fro m this meeting with Old Longears . \"When you met Old Longears , oh master ;\" asked his disciples, \"how did you admonish him, a s you surely must have? \" \" Now, in him I have finally seen a dragon! \" said Confucius . \" Coiled up, his body is complete ; extended, his scaly patterns ar e whole . He rides on the cloudy vapors and is nourished by yi n and yang . My mouth fell open and I couldn't close it ; my tongu e arched upward so I couldn ' t even utter a halting word . Ho w could I have admonished Old Longears? \" \"So,\" asked Tzukung, \"then can this man really remain stil l as a corpse with a dragonish presence, silent in the depths with a thunderous voice, setting forth in movement like heaven an d earth? May I also have the opportunity to observe him?\" Where - upon he went to see Old Longears with an introduction fro m Confucius . Old Longears was just on the verge of squatting reposefull y in his hall when he received Tzukung . \" I ' m getting on in years, \" he said softly . \"What are you going to caution me about? \" \"The government of all under heaven by the three augus t sovereigns and the five emperors was dissimilar,\" said Tzukung , \"but the fame that accrued to them was the same . How is it tha t you alone consider them not to have been sages?\" 14 1 \" Come forward a little, young man ;\" said Old Longears . \" Why do you say that their government was dissimilar? \" \" Yao passed the throne to Shun, and Shun passed it to Yii, \" was the answer . \" Yii relied on his strength and T'ang on hi s troops . King Wen went along with the tyrant Chow and dare d not go against him . King Wu went against Chow and dared no t go along with him . That's why I said they were dissimilar . \" \" Come forward a little bit more, young man,\" said Ol d Longears . \"I will tell you about the government of all unde r heaven by the three august sovereigns and the five emperors . When the Yellow Emperor governed all under heaven, he mad e the people of one mind . If someone's parent died and he did no t weep, no one would blame him . When Yao governed all unde r heaven, he made the minds of the people biased . If someon e disregarded the norm in the mourning garments he wore for hi s own parent, no one would blame him . When Shun governed al l under heaven, he made the minds of the people competitive . Pregnant women still gave birth after ten months, but thei r children could talk five months after they were born, and the y began to recognize people before they were toddlers . Conse- quently, people began to die prematurely . When Yii governed al l under heaven, he made the minds of the people deviant . Me n began to scheme and routinely resorted to force of arms . Claim- ing that they were killing robbers, not people, they considere d themselves a breed apart, as did all under heaven . Hence, al l under heaven were in a great panic, and the Confucians and th e Mohists arose . It was because of their doing that there first cam e to be morality, but what can you say of the way things have ende d up now ? \"I tell you, we may speak of the three august sovereign s ` governing' all under heaven, but it is governing in name only, fo r there is no greater disorder than that which they caused . Th e knowledge of the three august sovereigns rebelled against th e brightness of the sun and moon, conflicted with the essence o f the mountains and rivers below, and disrupted the procession of"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"1 4 2 the four seasons in between . Their knowledge was more fata l than the sting of a scorpion or the bite of a pit viper . Insecure i n the reality of their nature and destiny, they still considere d themselves sages . Is this not shameful? \" Tzukung stood there disconcerted and ill at ease . 7 Confucius said to Old Longears, \" I have been studying the si x classics—the Odes, Documents, Ritual, Music, Changes, and Spring an d Autumn Annals—for what I myself would consider a long tim e and I know their contents thoroughly . I have discussed the way s of the former kings with seventy-two villainous rulers and hav e explained the achievements of dukes Chou and Shao, but not a single ruler has employed me . How very difficult it is to convinc e men and to explain the Way! \" \" It ' s fortunate, sir, that you didn't encounter a ruler wh o could govern the world! \" said the Old Master . \"The six classic s are the stale traces of the former kings, but they do not tell wha t created the traces! Now, sir, what you talk about are traces . Traces, however, are produced by shoes ; they ' re not the shoe s themselves ! `A pair of white egrets look at each other with motionles s pupils and fertilization takes place . A male insect chirps from a n air current above, a female answers from below, and fertilizatio n takes place . The hermaphrodite is both male and female, henc e fertilization takes place by itself . One ' s nature cannot b e changed ; destiny cannot be altered ; time cannot be stopped ; th e Way cannot be blocked . If one attains the Way, there's nothin g one cannot achieve . If one loses the Way, ther e ' s nothing one ca n achieve . Confucius did not go outside for three months after thi s until he went to see Old Longears again and said, \" I ' ve finally go t it! Birds brood, fish milt, the solitary wasp transmutes, and when 14 3 a new baby boy is born the older brother cries because he can n o longer share the teat . I have long been a man who has not share d in evolution .

Here we see the outlines of an indigenou s Taoist ethos of simplicity quite apart from any Yogic praxis . 1 Having ingrained opinions and a high estimate of one ' s ow n conduct, leaving the world behind and being different fro m common society, engaging in lofty discussions and resentfull y slandering others—all this is merely indicative of arrogance . Bu t it is favored by the scholars of mountain and valley, men wh o censure the world and throw themselves with withered visag e into the watery depths . Discoursing on humaneness, righteous- ness, loyalty, and trustworthiness, being reverent, frugal , deferential, and yielding—all this is merely indicative of self - cultivation . But it is favored by the scholars who wish to brin g peace to the world, men who teach and instruct, who pursu e learning at home and abroad . Discoursing on great merit an d establishing great fame, observing the ceremonies for lord an d subject, and rectifying those on high and those below—all this is merely indicative of governing . But it is favored by the scholar s of court, men who honor their ruler and strengthen his state , who devote themselves to incorporating other states . Retiring t o bogs and marshes, dwelling in the vacant wilderness, fishing an d living leisurely—all this is merely indicative of nonaction . But i t is favored by the scholars of rivers and lakes, men who flee fro m the world and wish to be idle . Blowing and breathing, exhalin g and inhaling, expelling the old and taking in the new, bear stride s and bird stretches—all this is merely indicative of the desire fo r longevity . But it is favored by scholars who channel the vita l breath and flex the muscles and joints, men who nourish th e physical form so as to emulate the hoary age of Progenitor P'eng . If someone could be lofty without having ingrained opin- ions, cultivate himself without humaneness and righteousness , govern without merit or fame, be idle without rivers or lakes, an d live long without channeling and flexions, he would forget every - thing, yet he would possess everything . His tranquillity would b e unlimited, yet a multitude of excellences would follow in hi s wake . This is the Way of heaven and earth, the integrity of th e sage . Therefore, it is said, \"placidity, mildness, quietude, indif- ference, emptiness, nonbeing, and nonaction—these are the roo t of heaven and earth, the substance of the Way and virtue .\" Thu s the sage rests in them . Resting, he is peaceful and easeful ; peaceful and easeful, he is placid and mild . Hence worries an d troubles do not assail him, pernicious influences do not assaul t him . Consequently, his integrity is intact and his spirit is un- diminished . Therefore, it is said, the sage \"walks with heaven in life an d evolves with things in death . In stillness, he shares the sam e integrity as yin ; in movement, he shares the same current a s yang .\" He is not the founder of fortune, nor is he the initiator o f misfortune . He responds when affected, moves when pressed , and arises only when he has no other choice . He rids himself o f knowledge and precedent, conforming to the principle of"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"1 4 6 heaven . Thus, there will be \"no calamity from heaven, no en - cumbrance from things, no censure from men, and no reproac h from ghosts . \" His life is like floating ; his death is like resting . H e does not have anxious thoughts ; he does not make plans before - hand . He is \"bright but not dazzling, \" trustworthy but no t expectant . He \"does not dream when he is asleep, does not worr y when he is awake . \" His spirit is unadulterated ; \" his soul does no t weary .\" His emptiness, nonbeing, placidity, and mildness are a match for the integrity of heaven . Therefore, it is said, sorrow and joy are perversions o f integrity ; happiness and anger are transgressions of the Way ; likes and dislikes are failings of the mind . Thus, when the min d is free from anxiety and joy, that is the ultimate of integrity . When it is unified and unchanging, that is the ultimate o f stillness . When there is nothing that irritates it, that is th e ultimate of emptiness . When it has no dealings with othe r things, that is the ultimate of mildness . When there is nothin g that runs counter to it, that is the ultimate of purity . Therefore, it is said, when the physical form is toiled with - out rest it will become fatigued ; when the spiritual essence i s used without end it will be exhausted . . . .

This is a symbol for the integrity of heaven . Hence, i t is said, to be pure and unadulterated, to be still and unchanging , to be mild and nonactive, to walk with heaven when on e moves—this is the Way to nourish the spirit . Now, he who own s a fine sword from the southeast stores it in a scabbard, not darin g to use it lightly—this is the pinnacle of preciousness . But th e spiritual essence flows forth in all directions, never reaching a limit . It borders heaven above, encircles the earth below, trans - forming and nurturing the myriad things . It cannot be symbol- ized, but its name is \" With Deus . \" The Way of purity and plainness lies only in guarding th e spirit . Guard and do not lose it, becoming one with the spirit . \t 14 7 The essence of oneness will pervade and join with the order o f heaven . There is a proverb that says, \" The masses of me n emphasize profit ; the incorruptible scholars emphasize fame ; wise men esteem will ; the sage values essence . \" Hence plainnes s may be defined as what is unalloyed, and purity as keeping th e spirit undiminished . One who can embody purity and plainnes s may be called a \"true man . \""},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"1 4 9 The author continues with his espousal of pureness and placidity as the bes t means for restoring one ' s original nature . A person ' s primary purpose should b e the preservation of self by keeping things joyfully plain . Do not, says the author , strive to accumulate knowledge and do not engage in philosophical arguments — which is precisely what most of the Warring States thinkers did . 1 Those who would mend their nature through vulgar learning , seeking to restore its original condition, and those who woul d polish their desires through vulgar thinking, seeking to perfec t their intelligence, may be called deluded persons . The ancients who practiced the Way nourished knowledg e with placidity . Understanding life, they did not use their knowl - edge to engage in action . This may be called nourishing placidit y with knowledge . When knowledge and placidity nourish eac h other, then harmony and principle emerge from one ' s nature . Now, virtue is harmony and the Way is principle . Whe n there is nothing virtue does not accommodate, that is humane - ness ; when there is nothing the Way does not arrange, that is righteousness ; when righteousness is manifest and things fee l affection, that is loyalty . When the center is genuine and that i s reflected in the emotions, there is music ; when trustworth y conduct is accommodating and conforms to an elegant pattern , there is ceremony . But if ceremony and music are deviantl y performed, all under heaven will be in disorder . Correcting others yet concealing one's own virtue results i n virtue remaining unexposed .

The remainder is occupied by half a dozen other short parables and allegories illuminating the essential spirit o f Master Chuang . 1 When the time of the autumn floods arrived, the hundre d tributaries poured into the Yellow River . Its onrushing curren t was so huge that one could not discern an ox or a horse on th e opposite side or on the banks of its islets . Thereupon the Earl o f the River delightedly congratulated himself at having complet e and sole possession of all excellences under heaven . Followin g along with the current, he went east until he reached the North - ern Sea . There he looked eastward but could not see the water ' s end, whereupon he crestfallenly gazed across the surface of th e sea and said with a sigh to its overlord, \" There is a proverb tha t says, `He who has heard the Way a hundred times believes no on e may be compared with himself! ' This applies to me . Further - more, when I first heard those who belittle the learning o f Confucius and disparage the righteousness of Poyi, I did no t believe them . But now that I behold your boundlessness, I realiz e that, had I not come to your gate, I would have been in danger , and would have been ridiculed forever by the practitioners of th e great method : ' The Overlord of the Northern Sea said, \" You can ' t tell a frog at the bottom of a well about the sea because he's stuck i n his little space . You ca n ' t tell a summer insect about ice because i t is confined by its season . You can't tell a scholar of distorte d views about the Way because he is bound by his doctrine . No w you have ventured forth from your banks to observe the great se a and have recognized your own insignificance, so that you can b e told of the great principle . \" Of all the waters under heaven, none is greater than the sea . The myriad rivers return to it ceaselessly but it never fills up ; th e drain at its bottom endlessly discharges but it never empties . Spring and autumn it never varies, and it knows nothing of floo d and drought . Its superiority to such streams as the Yangtze an d the Yellow rivers cannot be measured in numbers . Yet the reaso n I have never made much of myself on this account is because I compare my own form to that of heaven and earth and recall tha t I received my vital breath from yin and yang . Amid heaven an d earth, I am as a little pebble or tiny tree on a big mountain . Sinc e I perceive of myself as small, how then can I make much o f myself?

The succession of the five emperors, th e contention of the three kings, the worries of humane men, th e labors of the committed scholars, all amount to no more tha n this . Poyi dedined it for the sake of fame . Confucius lectured o n it for the sake of his erudition . This is because they made muc h of themselves . Is this not like you just now making much o f yourself because of your flooding waters? \" \" This being so, \" asked the Earl of the River, \"may I tak e heaven and earth as the standard for what is large and the tip of a downy hair as the standard for what is small? \" \" No, \" said the Overlord of the Northern Sea . \"Things ar e limitless in their capacities, incessant in their occurrences, incon- stant in their portions, uncertain in their beginning and ending . For this reason, great knowledge observes things at a relativ e distance, hence it does not belittle what is small nor make muc h of what is big, knowing that their capacities are limitless . I t witnesses clearly the past and the present, hence it is not frus- trated by what is far off nor attracted by what is close at hand , knowing that their occurrences are incessant . It examines fullnes s and emptiness, hence it is not pleased when it obtains no r worried when it loses, knowing that their portions are incon- stant . It understands the level path, hence it is not enraptured b y life nor perturbed by death, knowing that beginnings and end- ings are uncertain . We may reckon that what man knows is les s than what he doesn't know ; the time when he is alive is less tha n the time when he isn't alive . When he seeks to delimit th e boundaries of the extremely large with what is extremely small , he becomes disoriented and can't get hold of himself . Viewe d from this vantage, how do we know that the tip of a downy hai r is adequate to determine the parameters of the extremely small ? And how do we know that heaven and earth are adequate t o delimit the boundaries of the extremely large? \" \" The deliberators of the world, \" said the Earl of the Yello w River, \"all say, `That which is extremely minute has no form ; tha t which is extremely large cannot be encompassed : Is this true?\" 15 5 \"If we look at what is large from the viewpoint of what i s minuscule, \" said the Overlord of the Northern Sea, \" we won't se e the whole . If we look at what is minuscule from the viewpoint o f what is large, we won ' t see the details . Now, that which is minut e is the smallest of the small ; that which is enormous is the larges t of the large . Hence, their differences are suitable and in accor d with their circumstances . Yet, the minute and the coarse are bot h dependent upon their having a form . That which has no form i s numerically indivisible ; that which cannot be encompassed i s numerically undelimitable . That which can be discussed i n words is the coarseness of things ; that which can be conceived o f in thought is the minuteness of things . That which can neithe r be discussed in words nor conceived of in thought is indepen- dent of minuteness and coarseness . . . : \" \" How, then,\" asked the Earl of the Yellow River, \" are we t o demarcate the value and magnitude of a thing, whether it b e intrinsic or extrinsic? \" The Overlord of the Northern Sea said, \"Observed in th e light of the Way, things are neither prized nor despised ; observe d in the light of things, they prize themselves and despise others ; observed in the light of the common lot, one ' s value is no t determined by oneself . Observed in the light of gradations, if w e consider to be large what is larger than something else, then th e myriad things are without exception large ; if we consider to b e small what is smaller than something else, then all the myria d things are without exception small . If we regard heaven and eart h as a mustard seed and the tip of a downy hair as a mountain, w e can perceive the numerousness of their relative gradations .

I f we recognize that east and west, though opposites, cannot b e without each other, their shared merit will be fixed . Observed i n the light of inclination, if we approve whatever they approve , then the myriad things without exception maybe approved ; if we"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"1 5 6 condemn whatever they condemn, then the myriad things with - out exception may be condemned . If we recognize that Yao an d Chieh approved of themselves but condemned each other, we ca n perceive their controlling inclinations . \"Long ago, Yao yielded his throne to Shun and the latte r became emperor, but when K ' uai yielded his throne to Tzu Chih , they were both cut down . T'ang and Wu became kings throug h contention, but the Duke of Po contended and was destroyed . Viewed in this light, the etiquette of contending and yielding , the conduct of Yao and Chieh, may be either prized or despise d in accord with the times, but may not be taken as constants . A beam or a ridge-pole may be used to breach a city wall, but i t cannot be used to plug a hole, which is to say that implement s have specific purposes . A Ch ' ichi or a Hualiu may gallop a thousand tricents in a day, but for catching rats they ' re not a s good as a wild cat or a weasel, which is to say that creatures hav e different skills . An owl can catch fleas at night and can discer n the tip of a downy hair, but when it comes out during the day i t stares blankly and can ' t even see a hill or mountain, which is t o say that beings have different natures . Therefore, when it is said , `Make right your teacher, not wrong ; make good governmen t your teacher, not disorder ; this is to misunderstand the principl e of heaven and earth and the attributes of the myriad things . I t would be like making heaven your teacher and ignoring earth , like making yin your teacher and ignoring yang . The un- workability of this is clear . Still, if one goes on talking like thi s and does not give it up, one is either being stupid or deceptive .

Embosom all the myriad things , Taking each one under your protective wings . This may be referred to as universality .

The years cannot be advanced , Nor can time be stayed . Dissolution and generation, fullness and emptiness — Whatever ends has a beginning . Thus may w e Speak of the secret of the great purport , Discuss the principle of the myriad things . The life of thing s Is like the cantering and galloping of a horse — They are transformed with each movement , They change with each moment . What are you to do ? What are you not to do ? Just let things evolve by themselves : ' \" Then what is to be prized about the Way?\" asked the Earl of th e Yellow River . The Overlord of the Northern Sea said, \" She who knows th e Way must apprehend principle ; she who apprehends principl e must be clear about contingency ; she who is clear about contin- gency will not harm herself with things . She who has ultimat e integrity will neither be burned by fire nor drowned in water, wil l neither be harmed by cold and heat nor injured by bird and beast . This does not mean that she belittles these things, but rather tha t she examines where she will be safe or in danger . She is tranquil i n misfortune or in fortune ; she is careful about her comings an d goings, so that nothing can harm her . Therefore it is said, ` Th e heavenly is within, the human is without ; integrity lies in heaven : When you know the operation of the heavenly and the human , you will root yourself in heaven and position yourself in content - 15 9 ment .

Tzulu went over to see him and said, \" Ho w can you be so cheerful, master? \" \" Come! \" said Confucius, \" I shall tell you . Long have I shunned adversity, but have not been able to avoid it : that ' s m y destiny . Long have I sought success, but have not been able t o achieve it ; that's the times . In the age of Yao and Shun, there wa s no one under heaven who met with adversity, but their achieve- ments were not due to their knowledge . In the age of Chieh an d Chow, there was no one under heaven who met with success, bu t their failures were not due to their lack of knowledge . It wa s because of the times and the circumstances they encountered . \"To travel on water yet not flee from crocodiles and dragon s is the courage of the fisherman ; to travel on land yet not fle e from rhinoceroses and tigers is the courage of the hunter ; to hav e naked blades cross before him yet view death as calmly as life i s the courage of the ardent warrior ; to know that adversity is du e to destiny and that success is due to the times yet face grea t difficulty without fear is the courage of the sage . Just sit tight , Tzulu . I am under the control of my destiny . \" Shortly afterward, the leader of the armed men came over and apologized, saying, \" We thought you were Tiger Yang an d so we surrounded you . Now that we know you're not, pleas e accept our apologies and we shall retreat : ' 4 Kungsun Lung inquired of Prince Mou of Wei, saying, \" When I was young I studied the Way of the former kings, and when I grew up I understood the conduct of humaneness and righteous- ness . I joined sameness and difference, separated hardness fro m whiteness, asserted the unassertable, and affirmed the unaffirm- able . I perplexed the thinkers of the hundred schools and refute d the disputers of the manifold persuasions . I considered myself t o be ultimately accomplished . But now I have heard the words o f Master Chuang and am bewildered by their oddity . I don't kno w whether it's because my powers of discussion are not up to his o r because my knowledge is less than his . Now I feel that I can't eve n make a peep . I venture to ask what strategy I should adopt . \" Prince Mou leaned against his table and heaved a great sigh . Then he looked up to heaven and, smiling, said, \"Haven't yo u heard about the frog in the broken-down well? ' I really enjo y myself here!' it said to a turtle of the Eastern Sea . 'If I want to g o out, I jump along the railing around the well, then I come bac k and rest where the brick lining is missing from the wall . I ente r the water till it comes up to my armpits and supports my chin . When I slop through the mud, it covers my feet and buries m y toes . Turning around, I see crayfish and tadpoles, but none o f them is a match for me . Furthermore, I have sole possession o f all the water in this hole and straddle all the joy in this broken - down well . This is the ultimate! Why don't you drop in som e time, sir, and see for yourself? ' \" But before the turtle of the Eastern Sea could get his lef t foot in, his right knee had already gotten stuck . After extricatin g himself, he withdrew a little and told the frog about the sea , saying, 'A distance of a thousand tricents is insufficient to span"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"1 6 3 its breadth ; a height of a thousand fathoms is insufficient t o plumb its depth . During Yŭ ' s time, there were floods nine year s out of ten, but the water in it did not appreciably increase ; durin g T'ang's time, there were droughts seven years out of eight, but th e extent of its shores did not appreciably decrease . Hence, not t o shift or change with time, not to advance or recede regardless o f amount—this is the great joy of the Eastern Sea .' Upon hearin g this, the frog in the broken-down well was so utterly startled tha t it lost itself in bewilderment . \"Furthermore, when you, whose knowledge is inadequate t o understand the limits of ' right ' and ` wrong, ' still wish to se e through the words of Master Chuang, it ' s like making a mos- quito carry a mountain on its back or an inchworm race agains t the Yellow River—they won ' t be up to the task . Still further , aren't you, whose knowledge is inadequate to understand th e words for discussing the uttermost mysteries and who satisf y yourself with a moment's profit, like the frog in the broken-dow n well? \" Master Chuang, however, marches through the Yello w Springs one moment and ascends to the empyrean the next . With him, there is neither north nor south , But only untrammeled release in all four direction s And absorption in the unfathomable ; There is neither east nor west , Beginning as he does in darkest obscurit y And returning to grand perceptivity . But you, sir, bewilderedly seek something with which to qui z him and grope for a means to dispute him . This is simpl y like peering at heaven through a tube or pointing at the eart h with an awl—they ' re too small for the purpose . Begone, sir !

The king of Ch' u dispatched two high-ranking officials to go before him with thi s message : \" I wish to encumber you with the administration of m y realm . \" Without turning around, Master Chuang just kept holdin g on to his fishing rod and said, \"I have heard that in Ch'u there i s a sacred tortoise that has already been dead for three thousan d years . The king stores it in his ancestral temple inside of a hamper wrapped with doth . Do you think this tortoise woul d rather be dead and have its bones preserved as objects of venera- tion, or be alive and dragging its tail through the mud? \" \" It would rather be alive and dragging its tail through th e mud, \" said the two officials . \"Begone! \" said Master Chuang . \" I ' d rather be dragging m y tail in the mud . \" 6 When Master Hui was serving as the prime minister of Liang , Master Chuang set off to visit him . Somebody said to Maste r Hui, \" Master Chuang is coming and he wants to replace you a s prime minister : ' Whereupon Master Hui became afraid and ha d the kingdom searched for three days and three nights . After Master Chuang arrived, he went to see Master Hu i and said, \"In the south there is a bird . Its name is Yello w Phoenix . Have you ever heard of it? It takes off from th e Southern Sea and flies to the Northern Sea . It won't stop on any 16 5 other tree but the kolanut ; won ' t eat anything but bamboo seeds ; won ' t drink anything but sweet spring water . There was once a n owl that, having got hold of a putrid rat, looked up at the Yello w Phoenix as it was passing by and shouted `shoo!' Now, sir, do yo u wish to shoo me away from your kingdom of Liang? \" 7 Master Chuang and Master Hui were strolling across the bridg e over the Hao River . \" The minnows have come out and ar e swimming so leisurely,\" said Master Chuang . \" This is the joy o f fishes . \" You ' re not a fish, \" said Master Hui . \" How do you kno w what the joy of fishes is? \" \" You ' re not me,\" said Master Chuang, \" so how do you kno w that I don ' t know what the joy of fishes is? \" \"I'm not you ;\" said Master Hui, \"so I certainly do not kno w what you do .

Perhaps the most touching tale in the book is related here : Maste r Chuang's acceptance of his wife's death as a natural transformation . A succession of weird encounters pursues the same thread—the advisability o f accepting change as a natural process . 1 their mouths, no beautiful clothes for their bodies, no prett y sights for their eyes, and no agreeable sounds for their ears . I f they do not get these things, they become greatly troubled an d frightened . Is it not foolish how this is all for the body ? The wealthy embitter themselves through frantic work . They accumulate more property than they can possibly use . Although they do this for the body, they actually alienate it . Th e honored worry day and night over whether they are being good . Although they do this for the body, they actually estrange it . Th e birth of men is also the birth of their anxieties . The greater thei r longevity the more addled they become and the longer they ar e anxious about not dying, a bitter fate indeed! Although they d o this for the body, they actually distance it . The ardent warrior i s viewed by all under heaven as good, but that is insufficient t o keep his person alive . I do not know whether their goodness i s truly good or not . If we consider it good , Still it is insufficient to keep their persons alive ; If we consider it as not good , Still it is sufficient to keep others alive . Is there ultimate joy anywhere under heaven? Is there a metho d for keeping the person alive? Now, if there is, what should one d o and what should one rely upon? What should one avoid an d what should one dwell in? What should one resort to and wha t should one leave behind? What should one enjoy and wha t should one detest ? That which all under heaven respect is wealth, honor, lon- gevity, and a good name ; that which they take joy in is securit y for their persons, rich flavors, beautiful clothes, pretty sights, an d agreeable sounds ; that which they look down on is poverty , meanness, premature death, and a bad name ; that which they fin d distasteful is getting no ease for their persons, no rich flavors for Therefore it is said , \" If your loyal admonitions are not listened to , You should shrink back and not contend . \" Hence , Tzuhsŭ's contentio n led to the ruination of his body . Yet, had he not contended , he would not have made a name for himsel f Was his goodness truly so or not ? Now, as for what the common lot do and what they enjoy,"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"1 6 8 again I do not know whether their enjoyment is really joyful o r not . I observe that what the common lot considers enjoyment i s to rush headlong toward their goals in a flock as though they ' d never stop . But I ' m not sure whether what they all call enjoymen t is enjoyable or not . Is there really enjoyment or not? I conside r nonaction to be true enjoyment, but the common lot find i t greatly distasteful . Therefore it is said, \" The ultimate joy is to b e without joy ; the ultimate praise is to be without praise . \" The right and wrong of all under heaven are really indeter- minate . Nonetheless, nonaction can determine right and wrong . The ultimate joy is to keep the person alive, and only throug h nonaction do we come close to maintaining ultimate joy . Let m e try to explain this . Through nonaction, heaven is pure , Through nonaction, earth is tranquil . Thus, these two instances of nonaction join together and all th e myriad things evolve . How nebulous and blurred! — They come from nowhere . How blurred and nebulous! — There are no images . The myriad things in their profusio n Are all generated through nonaction . Therefore it is said, \" Heaven and earth are nonactive, yet there i s no action left undone .\" Who among men can attain nonaction ? 2 Master Chuang ' s wife died . When Master Hui went to offer hi s condolences, he found Master Chuang lolling on the floor wit h his legs sprawled out, beating a basin and singing . 16 9 \" She lived together with you,\" said Master Hui, \"raised you r children, grew old, and died . It ' s enough that you do not wail fo r her, but isn ' t it a bit much for you to be beating on a basin an d singing? \" \" Not so,\" said Master Chuang . \" When she first died, ho w could I of all people not be melancholy? But I reflected on he r beginning and realized that originally she was unborn . Not onl y was she unborn, originally she had no form . Not only did sh e have no form, originally she had no vital breath . Interminglin g with nebulousness and blurriness, a transformation occurre d and there was vital breath ; the vital breath was transformed an d there was form ; the form was transformed and there was birth ; now there has been another transformation and she is dead . Thi s is like the progression of the four seasons—from spring t o autumn, from winter to summer . There she sleeps blissfully in a n enormous chamber . If I were to have followed her weeping an d wailing, I think it would have been out of keeping with destiny , so I stopped : ' 3 Nuncle Scattered and Nuncle Slippery were observing th e mounds of the Earl of Darkness in the emptiness of K'unlu n where the Yellow Emperor rested . Suddenly a willow began t o sprout from Nuncle Slippery's left elbow .

So why should I resent it? \" 1"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"1 7 0 4 When Master Chuang went to Ch ' u, he saw an empty skull . Though brittle, it still retained its shape . Master Chuang tappe d the skull with his riding crop and asked, \" Did you end up lik e this because of greed for life and loss of reason? Or was i t because you were involved in some treasonous affair and ha d your head chopped off by an ax? Or was it because you wer e involved in some unsavory conduct, shamefully disgracing you r parents, wife, and children? Or was it because you starved o r froze? Or was it simply because your time was up? \" When he had finished with his questions, Master Chuan g picked up the skull and used it as a pillow when he went to sleep . At midnight, the skull appeared to him in a dream and said , \" Your manner of talking makes you sound like a sophist . I perceive that what you mentioned are all the burdens of th e living . When you're dead, there ' s none of that . Would you like t o hear me tell you about death, sir? \" \"Yes, \" said Master Chuang . \"When you ' re dead, \" said the skull, \"there's no ruler abov e you and no subjects below you . There are no affairs of the fou r seasons ; instead, time passes leisurely as it does for heaven an d earth . Not even the joys of being a south-facing king can surpas s those of death . \" Not believing the skull, Master Chuang said, \" If I were t o have the Arbiter of Destiny restore life to your physical form, t o give you back your flesh, bones, and skin, to return your parents , wife, children, and village acquaintances, would you like that? \" Frowning in deep consternation, the skull said, \"How coul d I abandon ` the joys of a south-facing king' and return to the toil s of mankind?\" 17 1 5 When Yen Yam went eastward to Ch ' i, Confucius had a worrie d look . Tzukung stepped off his mat and inquired, saying, \" You r humble disciple ventures to ask why you have such a worrie d look now that Yen Yuan is going eastward to Ch'i . \" \" You ' ve asked a good question!\" said Confucius . \"Of old , Master Kuan had a saying of which I thoroughly approve . He said , 'A small bag cannot be made to contain something large ; a shor t rope cannot be made to draw from a deep well : Indeed, it is lik e this, there being that which is determined by our destiny and tha t which is suitable for our physical form . These can neither b e augmented nor diminished . I ' m afraid that Yuan will talk abou t the Way of Yao, Shun, and the Yellow Emperor with the Marqui s of Ch'i, and that he'll go on to talk about Torchman and th e Divine Farmer .

The marquis was trying t o nourish the bird as he would have nourished himself, and no t with the nourishment suitable for a bird .

Fish dwell in th e water and live ; if men were to dwell in the water they would die . They are decidedly different from each other, so their likes an d dislikes are different . Therefore the former sages did not insis t that the abilities of all be identical nor that their affairs b e similar . Their naming was limited by reality, and they establishe d usages as appropriate .

Focusin g on one's inner being, as opposed to external distractions, brings supreme skil l and long-lasting life . 1 She who understands the attributes of life does not strive fo r what is not doable in life ; she who understands the attributes o f destiny does not strive for that which is not permitted by destiny . For the nourishment of the physical form, material things are a necessary prerequisite, but sometimes there is a surplus of thing s yet the physical form goes unnourished . For there to be life, a necessary prerequisite is that it not be separated from the physi- cal form, but there are instances of nonseparation from th e physical form yet life is lost . When life comes, it cannot b e refused ; when life goes, it cannot be stopped . How sad that th e people of the world think that nourishing the physical form i s sufficient to preserve life! But when it turns out that nourishin g the physical form is insufficient for the preservation of life, what in the world can be done that is sufficient? Although doin g things is insufficient, one cannot but do them unless one avoid s doing altogether . If one wishes to avoid doing things for the physical form , there is no better course than to abandon the world . Once on e abandons the world, there are no entanglements . When there ar e no entanglements, there will be correct equanimity . When ther e is correct equanimity, one will be born again with that . Havin g been born again, one is dose to it . But why is it sufficient t o abandon affairs and to be lax about life? By abandoning affairs , the form is not toiled ; by being lax about life, the essence is no t diminished . When the form is complete and the essence i s restored, you become one with heaven . Heaven and earth are th e father and mother of the myriad things . When they join, th e body is complete ; when they disperse, completion begins anew . When the form and the essence are undiminished, this is calle d adaptability . With the essence of the essence, you return t o become the assistant of heaven . 2 Sir Master Lieh inquired of Yin, the Director of the Pass, saying , \"The ultimate man can walk under water without drowning, ca n tread upon fire without feeling hot, and can soar above the myria d things without fear .

Sit down, and I will tell you . \"Whatever has features, images, sound, and color is a thing . How, then, can one thing be distanced from another? And ar e there sufficient grounds for giving some precedence over others ? They are merely forms and color, that is all . But a thing that i s created from formlessness may end in nonevolution .

She will unify her nature, nurture her vita l breath, and consolidate her integrity so as to communicate wit h that which creates things . Being like this, she will preserve th e wholeness of her heavenly qualities and her spirituality will b e flawless, so how could things enter and affect her ? \"If a drunk falls from a carriage, even if it is going very fast , he will not die . His bones and joints are the same as those o f other people, but the injuries he receives are different . It's becaus e his spirit is whole .

For five or six months, I practice balancing tw o pellets at the end of my pole . When I can keep them from fallin g down, then I'll only lose a small fraction of the cicadas . When I can balance three balls and keep them from falling down, the n I ' ll only lose one cicada in ten . When I can balance five balls an d keep them from falling down, then I can gather up the cicadas a s easily as if I were using my hands . I position my body as thoug h it were an erect stump with twisted roots . I hold my arms a s though they were the branches of a withered tree . The greatnes s of heaven and earth and the numerousness of the myriad things 17 7 notwithstanding, I am aware only of the cicada ' s wings . I neithe r turn around nor to the side and wouldn ' t exchange the wings of a cicada for all the myriad things . How can I not succeed? \" Confucius turned to his disciples and said, \" In exercisin g your will, do not let it be diverted ; rather, concentrate your spirit . This is the lesson of the hunchback gentleman . \" Yen Yuan inquired of Confucius, saying, \" When I wa s crossing the gulf of Goblet Deep, the ferryman handled the boa t like a spirit . I asked him about it, saying, ` Can handling a boat b e learned?\"Yes , ' said he, ` good swimmers can learn quickly . As fo r divers, they can handle a boat right away without ever havin g seen one : I asked him why this was so, but he didn't tell me . I venture to ask what you think he meant . \" \"A good swimmer can learn quickly because he forgets abou t the water,\" said Confucius . ` As for a diver being able to handle a boat right away without ever having seen one, it's because h e regards the watery depths as if they were a mound and th e capsizing of a boat as if it were the rolling back of a carriage . Capsizing and rolling back could unfold a myriad times befor e him without affecting his heart, so he is relaxed wherever he goes . He who competes for a piece of tile displays all of his skill ; h e who competes for a belt buckle gets nervous ; he who compete s for gold gets flustered .

This lesson is repeated in a successio n of well-crafted tales . In current phraseology, we would he advised to \"keep a lo w profile\" and \"mind your own business .\" The probable multiple authorship o f even this one chapter is evident in the repetition, from three slightly differen t angles, of the story about Confucius being besieged between the statelets of Ch'e n and Ts'ai . 1 Master Chuang was walking in the mountains when he saw a great tree with thick branches and luxuriant foliage . A lumber - jack had stopped by its side but did not attempt to fell it . Whe n Master Chuang asked him the reason, he said, \" There ' s nothin g that it can be used for . \" \" This tree has been able to live out the years allotted to it b y heaven because it is worthless, \" said Master Chuang . After he left the mountain, Master Chuang lodged in th e home of an old friend . Delighted, the old friend ordered a boy t o kill a goose and cook it . The boy asked for further instructions,"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"1 8 7 saying, \" One of the geese can cackle and the other cannot .

The next day, Master Chuang's disciples inquired of him , saying, \"The tree we saw in the mountains yesterday was able t o live out the years allotted to it by heaven because it is worthless , but today our host's goose will die because it is worthless . Whic h of these conditions would you rather be in, master? \" Master Chuang laughed and said, \"I suppose I'd rather fin d myself somewhere between worthlessness and worthiness . Bu t even finding oneself somewhere between worthlessness an d worthiness, though it might seem like the right place to be, reall y isn't because it can ' t keep you out of trouble .

That is why I a m worried . \" Your techniques for ridding yourself of calamity are shal- low,\" said Master Southmarket . \"The thick-furred fox and th e elegantly spotted leopard inhabit the mountain forest and lurk i n cliffside caves—such is their stillness .

Although he had an instrument, he couldn ' t kee p the beat ; although he had a voice, he couldn ' t carry the tune . Th e sound of the wood and the sound of his voice had a peculiarl y plaintive effect upon the hearts of those who were listening . Yen Hui stood respectfully with his hands folded on hi s chest and turned his eyes around to glance at him .

Raising his pellet bow, he waited for the right moment . He saw a cicada that had just found a nice, shady spot and had forgotte n all about protecting its own body .

Hi s demeanor was now like that of a dragon, now like that of a tiger . He remonstrated with me as though he were my son ; he guide d me as though he were my father . That's why I sighed : ' When Confucius saw Warmsnow, he did not say a word . Tzulu said, \"Master, you have long wanted to see Master Uncl e Warmsnow, but now that you have seen him you didn't say a word . Why? \" ` As soon as my eyes came in contact with that man ;' sai d Confucius, \"I felt that I was in the presence of the Way . Ther e was simply no room for me to make a sound . \" 3 Yen Yuan inquired of Confucius, saying, \"When you pace, I als o pace ; when you rush, I also rush ; when you race, I also race ; bu t when you run so fast that you outstrip the dust, I am left behin d staring at you blankly . \" \" Hui, what do you mean?\" asked the master . \"By ` when you pace, I also pace ; I meant that when yo u speak, I also speak . By ` when you rush, I also rush ; I meant tha t when you dispute, I also dispute . By `when you race, I also race ; I meant that when you speak of the Way, I also speak of the Way . And by ` when you run so fast that you outstrip the dust, I am lef t behind staring at you blankly ; I meant that you are believed eve n when you don't speak ; that you encompass all without partiality ; and that, although you do not possess the implements of state , the people throng before you—yet I do not know at all how thi s can be so . 20 1 \" Ah! \" said Confucius . \" We ' d better examine this more care - fully! Now, there is no greater sadness than the death of th e mind—the death of the person is secondary . The sun comes u p in the east and sets in the western extremities, all the myria d things orienting themselves accordingly . Those that have eye s and toes complete their tasks only after waiting upon it . When i t comes out they are preserved ; when it goes in they disappear . It' s the same with the myriad things : there is that upon which the y wait before dying and that upon which they wait before bein g born . Once I have received my complete physical form, I remai n unchanged while I await extinction . I move in imitation of thing s day and night without a break, not knowing where it will end . From gathering wisps our physical form is completed and , though we may know destiny, we cannot perceive its antecedents . Thus do I pass on day after day . \"I have spent my whole life in bosom friendship with you , and yet you have missed this . Is it not sad? You have probabl y noted what I have noted, but that is already finished . Yet you g o seeking for it as though it still existed, which is like seeking for a horse in a deserted marketplace . I have been quite forgetful in m y service to you, and you have been quite forgetful in your servic e to me . Nevertheless, why should you be so troubled by this ? Although you may forget the old me, there still exists somethin g about me that cannot be forgotten . \" 4 Confucius went to see Old Longears, who had just finishe d shampooing and was disheveling his hair so it could dry . He wa s so absorbed that he seemed inhuman . Confucius waited on hi m off to the side for a while and then went over to introduc e himself . \"Were my eyes deceiving me? Or were you really lik e that? Just now your physical body was stiff as a withered tree, sir . You seemed to have left everything behind, parted company wit h humanity, and were standing there in solitude :'"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"2 0 2 \" I was letting my mind wander in the origin of things,\" sai d Old Longears . \"What do you mean? \" asked Confucius . \"The mind is so confined that one cannot know it ; th e tongue is so tied that one cannot tell of it . But I shall try t o describe it for you roughly . \" The ultimate yin is austere ; the ultimate yang is dazzling . Austerity comes forth from earth and dazzlement issues fro m heaven . When these two are in communication, harmony i s achieved and things are born . Perhaps there is something regulat- ing this, but no one has seen its form . Dissolution and genera- tion, fullness and emptiness, now dark, now bright ; the sun shift s and the moon evolves—daily this process goes on, but no on e sees its effect . Birth has that from which it sprouts ; death ha s that to which it returns . Beginning and ending are opposed t o each other in randomness, but no one knows where they con- clude . If it is not like this, then who is the ancestor of it all? \" \"May I ask how you let your mind wander in this realm? \" said Confucius . \" The attainment of this ;\" said Old Longears, \" is the ultimat e beauty and the ultimate joy . She who attains ultimate beauty an d wanders in ultimate joy is called the ultimate woman . \" \"I would like to hear about your method ;\" said Confucius . \"Herbivorous animals are not vexed by a change of pasture ; aqueous insects are not vexed by a change of water . This i s because a small transformation is carried out without the loss o f a greater constant, so that pleasure, anger, sorrow, and joy wil l not enter the breast . It is under heaven that the myriad things ar e unified . When they achieve unity and share it equally, their fou r limbs and hundred members of the body become so much dus t and dirt ; death and life, ending and beginning become as day an d night ; none of this can confound them, and much less can th e distinctions between gain and loss, between misfortune an d fortune . Abandoning subject status is like abandoning a clum p of mud, because one knows that one's person is more valued than 20 3 the subject status . Value lies in oneself and is not lost by a chang e of status . Since there are myriad transformations that neve r begin to reach a limit, which of them is sufficient to trouble th e mind? He who is already a doer of the Way comprehends this . \" Confucius said, \" Your integrity is a companion of heave n and earth, Master, yet you borrow ultimate words to cultivate th e mind . Were there any gentlemen of antiquity who could ge t beyond this? \" \"No,\" said Old Longears . \" The babbling of water is it s natural quality, not an intentional act . The relationship of th e ultimate man to integrity is similar in that nothing can escape it s influence though he does not cultivate it . He is like heaven whic h is naturally high ; like earth which is naturally substantial ; an d like the sun and moon which are naturally bright . What need i s there for him to cultivate it? \" Confucius went out and reported what he had heard to Ye n Hui, saying, \"Is not my relationship to the Way like that of a bu g in a vat of vinegar? Had the master not lifted up the lid, I woul d not have known the great perfection of heaven and earth . \" 5 When Master Chuang had an interview with Duke Ai of Lu, th e duke said, \"There are many literati in Lu, but few of the m practice your methods . \" \"There are few literati in Lu,\" said Master Chuang . \"Throughout the state of Lu there are people wearing literat i garb, \" said Duke Ai . \"What do you mean, 'there are few ' ? \" \"I have heard, \" said Master Chuang, \"that the literatus wear s a round cap to signify that he knows the seasons of heaven ; tha t he wears square sandals to signify that he knows the forms o f earth ; and that he ties at his waist a pendant shaped like a slotte d ring to signify that he decisively handles affairs which come t o him . But the gentleman who possesses a particular way does no t necessarily wear a particular garb, and the person who wears a"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"2 0 4 i particular garb does not necessarily know a particular way . Sinc e your highness obviously thinks this is not so, why do n ' t you issu e this proclamation throughout the land? ` Whoever wears a partic- ular garb without possessing the particular way that it signifie s will be guilty of a capital offense . \" Thereupon Duke Ai issued the proclamation and, withi n five days, there were no more people who dared to wear literat i garb, except for a single old man who stood at the duke's gate . The duke summoned him immediately and asked him abou t affairs of state . Although their conversation took a multitude o f twists and turns, the duke could not exhaust his knowledge . Master Chuang asked, \"If there is only one person in th e state of Lu who is a literatus, can we say that there are `many'? \" 6 Ranks and salaries did not enter the mind of Poll Hsi . There - fore, when he fed cattle, the cattle got fat, which caused Duk e Mu of Ch'in to forget his lowly position and turn over th e government to him . Life and death did not enter the mind of th e clansman of the freehold at Yŭ, therefore he was able to mov e others . 7 Lord Yuan of Sung wished to have some charts drawn . A crow d of clerks arrived and, after receiving their instructions and bow- ing, they stood in line licking their brushes and mixing their ink . There were so many that half of them remained outside . Ther e was one clerk who arrived late, casually and without hurrying . He received his instructions and bowed, but did not stand i n line, returning instead to his dormitory . When the duke sen t someone to look in on him, he was found half-naked, with hi s shirt off, sitting with his legs splayed out . \" He will do,\" said th e lord . \" This is a true draftsman?' 20 5 8 King Wen was sightseeing at Tsang when he spotted an old ma n fishing with a line, but the line had no hook . He was not one o f those who insists that his fishing line has to have a fishhook, thu s his was an eternal fishing . King Wen wished to elevate him to office and hand over th e government to him, but was afraid that his high officers and hi s seniors would be uneasy . Then he wished to stop thinking abou t the man and leave him alone, but he could not bear to let th e hundred clans be without such a heaven-sent guardian . Therefore , the next morning he called together his great officers and said t o them, \" Last night I dreamed I saw a man with a swarthy complex - ion and a beard . He was riding a piebald horse whose hooves wer e crimson on one side . `Entrust your government to the old ma n from Tsang, ' he cried out, ` so that the people may be cured!' \" \"It was your late father, the king ;\" said the great officers i n astonishment . \"If so, then let us divine the matter, \" said King Wen . \" Since it is the order of your late father ;\" said the grea t officers, \"you need not consider anything else . Why should yo u divine the matter? \" Whereupon the king welcomed the old man of Tsang to hi s court and handed over the government to him . The statutes an d laws remained unchanged and no unjust directives were issued . After three years King Wen toured the country and found tha t the ranks of the officials had destroyed their factions and dis- banded their cliques, that senior officers did not flaunt thei r virtue, and that no one dared to bring odd-sized measurement s inside the four borders .

Thereupon King Wen appointed him Grand Preceptor . Facing north, he asked, \"Can my government be extended to al l under heaven?\" The old man from Tsang was so oblivious tha t he did not respond except to decline vaguely . In the morning h e was still in charge, but by nightfall he had vanished, never to b e heard from for the rest of his life . Yen Yuan inquired of Confucius, saying, \"Was not eve n King Wen up to it? And why did he have to resort to a dream? \" \"Be silent!\" said Confucius . \"Don't say a word! King We n had reached perfection . How can you criticize him? He only use d it as a momentary expedient .\" 9 Lieh Yuk'ou was demonstrating his archery for Uncle Obscur e Nobody . He drew the bow to its full extent, had someone place a cup of water on his elbow, and released the string . No sooner ha d he shot the first arrow than he nocked another, and as soon as h e shot the second arrow another was lodged on the nocking point . All the while he stood like a statue . Uncle Obscure Nobody said, \"This is the archery of a n archer, not the archery of a nonarcher . Let's climb a high moun- tain and clamber over steep rocks till we overlook a chasm on e hundred fathoms deep . Will you be able to shoot then? \" Thereupon Nobody and Yuk'ou climbed a high mountai n and clambered over steep rocks until they were overlooking a chasm one hundred fathoms deep . Nobody inched out backwar d so that his feet were halfway over the edge . He bowed to Yuk'o u and invited him to come forward, but Yuk'ou had fallen pros- trate on the ground, with sweat dripping down to his heels . \" The ultimate man,\" said Uncle Obscure Nobody, \"peer s into the cerulean sky above and descends into the Yellow Spring s below .

At first I was suspicious of you, but now I see that the breath from you r nostrils is relaxed . Just how is it that you apply your mind? \" \"In what manner do I surpass other men?\" asked Sun Shu'ao . \" When the position came to me, I thought that I could no t refuse it ; when it was taken away from me, I thought that I coul d not prevent it . I believed that gaining or losing the position wa s not up to me, so I didn't appear dejected, that ' s all . In wha t manner do I surpass other men? Furthermore, I didn't kno w whether the honor had to do with the position or with me . If i t had to do with the position, then it had nothing to do with me . If it had to do with me, then it had nothing to do with th e position . I'm about to go sauntering off and gazing in the fou r directions ; what leisure do I have to care whether people hono r or despise me? \" Confucius heard of this and said, \" The true man of ol d could not be persuaded by those who are cunning, could not b e seduced by beautiful women, could not be plundered by robbers , could not be befriended by Fuhsi and the Yellow Emperor . Lif e and death are of great moment, but they could effect no trans - formation upon him, how much less rank and salary?

The best way t o experience it is just to go awandering . 1 Knowledge wandered north to the banks of the Dark Water, wher e he climbed the hill of Obscure Prominence and happened to mee t Dumb Nonaction . Knowledge said to Dumb Nonaction, \"I hav e some questions I wish to ask you . By what thought and wha t reflection may we know the Way? Where shall we dwell and ho w shall we serve so that we may be secure in the Way? From wha t point of departure and by what way may we attain the Way?\" H e asked three questions and still Dumb Nonaction did not answer . Not only did he not answer, he did not know how to answer . Being unsuccessful with his questions, Knowledge went bac k south to White Water, where he climbed up Solitary Confine and caught sight of Mad Stammerer . Knowledge asked the sam e questions of Mad Stammerer . \"Ah!\" said Mad Stammerer . \" I know the answers and will tell you .\" But right when he started t o speak, he forgot what he wanted to say . Being unsuccessful with his questions, Knowledge went bac k to the imperial palace where he saw the Yellow Emperor an d asked him the questions . The Yellow Emperor said, \" Don't think and don ' t reflect — only then may you begin to know the Way . Don't dwell and don ' t serve—only then may you begin to be secure in the Way . Hav e no departure and no way—only then may you begin to attai n the Way . \" Knowledge asked the Yellow Emperor, saying, \" You and I know the answers, but those two do not . Who ' s right? \" The Yellow Emperor said, \" It ' s Dumb Nonaction who ' s truly right . Mad Stammerer seems like he is, but you and I com e last and are not even close . Now , One who knows does not speak ; One who speaks does not know . Therefore, the sage practices a doctrine without words . The Wa y cannot be compelled and integrity cannot be forced . Humane- ness may be practiced ; righteousness may be slighted ; but cere- mony is for being false to one another . Therefore, it is said , `When the Way is lost , afterward comes integrity . When integrity is lost , afterward comes humaneness . When humaneness is lost , afterward comes righteousness . When righteousness is lost , afterward comes ceremony ."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"212 \t r \t 21 3 Ceremony is but the blossomy ornament of the Way , and the source of disorder : Therefore, it is said , ` The practice of the Way results in daily decrease .

Could anyone but the great man find it easy ? \" For life is the disciple of death and death is the beginnin g of life . Who knows their regulator? Human life is the coales- cence of vital breath . When it coalesces there is life ; when i t dissipates there is death . Since life and death are disciples of eac h other, how should I be troubled by them? Thus the myria d things are a unity .

But stench and putrefaction evolve into spiri t and wonder, and spirit and wonder evolve once again into stenc h and putrefaction .

Now, when I asked you, you knew th e answers . Why did you say you weren't even close? \" \" The reason Dumb Nonaction was truly right,\" said th e Yellow Emperor, \" is because he didn't know . The reason Ma d Stammerer seemed to be right is because he forgot .

Heaven and earth have great beauty but do not speak ; the fou r seasons have a clear law but do not deliberate ; the myriad thing s have a complete principle but do not explain . The sage is on e who probes the beauties of heaven and earth and comprehend s the principles of the myriad things . Hence the ultimate man doe s not act and the great sage makes nothing, which is to say tha t they observe heaven and earth . Now, the spiritual intelligence of heaven and earth is th e ultimate essence that undergoes hundreds of evolutions wit h things . Things in all of their dying and living, their squarenes s and roundness, know not their roots, yet surely they have existe d for all eternity in their ubiquitousness . The six reaches of th e universe are enormous, but they cannot get beyond the spirit o f heaven and earth . A downy hair of autumn is small, but it depend s on the spirit of heaven and earth for its embodiment . There i s nothing under heaven that does not wax and wane and tha t remains immutable throughout its existence . Yin and yang an d the four seasons revolve in their courses, each in its own prope r order . Dully, the spirit of heaven and earth seems nonexistent ye t it persists ; smoothly it inspirits without assuming a form of it s own . It rears the myriad things, but they are unaware . This i s called the root and the source ; through it we may observe heaven . 3 Gnaw Gap asked Wearcoat about the Way .

Nor do you pos- sess your descendants who are cast-off skins entrusted to you by heaven and earth . Therefore, when you walk you don't know wher e you're going ; when you stay in one place you don't know wha t you ' re clinging to ; and when you eat you don't know what you're 21 5 tasting . These are all due to the powerful vital breath of heaven an d earth, so how could one obtain and possess them? \" 5 Confucius inquired of Old Longears, saying, \" Today we are a t leisure, so I venture to ask about the ultimate Way : ' Old Longears said, \" You must fast so as to cleanse you r mind, purify your spiritual essence, and purge your knowledge .

That which may be added t o without increasing and subtracted from without decreasing i s what the sage protects . Deep as the ocean, towering as a moun- tain, it comes to an end then starts all over again . In full measure , it conveys the myriad things without neglecting any of them . (The way of the superior man, however, has to do with externals , does it not?) The myriad things all go to it for their sustenanc e yet there is no deficiency . Is this not the Way ? \" Here is a man of the Middle Kingdom who is neither yi n nor yang and who dwells between heaven and earth . For th e moment he is a man, but he will return to the source .

One might say that it is only a matte r of moments, surely insufficient to determine whether Yao i s right and Chieh is wrong . \" Fructiferous plants have their principles and human rela- tionships, though difficult, have that whereby they mesh . Whe n the sage encounters affairs, he does not go against them ; when h e passes beyond them, he does not maintain them . To respond t o things through adjustment is integrity ; to respond to things as a companion is the Way . It was thus that the emperors thrived an d the kings arose . \" Man ' s life between heaven and earth is like a white col t passing a crack in the wall—suddenly it's finished . Rapidly 21 7 surging, all things come forth ; smoothly subsiding, all thing s reenter . Having evolved they are born, then they evolve again an d are dead . Living things are sorrowed by it ; mankind is saddene d by it . But it's only the untying of a heavenly bow-case, th e emptying of a heavenly book-bag .

This is the great returning ! \"From formlessness to form, from form to formlessness — this is known to all men in common, but not something to whic h one who will attain the Way attends . This is something which i s discussed by the masses of men in common, but he who attains i t does not discuss it, and those who discuss it do not attain it .

Thus they cannot pass over K'unlun and wande r in grand emptiness .\" 8 Resplendent Light inquired of Nonexistent Existence, saying , \"Master, do you exist or do you not exist? \" Not getting an answer to his question, Resplendent Ligh t looked at the other ' s sunken, hollow appearance intently . For a whole day, he looked at him but couldn't see him, listened to hi m but couldn ' t hear him, groped for him but couldn ' t grasp him . \" The ultimate! \" said Resplendent Light . \"Who else coul d attain such a state? I can conceive of the existence of nonexis- tence, but not of the nonexistence of nonexistence . And when i t comes to the nonexistence of existence, how could one attai n such a state?\" 9 The forger of hooks for the minister of war was already eight y years old, but he hadn ' t lost an ounce of his ability . The minister of war asked him, \"Is it because of your skill ? Or do you have a way? \" \" It ' s because of what your subject guards . When I wa s twenty, I already liked to forge hooks . I didn't look at anythin g else . If it wasn ' t a hook, I didn't pay any attention to it . \" His competence at forging hooks was premised upon his 22 1 incompetence in other areas . Thus was he able to maintain hi s competence for such a long period of time . How much more s o is this the case with someone who is not incompetent! All thing s will avail themselves of him . 1 0 Jan Ch ' iu inquired of Confucius, saying, \"Can we know what i t was like before there were heaven and earth? \" \" Yes, \" said Confucius, \" it was the same in the past as it is i n the present . \" Jan Ch'iu lost the train of his question and withdrew . Th e next day he came to see Confucius again and said, \" Yesterday I asked `Can we know what it was like before there was heaven an d earth? ' and you said ' Yes, it was the same in the past as it is in th e present .' Yesterday I thought I understood you clearly, but now I feel muddled . I venture to ask what you meant, master . \" Confucius said, \" Yesterday you thought you understoo d clearly because your spirit anticipated my reply . Today you fee l muddled, however, because you are seeking to understand wit h your nonspiritual side . There is neither past nor present, neithe r beginning nor end . Is it conceivable that there could be on e generation of descendants unless there were an earlier generatio n of descendants? \" Jan Ch ' iu did not reply . \"Enough!\" said Confucius . \"You needn ' t respond . We can - not enliven death with life, we cannot deathify life with death . Are death and life counterposed? There is that which embodie s both of them as a unity . Is there something that was born befor e heaven and earth? That which makes things things is not a thing .

It thus serves as a transitional springboard int o the Miscellaneous Chapters and an encapsulation of the whole book . 1 Among the servants of Old Longears, there was a Kengsang C h ' u who had gotten a partial understanding of the Way of Ol d Longears . With it, he went north to dwell in the Jagged Moun- tains . He dismissed his attendants who were ostentatiousl y knowledgeable and distanced himself from his concubines wh o were insistently humane . He dwelled with rustics and made bus y bees his servants . After he had dwelled there for three years, ther e was a great harvest at Jagged . The people of Jagged said to eac h other, \"When Master Kengsang first came, we were startled b y his strangeness . Now, when we estimated him by the day, he wa s inadequate, but when we estimate him by the year, h e ' s more than"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"2 2 6 enough . Indeed, he's virtually a sage! Why don't you invoke hi m as our impersonator of the dead and build an altar to him as ou r god of the land and grain? \" When Master Kengsang heard this, he sat facing sout h feeling preoccupied . Master Kengsang's disciples considered thi s strange, but he said to them, \" Why, my disciples, should yo u consider this strange of me ? The vital breath of spring arise s and the hundred grasses are born ; The height of autumn arrive s and the myriad treasures ripen . Are spring and autumn like this for no reason? It's because of th e operation of the Way of heaven . I have heard that the ultimat e man dwells quietly as a corpse within the surrounding walls o f his room, while the common people rush about madly withou t knowing where they are going . Now the petty people of Jagge d presumptuously wish to make offerings to me along with th e wise men . Am I a man to be held up as such a paragon? That i s why I am perplexed by the words of Old Longears . \" \" Not so,\" said his disciples . \" Huge fish have no room to tur n their bodies around in a ditch that is a few yards wide, but mu d loathes can cut circles through it . Huge beasts have no place t o hide their bulk on a hillock that is a few paces high, but the wil y fox thinks it's just dandy . Furthermore, the wise should b e honored and the capable should be rewarded, while precedenc e should be given to the good and the beneficial . From old, Ya o and Shun behaved thus . How much more should the people o f Jagged do so! You, too, should accede to them, oh master . \" \" Come closer, my little ones!\" said Master Kengsang . \"Sup - posing there were a beast so large that it could hold a chariot i n its mouth . If it were to stray away from the hills, it would no t escape being troubled by nets . Supposing there were a fish s o large that it could swallow a boat . If it were to splash out of the 22 7 water, it could be tormented by ants . Therefore, birds and beast s do not detest heights ; fish and turtles do not detest depths . Th e man who would preserve his form and life intact hides his perso n and detests not depth and distance, that ' s all . \" Furthermore, how are those two worthy of your praise? I n their disputations, it was as though they were recklessly borin g through walls to plant bushes and brambles, selecting strands o f hair to comb, counting grains of rice to cook . Being so presump- tuous, how could they have been worthy of aiding the world? I f you promote those who are wise, the people will compete wit h each other ; if you appoint those who have knowledge, the peopl e will rob from each other . Those who count things are no t worthy of assisting the people . The people are so eager for profi t that a son will kill his father and a subject will kill his lord . The y will rob in broad daylight and tunnel through brick walls a t noon . I tell you that, surely as the root of great disorder was bor n in the times of Yao and Shun, its branches will last for more tha n a thousand generations . After a thousand generations, there wil l surely still be people who eat each other . \" Disconcerted, Rufus Southglory sat up straight and said , \" What means can someone who is old like me rely upon t o attain what you have spoken about? \" Master Kengsang said , \"Preserve your form , Protect your life ; Do not let your thought s be agitated . If you do this for three years, you can attain what I have spoke n about . \" \" In form, \" said Rufus Southglory, \"I cannot tell the differ- ence between eyes, yet the blind cannot see with theirs .

The ability of the one and the disability of the other ar e certainly due to the magnitude of their talents . Now, I am o f small talent that is insufficient to transform you, sir .

Rufus Southglory looke d around behind himself fearfully . \"Do you not know what I am talking about?\" asked the Ol d Master . Abashed, Rufus Southglory lowered his head . Then h e looked up and said with a sigh, \"Now I have forgotten m y answer, so I have lost my question . \" \" What do you mean?\" asked the Old Master . \"If we suppose that I am without knowledge ;\" said Rufu s Southglory, \" people will say that I am a cretin .

I f I were righteous, on the contrary, I would be tormented abou t my self . How can I possibly escape from this predicament? It i s these three watchwords that are troubling me . At Ch ' u ' s sugges- tion, I would like to ask you about them . \" \"A moment ago,\" said the Old Master, \"by looking yo u closely in the eyes, I could tell what was on your mind .

How pathetic! \" Rufus Southglory requested that he be permitted to ente r the Old Master's school and take up residence in its dormitory . There he summoned what he liked and dismissed what h e disliked . For ten days he tormented himself, then went back t o see the Old Master . \"If you are purging yourself ;\" asked the Old Master, \"wh y are you so melancholy? Instead, you are still overflowing wit h dislikes . When external distractions cannot be constrained an d arrested, bar them from within ; when internal distractions can - not be restrained and arrested, bar them from without . Even a man of the Way and integrity would not be able to maintai n himself in the face of such internal and external distractions , how much less could someone whose practice is but an imitatio n of the Way! \" \"When a villager gets sick ;\" said Rufus Southglory, \"and hi s fellow villagers ask about it, if the sick person can describe hi s sickness, then he's not really sick . In the case of my hearing abou t the Great Way, it's like drinking medicine that adds to m y sickness . I would like to hear about the basic rules for guardin g life, that's all .\""},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"2 3 0 \" The basic rules for guarding life, \" said the Old Master, \" ar e Can you embrace unity ? Can you keep from losing it ? Can you know what is auspicious and inauspiciou s without oracle bones and divining stalks ? Can you stop when it's time to stop ? Can you cease when it 's time to cease ? Can you give up looking for it in other s and seek for it in yourself ? Can you be casual? Can you be naive? Can you be like a child ? The child howls the whole day but its throat does not becom e hoarse—the height of harmony . It clasps its hands all day long , but they do not become cramped—it concentrates its integrity . It stares with its eyes the whole day, but they do not blink—it i s not diverted by externals . It walks but knows not where ; i t remains stationary but knows not why . It is intertwined wit h things and ripples along together with them . These are the basi c rules for guarding life . \" \" But is this then all there is to the integrity of the ultimat e man? \" asked Rufus Southglory . \"No . This is merely the so-called thawing of the ice an d melting of the frost . As for the ultimate man, along with other s he prays for food from earth and prays for joy from heaven . H e does not come into conflict with men and things over advantag e and disadvantage . He does not do strange things, make plans, o r engage in affairs with others . Casually he goes ; naively he comes . These are the basic rules for guarding life : ' \" But is this then the ultimate? \" \" Not quite . I had originally asked you whethe r You could be ` like a child : The child move s but does not know why, 23 1 Walks but does not know where . Its body is like a branch of withered woo d and its mind is like dead ashes . Being like this , Misfortune does not arrive , Nor does fortune come . When there is neither fortune nor misfortune , How can there be human calamities? \" When space is serenely stabilized, it emits a heavenly light . When the heavenly light is emitted, humans reveal their human- ity, things reveal their substantiality . When humans have culti- vated themselves, they finally achieve constancy . When someon e has constancy, humans will take shelter with him and heaven wil l help him . Those whom humans take shelter with are calle d people of heaven . Those whom heaven helps are called sons o f heaven . Learning is to learn what cannot be learned ; action is to ac t out what cannot be acted ; disputation is to dispute over wha t cannot be disputed . Knowledge that stops at what it canno t know is the ultimate . If someone does not subscribe to this, h e will be worn down by the celestial potter's wheel . Provided with things to succor the physical form, storing u p unconcern to enliven the mind, respecting what lies within t o communicate with what lies without—if one does this and stil l myriad evils arrive, it is all due to heaven and not to man . The y will be insufficient to disturb completeness and incapable o f admittance to the numinous terrace . The numinous terrace has a guardian, but unless it knows what is guarding it, it cannot b e guarded . If one sallies forth without realizing this sincerity, every sall y will be improper .

Wha t was the ultimacy that it attained? They realized thai there was a stage before there were things . This is the ultimacy they ha d attained, the utmost to which nought can be added . Next, ther e were those who recognized that there were things yet considere d that life was bereavement and death but a return . This wa s already a division . Next, there were those who said, \"In th e beginning was nonbeing . Subsequently, there was life, and onc e there was life, suddenly there was death .

The Way is the 23 5 sovereign of virtue ; life is the light of virtue ; nature is th e substance of life . The movement of nature is called action ; th e falsification of action is called failure . Knowledge is reception ; knowledge is scheming . But knowledge which is unknowing i s like a sideways glance . Movement in which one has no alternativ e is called virtue ; movement in which there is nothing other tha n ego is called order .

People in general are too busy with their daily occupations an d neglect what is genuinely important in their lives . Master Chuang has an anti - philosophical discussion with Master Hui and then mourns his passing . Most of the episodes in this lengthy chapter are directed against clever , sophistical disputation, Confucian moralizing, and involvement with mundan e affairs . The spiritual man (the Taoist true man) is not confused by suc h distractions because he has a more profound vision that sees things clearly . 1 Ghostless Hsii obtained through Na Shang an introduction fo r an interview with Marquis Wu of Wei . Marquis Wu console d him, saying, \"You must be exhausted, sir! I suppose that you wer e willing to come see my humble self only because you hav e suffered so bitterly from your toils in the mountain forests . \" \"It is I who should console you, my lord,\" said Ghostles s Hsu . \"What is there for you to console me about?

I shal l console you, my lord . What is there for you to console m e about? \" Marquis Wu haughtily made no reply . After a short while, Ghostless Hsŭ said, \"Let me tell you r lordship how I judge dogs . Those of inferior quality are conten t merely to seize their prey and fill their stomachs—they have th e virtue of a wild cat . Those of middling quality seem to look u p at the sun . Those of superior quality seem to have lost their ow n identity . But my judging of dogs is not up to my judging o f horses . When I judge horses, if they make straight lines tha t would fit a ruler, angles that would fit a bevel, squares that woul d fit an L-square, circles that would fit a compass, they are horse s for a kingdom, but they are not as good as horses that ar e suitable for all under heaven . The horse that is suitable for al l under heaven has talents that are complete . He seems distresse d and distracted, as though he had forfeited his own identity . A horse like this is so surpassing that he outstrips the dust, no t knowing where he is .\" Marquis Wu laughed with great delight . When Ghostless Hsŭ went out, Nŭ Shang asked him, \"Ho w was it, sir, that your persuasions had such a singular effect on m y lord? In attempting to persuade him, my indirect persuasions ar e drawn from the Odes, Documents, Ritual, and Music, while my direc t persuasions are drawn from the Metal Tablets and Six Bow-cases . The number of greatly meritorious proposals I have submitte d to him is incalculable, yet my lord has never shown his teeth in a smile . Now, sir, how did you persuade my lord so as to cause hi m to be delighted like this? \" \"I told him straightforwardly how I judge dogs and horses, \" said Ghostless Hsŭ . \"Just like that?\" asked Nŭ Shang . \"Haven't you heard about the man who was exiled to Viet? \" asked Ghostless Hsŭ . 'After he ' d been away from his country fo r several days, whenever he saw someone he knew it made hi m happy . After he ' d been away from his country for a month or so, 23 9 whenever he saw someone he ' d seen before in his country it mad e him happy . By the time a full year had elapsed, whenever he sa w someone who looked vaguely familiar, it made him happy . Isn ' t this because the longer you're away from someone, the mor e deeply you think of him? Suppose that someone flees into a deserted valley where weasel runs are choked with pigweed an d goosefoot . After a protracted stay in its emptiness, should h e hear the tramping sound of human footsteps, he will feel happy . How much more so if it were the mirthful murmurs of hi s brothers and relatives by his side! For too long there have been n o mirthful murmurings of a true man by the side of my lord! \" 2 Ghostless Hsŭ had an interview with Marquis Wu, and th e marquis said to him, \"For too long, sir, you have dwelt in th e mountain forests eating chestnuts and acorns and sating yoursel f with onions and leeks, neglecting my humble self! Have yo u come now because yo u ' re old? Because you desire to try the tast e of wine and meat? Or because you want to bring blessings to m y humble altars to the gods of the land and grain? \" \"I was born into poverty, \" said Ghostless Hsŭ, \"and woul d never dare to eat and drink my lord's meat and wine . I have come , rather, to console my lord . \" \"What? \" said the lord . \"How can you console my humbl e self? \" \"I shall console your spirit and your form . \" \"What do you mean? \" asked Marquis Wu . \"The nurture of heaven and earth is integral, \" said Ghostles s Hsŭ . \"Someone who climbs high should not think that he i s esteemed ; someone who dwells low should not think that he i s debased .

Dissipation is a disease, therefore I console yo u because of it . Why are you, my lord, particularly prey to thi s disease? \" \" I have long wished to see you, sir,\" said Marquis Wu . \" I wish to love the people and through righteousness to halt war . Will that suffice ? \" No,\" said Ghostless Hsii . \" Loving the people is the sourc e of harming the people ; halting war through righteousness is th e root that produces war . If you act on these premises, my lord, yo u are unlikely to accomplish your aims . The intentional effort t o accomplish something fine is a poor device for doing so . Thoug h you may act through humanity and righteousness, my lord, it i s tantamount to hypocrisy . For just as surely as form produce s form, accomplishment yields vaingloriousness and deviatio n produces external combativeness . You must not amass forma- tions of troops amidst your elegant watchtowers, my lord, an d you must not have infantry and cavalry in the sequestere d sanctuaries of your palace . Do not harbor contrariness in you r achievements ; do not gain victory over others through cleverness ; do not gain victory over others through scheming ; do not gai n victory over others through battle . If I kill another's nobles an d people, if I incorporate his territory to nourish my self and m y spirit, one does not know who the better person is in such a battle and wherein the victory lies . If you feel compelled to d o something, cultivate the sincerity in your breast in order t o respond to the circumstances of heaven and earth without con- flict .

When ordinary people have employment fro m morning till evening they are encouraged ; when the various type s of artisans are skilled with their tools and machines they flour- ish . If their wealth and property do not accumulate, the greed y are worried ; if their power and influence do not amass, th e boastful are sad . Such adherents of influence and material thing s joy in transformation . If they encounter a moment when there i s use for them, they cannot but act . They all follow along with th e times and change along with things . They race their physica l forms and their natures, sinking them under the myriad things , without ever turning back their whole life . How sad! 24 3 5 Master Chuang said, \"If an archer hits the target without takin g aim in advance and we declare that he is a skilled archer, then al l under heaven would be Yis . Is that a permissible statement? \" \"Yes ;\" said Master Hui . \" Given that there is no publicly recognized conception o f what is right for all under heaven, \" said Master Chuang, \"an d that each individual takes as right what she considers right, the n all under heaven must be Yaos . Is that a permissible statement? \" \" Yes, \" said Master Hui . \"Well, then, \" said Master Chuang, \"there are the four school s of the Confucians, the Mohists, the Yangists, and the Pingists .

Regarding things, he take s pleasure together with them . Regarding people, he enjoys com- municating things with them, but protects himself while doin g so . Therefore, while he may not speak, he enables men to imbib e harmony . He stands side by side with other men and causes the m to be transformed, as would be suitable for a parent and child .

Rulers are excessive i n the things they want done and rebuke those who are unaware o f them . They create great difficulties and condemn those who dar e not cope with them .

Now tha t you are at leisure, I beg to ask about my faults . \" The Old Master said , \" You have a superciliou s And haughty look ; Who would dwell with you ? ` The greatest whiteness seems grimy , The fullest integrity seems insufficient : \" Sir Sunny Dweller abruptly changed countenance and said , \" Respectfully I hear your commands .\" 28 3 When he first arrived at the lodge, the people there came ou t to welcome him . The master of the house brought him a mat an d the wife brought him a towel and comb . The people in the lodg e left their places at the mat and those who were warming them - selves by the fire left their places at the stove . When he returne d from his interview with the Old Master, the people in the lodg e competed with him for places at the mat ."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"2 8 5 2 8 ABDICATING KINGSHI P The best ruler is he who does not covet rulership—the people will follow hi m anywhere . The truly wise man, on the other hand, would not accept rulership o r wealth and honor under any circumstances—poverty is a natural state o f affairs for him . 1 Yao wished to abdicate his rulership of all under heaven to Hs ŭ Yu, but Hsŭ Yu would not accept it . He then tried to abdicate t o Sir Township Branch Father, but Sir Township Branch Fathe r said, \"It would be possible to make me the son of heaven . However, it so happens that I am suffering the illness of melan- cholia . While I am trying to cure it, I have no spare time t o govern all under heaven . \" Now, the rulership of all under heave n is of ultimate importance, but he would not accept it for fea r that it would harm his life . How much less would he let othe r things harm him! Only one who does not wish to take on th e rulership of all under heaven may be entrusted with the rulershi p of all under heaven . Shun wished to abdicate the rulership of all under heaven to Sir Township Branch Uncle, but Sir Township Branch Uncl e said, \" It so happens that I am suffering from the illness o f melancholia . While I am trying to cure it, I have no spare time t o govern all under heaven .\" Therefore, although the rulership of al l under heaven is a great instrument, he would not exchange hi s life for it . This shows wherein one who possesses the Way differ s from common men . Shun wished to abdicate the rulership of all under heave n to Goodroll, but Goodroll said, \"I stand in the middle o f universal space and time . In winter I wear skins and furs ; i n summer I wear clothes made from the fibers of arrowroo t hemp . In spring I plow and plant, my physical form ready fo r the laborious toil ; in autumn I gather in the harvest, my bod y ready for the rest and sustenance . When the sun comes up I work ; when the sun sets I cease . I roam through heaven an d earth and satisfy myself with the thoughts in my mind . Wh y would I want to take on the rulership of all under heaven? Ho w sad, sir, that you do not understand me! \" Thereupon, h e refused to accept the offer . So he left and entered into the dee p mountains, no one knew where . Shun wished to abdicate the rulership of all under heaven t o his friend, the farmer of Stone Door, but the farmer of Ston e Door said, \"As a person, your excellency, you're all contorte d from your striving . You ' re someone who trusts his strength . \" Believing that Shun's integrity had not reached the ultimate, h e loaded his belongings on his back and on his wife's head and , leading his son by the hand, went off to sea, never to return fo r the rest of his life . 2 When the Great King Pater Tan was dwelling in Pin, the Di k people attacked him . He presented them with skins and silks, bu t they would not accept them . He presented them with dogs an d horses, but they would not accept them . He presented them with"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"2 8 6 pearls and jade, but they would not accept them . What the Di k people sought was his territory . The Great King Pater Tan said, \" To dwell with people ' s older brothers and cause their younger brothers to be killed, t o dwell with people's fathers and cause their sons to be killed — this I cannot bear . I urge all of you, my children, to remain wher e you are . What difference is there in being my subjects or in bein g subjects of the Dik people? And I have heard that a ruler shoul d not employ what he uses for nourishment to harm those who m he nourishes .\" Thus taking his staff and riding-whip, he wen t away . But the people followed him in an unbroken line, where - upon he reestablished his state at the base of Mount Ch'i . We may say that the Great King Pater Tan was able t o respect life . A person who is able to respect life, though he b e honored and wealthy, would not injure his person on account o f what nourishes him, and though he be poor and lowly, would no t burden his physical being on account of what profits him . Th e people of the present age who occupy high offices and who hol d honorable titles all look seriously upon the prospect of losin g them, but when they see a possibility of profit, they make light o f the risk to their persons . Are they not deluded indeed ? 3 In three successive generations, the people of Viet assassinate d their ruler . Troubled by this, Prince Sou fled to the Cinnaba r Caves, leaving the state of Viet without a ruler . The peopl e searched for Prince Sou but could not find him, till finally the y tracked him to the Cinnabar Caves . Prince Sou was unwilling t o come out, but they smoked him out with mugwort and made hi m ride in the royal chariot . As Prince Sou held on to the straps t o mount the chariot, he looked up to heaven and cried out, \" A ruler ! Oh, to be a ruler! Couldn't I alone have been spared from this? \" Prince Sou did not dislike being ruler ; he disliked the troubles in- herent in being ruler . We may say that such a person as Prince Sou 28 7 would not injure life on account of the state, and this was precisel y why the people of Viet wanted to get him to be their ruler . 4 Han and Wei were competing with each other over some lan d that had been invaded . Sir Master Hua went to see Marqui s Chaohsi who had a mournful look . Sir Master Hua said, \" Supposing, my lord, that all unde r heaven were to sign an agreement before you stating that `Shoul d the left hand seize it, the right hand will be disabled ; should th e right hand seize it, the left hand will be disabled . Yet he wh o seizes it will certainly gain all under heaven : Would you seize it ? \" \" I would not seize it,\" said Marquis Chaohsi . \"Very good! \" said Sir Master Hua . \"Judging from this, you r two arms are more important than all under heaven, but you r person is even more important than your two arms . Han is fa r less significant than all under heaven, but what you are compet- ing over now is far less significant than Han . Why, my lord, mus t you worry your person and injure your life by fretting ove r something you can't get? \" \"Excellent!\" said Marquis Hsi . \"Many are those who hav e instructed me, but I have never heard this sort of advice . \" Sir Master Hua may be said to have known what wa s insignificant and what was important . 5 The Lord of Lu, hearing that Yen Ho was a person who ha d attained the Way, dispatched a man to go before him with gifts . Yen Ho was waiting by a rustic village gate, wearing hempe n clothing and feeding a cow by himself . When the messenger o f the Lord of Lu arrived, Yen Ho himself received the man . \"Is this Yen Ho's house?\" asked the messenger . \" It is Ho's house, \" answered Yen Ho ."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"2 8 8 As the messenger was presenting the gifts, Yen Ho re- sponded by saying, \"I'm afraid that you heard incorrectly an d that the one who sent you with the presents will blame you . Yo u had better check . \" The messenger returned and, having checked over the mat - ter, came back again to seek Yen Ho but could not find him . Thus does someone like Yen Ho truly dislike wealth and honor . Therefore it is said , \"The truth of the Wa y Is for governing the person . Its remnant s Are for managing the state and family . Its scrap s Are for governing all under heaven .\" 28 9 of Cheng, saying, \"I believe that Lieh YU k ' ou is a gentleman wh o possesses the Way, yet he dwells poverty stricken in your honor ' s state . Could it be that your honor does not like such gentlemen? \" Tzuyang of Cheng immediately ordered an official to send hi m some grain . When Sir Master Lieh saw the messenger, he bowe d twice but declined the grain . After the messenger left, Sir Master Lieh went inside . Beat- ing her breast, his wife said to him with resentment, \"I have hear d that the wife and children of one who possesses the Way all enjo y peaceful pleasure, but now we have a starved look . His hono r recognized his error and sent you some food, but you, sir, woul d not accept it . Could we be so ill-fated? \" \" His honor himself does not know me,\" Sir Master Lieh sai d to her with a laugh . \"He sent me the grain because of wha t someone told him . Ultimately, he may also hold me a crimina l because of what someone tells him . That's why I did not accep t it . Judging from this, the achievements of emperors and kings ar e the leftover affairs of the sages, not that which fulfills the perso n or nourishes life . Most of the worldly gentlemen of toda y endanger their persons and abandon life in their greed for things . Is this not sad ? Whenever the sage makes a movement, he is certain t o examine what his purpose is and what he is doing . If now , however, we suppose that there were a man who shot at a sparro w a thousand yards away with the pearl of the Marquis of Sui, th e world would certainly laugh at him . Why is this? It is becaus e what he uses is important and what he wants is insignificant . And is not life much more important than the pearl of th e Marquis of Sui? 6 Sir Master Lieh was poverty stricken and his countenance had a starved look . A visitor spoke of this to Tzuyang, prime minister In the end, the people actually did riot and killed Tzuyang . 7 When King Chao of Ch'u lost his kingdom, the sheep butche r Happy followed the king in his flight . When King Chao re - turned to his kingdom and was going to reward those who ha d followed him, he came to sheep butcher Happy, who said , \" When our great king lost his kingdom, I lost my sheep butch- ery . When he returned to his kingdom, I likewise returned to m y sheep butchery . His subject ' s tides and emoluments have alread y been restored, so why should he reward me any further? \" \"Force it upon him! \" said the king . \" The great king's loss of his kingdom was not due to an y crime of mine,\" said sheep butcher Happy, \" therefore I woul d not presume to submit to punishment for that . The great king' s return to his kingdom was not due to any achievement of mine , therefore I would not presume to receive a reward for that .\""},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"2 9 0 \"Admit him to my presence! \" said the king . \"The laws of the kingdom of Ch'u, \" said sheep butche r Happy, \"require that one be admitted to the presence of the kin g only upon the receipt of a heavy reward for great achievement . Now, my knowledge was insufficient to preserve the kingdo m and my courage was insufficient to kill the invaders . Whet' th e armies of Ngwa entered Ying, fearing the difficulties, I ran awa y from the invaders . I did not follow our great king on purpose . Now, our great king wishes to abrogate the law and rescind th e regulations by admitting me into his presence . This is not what I would want to have heard about me everywhere under heaven : ' \"Sheep butcher Happy occupies a lowly position, \" said th e king to his minister of war, Tzuchi, \"but his display of righteous- ness is very high . You may extend to him on my behalf th e position of one of the three banners : ' \"I know that the position of 'three banners ' is more honor - able than a sheep butcher's stall ;\" said sheep butcher Happy, \" an d that an emolument of ten thousand bushels would make m e wealthier than the profits from my sheep butchery . Yet, out o f greed for titles and emoluments, how could I give my ruler a name for reckless bestowal? I would not presume to receive the m but would rather return to the stall of my sheep butchery : ' Accordingly, he refused to accept the king's rewards . 8 When Yuan Hsien was dwelling in Lu, the walls of his hous e were only a few yards around . It was thatched with live grass ; ha d a thornwood door that was incomplete, a mulberry branch for a door-pivot, and bottomless earthen jars for windows ; the tw o rooms were separated by a serge cloth . It leaked above and wa s damp below, but there he sat squarely, strumming and singing . Tzukung, wearing a purple inner garment and a white robe , went to see Yuan Hsien riding in a carriage drawn by larg e horses, the top of which was so high that it would not fit into the 29 1 alley . Yŭan Hsien, wearing a cap of mulberry bark and slipper s tied together with string, and supporting himself on a chenopo d cane, went to answer the door . \" Gracious!\" said Tzukung . \" What distress are you sufferin g from, sir? \" \"I have heard, \" responded Yuan Hsien, \" that to be withou t property is called poverty and that inability to put one ' s learnin g into practice is called distress . Now, I may be poor, but I'm no t in distress . \" Tzukung shrank back with an embarrassed look . \" To strive for worldly approbation in one's practice ; ' sai d Yuan Hsien with a laugh, \"to form cliquish friendships, t o pursue learning for the sake of impressing others, to teach for th e sake of one ' s own aggrandizement, to cloak oneself in humane- ness and righteousness, and to flaunt one's chariots and horses — these are not what I, Hsien, can bear to do! \" 9 When Master Tseng was dwelling in Wey, he wore a rob e quilted with hemp whose outer layer was missing . His face wa s swollen and inflamed, his hands and feet were callused . H e would go three days without lighting a fire and ten year s without having any clothes made . If he tried to put his cap o n straight, the throatband would break ; when he tugged at hi s lapels, his elbows would be revealed ; and when he put on hi s shoes, the heels would split . His shoes tied on with string, h e would shuffle along singing the \"Lauds of Shang . \" The soun d of his voice filled heaven and earth, as though it came from a bronze bell or a stone chime . The son of heaven could not ge t him to be a minister, the feudal lords could not get him to b e their friend . Thus, he who nourishes his determination forget s about his physical form, he who nourishes his physical for m forgets about profit, and he who applies himself to the Wa y forgets about mind ."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"2 9 2 1 0 \" Come here, Hui, \" said Confucius to Yen Hui . \"Your family i s poor and your dwelling is lowly .

Strumming my lute is sufficien t for entertaining myself and your doctrines which I study ar e sufficient for enjoying myself .

What's to be done? \" \"Emphasize life,\" said Master Chan . \"If you emphasize life , then you will look upon profit as insignificant . \" 'Although I know this,\" said Prince Mou of Chungshan, \" I have not been able to conquer myself \" \"If you cannot conquer yourself, then follow your inclina- tions . \" \"Wouldn ' t that be an offense against the spirit? \" \"If you cannot conquer yourself and force yourself not t o follow your inclinations, this is called `double injury : A perso n who is doubly injured will not be classed among the long-lived . \" 29 3 Mou of Wei was the prince of a state with ten thousan d chariots . For him to seek reclusion amid crags and caves was mor e difficult than it would have been for a common scholar . Althoug h he had not attained the Way, we may say that he had an idea of it . 1 2 When Confucius was isolated between Ch'en and Ts'ai, he ha d no cooked food to eat for seven days, but only some chenopo d soup without any rice mixed in . His face looked very exhausted , but he still kept strumming and singing in his room . Yen Hu i was outside picking vegetables, while Tzulu and Tzukung, wh o were talking together, said to him, \"Our master was twice drive n out of Lu, had his traces obliterated in Wey, had a tree he wa s resting under chopped down in Sung, was impoverished in th e capitals of the old Shang duchy and the Chou kingdom, and i s besieged in the area between Ch'en and Ts'ai . If someone were t o kill our master, he would be guiltless, and there is no prohibitio n against holding him prisoner . And yet he keeps strumming hi s lute and singing without a break in the sound . Can a superio r man be so shameless as this? \" Having nothing with which to respond to them, Yen Hu i went in and reported to Confucius what they had said . Con- fucius pushed his lute aside and said with a deep sigh, \"Tzul u and Tzukung are petty men . Summon them to come here and I'l l speak to them . \" Tzulu and Tzukung entered . \"It may be said that, in this sor t of situation, you are really isolated! \" said Tzulu . \" What are you talking about? \" said Confucius . \" When th e superior man communicates with the Way, it is called ' communi- cation : When he is isolated from the Way, it is called ` isolation : Now, I embrace the way of humaneness and righteousness t o encounter the troubles of a disordered age .

Tzukung said, \"I did not know heaven ' s height nor earth' s depth! \" The ancients who attained the Way were joyful both in isola- tion and in communication, but what made them joyful was no t the isolation nor the communication . When the Way is attaine d in this fashion, isolation and communication are as the sequenc e of winter cold and summer heat, of wind and rain . Therefore , Hsu Yu found pleasure north of the Ying River and the Earl o f Kung attained his ambition on the top of Mount Kung . 1 3 Shun wished to abdicate the rulership of all under heaven to hi s friend, Northerner Nonprefer, who said, \"What a strange ma n the ruler is! When he was dwelling among his channeled fields , he aspired to wander at the gate of Yao . But it's not only this . Now he wants to sully me with his disgraceful conduct . I woul d be ashamed to see him .\" Whereupon he threw himself into th e watery depths of Ch'ingling . 1 4 When T'ang was about to attack Chieh, he consulted wit h Follow Transform, who said, \" It ' s none of my business . \" \" Whom may I consult? \" asked T ' ang . \"I don't know . \" T ' ang then consulted with Oblivious to Glory, who said , \"It ' s none of my business .\" 29 5 \"Whom may I consult?\" asked T ' ang . \" I don't know . \" \"How about Yi Yin?\" asked T ' ang . \" He has a powerful ability to endure infamy . I don ' t kno w anything else about him . \" Thereupon T ' ang consulted with Yi Yin, attacked Chieh , and subdued him, after which he wished to abdicate to Follo w Transform, who declined the offer, saying, \" When your majest y was about to attack Chieh and consulted with me, you must hav e thought I was a brigand .

T'ang then wished to abdicate in favor of Oblivious t o Glory, saying, \"He who is wise planned it ; he who is valian t carried it out ; he who is humane should occupy it—that was th e way of antiquity . Why, sir, do you not take the position? \" Oblivious to Glory declined, saying, \"To depose one's sover- eign is to be unrighteous ; to kill the people is to be inhumane .

The two men looked at each other and laughed, saying, \"Ha ! How strange! This is not what we would call the Way . Of old , when the Divine Farmer possessed all under heaven, he sacrifice d at the proper seasons and with the utmost reverence, but did no t pray for blessings from the gods .

He enjoyed administering for the sake o f administering ; he enjoyed governing for the sake of governing .

An elaboration of a theme from Chapter 10, it is a n incredibly powerful denunciation of Confucius by a brigand . The remainder o f the chapter consists of censures against wealth and power . The wise man eschew s fame and gain, tending instead to his spiritual equanimity . 1 Confucius was a friend of Underwillow Chi, who had a younge r brother named Robber Footpad . Robber Footpad had nin e thousand troops who followed him and who marched at wil l everywhere under heaven, encroaching violently upon the feuda l lords . They bore through walls and wrenched off doors, drov e off people ' s cattle and horses, and carried away people ' s wive s and daughters . In their greed for gain, they forgot their kin , disregarded their parents and brethren, and did not sacrifice t o their ancestors . Wherever they passed through a region, th e people in the bigger states guarded their city walls, while those i n the smaller states entered their fortifications . Myriads of peopl e suffered because of them . \" Those who are fathers ;\" said Confucius to Underwillo w Chi, \" should certainly be able to appeal to their sons, and thos e who are older brothers should certainly be able to instruct thei r younger brothers . If fathers cannot appeal to their sons an d older brothers cannot instruct their younger brothers, there is n o honor in the relationship between father and son, between olde r brother and younger brother . Now, sir, you are a nobleman o f ability in this age and your younger brother is Robber Footpad . He harms all under heaven, yet you cannot instruct him . I mus t admit, sir, that I am embarrassed for you . Let me go speak to hi m for you . \" \" Sir, \" said Underwillow Chi, \"you say that those who ar e fathers should certainly be able to appeal to their sons, and thos e who are older brothers should certainly be able to instruct thei r younger brothers . But if sons will not listen to the appeals o f their fathers and younger brothers will not accept the instruc- tions of their older brothers, even though one may have you r powers of disputation, sir, what can be done about it? What ' s more, Footpad is a person whose mind is like a bubbling sprin g and whose thoughts are like a whirlwind . He is strong enough t o repel his enemies and his powers of disputation are sufficient t o gloss over his wrongs . If you go along with his mind he's happy , but if you go against his mind he'll get angry . He readily abuse s others when he speaks . You must not go to him, sir . \" Confucius did not heed his advice . With Yen Hui as hi s charioteer and Tzukung on his right, he went to see Robbe r Footpad, who was just then resting his troops to the south o f Mount T ' ai and eating a dinner of hashed human liver . Con- fucius got down from his carriage and went forward . Upo n seeing the officer in charge of receiving visitors, he said, \" I , Hillock K ' ung of Lu, have heard of the general's lofty righteous- ness .\" Respectfully, he bowed twice to the officer .

Go back where you came from quickly! Otherwise, I'l l supplement my lunch with your liver!' \" Confucius sent in another communication, saying, \" I hav e received the favor of your brother Chi and hope that I shall b e permitted to step beneath your curtain? ' After the officer in charge of receiving visitors had commu- nicated this message, Robber Footpad said, \"Have him com e before me! \" Confucius hurried forward but, declining to be seated on a mat, hastily turned back and then bowed twice to Robbe r Footpad . This greatly angered Robber Footpad who stretche d out both his legs, placed his hand on his sword, and said wit h glaring eyes and a growl like a nursing tigress, \"Come before me , Hillock! If what you say goes along with my thoughts you wil l live, but if it goes against what's in my mind you will die . \" \"I have heard, \" said Confucius, \"that all under heaven hav e three virtues . To grow up tall and big, to be peerlessly handsome . and good, to please everyone who sees him, be they young or old , honored or lowly—this is to have superior virtue . To hav e knowledge that ties together heaven and earth, to be able t o dispute on all manner of things—this is to have middling virtue . To be brave and bold, decisive and daring, to gather in multi- tudes and lead on troops—this is to have inferior virtue . Who - 30 1 ever has one of these virtues is capable of facing south an d styling himself ` solitary : Now you, general, are someone wh o combines all three . Your person is eight feet two inches tall, you r face is radiant, your lips are like shining cinnabar, your teeth ar e like even cowry shells, your voice is tuned to the Yellow Bell, an d yet you are named Robber Footpad . I must admit, general, that I am ashamed for you and cannot approve of this . \"If you are of a mind to listen to me, general, permit me t o go south to Ngwa and Viet as your ambassador, to go north t o Ch'i and Lu as your ambassador, to go east to Sung and Wey a s your ambassador, to go west to Chin and Ch'u as your ambas- sador . I will have them build a great city of several hundre d tricents for you, general, will have them establish an appanage o f several hundred thousand households for you, and will hav e them respect you, general, as a feudal lord . You will begin ane w with all under heaven, will disband your troops and demobiliz e your soldiers, will collect and nourish your brothers, and wil l reverently sacrifice to your ancestors . This would be the conduc t of a sage and a nobleman of ability and what all under heave n wish for . Greatly angered, Robber Footpad said, \"Come before me , Hillock! Those who reprimand with gain and remonstrate wit h words may all be said to be stupid and crude commoners .

Th e people knew their mothers but not their fathers . They live d together with elk and deer . They plowed so they would hav e food ; they wove so they would have clothes . They had no min d to harm one another . This is the fullness of ultimate virtue . Th e Yellow Emperor, however, could not maximize his virtue . H e fought with Ch'ihyu in the wilds of Cholu and the blood flowe d for a hundred tricents . When Yao and Shun arose, they estab- lished their crowd of ministers . T'ang banished his sovereign an d King Wu killed Chow . Ever after this, the strong oppressed th e weak and the many tyrannized the few . Ever since T ' ang and Wu , they have all been a bunch who bring disorder to the people . \" Now you, sir, cultivate the way of Wen and Wu ; yo u manipulate the disputations of all under heaven to instruct late r ages . With your ample robe and broad belt, your dissemblin g words and fraudulent conduct, you confuse and delude th e sovereigns of all under heaven, wishing thereby to seek wealt h and honor . There are no greater robbers than you, sir . Why don' t all under heaven call you Robber Hillock instead of calling m e Robber Footpad? With your sweet phrases, you persuaded Tzul u to become a follower of yours . You had him get rid of his peake d cap and remove his long sword, so as to receive your instructions . All under heaven say that Confucius can stop tyranny and 30 3 prevent wrongs . In the end, however, when Tzulu wished to kil l the Lord of Wey, the affair miscarried and they displayed hi s pickled corpse on the east gate of Wey . This shows the imperfec- tion of your teaching, sir . \" Do you call yourself a nobleman of ability and a sage? Bu t you were twice driven out of Lu, had your traces obliterated i n Wey, were isolated in Ch'i, and were besieged in the area of C h ' e n and Ts ' ai, leaving no place under heaven where your perso n might be accommodated . It was your instructions that brough t upon Tzulu this calamity of being pickled . You, as superior, ca n do nothing for your own person, and your subordinates can d o nothing for others . Is your way worth honoring, sir ? \" There is no one whom the world esteems as much as th e Yellow Emperor, but even the Yellow Emperor was unable t o perfect his virtue and fought in the wilds of Cholu, causin g blood to flow for a hundred tricents . Yao was unkind, Shun wa s unfilial, Yŭ was partially withered, T ' ang banished his sovereign , and King Wu attacked Chow . . . . These are the six men who m the world esteems, but if we discuss them thoroughly, they wer e all deluded by gain and forcefully opposed their own emotion s and natures . Their conduct is thus quite shameful . \" Those whom the world considers worthy noblemen includ e Poyi and Shuch ' i . Poyi and Shuch ' i took leave of the Lord o f Kuchu and starved to death at Shouyang Mountain, their bone s and flesh remaining unburied . Pao Chiao glamorized his conduc t and criticized the world, but he died with his arms wrappe d around a tree . When Shent ' u Ti's criticisms went unheeded, h e threw himself into the river carrying a stone on his back and wa s eaten by fishes and turtles . Chieh Tzut'ui, being of utmos t loyalty, cut flesh from his own thigh to feed Duke Wen . Whe n Duke Wen later turned his back on him, Tzut'ui became angr y and went away, wrapping his arms around a tree and being burn t to death .

The water rose, but he woul d not leave, and he died with his arms wrapped around a pillar of"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"3 0 4 the bridge . These six men were no different from a dog whos e carcass is hung outside the door to ward off evil spirits, a pig tha t is sacrificed to the god of the river, or a starved beggar who ha s frozen to death in a ditch but still holds his alms gourd . They al l put a premium on fame and despised death, paying no regard t o the fundamental nourishment of their allotted life span . \" There are none whom the world considers such loyal minis- ters as Prince Pikan and Wu Tzuhsŭ . Yet Tzuhsŭ's body was cas t into the Yangtze River and Pikan ' s heart was cut open . Th e world considered these two men loyal ministers, but in the en d they were laughed at by all under heaven . Judging from the abov e cases, down to Tzuhsŭ and Pikan, none are worth honoring . \"As for what you're trying to persuade me with, if you tell m e about the affairs of ghosts, that's something I can't know any - thing about ; if you tell me about the affairs of men, it's no mor e than this—what I've already heard about and know . \" Now, sir, I shall tell you about the human condition . Th e eyes desire to see colors ; the ears desire to hear sounds ; th e mouth desires to taste flavors ; the will and vital breath desir e fulfillment . Man's highest longevity is a hundred years, mediu m longevity is eighty, and lowest longevity is sixty . If we exclud e illness, death, and dread, the days that remain on which we ca n open our mouths to laugh amount to no more than four or fiv e in a month . Heaven and earth are timeless, but the death of ma n is fixed in time . If we take an entity that is fixed in time an d entrust it to timelessness, its brevity will be no different fro m that of Piebald Thoroughbred passing a crack in a wall . Non e who are unable to gratify their volition and to nourish thei r allotted life span are in communication with the Way . \" Everything you have spoken, Hillock, is what I have, re- jected . Go back immediately . Speak no more! Your way is a frenzied and frantic affair that is deceitful, clever, vain, an d hypocritical—not what can be used to fulfill the truth . It's no t worth discussing!\" 30 5 Confucius bowed twice and hurried away . He went out th e door and mounted his carriage . Three times the reins fell fro m his grasp . His eyes were so blurred that he couldn ' t see anythin g and his complexion was like dead ashes . Leaning against th e crossbar with head bowed, he could scarcely catch his breath . When he returned to Lu, he happened to meet Underwillow Ch i outside the east gate . \" Regrettably,\" said Underwillow Chi, \" I haven't seen you for the last few days and your carriage an d horses look as though you've been traveling . Could it be that yo u went off to see Footpad? \" Confucius looked up to heaven and said with a sigh, \"Yes . \" \"Might it be that Footpad went against your ideas as I predicted he would? \" asked Underwillow Chi . \"Yes ;\" said Confucius . \" I may be said to be one who cauter- izes himself when he's not even sick . I ran off hastily to grab th e tiger by his head and tweak his whiskers, and I narrowly escape d his mouth .\" 2 Tzuchang asked Fully Ill-Gotten, \" Why don't you behave virtu- ously? If you don ' t behave virtuously, you won't be trusted ; i f you're not trusted, you won ' t be appointed to office ; and if you'r e not appointed to office, you will not realize any gain . Therefore , if you judge the matter on the basis of fame or estimate it on th e basis of gain, righteousness is truly the right course . But if yo u reject fame and gain and reflect on the matter in your mind, yo u will find that the gentleman ' s virtuous behavior cannot for a da y fail to be without righteousness . \" \"Those who are without shame become wealthy, \" said Full y Ill-Gotten, \"and those who are much trusted become prominent . The greatest fame and gain would seem to lie in shamelessnes s and trust . Therefore, if you judge the matter on the basis of fam e or estimate it on the basis of gain, trust is truly the right course ."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"3 0 6 But if you reject fame and gain and reflect on the matter in you r mind, you will find that the gentleman's virtuous behavior is t o embrace heaven . ' \"Long ago,\" said Tzuchang, \" Chieh and Chow were honore d as sons of heaven, and they possessed the wealth of all unde r heaven . Now, if we were to say to a pilferer, ' Your conduct is lik e that of Chieh and Chow , ' he would blush and, in his heart, woul d not submit to such an accusation . Thus they are despised even b y petty men . Confucius and Mo Ti were poverty-stricken com- moners, but if we were now to say to a prime minister, ' You r conduct is like that of Confucius and Mo Ti, ' he would chang e countenance in embarrassment, declaring that he is not worth y of such a comparison . Thus they are sincerely honored b y noblemen . Therefore, though one may be powerful as the son o f heaven, he will not necessarily be honored ; though one may b e poverty stricken as a commoner, he will not necessarily be de- spised . The distinction between honor and contempt lies in th e quality of one ' s conduct : ' \" Small robbers are arrested ;\" said Fully Ill-Gotten, \"an d great robbers become feudal lords . It is within the gates of th e feudal lords that the righteous nobleman is preserved . Of old , Hsiaopo, who was Duke Huan, killed his older brother and too k in his sister-in-law as a wife, yet Kuan Chung served as hi s minister ; Viscount Fieldborn, Ch ' ang, murdered his ruler an d usurped the state, yet Confucius accepted presents from him . I n their discussions Kuan Chung and Confucius despised them, bu t in their conduct they were subservient to them . Thus the emo- tions stemming from their words and their conduct were in a fractious war within their breasts . Is this not perverse? Therefore , it is said in a book, ' Who is good? Who is bad? He who i s successful takes the headmost ; he who is unsuccessful takes th e hindmost : \" \" If you do not behave virtuously , \" said Tzuchang, \" there wil l be no distinction between distant and close relatives, there wil l be no usages for the honored and the despised, there will be no 30 7 order for the old and the young . Then how will you distinguis h among the five relationships and the six positions? \" \"Yao killed his eldest son,\" said Fully Ill-Gotten, \" and Shu n exiled his half-brother—did they maintain a distinction be- tween distant and dose relatives? T ' ang banished Chieh an d King Wu killed Chow—did they maintain the usages for th e honored and the despised? Prince Junior assumed the lega l succession and the Duke of Chou killed his elder brothers—di d they maintain the order between young and old? Given th e specious phraseology of the Confucian literati and the universa l love of the Mohists, would there be a distinction among the fiv e relationships and the six positions ? \"Moreover, sir, your goal is fame and my goal is gain . Th e actualities of fame and gain are not in accord with principle an d are not illuminated by the Way . The other day, I put ou r argument before Bondless, who said, ' The petty man sacrifice s himself for property ; the superior man sacrifices himself fo r fame . While the distortion of their attributes and the change o f their nature may be different, they are identical in that they en d up by rejecting what they should be doing and sacrificing them - selves for what they should not be doing . Therefore, it is said , \" Do not be a petty man , Turn and sacrifice yourself for heaven ; Do not be a superior man , Follow the principles of heaven .

People turn to those who are wealthy . Having turne d to them, they are subservient and, being subservient, they hono r them . To be honored by the subservient is the way to long life , rest for the body, and a joyous intent . Now, sir, do you alone no t aspire to this because your knowledge is insufficient? Or may i t be that you know about it but that you don't have the strength t o be able to carry it out? Do you purposely push for rectitude an d never forget it?\" 30 9 \"Now, let us suppose,\" said Know Harmony, \"that there i s this sort of man who believes that, in comparison with his ow n contemporaries and his own compatriots, he is a nobleman wh o has broken with vulgarity and transcended the world . But in hi s examination of the ancient and the contemporary, in his distin- guishing between right and wrong, he is totally without a con - trolling rectitude and evolves along with the vulgarity of his age . He gets rid of what is most important and he rejects what i s most respected in order to do what he does . Is this not far fro m `the way to long life, rest for the body, and a joyous intent' whic h has been discussed? Upon grievous anxiety and tranquil repose , he reflects not in his body ; upon timorous fear and gleefu l happiness, he reflects not in his mind . He knows that he doe s what he does but does not know why he does it . For this reason , though he may be honored as the son of heaven and have th e wealth of all under heaven, he will not be free from calamities . \" \"Wealth,\" said Insufficient, \"is in every respect beneficial t o man . The exhaustive appreciation of beauty and the thoroug h exercise of power are not what the ultimate man can grasp no r what the worthy can reach . By commandeering the brave strengt h of others, one may assume majestic might ; by employing the wis e counsels of others, one may assume intelligent discrimination ; b y borrowing the virtues of others, one may assume worthy good- ness . Then, even though he does not possess the state, a man wil l be as awe-inspiring as the ruler-father . Furthermore, the effect o f sound, color, flavors, authority, and power upon man is such tha t the mind enjoys them without having to learn from others an d the body takes pleasure in them without having to emulat e others . Desires, dislikes, aversions, and predilections, indeed, d o not require a teacher—this is the nature of man . Even though al l under heaven may contradict me, who can dismiss these traits? \" \"The action of the wise man, \" said Know Harmony, \"i s intentionally initiated on behalf of the hundred clans .

For him, the reality of incorruption and gree d is not compelled by externals, but by turning inward to reflect o n his own measure . He may wield the power of the son of heaven , but he would not be arrogant to others on account of his honor ; he may have the wealth of all under heaven, but he would not b e contemptuous of others on account of his property .

By maintaining their life with restricted sustenance, they ar e merely staving off death through prolonged illness and length y crisis . \" Equanimity, \" said Know Harmony, \"is blessedness, an d having an excess is harmful . It is so with all things, but partic- ularly with property . Now, the ears of the wealthy man ar e entranced by the sounds of bells, drums, pipes, and flutes, an d his mouth is sated with the flavors of domesticated animal flesh , thick wines, and liqueurs . Consequently, his thoughts are stimu- lated so he ignores his true enterprise—we may say that he is 31 1 disordered .

Speaking metaphorically, he defeats all of hi s formidable opponents with his razor-sharp tongue . In the process, he jolts a kin g who is addicted to swordfighting back to his senses . 1 Long ago, King Wen of Chao was fond of swords . More tha n three thousand swordsmen clustered around his gate as guests . Day and night they dueled before him . There were more than a hundred casualties a year, but he was so enamored of their bout s that he never grew weary of them . It was like this for three years , but the kingdom declined, so the other feudal lords began t o plot against Chao . Troubled by this, the heir apparent K'uei summoned hi s attendants and said, \" Whoever can persuade the king to put a stop to these swordsmen, I will reward with a thousand pieces o f gold .\" \"Master Chuang surely can, \" said the attendants . Thereupon the heir apparent sent men with a thousan d pieces of gold to offer to Master Chuang . Master Chuang woul d not accept them, but went back together with the messengers . When he saw the heir apparent he said, \" What instructions d o you have for me, heir apparent, that you should present me wit h a thousand pieces of gold? \" \"I have heard, sir,\" said the heir apparent, \" that you are a brilliant sage, so I am respectfully offering you a thousand piece s of gold as gifts for your followers . But if, sir, you do not accep t them, I wouldn ' t dare to say anything further : ' \"I have heard, \" said Master Chuang, \"that the reason yo u wish to employ me is to free the king from his passion . Suppos e that, in trying to persuade his majesty, I should go against hi s wishes on the one hand and fail to satisfy you on the other, I would be punished with death . Of what use would the gold be t o me then? Or suppose that I should succeed in persuading hi s majesty on the one hand and satisfying you on the other, wha t might I seek in the kingdom of Chao that I would not get? \" \" However, \" said the heir apparent, \" the only people who m my father, the king, will see are swordsmen . \" \"Yes,\" said Master Chuang, \"but I am skilled in wieldin g swords . \" \"However , \" said the heir apparent, \"all the swordsmen who m my father, the king, sees have disheveled hair, locks that bulge ou t from their temples, drooping caps with plain throatbands, coat s that are short in back, glaring eyes, and combative speech, all o f which delight the king . Now, sir, you will certainly go to see th e king wearing literati garb, and this is something that will cer- tainly run greatly against his liking . \" \"Allow me to make ready a swordsman ' s garb, \" said Maste r Chuang . After three days, his swordsman's garb made ready , Master Chuang went to see the heir apparent, who went togethe r with him to see the king . The king unsheathed the naked blad e of his sword and waited for him . When Master Chuang entered"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"3 1 4 the doorway to the hall, he did not rush forward, and he did no t bow when he saw the king . \" With what do you wish to instruct me,\" asked the king , \" that you would have the heir apparent introduce you? \" \" I have heard that your majesty likes swords, and therefore I have come to see you with my sword . \" \" How can your sword suppress the enemy?\" said the king . \"My sword cuts down one man every ten paces, and for a thousand tricents it doesn't pause in its march forward? ' Greatly pleased, the king said, \" There's no match for it unde r heaven! \" \" One who wields a sword, \" said Master Chuang , \" Reveals his emptiness to his opponent , Gives him an advantageous opening , Makes his move after him , Arrives before he does . I ' d like a chance to try out my skill for you : ' \"Go to your lodgings to rest, sir,\" said the king, \"and awai t my orders . I will arrange for the contest and then invite you : ' Thereupon the king tested his swordsmen for seven days, durin g which there were more than sixty casualties . He selected five o r six men and made them come to the lower part of his hal l bearing their swords, whereupon he called Master Chuang . \" To - day I shall have my men try out their swordsmanship agains t you, \" said the king . \" I have been looking forward to this for a long time,\" sai d Master Chuang . \"How long is the weapon that you ' ll be using?\" asked th e king . \" Whichever sword your subject is made to bear will be al l right . However, I have three swords that I may employ for you , oh King . Allow me to describe them first and then try them out : \" \" I would like to hear about the three swords,\" said the king . 31 5 \" There is the sword of the son of heaven, the sword of th e feudal lord, and the sword of the common man : \" \"What is the sword of the son of heaven like? \" asked th e king . \"The sword of the son of heaven has a point made o f Swallow Gorge and Stone Wall, a blade edge made of Mount Ta i in Ch'i, a spine made of Chin and Wey, a haft made of Chou an d Sung, and a pommel made of Han and Wei . It is embraced b y the four uncivilized tribes, encirded by the four seasons, an d wrapped around by the Sea of Po .

The cook served a meal around which the king circled thre e times . \" Sit down calmly and settle your spirits,\" said Maste r Chuang . \"I have already finished my presentation on the busines s of swords . \" Thenceforth, King Wen did not leave his palace for thre e months, and the swordsmen all committed suicide in thei r rooms . 3 1 AN OLD FISHERMA N A very wise old fisherman mercilessly satirizes Confucius for his officiousnes s and hypocrisy . The Taoist venerable, by contrast, concentrates on cultivating hi s true nature . Confucius is stunned by his meeting with a real sage . 1 Confucius was wandering in the forest of Black Curtains and sa t down to rest at Apricot Altar . His disciples were reading thei r books and Confucius himself was singing a song while strum- ming on his lute . He had not finished half of his canto when a n old fisherman got out of his boat and came toward them . With a gleaming white beard and eyebrows, disheveled hair, and flappin g sleeves, he walked up from the bank and stopped when h e reached the elevated land . His left hand resting on his knee an d his right hand holding his chin, he listened . When the canto wa s ended, he beckoned to Tzukung and Tzulu, both of who m responded . \"What does he do? \" asked the stranger, pointing at Con- fucius . \" He ' s the superior man of Lu, \" replied Tzulu ."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"3 1 8 The stranger asked about his clan, to which Tzulu replied , \" He belongs to the K'ung clan . \" \"And how does clansman K'ung occupy himself? \" asked th e guest . Before Tzulu responded, Tzukung replied, \"Clansman K ' un g by nature is devoted to loyalty and trust and in his perso n practices humaneness and righteousness . He embellishes rite s and music and codifies human relationships . Above, he applie s loyalty to the reigning sovereign ; below, he applies education t o the ordinary people . His aim is to benefit all under heaven . Thi s is how clansman K ' ung occupies himself \" \"Is he a ruler who has territory? \" the guest went on to ask . \" No, \" said Tzukung . \"Is he the assistant to a marquis or a king? \" \"No,\" said Tzukung . Whereupon the stranger laughed and turned to leave, sayin g as he walked, \" He may well be humane, but I am afraid he won' t be able to escape harm to his person . He taxes his mind and toil s his body, thereby endangering his true nature . Alas! How far h e has diverged from the Way! \" Tzukung returned and reported this to Confucius . Pushin g aside his lute, Confucius got up and said, \" He must be a sage! \" whereupon he went down in search of the stranger . When h e reached the edge of the marsh, the stranger was just about to pol e his boat away with an oar . Glancing back, he saw Confucius , then turned around and stood facing him . Confucius retreated , bowed twice, and went forward . \"What do you seek from me, sir? \" asked the stranger . \"A while ago, master, you made some enigmatic remarks an d then left,\" said Confucius . \"I am unworthy and do not under - stand what you said, so I venture to wait here deferentially i n hopes that I shall be so fortunate as to hear a few fine phrase s from you that, in the end, will be of help to me . \" \"Hai!\" said the stranger, \"great, indeed, is your love o f learning!\" 31 9 Confucius bowed twice, then rose and said, \"I have culti- vated learning from my youth up till today when I am sixty-nin e years old, but I never had the opportunity to hear the ultimat e teaching . Dare I not seek instruction from you in all humility? \" The guest said, \" Similar categories follow each other an d similar sounds respond to each other . Indeed, this is the principl e of heaven . Allow me to explain what I have so as to analyze wha t you are engaged in, sir . What you are engaged in, sir, are huma n affairs . When the son of heaven, the feudal lords, the gran d masters, and the common people, these four classes, correc t themselves, we have the beauty of order . But when these fou r classes leave their proper positions, there is no greater disorder . When the officials take care of their duties and the commo n people attend to their affairs, there is no room for encroachment . Therefore, barren fields, leaking rooms, insufficient food an d clothing, unpaid taxes, disharmony among wives and concubines , disarray among old and young—these are the worries of th e common people . Inability to fulfill their responsibilities, officia l business left uncared for, conduct lacking probity, subordinate s who are slipshod and lazy, absence of merit and excellence, failur e to maintain titles and allowances—these are the worries of th e grand masters . Absence of loyal ministers, state and family i n chaos, inept workers and craftsmen, lack of excellence in tribut e items, falling behind in spring and autumn audiences with th e emperor, disaccord with the son of heaven—these are the worrie s of the feudal lords . Disharmony of yin and yang, untimeliness o f winter cold and summer heat that injure all things, feudal lord s who are rebellious and who usurpingly attack each other to th e detriment of the people, rites and music unrestrained, propert y and resources exhausted, human relationships out of kilter, th e hundred clans licentiously disordered—these are the worries o f the son of heaven .

To extol and deceive in order t o bring about the ruin of others is called wickedness . Withou t choosing between good and bad, to accommodate both ambiva- lently so as to extract stealthily what one desires is called treach- ery . Without, these eight defects bring disorder to others and , within, injury to oneself . A superior man will not befriend on e who has them ; an enlightened ruler will not use him as a minister . Then there are the four so-called infirmities . To be fond o f managing great affairs, transforming and changing what has bee n constant, in order to scheme for merit and fame, is called ambi- tiousness . To monopolize knowledge and arrogate affairs, en- croaching upon what belongs to others and appropriating it fo r one's own use, is called greediness . To see one's errors withou t altering them and to hear criticisms but be all the more inured t o them is called perverseness . To approve of another when he agree s with oneself, but when he disagrees with oneself to say that he i s not good, even though he may be good, is called conceitedness . These are the four infirmities . Only if one can get rid of the eigh t defects and not exercise the four infirmities can one be taught . \" Abashed, Confucius sighed . He bowed twice, then rose an d said, \"I was twice driven out of Lu, had my traces obliterated i n Wey, had a tree I was resting under chopped down in Sung, an d was besieged in the area of Ch'u and Ts ' ai . I don ' t know wha t mistakes I made that I should have suffered these four vilifica- tions . \" 32 1 Grieved, the stranger changed countenance and said, \" Ho w very difficult it is, sir, for you to comprehend! There was a ma n who, afraid of his shadow and disliking his footprints, tried t o run away from them, but the more frequently he raised his feet th e more numerous were his footprints, and the faster he ran th e closer his shadow stayed to his person . He thought he was stil l going too slow, so he kept going faster and faster without stop - ping until his strength was exhausted and he died . He didn ' t realize that, by staying in the shade, he could eliminate his shado w and that, by staying still, he could extinguish his footprints . Ho w very stupid he was! You, sir, inquire into the sphere of humanenes s and righteousness, examine the boundary between sameness an d difference, observe the transformations of movement and still- ness, comply with measures for giving and receiving, adjust th e emotions of liking and disliking, harmonize the moments o f happiness and anger—and yet you have barely been able to escap e all these troubles . Diligently cultivate your person ; attentivel y guard your true nature ; let things return to the keeping o f others—then there will be nothing in which you will be impli- cated . But now, instead of cultivating your own person, you see k to cultivate others . Is this not paying attention to externals? \" 'Allow me to ask what you mean by 'true nature,' \" sai d Confucius, abashed . \"One's true nature, \" said the stranger, \"is the ultimate expres- sion of pure sincerity . If one is neither pure nor sincere, on e cannot move others . Therefore, he who forces himself to cry , though he may seem sad, is not really sorrowful ; he who force s himself to be angry, though he may seem stern, is not really awe - inspiring ; he who forces himself to be affectionate, though h e may smile, is not really sympathetic . True sadness, even withou t any sounds, is sorrowful ; true anger, even without any temper, i s awe-inspiring ; true affection, even without a smile, is sympa- thetic .

In loyalty and honesty , merit is primary ; in winedrinking, joy is primary ; in situations o f mourning, sorrow is primary ; in serving parents, compliance i s primary . The beauty of merit accomplished does not always leav e identical traces ; in serving parents with compliance, one does no t discuss the means ; in winedrinking for joy, one is not choos y about the utensils ; in situations of mourning with sorrow, one i s not inquisitive about the rites . The rites were devised by th e vulgar people of the world ; one's true nature is that which wa s received from heaven, so naturally it cannot be changed . There - fore, the sage models himself on heaven and honors the truth ; h e does not cling to the vulgar . The stupid do the opposite of this . They cannot model themselves on heaven but are distressed b y man . They do not know to honor the truth but dully underg o the transformations of the vulgar . Therefore they are inadequate . 'Tis pity, sir, that you were so early immersed in human hypoc- risy and heard of the great Way so late . \" Again, Confucius bowed twice, then rose and said, \"M y meeting you today is as though it were a stroke of heavenl y fortune . If, master, you would not be ashamed to include m e among the ranks of those who render service to you and to teac h me personally, I venture to see where your dwelling is so that I may be permitted to receive instructions from you and finish m y learning of the great Way . \" \"I have heard, \" said the stranger, \"that, if it is someone wit h whom you can walk along, go with him even to the wondrou s Way . But, if it is someone with whom you cannot walk along , someone who knows not the Way, take care not to go with him , and then your person will be blameless . Exert yourself, sir, for I must leave you! I must leave you!\" Whereupon he left, poling hi s boat through the green reeds . Yen Yuan turned the carriage around and Tzulu hande d Confucius the strap for mounting, but he paid no attention to it . 32 3 He waited until the ripples had subsided and was willing t o mount the carriage only after the sound of poling could n o longer be heard . Following beside the carriage, Tzulu questioned him, saying , \"Long have I had the opportunity to be your servant, but I hav e never seen you so awe-inspired by any other person you ' ve met , master . I have seen you with rulers of ten thousand chariots an d lords of a thousand chariots ; they have always shared their hall s with you and treated you as an equal, while you, master, wore a look of haughtiness . Now this old fisherman stood across fro m you leaning on his oar, and you bent at the waist like a ston e chime . When he spoke, you bowed before responding . Isn't this a bit much? Your disciples all think it strange of you, master . Ho w could the fisherman affect you like this? \" Confucius leaned against the crossbar and said with a sigh , \"It's very difficult to transform you, Yu! Yo u ' ve been immersed i n rites and righteousness for quite a while, but till this day you hav e not gotten rid of your crude, mean heart . Come nearer and I wil l tell you . If you meet an elder and are not respectful to him, that i s impolite ; if you see a worthy and do not honor him, that i s inhumane . If he were not an ultimate man, he would not be abl e to make others humble themselves and if those who humbl e themselves are insincere, they will not obtain the truth . There - fore, they would cause lasting injury to their persons . Alas! Ther e is no greater misfortune for man than to be inhumane, but yo u alone, Yu, would arrogate that to yourself . Moreover, the Way i s that whence the myriad things derive . When things of all sort s lose it they die ; when they attain it they live . In handling a n affair, if you go against it you will fail, if you accord with it yo u will succeed . Therefore, wherever the Way exists, the sage honor s it . Now, we may say that the old fisherman possesses the Way .

It closes with tw o charming sketches of the simplicity and humility of Master Chuang . 1 Lieh Yi .ik'ou was going to Ch'i but he turned back when he wa s halfway there .

When one subdues others' minds wit h one's external appearance, causing them to belittle the honored and the elderly, various troubles will ensue . The soup-sho p owner ' s particular business is to sell soup and he doesn't have a lot of excess earnings . The profit he makes is slight and th e authority he wields is little . If even they were like this, how muc h more so would a ruler of ten thousand chariots be! His perso n wearied by the state and his knowledge exhausted by affairs, h e would employ me in his affairs and have me devote myself t o achievement .

Uncle Obscur e Dimbody stood facing north with his chin propped on hi s upright staff He stood there for a while then left without sayin g a word . When the servant who received guests told Master Lie h what had happened, the latter picked up his shoes and ra n barefoot after the visitor . Catching up with him at the outer gate , he said, \"Since you have come, sir, won't you issue me a prescrip- tion? \" \" There's no point .

He had his younger brothe r study Mohism . When he, the Confucian literatus, and his ' brother, the Mohist, would have disputes, their father would tak e the side of the Mohist . After ten years, Deliberate committe d suicide . He appeared to his father in a dream, saying, \"It was I who had your son become a Mohist .

Therefore it i s said, \"All the people of this age are Deliberates .\" They thin k themselves to be right, but a person of integrity considers this t o be ignorance . How much more so would a person of the Way ! The ancients called what happened to people like Deliberat e \"the punishment of fleeing from the heavenly \" The sage seeks security in what is secure ; he does not see k security in what is insecure . The masses seek security in what i s insecure ; they do not seek security in what is secure . Master Chuang said, \" To know the Way is easy ; not to spea k of it is difficult . To know but not to speak of it is that which 32 7 pertains to heaven ; to know and to speak of it is that whic h pertains to man . The men of antiquity pertained to heaven an d not to man . 3 Dwarfy Diffuse learned how to butcher dragons from Scattere d Plus . Having depleted the family fortune of a thousand pieces o f gold, he perfected his techniques within three years, but ther e was nowhere for him to use his skill . 4 The sage considers what is necessary to be unnecessary, therefor e he has no hostility . The masses consider what is unnecessary t o be necessary, therefore they have much hostility . Therefore, th e behavior of those who go along with hostility will be demanding .

You might do so by mis - take, but now if you were to cause the people to depart from realit y and learn artifice, this is not what to show the people .

When smal l men encounter external punishment, it is metal and wood tha t interrogate them ; when they encounter internal punishment, it i s yin and yang that eat at them .

Therefore, the superior man will send a person on a distan t mission to observe his loyalty, send him on a nearby mission t o observe his respect, send him on an irksome mission to observ e his ability, question him suddenly to observe his wisdom, set a n urgent appointment for him to observe his trustworthiness , entrust him with property to observe his humaneness, warn hi m of danger to observe his steadfastness, make him drunk on win e to observe his standards, place him in mixed company to observ e his sexuality .

The wide variety o f schools active at the time is remarkable and merits close comparison with paralle l trends in Western and Indian philosophy . This chapter is surprisingly evenhanded in its treatment of the divers e philosophers it assesses . Among its more captivating portraits is that of Maste r Chuang himself, with his \"absurd expressions, extravagant words, and un- bounded phrases .\" The first place in the chapter is given to Master Mo, the mos t earnest and \" right \" thinker of the time . The final place is reserved for Maste r Chuang ' s favorite mental sparring partner, Master Hui . Confucius is beyon d the pale—hardly worth mentioning after being devastated in the rest of the book . 1 Many are those under heaven who attend to their theories an d techniques, and they all believe that nothing can be added to the"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"3 3 4 ones that they possess . But where is the so-called \" technique o f the Way\" of antiquity ? \"It is everywhere? ' \" Whence does the spirit descend? Whence does intelligenc e emerge? \" \" Sagehood has that from which it is born, kingship ha s that from which it is formed, but both find their source i n Unity? ' He who is not separated from the ancestral may be called a heavenly man ; he who is not separated from the essential ma y be called a spiritual man ; and he who is not separated from th e true may be called an ultimate man . He who takes heaven as hi s ancestor, he who takes integrity as his root, he who takes th e Way as his gate, and he who is foreshadowed by transforma- tion and evolution may be called a sage . He who takes humane- ness as kindness, he who takes righteousness as principle, h e who takes ritual as conduct, he who takes music as harmony , and he who is suffused by compassion and humaneness may b e called a superior man . To take the law as their lot ; to tak e names as their representation ; to take participation as valida- tion ; to take investigation as determination ; and to conside r counting off one, two, three, four as deciding what is right — this is how the hundred offices of government intermesh . T o take administrative affairs as their constant occupation ; to tak e the provision of food and clothing as their main task ; t o propagate, rear, and store ; to think of the young and the old , the orphaned and the widowed, so that they will all have tha t whereby they may be nourished—this is the principle of carin g for the people . How well prepared were the men of antiquity! They comple- mented spiritual intelligence, imitated heaven and earth, fostere d the myriad things, and harmonized with all under heaven . Thei r benefits reached to the hundred clans ; they were enlightened wit h regard to rudimentary regulations ; they were familiar with regard 33 5 to particular rules ; and they comprehended the six directions o f the universe and the four regions . Big and little, coarse an d fine—their operation was everywhere . Of their intelligence as i t existed in regulations and rules, much was still transmitted in th e old laws for generations by the historians . Of what existed in th e Odes, Documents, Ritual, and Music, many of the masters who wer e noblemen of Tsou and Lu or members of the official class coul d understand it . . . . Of their regulations that were scattered unde r heaven and established in the Middle Kingdom, some of th e hundred schools of learning occasionally stated and declare d them . Then there was great disorder under heaven and th e worthies and the sages no longer illuminated it . The Way an d virtue were no longer unified and, for the most part, all unde r heaven narcissistically held to one aspect of them . This may b e compared to the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth . They all have tha t which they illumine, but they are not interchangeable . Likewise , the various experts of the hundred schools all have their stron g points and those moments when they are useful . Nevertheless , they are neither comprehensive nor inclusive but scholars whos e views are partial . When they judge the beauty of heaven an d earth, analyze the principles of the myriad things, examine th e wholeness of the ancients, few can encompass the beauty o f heaven and earth or dedare the features of spiritual intelligence . For this reason, the Way of internal sagehood and externa l kingship has become obscure and unillumined, constrained an d unexpressed . But all men under heaven, because of their indi- vidual desires in these matters, devise their own theories . Ho w sad that the hundred schools go along their own ways withou t turning back so that they will of necessity never join together ! The students of later generations have unfortunately not see n the simplicity of heaven and earth . The techniques of the Wa y as they were so greatly embodied by the men of antiquity ar e being sundered by all under heaven . i ,"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"r 3 3 6 2 Not to instill extravagance in later generations, not to be waste- ful of the myriad things, not to be ostentatious with regulation s and rules, to restrain oneself with codes of conduct, and to b e prepared for the crises of the age—a portion of the ancien t techniques of the Way lay in these practices . Mo Ti and Ch'i n Kuli heard of such usages and delighted in them, but they wer e too overwrought in their doings and too insistent in thei r abstinence . They formulated an \" antimusic \" policy and put i t under the rubric of \"economy of expenditure .\" In life they wer e against singing and in death they were against graveclothes . Master Mo advocated love overflowing to all, the sharing o f profits, and the rejection of fighting . His way was against anger . Moreover, he was fond of learning and was erudite . Though h e did not strive to be different, he was not the same as the forme r kings and criticized the rituals and music of the ancients . The Yellow Emperor had his \"The Pond of Totality,\" Ya o had his \" Great Stanzas, \" Shun had his \"Great Splendors,\" Yid ha d his \"Great Hsia ;\" T'ang had his \" Great Diffusion,\" King We n had his \" Royal Concord, \" and King Wu and the Duke of Cho u composed \" The Martial : ' In the funeral rites of the ancients, there were differen t ceremonies for the honored and the despised, there were differ- ent degrees for those above and those below . The coffin of th e son of heaven had seven layers, that of a feudal lord had five, tha t of a great officer three, and that of a retainer two . But no w Master Mo alone was against singing in life and against grave - clothes in death . His legal guidelines called for a coffin made o f paulownia wood three inches thick and no outer shell . I a m afraid that, by instructing others with these doctrines, he did no t love others and, by practicing them himself, he certainly did no t love himself . This is not to overthrow the way of Master Mo 33 7 altogether . Nevertheless, people will sing, yet he rejected singing ; people will wail, yet he rejected wailing ; people will make music , yet he rejected music . Does this really seem human? For him, lif e was toilsome and death was contemptible—his way was greatl y deficient . Because it caused men to worry and to be sad, it wa s difficult to put into practice . I am afraid that it cannot be take n as the Way of the sages . Whatever is contrary to the mind of al l under heaven, all under heaven will not bear it . Although Maste r Mo alone might have been able to endure it, how could all unde r heaven? Having left all under heaven behind, its distance fro m kingship was also far . Master Mo declared, \" Long ago, when Yid was trying to ste m the flood waters, he cut channels from the Yangtze and th e Yellow rivers and opened communications with the four unciv- ilized tribes and the nine regions . There were three hundre d famous rivers, three thousand branch rivers, and countles s smaller ones . Yid personally handled the basket and the shovel , interconnecting the rivers of all under heaven, till there was n o down on his calves and no hair on his shins . He was bathed b y the pouring rains and combed by the gusting winds as he laid ou t the myriad states . Yid was a great sage, and he wearied his physica l form on behalf of all under heaven like this .\" He caused Mohist s of later ages, for the most part, to wear furs and clothes made o f arrowroot hemp and to put on wooden clogs and grass sandals . Day and night, they never rested, considering self-misery to b e perfection . They said, \" If one cannot be like this, he is no t following the way of Yid and is unworthy of being called a Mohist : \" The disciples of Hsiangli Ch ' in, the adherents of Wu Hou , the southern Mohists such as Bitter Harvest, Bite Self, an d Master Tengling all recited the Mohist canon, but their divergen t distortions were so different that they called each other \"aber- rant Mohists .\" They reviled each other with their disputation s over \" hard \" and \" white\" and over \"sameness \" and \" difference,\" as"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"3 3 8 well as with their rejoinders to each other over the disparit y between \" odd \" and \"even :' They considered their giants to b e sages and all were willing to accept them as their leaders, hopin g that they would be accepted by later generations, but to this da y the controversy has not been resolved . The ideas of Mo Ti and Ch ' in Kull were right, but thei r practice was wrong . They were to cause the Mohists of late r generations to weary themselves till there was no down on thei r calves and no hair on their shins, urging each other forward t o the very end . The results were superior to disorder but inferior t o order . Nonetheless, Master Mo was truly one of the best me n under heaven, and it would be hard to find another like him . Though he became withered and wasted, he never gave up . H e was indeed a scholar of ability! 3 Not to be entangled in vulgarity, not to ornament oneself wit h things, not to be caustic toward others, not to be hostile towar d the masses, to desire peaceful repose for all under heaven so as t o preserve the lives of the people, to stop when nourishment fo r others and for oneself is quite sufficient and thereby to mak e plain one ' s mind—a portion of the ancient techniques of th e Way lay in these practices . Sung Chien and Yin Wen heard o f such usages and delighted in them . They made Mount Hua cap s to distinguish themselves and their first premise in their contac t with the myriad things was to dispense with enclosures . I n describing the capacity of the mind, they named it \"the action o f the mind . \" Through pliability they joined happily in blending al l within the seas and they wished to establish this as their chie f doctrine . By not feeling disgraced when insulted, their aim wa s to save the people from fighting ; by prohibiting aggression an d halting troops, their aim was to save the world from war . Wit h these tenets, they walked all around under heaven trying t o persuade those above and instructing those below . Although all 33 9 under heaven did not adopt their tenets, they kept up a forcefu l clamor and never gave up . Therefore, it is said, \"Those above an d below are tired of seeing them, but they force themselves to b e seen . Nonetheless, they were too much concerned with others an d too little concerned with themselves . They said, \" We merel y wish to have five pints of rice set before us and that will b e enough : ' I am afraid that the masters never got their fill and th e disciples, although hungry, never forgot all under heaven . Da y and night, they never rested, saying, \" We will certainly be able t o go on living! \" How proud were the plans of these noblemen wh o would save the world! They said, \"The superior man does no t make exacting examinations, nor does he permit his person to b e subjugated by things : ' They believed that, rather than elucidat e what was of no value to all under heaven, it would be better t o desist . They took the prohibition of aggression and the haltin g of troops as their external policy, the diminution of desires a s their internal policy . This was the big and the little, the coars e and the subtle of their theories . In their practice, they reache d just to this and then stopped . 4 Public-minded and nonpartisan, easygoing and impartial, de- cidedly without subjectivity, not to be duplicitous in one's ap- proach to things, not to be preoccupied by one's thoughts, not t o scheme for knowledge, to make no choices among things, goin g along with everything—a portion of the ancient techniques o f the Way lay in these practices . P ' eng Meng, T'ien P'ien, an d Shen Tao heard of such usages and delighted in them . The y made equality of the myriad things their primary doctrine , saying, \" Heaven can cover but it cannot support ; earth ca n support but it cannot cover ; the great Way can embrace but i t cannot discriminate .\" They knew that the myriad things all hav e that wherein they are affirmable and that wherein they are not"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"3 4 0 affirmable . Therefore, they said : \"Any selection is biased ; an y instruction is imperfect ; it is only the Way that omits nothing . \" For this reason, Shen Tao abandoned knowledge and re- jected self, acquiescing in inevitability . He was indifferent towar d things and took this as his principle of the Way, saying, \" Whe n you know that you do not know, you will be one who disparage s knowledge and tramples upon it .\" He went along with things an d set himself no particular task, and he laughed at all under heave n for paying esteem to worthies ; he was unrestrained and unculti- vated, and he criticized all under heaven for giving prominenc e to sages . Hammering, slapping, lathing, cutting—he went roun d and round with things . He renounced right and wrong so that h e might carelessly avoid involvement . He mastered nothing fro m knowledge and thought ; he knew nothing of precedence an d sequence—he merely remained sublimely disengaged . He woul d only go forward if he were pushed and he would only follo w along if he were dragged . His movement was like the turning of a whirlwind, the circling of a falling feather, the revolving of a millstone . He was whole and without fault, his deportment wa s without error, and he was always without guilt . What was th e reason for this? Things that are without knowledge are withou t the troubles that result from self-assertiveness and are withou t the entanglements that result from the application of knowledge . In their deportment, they never depart from principle, so conse- quently they are without praise till the end of their life . There - fore, he said, \" May I merely arrive at the state of being like a thing without knowledge . There ' s no use for worthies an d sages—it ' s the clod that doesn't lose the 'Way!\" The valiant an d the heroic laughed at him to each other and said, \"The way o f Shen Tao is not based on the conduct of the living ; instead, h e has arrived at the principle of the dead . There ' s really somethin g strange about it! \" It was the same with T'ien P'ien . He studied with P ' en g Meng, but what he got from him was noninstruction . P'en g Meng's teacher said, \"The ancient men of the Way arrived at a 34 1 state where there was nothing right and nothing wrong, that's all . His usages were so vague that they cannot be described in words . He often opposed others so no one heeded him, yet he could no t avoid being rounded and cut off . What he called the way was no t the Way, and what he said was right could not avoid bein g wrong . P'eng Meng, T ' ien P ' ien, and Shen Tao did not know the Way . Nonetheless, it would appear that they had all heard about it . 5 To take the root as essential and to take things as extraneous, t o take accumulation as insufficiency, to dwell alone tranquilly wit h spiritual intelligence—a portion of the ancient techniques o f the Way lay in these practices . Yin, the Director of the Pass, an d Old Longears heard of such usages and delighted in them . The y set up the concept of eternal nonbeing and being and mad e grand unity their chief doctrine . They took soft weakness an d humility as their distinguishing features and took vacuity an d nondamage to the myriad things as their inner substance . Director Yin said , \" To one who does not dwell in himself , The forms of things will manifest themselves . His movement is like water , His stillness is like a mirror . His response is like an echo , Indistinct as though it were absent , Quiet as though it were pure . In sameness there is harmony , In getting there is loss . \""},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"3 4 2 He never went before others but always followed after them . Old Longears said , \" Know masculinity , Maintain femininity , and be a ravine for all under heaven . Know whiteness , Maintain insult , and be a valley for all under heaven : ' \" Men all take the first place ; he alone takes the last, saying, `I wil l accept the filth of all under heaven .' Men all take substantiality ; he alone takes emptiness . He does not store up, therefore he has a surplus . . . . In the conduct of his person, he is slow but no t wasteful . He acts not and laughs at cleverness . Men all see k blessings ; he alone is preserved whole through bending, saying , 'If only I can avoid affliction : He takes depth as rudimentar y and thrift as regulatory, saying, `If it is hard it will be damaged ; i f it is sharp it will be blunted . ' \" He was always magnanimou s toward things and not trenchant toward men . He may be said t o have arrived at the apex . Ah, Director Yin and Old Longears! They were indee d ample true men of antiquity! 6 Obscure and formless, ever transforming and inconstant . Ar e we alive? Are we dead? Do we coexist with heaven and earth ? Do we go along with spiritual intelligence? How nebulous ! where are we going? How blurred! where are we aiming? Th e myriad things being arrayed all around, there is none fit for u s to return to—a portion of the ancient techniques of the Wa y lay in these practices . Chuang Chou heard of such usages and 34 3 delighted in them . With absurd expressions, extravagant words , and unbounded phrases, he often gave rein to his whims bu t was not presumptuous and did not look at things from on e angle only . Believing that all under heaven were sunk in stu- pidity and could not be talked to seriously, he used imprompt u words for his effusive elaboration, quotations for the truth, an d metaphors for breadth . Alone, he came and went with th e essential spirits of heaven and earth but was not arrogan t toward the myriad things . He did not scold others for bein g right or wrong, but abode with the mundane and the vulgar . Although his writings are exotic and convoluted, there is n o harm in them ; although his phraseology is irregular and bi- zarre, it merits reading . His fecundity is inexhaustible . Abov e he wanders with the creator of things, and below he is friend s with those who are beyond life and death and without begin- ning or end . Regarding the root, he is expansive and open , profound and unrestrained ; regarding the ancestor, he may b e said to be attuned and ascendant . Nonetheless, in his respons e to evolution and in his emancipation from things, his princi- ples are not exhaustive and his approach is not metamorphos- ing . How nebulous! How cryptic!—someone who has neve r been fully fathomed . 7 Hui Shih had many theories . His books filled five carts, but hi s way was contradictory and his words were off the mark . In hi s successive estimation of things, he said : \"That which is so great that there is nothing outside it ma y be called `the great one ' ; that which is so small that there i s nothing inside it may be called `the small one : \" \"That which has no thickness and cannot be accumulated i s a thousand tricents in size : ' \"Heaven is as low as the earth ; a mountain is as level as a marsh : '"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"3 44 ` As soon as the sun is at noon it dedines ; as soon as a thin g is born it dies . \" \"Given that there is a difference between great similarity an d small similarity, this is called a small difference of similarity ; given that the myriad things are ultimately similar yet ultimatel y different, this is called a great difference of similarity . \" \" The southern direction is limitless yet it has a limit : ' \" One sets out for Viet today but came there yesterday . \" \" Linked rings can be separated . \" \"I know the center of all under heaven : it is north of Yen an d south of Viet . \" \"If there is general love of the myriad things, heaven an d earth are one body : ' Considering that these statements were great, Hui Shil l revealed them to all under heaven and explained them to th e sophists . All the sophists under heaven enjoyed adding their ow n to his : 'An egg has feathers : ' 'A chicken has three legs : ' \"Ying possesses all under heaven . \" 'A dog can be taken as a sheep : ' \" A horse has eggs . \" `A frog has a tail : ' \" Fire is not hot . \" \"Mountains produce mouths : ' 'A wheel does not roll on the ground : ' 'An eye does not see : ' \"To indicate is not to arrive at ; arrival is not absolute : ' `A turtle is longer than a snake . \" `An L-square is not square and a compass cannot make a circle : ' `A chisel does not surround its helve . \" \" The shadow of a flying bird has never moved . \" \"Swift as the barbed arrow may be, there is a time when i t neither moves nor is at rest : '"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"3 46 \"A puppy is not a dog . \" \"A sorrel horse and a black ox are three . \" \"A white puppy is black . \" \"An orphan colt never had a mother . \" \"If you take away half of a foot-long stick every day, it wil l not be exhausted in a myriad ages . \" The sophists responded to Hui Shih with these statement s endlessly throughout their lives . Huan T ' uan and Kungsun Lung were adherents of th e sophists . They embellished the minds of men and changed th e ideas of men . They could overcome others in debate but the y could not subdue their minds—such were the limitations of th e sophists . Hui Shih used his knowledge to dispute with other s every day and he particularly devised strange propositions wit h all the sophists under heaven . This was the basis of his school . However, in his colloquies, Hui Shih believed that he him - self was the most worthy, saying, \"Under heaven and on earth, i s there another so magnificent?\" He maintained his masculinit y but was without technique . In the south there was an odd ma n named Huang Liao who asked him why heaven did not collaps e and earth did not sink and the reason for wind, rain, and th e crash of thunder . Not declining to respond, Shih replie d thoughtlessly, volubly talking about the myriad things . He kep t talking without a pause, voluminously and unceasingly, but stil l thinking that he was laconic and adding all sorts of strang e remarks . He took contradicting others as his substance an d wished to become famous by overcoming them, hence he did no t get along with the masses . He was weak in virtue but strong i n things . Arcane was his path ! If we observe Hui Shih ' s ability from the Way of heaven an d earth, it was like the toiling of a mosquito or a gadfly . Of wha t use was he to things? It is acceptable to claim that he filled a certain role, but I say that, had he gone on to honor the Way, h e would have been very close indeed . Hui Shih could not find an y self-satisfaction in this, so he scattered himself insatiably among 34 7 the myriad things, ending up being famed as a skillful debater . What a pity! With all of his abilities, he was like a runaway hors e that could not be restrained . He went in pursuit of the myria d things and never came back . This is like trying to stifle an ech o by shouting at it or pitting the body in a race against its shadow .

PLACE S Ch'en and Ts'ai (p . I37) . Two small states, on the border o f which Confucius once nearly lost his life . This famous inciden t is recorded in many ancient works (Records of the Scribe, Analects , Mencius, Mo Tzu, and Hsiin Tzu) and occurs in the Chuang Tzu i n the context of a whole series of disasters that plagued Confuciu s as he traveled from one state to another seeking a ruler wh o would put his doctrines into practice . The first story tells of Confucius going on a tour of the stat e of Sung . He and his disciples stopped to rest under a large tree . The master instructed his disciples to practice their ritual an d etiquette . Just at that moment, Huan T ' ai, the minister of wa r for Sung, commanded that the tree be cut down and was abou t to have Confucius murdered when the latter fled . Huan T'ai' s enmity for Confucius is said to have stemmed from the master' s criticism of his cruelty and excess in the construction of his ow n tomb . In the next story, the Duke of Wey permitted Confucius an d his followers to enter his state, but he kept such a close watch o n them that they decided to leave . As they were departing, th e people of a border town, mistaking them for a band of robber s who had raided the area not long before, surrounded Confuciu s and his disciples . Only after five days did the local strongma n release them, warning Confucius never to come back to the stat e of Wey . 36 5 The specific allusions to the Shang duchy and the Cho u kingdom in this passage are not known, except to say that neithe r of these states heeded Confucius ' s counsel . They were als o probably unwilling to foot the considerable bill for the maste r and his entourage . The rulers of Ch'en and Ts'ai, afraid that Confucius woul d travel to help their powerful southern neighbor, the state o f Ch'u, surrounded him when he passed through their states . He i s said to have been released only through the intervention of Ch ' u . It is reported that, while he was being detained, Confuciu s survived on chenopod soup for a week . \" Chenopod \" is th e Latinate equivalent of \" goosefoot .\" The Chenopodiaceae famil y includes pigweed, lamb's quarters, beets, spinach, the broo m plant, and many common weeds . In old China, chenopods wer e associated with famine and poverty . On page 303 there is reference to the story of Confuciu s having fled to Ch'i when there was chaos in Lu . Duke Ch'ing o f Ch'i was impressed by Confucius's political advice and wanted t o enfeoff him, but was prevented from doing so by the prim e minister of Ch'i, Yen Ying . Ch ' i (p . 33) .

Once, for example, during the 36 7 reign of Duke Ting, the state of Ch'i purposely sowed seeds o f discord between Confucius and his ruler by presenting the latte r with 80 beautiful women and 124 fine horses . Confucius wa s unhappy about this, of course, because it diverted the ruler' s attention from the all-important (to Confucius) business o f governing the state well, so he felt that he had no choice but t o leave Lu and attempt to persuade some other ruler to adopt hi s policies .

The sinographs used to write thi s expression, which may also be rendered as \"small talk,\" hav e come to signify \" fiction\" in Modern Standard Mandarin (proba- bly borrowed back into Chinese from a Japanese calque [seman- tic borrowing] for the Western literary term) . This passage , where the two graphs occur together in combination for the firs t time, has often been cited as evidence for the existence of fictio n during the time of Chuang Chou . This interpretation, however , is both fallacious and anachronistic . It is impossible to demon- strate on the basis of this passage alone or in conjunction wit h any other contemporary data that the author was even remotel y concerned with fiction when he wrote about \" petty persuasions . \" Furthermore, although this tale about the scion of the Duke o f Jen catching a huge fish is memorable, parts of it are poorl y written, which has caused several commentators to remark that i t is a rather late interpolation, even in the context of the derivativ e Miscellaneous Chapters . The Chuang Tzu itself undoubtedly has the highest degree o f fictionality of any literary work before the advent of Buddhis m in China (see Mair, \"The Narrative Revolution\") . Even so, thi s does not qualify the Chuang Tzu to be considered as a consciou s or intentional piece of fiction per se . See also the previous entr y on persuasions . Piebald Thoroughbred (p . 304) .

The information given in the Chuang Tz u accords closely with beliefs and customs concerning the swallo w in a number of societies . The Taiwanese and the Nepalese, fo r example, do not consider a newly constructed house to b e blessed until a swallow builds its nest under the eaves . It is th e sacred quality of the mud-daubed nest that undoubtedly led th e author of this passage to refer to it here as an \" altar of the soi l and grain .\" Even more remarkable is a personal observation I made during an extended trip to the People's Republic of Chin a in I983 . After three weeks of travel across the length and breadt h of the land, one of my companions who happened to be a birdwatcher exclaimed with chagrin, \"Oh, heaven! Victor, ther e are no birds in China! \" And, indeed, except for a solitary kit e that we had seen flying high in the sky above the remote uppe r reaches of the Yellow River, we had not seen or heard a singl e bird for three weeks . When I asked our Chinese guides how thi s could be, they explained that massive extermination campaign s had reduced the bird population to almost nil ( \" because bird s compete with human beings for grain\") . There were also th e local \" bird-killing kings\" who shot or netted as many as a hundred birds a day for sport or food . Four years later, in I987 , the Chinese authorities began to realize what an ecological \t 383 \t disaster these misguided policies had spawned—millions o f trees were dying from insect infestation, to name only on e problem—and so they gradually began to attempt to control th e wanton slaughter . But, to return to the conclusion of my I98 3 trip, after nearly a month in China, as we reached Canton an d were preparing to leave the country, we were overjoyed to behol d scattered groups of swallows flying exuberantly in the vicinity o f the Canton Historical Museum (formerly a temple that wa s originally built in 1380 on a commanding height overlooking th e city) . I was so startled by their existence that I could not help bu t ask my Chinese host why they, too, had not been killed . \"In th e first place ;\" he said, \"their flight is too fast and jittery for anyon e to shoot them easily . Secondly, they help us kill insects that ro b us of grain . And finally, \" he admitted, \"they bring good luck . \" Hence, even in godless communist China, an ancient traditio n about the swallow had been preserved—after a fashion . tattooed ; lopped off . . . nose (pp . 62-63) .

There are countless speculations about the meanin g of this simple word (e .g ., the creator, physical form, nature, Go d [Deus], etc .) .

Probably the single most important an d quintessential concept in the Chuang Tzu, but often overlooke d because it is presented in literary rather than philosophica l terms . \"Wandering \" implies a \" laid-back \" attitude toward life i n which one takes things as they come and flows along with th e Tao unconcernedly . The word yu is usually translated as \"wan- der(ing ) \" but is occasionally rendered as \"play(ing),\" \"strolling , \" or \"enjoy(ing) oneself . \" \"Wandering \" with someone can als o mean to study with or learn from them . In this sense, Chines e thinkers of the Warring States period were very much like thei r Greek counterparts from the same time who were often peripa- tetics . When engaged in by Confucians and other \"uptight \" types, yu means simply \"traveling \" or, at best, \" going on a n excursion : ' Yu is also cognate with the word for \"swim(ming) , \" s o when Master Chuang observes fish swimming (see page 165), h e is also watching them playing and wandering freely in their ow n element . Thus, in the special language of the Chuang Tzu, \"wan- dering \" amounts to a technical term for that transcendental sor t of free movement which is the mark of an enlightened being .

If, however, we are able to nourish birds as bird s should be nourished, we ought to let them perch in the dee p forests, float on rivers and lakes, feed on loaches and hemiculters , and dwell in self-contentment, then they will feel safe on level , dry ground, and that is all . Now, Hsiu is a person of slim wit an d slight learning . My telling him about the integrity of the ulti- mate man is like using a carriage and horses to transport a mous e or drums and bells to delight a bull-headed shrike .

The entire staff of the Center was unfailingl y helpful to me in facilitating the research that went into th e making of this book . I wish particularly to express my gratitud e to Karen Carroll and Linda Morgan for typing the whol e manuscript from a monumentally messy handwritten first draft . Leave at the National Humanities Center was supported b y grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities an d by the Mellon Foundation . I am grateful to both of thes e organizations for their generous assistance . Linda Loewenthal, who four years ago gave me expert edi- torial guidance when I was working on the Tao Te Ching, has onc e again provided much needed critical advice for my version of th e Chuang Tzu . I am deeply appreciative of her patient efforts t o wean me away from a natural inclination to scholarly tedium . The format of the book and the present form of the Introduc- tion and other ancillary matter are due to her incisive organiza- tional vision and skills . Leslie Meredith, Executive Editor at Bantam and in charge"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"402 i of the Wisdom Editions, deserves thanks for her understandin g of what I wanted this book to be, especially on the question o f the need for a truly complete translation of the Chuang Tzu, an d was supportive on various aspects relating to the design of th e final product . I also wish to thank Denis Mair and ling Wang for readin g over the entire translation against the original Chinese text t o ensure that nothing was inadvertently omitted . The former, wh o is a fine poet and premier translator in his own right, made som e excellent suggestions for improvement . The latter offered invalu- able insights and encouragement in the final stages of the work . To my son, Thomas Krishna, who has grown into a ma n while this book was being written, I am grateful for helping m e to see things with clarity . To my wife, Liching, who had t o endure years of neglect while I was immersed in ancient tomes, I am grateful for all the support and understanding she has shown . Finally, I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to th e following scholars whose studies on the intellectual history o f the Warring States period and on Taoism I have relied upon s o heavily in writing the Introduction : E .

The interpretations placed upon their work , however, are strictly my own . ABOUT THE TRANSLATO R VICTOR H . MAIR is one of America ' s foremost translators o f ancient Chinese .
