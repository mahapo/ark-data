I discovered, in the course of writing this book, that physicists, from graduate students to Nobel Laureates, are a gracious group of people; accessible, helpful, and engaging. This discovery shattered my long-held stereo- type of the cold, \"objective\" scientific personality. For this, above all, I am grateful to the people listed here. Jack Sarfatti, Ph.D., Director of the Physics/Consciousness Research Group, is the catalyst without whom the following people and I would not have met. Al Chung-liang Huang, The T'ai Chi Master, provided the perfect metaphor of Wu Li, inspiration, and the beautiful calligraphy. David Finkelstein, Ph.D., Director of the School of Physics, Georgia Institute of Technology, was my first tutor. These men are the godfathers of this book. In addition to Sarfatti and Finkelstein, Brian Josephson, Professor of Physics, Cambridge University, and Max Jammer, Professor of Physics, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat- Gan, Israel, read and commented upon the entire manu- script.

Watching the book grow has been instructive and rewarding, because Zukav has insisted on going through the whole evolution of the quantum relativistic phys- ics of today, treating it as it is, an unfolding story. As a result this book is not only readable, but it also puts the reader in touch with all the various ways that physicists have worked out for talking about what is so hard to talk about. In short, Gary Zukav has written a very good book for laymen. Zukav's attitude to physics is rather close to mine, so I must be a layman too, and it is more stimulating to talk phys- ics with him than with most professionals. He knows that physics is—among other things—an attempt to harmonize with a much greater entity than ourselves, requiring us to seek, formulate and eradicate first one and then another of our most cherished prejudices and oldest habits of thought, in a never- ending quest for the unattainable. Zukav has graciously offered me this place to add my own emphases to his narrative. Since it has been three years since we met, I must sift my memory for a while. Migrating whales come to mind first. I remember us standing on the Esalen cliffs and watching them cavort as they headed south. Next comes to mind beautiful Monarch butterflies, dotting the fields from the first day, and covering one magic tree as thick as leaves in a grand finale. Between the whales and the butterflies it was difficult for us to feel self-important and very easy for us to play. The very difficulty of communicating with the physicists at Esalen helped me to realize how differently most physicists think about quantum mechanics than I do.

At that time, I had no connections with the scientific communi- ty, so I went to see what physicists were like. To my great surprise, I discovered that (1), I understood everything that they said, and (2), their discussion sounded very much like a theological discussion. I scarcely could believe what I had discovered. Physics was not the sterile, boring discipline that I had assumed it to be. It was a rich, profound venture which had become inseparable from philosophy. Incredibly, no one but physicists seemed to be aware of this remarkable devel- opment. As my interest in and knowledge of physics grew, I resolved to share this discovery with others. This book is a gift of my discovery. It is one of a series. Generally speaking, people can be grouped into two cate- gories of intellectual preference. The first group prefers explorations which require a precision of logical processes. These are the people who become interested in the natural sciences and mathematics. They do not become scientists be- cause of their education, they choose a scientific education because it gratifies their scientific mental set. The second group prefers explorations which involve the intellect in a less logically rigorous manner. These are the people who become interested in the liberal arts. They do not have a liberal arts mentality because of their education, they choose a liberal arts education because it gratifies their liberal arts mental set. Since both groups are intelligent, it is not difficult for members of one group to understand what members of the other group are studying.

That's difficult.\" This universal reaction to the word \"physics\" is a wall that stands between what physicists do and what most people think they do. There is usually a big difference between the two. Physicists themselves are partly to blame for this sad situation. Their shop talk sounds like advanced Greek, unless you are Greek or a physicist. When they are not talking to other physicists, physicists speak English. Ask them what they do, however, and they sound like the natives of Corfu again. On the other hand, part of the blame is ours. Generally speaking, we have given up trying to understand what physi- cists (and biologists, etc.) really do. In this we do ourselves a disservice. These people are engaged in extremely interesting adventures that are not that difficult to understand. True, how they do what they do sometimes entails a technical explanation which, if you are not an expert, can produce an involuntary deep sleep. What physicists do, however, is actu- ally quite simple. They wonder what the universe is really made of, how it works, what we are doing in it, and where it is going, if it is going anyplace at all. In short, they do the same things that we do on starry nights when we look up at the vastness of the universe and feel overwhelmed by it and a part of it at the same time. That is what physicists really do, and the clever rascals get paid for doing it. Unfortunately, when most people think of \"physics,\" they think of chalkboards covered with undecipherable symbols of"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"4 / WU LI? an unknown mathematics. The fact is that physics is not math- ematics. Physics, in essence, is simple wonder at the way things are and a divine (some call it compulsive) interest in how that is so. Mathematics is the tool of physics. Stripped of mathematics, physics becomes pure enchantment. I had spoken often to Jack Sarfatti, who is the physicist director of the Physics/Consciousness Research Group, about the possibility of writing a book, unencumbered with techni- calities and mathematics, to explain the exciting insights that motivate current physics. So when he invited me to a confer- ence on physics that he and Michael Murphy were arranging at the Esalen Institute, I accepted with a purpose. The Esalen Institute (it is named for an Indian tribe) is in Northern California. The northern California coast is an awe- some combination of power and beauty, but nowhere so much as along the Pacific Coast Highway between the towns of Big Sur and San Luis Obispo. The Esalen facilities are located about a half hour south of Big Sur between the highway and the coastal mountains on the one side and rugged cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean on the other. A dancing stream divides the northern third of the grounds from the remainder. On that side is a big house (called the Big House) where guests stay and groups meet, along with a small home where Dick Price (co-founder of Esalen with Murphy) stays with his family. On the other side of the stream is a lodge where meals are served and meetings are held, accommodations for guests and staff, and hot sulfur baths. Dinner at Esalen is a multi-dimensional experience. The elements are candlelight, organic food, and a contagious naturalness that is the essence of the Esalen experience. Sarfatti and I joined two men who already were eating. One was David Finkelstein, a physicist from Yeshiva University (in New York) who was attending the conference on physics. The other was Al Chung-liang Huang, a T'ai Chi Master who was leading a workshop at Esalen. We could not have chosen better companions. The conversation soon turned to physics. \"When I studied physics in Taiwan,\" said Huang, \"we called it Wu Li (pronounced 'Woo Lee'). It means 'Patterns of Organic Energy.' \" Everyone at the table was taken at once by this image. Mental lights flashed on, one by one, as the idea penetrated."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"BIG WEEK AT BIG SUR / 5 \"Wu Li\" was more than poetic. It was the best definition of physics that the conference would produce. It caught that certain something, that living quality that we were seeking to express in a book, that thing without which physics becomes sterile. \"Let's write a book about Wu Li!\" I heard myself exclaim. Immediately, ideas and energy began to flow, and in one stroke all of the prior planning that I had done went out the window. From that pooling of energy came the image of the Dancing Wu Li Masters. My remaining days at Esalen and those that followed were devoted to finding out what Wu Li Masters are, and why they dance. All of us sensed with excitement and certitude that we had discovered the channel through which the very things that we wanted to say about physics would flow. The Chinese language does not use an alphabet like western languages. Each word in Chinese is depicted by a character, which is a line drawing. (Sometimes two or more characters are combined to form different meanings). This is why it is difficult to translate Chinese into English. Good translations require a translator who is both a poet and a linguist. For example, \"Wu\" can mean either \"matter\" or \"energy.\" \"Li\" is a richly poetic word. It means \"universal order\" or \"universal law.\" It also means \"organic patterns.\" The grain in a panel of wood is Li. The organic pattern on the surface of a leaf is also Li, and so is the texture of a rose petal. In short, Wu Li, the Chinese word for physics, means \"pat- terns of organic energy\" (\"matter/energy\" [Wu] + \"universal order/organic patterns\" [Li]). This is remarkable since it reflects a world view which the founders of western science (Galileo and Newton) simply did not comprehend, but toward which virtually every physical theory of import in the twentieth century is pointing! The question is not, \"Do they know some- thing that we don't?\" The question is, \"How do they know it?\" English words can be pronounced almost any way without changing their meanings. I was five years a college graduate before I learned to pronounce \"consummate\" as an adjective (con-SUM-mate). (It means \"carried to the utmost extent or degree; perfect\").

light contains only red light, green light contains only green light, etc Isaac Newton wrote his famous Optiks about this phenomenon three hundred years ago This display of colors is called a white-light spectrum The spectral analysis of white light shows a complete spectrum because white light contains all of the colors that our eyes can see (and some that they cannot sec, like infrared and ultraviolet) However, not every spectral analysis produces a complete spectrum If we take one of the chemical elements, for example, like sodium, cause it to emit light, and shine that light

sun is at the center of our solar system In the nucleus is located almost all of the mass of the atom in the form of positively charged particles (protons) and particles about the same size as protons but without a charge (neu- trons) (Only hydrogen has no neutrons in its nucleus) Orbiting about the nucleus, as the planets orbit the sun, are electrons, which have almost no mass compared with the nucleus Each electron has one negative charge The number of electrons is always the same as the number of protons, so that the positive and negative charges cancel each other and the atom, as a whole,

The problem with comparing this model of the atom with our solar system is that the distances between an atomic nucleus and its electrons are enormously greater than we picture the distances between the sun and its planets The space occu- pied by an atom is so huge, compared with the mass of its particles (almost all of which is in the nucleus), that the electrons orbiting the nucleus are \"like a few flies in a cathedral\" ac- cording to Ernest Rutherford, who created this model of the atom in 1911 This is the familiar picture of the atom that most of us learned in school, usually under duress Unfortunately, this picture is obsolete, so you can forget the whole thing We will discuss later how physicists currently think of an atom The point here is that the planetary model of the atom formed the background against which a most puzzling problem was solved The spectrum of hydrogen, the simplest of the atoms, contains over one hundred lines' The patterns of the other elements are even more complicated When we shine the light from excited hydrogen gas through a spectroscope, we get over one hundred different lines of color in a distinct pattern * The question is, \"How can such a simple thing like a hydrogen atom, which has only two components, a proton and an electron, account for such a complex spectrum' 1 \" One way of thinking about light is to ascribe wave-like properties to it, and then to say that different colors have different frequencies, just as different sounds, which also are waves, have different frequencies Arnold Sommerfield, a German physicist who also was an accomplished pianist, ob- served, tongue-in-cheek, that hydrogen atoms, which emit over one hundred different frequencies, must be more com- plicated than grand pianos, which emit only eighty-eight dif- ferent frequencies' It was a Danish physicist named Niels Bohr who came up with an explanation (in 1913) that made so much sense that it won him a Nobel Prize Like most ideas in physics, it is essentially simple Bohr did not start with what was theoretically * Accurately speaking different experimental equipment is required to photo graph each series of the hydrogen spectrum Therefore most single photo graphs of the hydrogen spectrum show only about 10 lines Theoretically there are an infinite number of lines in each atomic spectrum In feet theoretically there are an infinite number of lines m each series of each spectrum because the lines in tht. higher frequency range of each senes become so closely spaced that m effect they form » continuum"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"BIG WEEK AT BIG SUR / 13 \"known\" about the structure of atoms He started with what he really knew about atoms, that is, he started with raw spectroscopic data Bohr speculated that electrons revolve around the nucleus of an atom not at just any distance, but in orbits or shells, which are specific distances from the nucleus Each of these shells (theoretically there are an infinite num- ber of them), contains up to a certain number of electrons, but no more If the atom has more electrons than the first shell can ac- commodate, the electrons begin to fill up the second shell If the atom has more electrons than the first and second shells combined can hold, the third shell begins to fill and so on, like this Shell number 12345 Numbers of electrons 2 8 18 32 50 His calculations were based on the hydrogen atom, which has only one electron According to Bohr s theory, the electron in the hydrogen atom stays as close to the nucleus as it can get In other words, it usually is in the first shell This is the lowest energy state of a hydrogen atom (Physicists call the lowest energy state of any atom its ground state ) If we excite an atom of hydrogen we cause its electron to jump to one of the outer shells How far it jumps depends upon how much energy we give it If we really heat the atom up (thermal energy), we cause its electron to make a verv large jump all the wav to one of the outer shells Smaller amounts of energy make the electron jump less far However, as soon as it can (when we stop heating it), the electron returns to a shell closer in Eventually it returns all the way back to shell num- ber one Whenever the electron jumps from an outer shell to an inner shell, it emits energv in the form of light The energv that the electron emits is exactly the amount of energy that it absorbed when it jumped outward in the first place Bohr discovered that all of the possible combinations of jumps that the hydrogen electron can make on its journeys back to the ground state (the first shell) equals the number of lines in the hydrogen spectrum' This is Bohr's famous solution to the grand-piano mvstery If the electron in a hydrogen atom travels from an outer shell all the way to the innermost shell in one jump, it gi\\ es off a certain amount of energy That makes one line in the hydro-"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"14 /WU LI?

what they see. Another point of view is that the world presents itself most completely through such structures. In any case, mathematics is the most concise expression of physics. The reason for writing The Dancing Wu Li Masters, however, is that most physicists are not able to explain physics very well without it. This makes them very concise but, unfortunately, unintelligible. The fact is that most of us use words to do our explaining. However, it is important to remember that mathematics and English are both languages. Languages are useful tools for conveying information, but if we try to communicate experiences with them, they simply do not work. All a lan- guage can do is talk about an experience. Wu Li Masters know that a description of an experience is not the experience. It is only talk about it. This is a book about physics. Therefore, all it contains is a description. It cannot contain the experience itself. This does not mean that you will not have the experience of physics by reading it; it only means that if you do, the experience is coming from you, and not from the book. Quantum mechan- ics, for example, shows us that we are not as separate from the rest of the world as we once thought. Particle physics shows us that the \"rest of the world\" does not sit idly \"out there.\" It is a sparkling realm of continual creation, trans- formation, and annihilation. The ideas of the new physics, when wholly grasped, can produce extraordinary experiences. The study of relativity theory, for example, can produce the remarkable experience that space and time are only mental constructions! Each of these different experiences is capable of changing us in such ways that we never again are able to view the world as we did before. There is no single \"experience\" of physics. The experience always is changing. Relativity and quantum mechanics, although generally unknown to nonphysicists, are more than a half cen- tury old. Today, the entire field of physics is quivering with anticipation. The air is charged with excitement. A feeling is shared among physicists that radical change is at hand. A consensus grows that the near future will see new theories exploding onto the scene, incorporating the older theories and giving us a much larger view of our universe and, conse- quently, of ourselves.

Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics. There are several branches of physics. Most physi- cists believe that sooner or later they will construct an over- view large enough to incorporate them all. According to this point of view, we eventually will develop, in principle, a theory which is capable of explaining everything so well that there will be nothing left to explain. This does not mean, of course, that our explanation necessarily will reflect the way that things actually are. We still will not be able to open the watch, as Einstein put it, but every occurrence in the real world (inside the watch) will be accounted for by a corresponding element of our final supertheory. We will have, at last, a theory that is consistent within itself and which explains all observable phenomena. Einstein called this state the \"ideal limit of knowledge.\"' This way of thinking runs into quantum mechanics the same way that the car runs into the proverbial brick wall. Einstein spent a large portion of his career arguing against quantum mechanics, even though he himself made major contributions to its development. Why did he do this? To ask this question is to stand at the edge of an abyss, still on the solid ground of Newtonian physics, but looking into the void. To answer it is to leap boldly into the new physics. Quantum mechanics forced itself upon the scene at the beginning of this century.

A \"quantum\" is a quantity of something, a specific amount. \"Mechanics\" is the study of motion. Therefore, \"quantum me- chanics\" is the study of the motion of quantities. Quantum theory says that nature comes in bits and pieces (quanta), and quantum mechanics is the study of this phenomenon. Quantum mechanics does not replace Newtonian physics, it includes it. The physics of Newton remains valid within its limits. To say that we have made a major new discovery about nature is one side of a coin. The other side of the coin is to say that we have found the limits of our previous theories. What we actually discover is that the way that we have been looking at nature is no longer comprehensive enough to explain all that we can observe, and we are forced to develop a more inclusive view. In Einstein's words: . . . creating a new theory is not like destroying an old barn and erecting a skyscraper in its place. It is rather like climbing a mountain, gaining new and wider views, discovering unexpected connections between our starting point and its rich environment. But the point from which we started out still exists and can be seen, although it appears smaller and forms a tiny part of our broad view gained by the mastery of the obstacles on our adventurous way up. Newtonian physics still is applicable to the large-scale world, but it does not work in the subatomic realm. Quantum me- chanics resulted from the study of the subatomic realm, that invisible universe underlying, embedded in, and forming the fabric of everything around us. In Newton's age (late 1600s), this realm was entirely speculation. The idea that the atom is the indivisible building block of nature was proposed about four hundred years before Christ, but until the late 1800s it remained just an idea. Then physicists developed the technology to observe the effects of atomic phenomena, thereby \"proving\" that atoms exist. Of course, what they really proved was that the theoretical existence of atoms was the best explanation of the experimental data that anyone could invent at the time.

that we can know either the momentum of a particle or its position, but not both, we must choose which of these two properties we want to determine Metaphysically, this is very close to saying that we

are always faint The intensity of the lines in the hydrogen spectrum vanes because hydrogen electrons returning to the ground state do not al- ways take the same route Shell five, for example may be a more popular stopover than shell three In that case the spectrum produced by millions of excited hydrogen atoms will show a more pro- nounced spectral line corresponding to electron jumps from shell five to shell one and a less pronounced spectral line corresponding to electron jumps from, say, shell three to shell one That is because, in this example, more electrons stop over at shell five before jumping to shell one than stop over at shell three before jumping to shell one In other words, the probability is very high, in this example, that the electrons of excited hydrogen atoms will stop at shell five on their way back to shell one and the probability is lower that they will stop at shell three Said another way, we know that a certain number of electrons probably will stop at shell five and that a certain lesser number of electrons probably will stop at shell three Still we have no wav of knowing which electrons will stop where As before, we can describe precisely an

philosophical issue of quantum mechanics, namely, ' What is it that quantum mechanics de- scribes?

In the autumn of 1927, physicists working with the new physics met in Brussels Belgium, to ask themselves this ques- tion, among others What they decided there became known as the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics * Other interpretations developed later, but the Copenhagen Interpretation marks the emergence of the new physics as a consistent way of viewing the world It is still the most prevalent interpretation of the mathematical formalism of quantum me- chanics The upheaval in physics following the discovery of the inadequacies of Newtonian physics was all but complete The question among the physicists at Brussels was not whether Newtonian mechanics could be adapted to subatomic phe- nomena (it was clear that it could not be), but rather, what was to replace it The Copenhagen Interpretation was the first consistent for- mulation of quantum mechanics Einstein opposed it in 1927 and he argued against it until his death, although he, like all physicists, was forced to acknowledge its advantages in explaining subatomic phenomena The Copenhagen Interpretation says, in effect, that it does not matter what quantum mechanics is about't The important thing is that it works in all possible experimental situations This is one of the most important statements in the history of science The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechan- ics began a monumental reunion which was all but unnoticed at the time The rational part of our psyche, typified by science, began to merge again with that other part of us which we had ignored since the 1700s our irrational side The scientific idea of truth traditionally had been anchored in an absolute truth somewhere out there\"—that is, an abso- lute truth with an independent existence The closer that we came in our approximations to the absolute truth, the truer * This was the 5th Solvay Congress at which Bohr and Einstein conducted their now famous debates The term Copenhagen Interpretation

for the mind to relate to am thing other than ideas Therefore, it is not correct to think that the mind actually can ponder reality All that the mind can ponder is its ideas about reality (Whether or not that is the way reality actually is, is a meta- physical issue) Therefore, whether or not something is true is not a matter of how closely it corresponds to the absolute truth but of how consistent it is with our experience * The extraordinary importance of the Copenhagen Interpre- tation lies in the fact that for the first time, scientists attempting to formulate a consistent physics were forced by their own findings to acknowledge that a complete understanding of reality lies beyond the capabilities of rational thought It was this that Einstein could not accept The most

When we talk of physics as patterns of organic energy, the word that catches our attention is \"organic.\" Organic means living. Most people think that physics is about things that are not living, such as pendulums and billiard balls. This is a common point of view, even among physicists, but it is not as evident as it may seem. Let us explore this viewpoint with the aid of a hypothetical person, a young man named Jim de Wit who is the perpetual champion of the non-obvious. \"It is not at all true,\" says Jim de Wit, \"that physics is about nonliving things. This is evident from our discussion of falling bodies (page 29). Even if some of them are the human kind, they all accelerate at the same rate in a vacuum. So physics | does apply to living things.\" But that is an unfair example, we say. Rocks have no choice in the matter of falling. If we drop them, they fall. If we don't drop them, they don't fall. Humans, on the other hand, exercise choice. Accidents excluded, humans ordinarily are not found in the act of falling. Why? Because they know that falling may hurt them and they have no desire to be hurt. In other words, humans process information (they know that they may be hurt) and they respond to it (by not falling). Rocks can do neither.\" \"That is the way things appear,\" says de Wit, \"but it may not be the way they actually are. For example, by watching time-lapse photography we know that plants often respond to stimulae with humanlike reactions. They retreat from pain, 45"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"46 / PATTERNS OF ORGANIC ENERGY advance toward pleasure, and even languish in the absence of affection. The only difference is that they do it at a much slower rate than we do. So much slower, in fact, that it appears to the ordinary perception that they do not react at all. \"If this is so, then how can we say with certainty that rocks, and even mountain ranges, do not react also as living organ- isms, but with a reaction time so slow that to catch it with time-lapse photography would require millennia between exposures! Of course, there is no way to prove this, but there is no way of disproving it either. The distinction between living and nonliving is not so easy to make.\" \"That's clever,\" we think, \"but from a practical point of view, it cannot be observed that inert matter responds to stimulae, and there is no question that humans do.\" \"Wrong again!\" says de Wit, reading our thoughts. \"Any chemist can verify that most chemicals (which usually come out of the ground as rocks) do react to stimulation. Under the right conditions, for example, sodium reacts to chlorine (by forming sodium chloride—salt), iron reacts to oxygen (by forming iron oxides—rust), and so on, just as humans react to food when they are hungry and to affection when they are lonely.\" \"Well, this is so,\" we admit, \"but it hardly seems fair to compare a chemical reaction to a human reaction. A chemical reaction either happens or it does not happen. There is nothing in between. When two such chemicals are combined properly, they react; if they are not properly combined, they do not react. Humans are much more complex. \"If we offer food to a hungry person, he might eat it or he might not, depending upon his circumstances; and if he eats, he might eat his fill or he might not. Consider the person who is hungry and late for an appointment. If the appointment is important enough, he will go without eating, even though he is hungry. If a person knows that his food is poisonous, he will not eat, even though he is hungry. It is a matter of processing information and responding appropriately that distinguishes a human reaction from a chemical reaction. Chemicals have no options; they always must act one way or the other.\" \"Of course,\" beams Jim de Wit, \"but how do we know that our responses are not as rigidly preprogrammed as those of a chemical, with the only difference being that our programs are enormously more complex? We may not have any more freedom of action than stones do, although, unlike stones, we deceive ourselves into thinking that we do!\""},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"LIVING? / 47 We have no way to dispute this argument. De Wit has shown us the arbitrary quality of our prejudices. We would like to think that we are different from stones because we are living and they are not, but there is no way we can prove our position or disprove his. We cannot establish clearly that we are different from inorganic substances. That means that, log- ically, we must admit that we may not be alive. Since this is absurd, the only alternative is to admit that \"inanimate\"'' ob- jects may be living. The distinction between organic and inorganic is a concep- tual prejudice. It becomes even harder to maintain as we advance into quantum mechanics. Something is organic, ac- cording to our definition, if it can respond to processed infor- mation. The astounding discovery awaiting newcomers to physics is that the evidence gathered in the development of quantum mechanics indicates that subatomic \"particles\" constantly appear to be making decisions! More than that, the decisions they seem to make are based on decisions made elsewhere. Subatomic particles seem to know instantaneously what decisions are made elsewhere, and elsewhere can be as far away as another galaxy! The key word is instantaneously. How can a subatomic particle over here know what decision another particle over there has made at the same time the particle over there makes it? All the evidence belies the fact that quantum particles are actually particles. A particle, as we mentally picture it (classically defined) is a thing which is confined to a region in space. It is not spread out. It is either here or it is there, but it cannot be both here and there at the same time. A particle over here can communicate with a particle over there (by shouting at it, sending it a TV picture, waving, etc.), but that takes time, even if only milliseconds. If the two parti- cles are in different galaxies, it could take centuries. For a particle here to know what is going on over there while it is happening, it must be over there. But if it is over there, it cannot be here. If it is both places at once, then it is no longer a particle. This means that \"particles\" may not be particles at all (page 32). It also means that these apparent particles are related with other particles in a dynamic and intimate way that coin- cides with our definition of organic.

This also was explained by Einstein's new theory. Accord- ing to Einstein's theory, each photon of a given color, like green, for instance, has a certain amount of energy. Reducing the intensity of a beam of green light only reduces the num- ber of photons in the beam. Each remaining photon, howev- er, still has the same amount of energy as any other photon of green light. Therefore, when any photon of green light strikes an electron, it knocks it away with a certain amount of energy which is characteristic of green-light photons. Max Planck described Einstein's theory this way: . . . The photons (the \"drops of energy) do not grow smaller as the energy of the ray grows less; what happens is that their magnitude remains unchanged and they follow each other at greater intervals. 2 Einstein's theory also substantiated Planck's revolutionary discovery. High-frequency light, like violet, is made of higher-energy photons than low-frequency light, like red. Therefore, when violet light, which is made of high-energy photons, strikes an electron, it causes the electron to rebound with a high velocity. When red light, which is made of low- energy photons, strikes an electron, it causes the electron to rebound at a low velocity. In either case, increasing or de- creasing the intensity of the light increases or decreases the number of rebounding electrons, but only by changing the color of the impinging light can we change their velocity. In short, Einstein demonstrated, using the photoelectric effect, that light is made of particles, or photons, and that the photons of high-frequency light have more energy than the photons of low-frequency light. This was a momentous achieve- ment. The only problem w«s that one hundred and two years earlier an Englishman named Thomas Young had shown that light is made of waves, and no one, including Einstein, was able to disprove him.

A ——————— WAVE LENGTH —————————frj DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT A wavelength is the distance between one crest of a wave and the next. The longest radio waves are over six miles long. X-rays, on the other hand, are only about one billionth of a centimeter long. Visible light has wavelengths in the neigh- borhood of four to eight one hundred thousandths of a centi- meter.

If the wave is moving in the direction of the arrow and a crest passes point A each second, the frequency of the wave is one cycle per second. If ten and one half crests pass point A every second, the frequency of the wave is 10.5 cycles per second. If ten thousand crests pass the same point every second, the frequency of the wave is 10,000 cycles per second, and so on. The velocity of the wave can be determined by multiplying the wavelength by the frequency. For example, if the wave- length of a wave is two feet and the frequency of the wave is one cycle per second, the wave is moving one wavelength (two feet) every second. Therefore, its velocity is two feet per second. If the wavelength is two feet and the frequency is three cycles per second, the velocity of the wave is six feet per second because the wave moves three wavelengths for- ward every second. There is nothing complicated about this. We can determine how fast a man is running if we know the length of his stride and how many of them he takes in a second. By multiplying them together we get how far the man runs in a second. If his stride is three feet and he takes two strides per second, then he runs six feet per second (about four miles per hour). We do the same things with waves, except that we use wavelengths instead of strides. Although the velocity of a light wave can be determined by multiplying its wavelength by its frequency, it is not neces- sary. Physicists have discovered that the velocity of light in empty space is always 186,000 miles per second. This applies to all electromagnetic waves, including light. Therefore, all light waves (blue ones, green ones, red ones, etc.) have the same velocity as radio waves, x-rays, and all the other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The speed of light is a constant. It is represented by the letter \"c.\" The constant \"c\" is (approximately) 186,000 miles per second and it never varies (which is what makes it a \"constant\"). It does not matter whether light is going up or down, has a high frequency or a low frequency, a large wavelength or a small wavelength, is coming toward us or going away from us: Its velocity is always 186,000 miles per second. This fact led Albert Einstein to the theory of special relativity, as we shall see later."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"LIVING? / 57 It also permits us to know both the frequency and the wavelength of light if we know either one of them. This is because the product of the two is always 186,000 miles per second in empty space. The larger one of them is, the smaller the other must be. For example, if we know that by multiply- ing two numbers together we get 12 for an answer, and if we know that one of the numbers is 6, then we also know that the other number must be 2. If we know that one of the numbers is 3, then we know that the other number must be 4. Similarly, the higher the frequency of a light wave, the shorter its wavelength must be; the lower the frequency of a light wave, the longer its wavelength must be. In other words, high-frequency light has a short wavelength and low-frequency light has a long wavelength. Now we return to Planck's discovery. Planck discovered that the energy of a light quantum increases with frequency. The higher the frequency, the higher the energy. Energy is proportional to frequency, and Planck's constant is the \"con- stant of proportionality\" between them. This simple relation between frequency and energy is important. It is central to quantum mechanics. The higher the frequency, the higher the energy; the lower the frequency, the lower the energy. When we put wave mechanics and Planck's discovery to- gether we get this: High-frequency light, such as violet light, has a short wavelength and high energy; low-frequency light, such as red light, has a long wavelength and low energy. This explains the photoelectric effect. Photons of violet light knock electrons loose from the atoms of a metal and send them flying away at a higher velocity than photons of red light because the photons of violet light, which is a high-frequency light, have more energy than the photons of red light, which is a low-frequency light. This all makes sense if you overlook the fact that we are talking about particles (photons) in terms of waves (frequen- cies) and waves in terms of particles, which, of course, makes no sense at all.

When this happens it is called diffraction. Imagine that we are in a helicopter hovering over the mouth of an artificial harbor. The mouth of the harbor is wide enough for two aircraft carriers to pass each other going through it. The sea is rough and the wind and waves are blowing straight into the mouth of the harbor. When we look down, this is the pattern that we see the waves making in the harbor: The waves are stopped cleanly by the walls of the harbor except at the harbor entrance, where they continue straight forward into the harbor until they are dissipated. Now imagine that the mouth of the harbor is so small that a rowboat scarcely can pass through it. As we look down from the helicopter, the pattern we see is quite different."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"LIVING? / 59 Instead of moving directly ahead into the harbor, the waves inside the harbor are spreading out from the mouth of the harbor almost as if it were a pond and we had dropped a rock into it at that point. This is diffraction. Why does it happen? Why does reducing the size of the harbor mouth cause the wave pattern inside the harbor to spread out in semicircles? The answer lies in comparing the size of the harbor mouth to the size of the wavelength of the incoming waves. In the first case, the size of the harbor mouth is considerably larger than the distance between the crests of the waves going through it, and the waves proceed directly through it into the harbor following a straight line (rectilinear propagation) as waves usually do. In the second case, the size of the harbor mouth is about the same size, or smaller, than the wavelength of the incom- ing waves, and when this happens, it causes the characteristic pattern (diffraction) that we see in the drawing. Whenever waves pass through an opening that is so small that the wavelength of the waves passing through it seems large in comparison, the waves passing through it diffract. Since light is a wave phenomenon (according to the wave theory of light), it should behave in the same way, and it does. If we place a light source behind a cut-out like the one below, it casts a projection on the wall like this one: This is analogous to sea waves entering the large harbor mouth. The width of the cut-out is millions of times larger than the wavelength of the light. As a result, the light waves go straight through it, following straight lines and projecting onto the wall a figure with the same shape as the cut-out. Notice especially that this projection has distinct borders be- tween the bright area and the dark area."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"60 / PATTERNS OF ORGANIC ENERGY If we make the cut-out no larger than a razor slit so that its width is roughly as small as the wavelength of the incoming light, the light diffracts Now the sharp boundary between the light area and the dark area disappears and we see a bright area that fades into darkness at the edges Instead of proceeding in a straight line to the wall, the light beam has spread out like a fan This is diffracted light Now that you know the punch line, here comes the storv In 1803, Thomas Young settled once and for all (he thought) the question of the nature of light He used an experiment that was both simple and dramatic In front of a light source (Young used sunlight coming through a hole in a screen) he placed a screen with two vertical slits in it Each slit could be covered over with a piece of material SUN LIGHT /TOP } | VIEW j LIGHT SOURCE On the other side of the double-slit screen was a wall against which the light coming through the double slits could shine When the light source was turned on and one of the slits was covered up the wall was illuminated like the first drawing on the next page When both slits were uncovered however, Young made historv The projection on the wall should have been the sum of the light from the two slits, but it wasn't Instead, the wall"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"LIVING? / 61 was illuminated \\vith alternating bands of light and darkness' The center band was the brightest On both sides ot the center band of light were bands of darkness then bands of light but less intense than the tenter band then bands of darknt ss etc as b( low How could this happen^ The simplicity of the answer is what makes this experiment a great one The alternating light and dark bands are a well- known phenomenon of wave mechanics called interference Interference results when the waves of light diffracting from the two slits interfere with each other In some places these"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"62 / PATTERNS OF ORGANIC ENERGY waves overlap and reinforce one another In othei places they cancel each other In areas where one wave crest overlaps another wave crest, the result is an intensification of light (the light bands) In areas where a crest meets a trough, they cancel each other and no light reaches the wall (the dark bands) It is just as if we dropped two stones into a pond simulta- neouslv and watched the waves spreading from their points of entry The waves that the stones make interfere with each other In places where the crests of the waves caused by one stone meet the crests of the waves caused by the other stone, large waves result In places where the troughs of the waves caused by one stone meet the crests of the waves caused by the other stone, the water is calm In short Young's double-slit experiment showed that light must be wave-like because only waves can create interference patterns The situation, then, was as follows Einstein, using the photoelectric effect, \"proved\" that light is particle-like and Young, using the phenomenon of interference, \"proved\" that light is wave-like But a wave cannot be a particle and a particle cannot be a wave That is just the beginning' Since Einstein \"proved\" that light is composed of photons, let us go back to Young's double-slit experiment and run it with photons * (This has been done) Suppose that we have a light gun which can fire, in effect, one photon at a tune The experiment is set up as before, except that only one slit is open Now we fire the photon, it goes through the open slit, and we mark where it hits the wall 'using a photographic plate) Because we have done this experiment before, \\ve notice that the photon has landed in an area that would be dark if the second slit were open That is, if the second slit were open, no photons would be recorded in this area To make siue, we do the experiment again, but this time we leave both of the slits open Just as we thought, there ire no photons recorded now in the area where the photon hit in oui fust experiment When both slits are open and interfer- ence is present, this area is in the middle of a dark band The question is, Hou. did the photon in the first evpenment know that the second slit was not open?

the end of the \"Either-Or\" way of looking at the world Physicists no longer could accept the pioposition that light is either a particle or a wave because they had \"proved to themselves that it was

doesn t explain anything The wave-particle duality prompted the first real step in understanding the newly unfolding quantum theory In 1924, Bohr and two of his colleagues, H A Kramers and John Slater, suggested that the waves in question were probability twines Probability waves were mathematical entities by which physicists could predict the probability of certain e\\ ents oc- curring or not occurring Their mathematics did not prove correct but their idea, which was unlike anything that had been proposed before, was sound Later, with a different formalism (mathematical structure), the

been actualized. It referred to a tendency to happen, a tendency that in an undefined way existed of itself, even if it never became an event. Probability waves were mathematical cata- logues of these tendencies. This was something quite different from classical probability. If we throw a die in a casino, we know, using classical probab'lity, that the chances of getting the number that we want is one in six. The probability wave of Bohr, Kramers, and Slater meant much more than that. According to Heisenberg: It meant a tendency for something. It was a quantitative version of the old concept of \"potentia\" in Aristotelian philosophy. It introduced something standing in the mid- dle between the idea of an event and the actual event, a strange kind of physical reality just in the middle be- tween possibility and reality. 5 By 1924, Planck's discovery of the quantum was producing seismic effects in physics. It enabled Einstein to discover the photon, which caused the wave-particle duality, which led to probability waves. The physics of Newton was a thing of the past. Physicists found themselves dealing with energy that some- how processed information (which made it organic), and unaccountably presented itself in patterns (waves). In short, physicists found themselves dealing with Wu Li—patterns of organic energy."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 What Happens Quantum mechanics is a procedure. It is a specific way of looking at a specific part of reality. The only people who use it are physicists. The advantage of following the procedure of quantum mechanics is that it allows us to predict the proba- bilities of certain results provided our experiment is performed in a certain way. The purpose of quantum mechanics is not to predict what actually will happen, but only to predict the probabilities of various possible results. Physicists would like to be able to predict subatomic events more accurately, but, at present, quantum mechanics is the only workable theory of subatomic phenomena that they have been able to construct. Probabilities follow deterministic laws in the same way that macroscopic events follow deterministic laws. There is a di- rect parallel. If we know enough about the initial conditions of an experiment, we can calculate, using rigid laws of develop- ment, exactly what the probability is for a certain result to occur. For example, there is no way that we can calculate where a single photon in a double-slit experiment will strike the pho- tographic plate (page 64). However, we can calculate with precision the probability that it will strike it at a certain place, provided that the experiment has been prepared properly and that the results are measured properly. Suppose that we calculate a 60 percent probability for the photon to land in area A. Does that mean that it can land somewhere else? Yes. In fact, there is a 40 percent probability that it will. 67"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"68 / PATTERNS OF ORGANIC ENERGY In that case (asking the question for Jim de Wit), what determines where the photon will land? The answer given by quantum theory pure chance This pure-chance aspect was another objection that Einstein had about quantum mechanics It is one of the reasons that he never accepted it as the fundamental physical theory 'Quantum mechanics is very impressive,\" he wrote in a letter to Max Born, \" but I am convinced that God does not play dice \"' Two generations later, J S Bell, a Scotish physicist, proved that he may have been right, but that is another story, which we will come to later The first step in the procedure of quantum mechanics is to prepare a physical system (the experimental apparatus) accord- ing to certain specifications, in an area called the region of preparation The second step in the procedure of quantum mechanics is to prepare another physical system to measure the results of the experiment This measuring system is located in an area called the region of measurement Ideally, the region of meas- urement is far away from the region of preparation Of course, to a subatomic particle, even a small macroscopic distance is a long way Now let us perform the double-slit experiment using this procedure First, we set a light source on a table, and then, a short distance away, we place a screen with two vertical slits in it The area where these apparatuses are located is the region of preparation Next we fix an unexposed photographic plate on the opposite side of the screen from the light source This area is the region of measurement The third step in the procedure of quantum mechanics is to translate what we know about the apparatus in the region of preparation (the light and the screen) into mathematical terms which represent it, and to do likewise for the apparatus that is located in the region of measurement (the photographic plate) To do this we need to know the specifications of the appara- tus In practice, this means that we give the technician who sets up the equipment precise instructions We tell him, for example, the exact distance to place the double-slit screen from the light source, the frequency and intensity of the light that we will use, the dimensions of the two slits and their position relative to each other and

Many do, in particular Henry Stapp, and their reasoning goes like this. The fundamental theoretical quantity in quantum mechan- ics is the wave function. The wave function is a dynamic (it changes as time progresses) description of possible occurrences. But what does the wave function describe, really? According to western thought, the world has only two essential aspects, one of which is matter-like and the other of which is idea-like. The matter-like aspect is associated with the external world, most of which is conceived to be made of inanimate stuff that is hard and unresponsive, like rocks, pavement, metal, etc. The idea-like aspect is our subjective experience. Reconciling these two has been a central theme of religion through histo- ry. The philosophies which champion these aspects are Mate- rialism (the world is matter-like, regardless of our impressions) and Idealism (reality is idea-like, regardless of appearances). The question is, which one of these aspects does the wave function represent? The answer, according to the orthodox view of quantum mechanics elucidated by Stapp, is that the wave function represents something that partakes of both idea-like and matter-like characteristics.! For example, when the observed system as represented by the wave function propagates in isolation between the region of preparation and the region of measurement, it develops * The wave function is the physicist's desciiption of teality At issue is the interpretation of the wave function and whether it is the best possible descnp tion (or simpl) the only one that fits the language used bv physicists) t The wave function, since it is a tool for 0111 undei standing of nature, is something m our thoughts It represents certain specifications of certain physical systems Specifications are objective in the sense that scientists and technicians can agiee on them Howevei, specifications do not exist apait horn thought Also, any given physical system satisfies many sets of specifications, and many physi- cal systems can satisfy one set of specifications All of these characteristics are idea-like and, to that extent, that which is represented bv the wave function is idea-like, even though it is objective However, these specifications aie transcribed into wave functions that de- velop according to a determined law {the Schiodmgei wave equation) This is a matter-like aspect The thing that develops describes onlv probabilities Probabilities can be thought to describe either things that exist apart from thought, or things that exist only within thought Thus that which the wave function represents ha& both idea-like and matter-like characteristics"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"WHAT HAPPENS / 81 according to a strictly deterministic law (the Schrodinger wave equation). Temporal development in accordance with a causal law is a matter-like characteristic. Therefore, whatever the wave function represents, that something has a matter-like aspect. However, when the observed system as represented by the wave function interacts with the observing system (when we make a measurement), it abruptly leaps to a new state. These \"Quantum Leap\" type transitions are idea-like characteristics. Ideas (like our knowledge about something) can and do change discontinuously. Therefore, whatever the wave function represents, that something also has an idea-like aspect. The wave function, strictly speaking, represents an observed system in a quantum mechanical experiment. In more general terms, it describes physical reality at the most fundamental level (the subatomic) that physicists have been able to probe. In fact, according to quantum mechanics, the wave function is a complete description of physical reality at that level. Most physicists believe that a description of the substructure underlying experience more complete than the wave function is not possible. \"Wait a minute!\" says Jim de Wit (where did he come from?). \"The description contained in the wave function con- sists of coordinates (three, six, nine, etc.) and a time (page 75). How can that be a complete description of reality? Imag- ine how I felt when my girl friend ran off to Mexico with a gypsy. Where does that show up in a wave function?\" It doesn't. The \"complete description\" that quantum theory claims the wave function to be is a description of physical reality (as in physics). No matter what we are feeling, or thinking about, or looking at, the wave function describes as completely as possible where and when we are doing it. Since the wave function is thought to be a complete de- scription of physical reality and since that which the wave function describes is idea-like as well as matter-like, then physical reality must be both idea-like and matter-like. In other words, the world cannot be as it appears. Incredible- as it sounds, this is the conclusion of the orthodox view of quantum mechanics. The physical world appears to be com- pletely substantive (made of \"stuff\"). Nonetheless, if it has an idea-like aspect, the physical world is not substantive in the usual sense of the word (one hundred percent matter, -zero percent idea).

the conclusion that the physical world itself is not This claim at first appears so preposterous and remote from experience that our inclination is to discard it as the foolish product of cloistered

That is, each person, psychologically speaking, was recognized as being the center of the universe. Although this sounds like an egotistical point of view, it was not since every person was recognized as a divine manifestation.

To dance with god, the creator of all things, is to dance with ourselves. This is a recurrent theme of eastern literature. This is also the direction toward which the new physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, seems to point. From the revolutionary concepts of relativity and the logic-defying paradoxes of quantum mechanics an ancient paradigm is emerging.

This meant that they had less energy after the collision than they had before the collision. Compton s x-rays were impacting with electrons exactly the way that billiard balls impact with other billiard balls. Compton's discovery was intimately related to quantum theory. Compton could not have revealed the particle-like behavior of x-rays if Planck had not discovered his fundamental rule that higher frequency means higher energy. This rule permitted Compton to prove that the x-rays in his experiment lost energy in a particle-like collision (because their frequen- cies were lower after the collision than before the collision). The conceptual paradox in Compton's experiment shows how deeply the wave-particle duality is embedded in quantum mechanics. Compton proved that electromagnetic radiations, like x-rays, have particle-like characteristics by measuring their frequencies! Of course, \"particles\" don't have frequencies. Only waves have frequencies. The phenomenon which Compton discovered is called Compton scattering, in honor of what happens to the x-rays.

Since particle-like behavior and wave-like behavior are the only properties that we ascribe to light, and since these properties now are recognized to belong (if complementarity is correct) not to light itself, but to our interaction with light, then it appears that light has no properties independent of us! To say that something has no properties is the same as saying that it does not exist. The next step is this logic is inescapable. Without us, light does not exist. Transferring the properties that we usually ascribe to light to our interaction with light deprives light of an independent existence. Without us, or by implication, anything else to interact with, light does not exist. This remarkable conclusion is only half the story. The other half is that, in a similar manner, without light, or, by implication, anything else to interact with, we do not exist] As Bohr himself put it: ... an independent reality in the ordinary' physical sense can be ascribed neither to the phenomena nor to the agencies of observation. 1 By \"agencies of observation,\" he may have been referring to instruments, not people, but philosophically, complemen- tarity leads to the conclusion that the world consists not of things, but of interactions.

To obtain the probability of a given state we square (multiply by itself) the amplitude of the matter wave associated with the state. The question of whether de Broglie's equations and Schro- dinger's equations represent real things or abstractions was clear to Born. It did not make sense to him to try to think of a real thing that exists in more than three dimensions. We have two possibilities. Either we use waves in spaces of more than three dimensions ... or we remain in three- dimensional space, but give up the simple picture of the wave amplitude as an ordinary physical magnitude, and replace it by a purely abstract mathematical concept . . . into which we cannot enter. 6 This is exactly what he did. \"Physics,\" he wrote, is in the nature of the case indeterminate, and therefore the affair of statistics. 7 This is the same idea (probability waves) that Bohr, Kramers, and Slater had thought of earlier. This time, however, using the mathematics of de Broglie and Schrodinger, the numbers came out right. Born's contribution to Schrodinger's theory is what enables quantum mechanics to predict probabilities. Since the proba- bility of a state is found by squaring the amplitude of the matter wave associated with it, and, given initial conditions, the Schrodinger equation predicts the evolution of these wave patterns, the two taken together give a determinable evolution of probabilities.

In other words, the \"probability\" of quantum mechanics is the probability of observing an ob- served system in a given state at a given time if it was prepared in a given initial state.* Thus it was that the wave aspect of quantum mechanics deVeloped. Just as waves have particle-like characteristics (Planck, Einstein), particles also have wave-like characteristics (de Broglie). In fact, particles can be understood in terms of standing waves (Schrodinger). Given initial conditions, a precise evolution of standing-wave patterns can be calculated via the Schrodinger wave equation. Squaring the amplitude of a mat- ter wave (wave function) gives the probability of the state that corresponds to that wave (Born). Therefore, a sequence of probabilities can be calculated from initial conditions by using the Schrodinger wave equation and Horn's simple formula. We have come a long way from Galileo's experiments with falling bodies. Each step along the path has taken us to a higher level of abstraction: first to the creation of things that no one has ever seen (like electrons), and then to the aban- donment of all attempts even to picture our abstractions. The problem is, however, that human nature being what it is, we do not stop trying to picture these abstractions. We keep asking \"What are these abstractions of?\", and then we try to visualize whatever that is. Earlier we dismissed Bohr's planetary model of the atom with the promise that we later would see \"how physicists currently think of an atom.\" Well, the time has come, but the task is a thorny one. We gave up our old picture of the atom so easily because we assumed that it would be replaced by one more meaningful, but equally as lucid. Now it develops that our replacement picture is not a picture at all, but an unvisualizable abstraction. This is uncomfortable because it reminds us that atoms were never \"real\" things anyway.

matrix me- chanics, Schrodmger discovered that it was mathematically equivalent to his own wave mechanics Since both of these theories were valuable tools for subatomic research, both of them were incorporated into the new branch of physics which became known as quantum mechanics Much later, Heisenberg applied matrix mathematics to the particle collision experiments of high-energy particle physics Because such collisions always result in a scattering of parti- cles, it was called the Scattering Matrix, which was shortened to the S Matrix Today, physicists have two ways to calculate the transition probabilities between what they obsen e at the beginning of a quantum mechanical experiment and what they observe at the end of it The first method is the Schrodmger wave equation, and the second method !« the S Matrix The Schrodmger wave equation describes a temporal development of possibilities, one of which suddenly actualizes when we make a measurement in the course of a quantum

Heisenberg's remarkable discovery was that there are limits beyond which we cannot measure accurately, at the same time, the processes of nature These limits are not imposed by the clumsy nature of our measuring devices or the extremely small sue of the entities that we attempt to meas- ure, but rather by the very wav that nature presents itself to us' In other words, there exists an ambiguity barnet beyond which we never can pass without venturing into the realm of uncertainty For this reason, Heisenberg s discovery became known as the ' uncertainty principle ' The uncertainty principle reveals that as we penetrate deeper and deeper into the subatomic realm wt reach a certain point at which one part or another of our picture of natuie becomes blurred, and there is no way to reclanfy that part without blurring another part of the picture' It is as though we are adjusting a moving picture that is slightly out of focus As we make the final adjustments, we are astonished to discover that when the right side of the picture clears, the left side of the picture becomes completely unfocused and nothing in it is recognizable When we try to focus the left side of the pic- ture, the right side starts to blur and soon the situation is reversed If we try to strike a balance between these two extremes, both sides of the picture return to a recognizable condition, but in no way can we remove the original fu/zmess from them The right sidf of the picture, in the original formulation of the uncertainty principle, corresponds to the position in space of a mov ing particle The left

know about its momentum If we precisely determine the momentum of the particle, there is no wav to determine its position To illustrate this strange statement, Heisenbeig proposed that we imagine a

light waves bend around it instead of being obstructed by it To see something, we have to obstruct the light waves we are looking with In other words, to see something, we have to illuminate it with wavelengths smaller than it is For this reason, Heisenberg substituted gamma rays for visible light in his imaginary mi- croscope Gamma rays have the shortest wavelength known, which is just what we need for seeing an electron An electron is large enough, compared to the tiny wavelength of gamma rays, to obstruct some of them to make a shadow on the wall, as it were This enables us to locate the electron The only problem and this is where quantum phvsics enters the picture, is that, according to Planck s discovery, gamma rays which have a much shorter wavelength than visible light, also contain much more energy than visible light When a gamma ray strikes the imaginary electron, it illuminates the electron, but unfortunately, it also knocks it out of its orbit and changes its direction and speed (its momentum) in an unpredictable and uncontrollable way (We cannot calculate precisely the angle of rebound between a particle, like the electron, and a wave, like the gamma ray)

Th'e child in us is always naive, innocent in the simplistic sense. A Zen story tells of Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era who received a university professor. The professor came to inquire about Zen. Nan-in served tea. He poured his visitor's cup full, and then kept on pouring. The professor watched the overflow until he no longer could restrain him- self. \"It is overfull. No more will go in!\" \"Like this cup,\" Nan-in said, \"you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?\" Our cup usually is filled to the brim with \"the obvious,\" \"common sense,\" and \"the self-evident.\" Suzuki Roshi, who established the first Zen center in the United States (without trying, of course, which is very Zen), told his students that it is not difficult to attain enlightenment, but it is difficult to keep a beginner's mind. \"In the beginner's mind,\" he told them, \"there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are few.\" When his students published Suzuki's talks after his death, they called the book, appropriately, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind. In the introduction, Baker Roshi, the American Zen Master, wrote: The mind of the beginner is empty, free of the habits of the expert, ready to accept, to doubt, and open to all the possibilities. . . .'

This confidence is not the obstinacy of the fool, but the surety of him who knows what he knows, and knows also that he can convey it to others in a meaningful way. The writer, Henry Miller, wrote: 1 obey only my own instincts and intuition. I know nothing in advance. Often I put down things which I do not understand myself, secure in the knowledge that later they will become clear and meaningful to me.

I don't even know what it's going to say An example of this kind of faith in the realm of physics was the theory of light quanta. In 1905, the accepted and proven theory of light was that light was a wave phenomenon. In spite of this, Einstein published his famous paper proposing that light was a particle phenomenon (page 52). Heisenberg described this fascinating situation this way: [In 1905] light could either be interpreted as consisting of electromagnetic waves, according to Maxwell's theory, or as consisting of light quanta, energy packets traveling through space with high velocity [according to Einstein]. But could it be both? Einstein knew, of course, that the well-known phenomena of diffraction and interference can be explained only on the basis of the wave picture. He was not able to dispute the complete contradiction be- tween this wave picture and the idea of the light quanta; nor did he even attempt to remove the inconsistency of this interpretation. He simply took the contradiction as something which would probably be understood much later. 4 That is exactly what happened.

not so much about what is relative as about what is not It describes in what way the relative aspects of physical reahtv appear to vary depending upon the point of view of different observers (actually depending upon their state of motion relative to each other) but, in the process, it defines the non-changing, absolute aspect of physi- cal reality as well The special theory of relativity

us (very fast) as being only ten inches long What may appear to us as one hour, may appear to an observer traveling past us (very fast) as two hours However, the moving observer can use the special

essence the special theory of relativity is not about what is relative, it is about what is absolute However, the special theory of relativity does show that appearances are dependent upon the state of motion of the observers For example the special theory of relativity tells us that (1) a moving object measures shorter in its direction of motion as its velocity increases until, at the speed of light it disappears (2) the mass of a moving object measures more as its velocity increases until at the speed of light it becomes infinite and (3) moving clocks run more slowly as their velocity increases until at the speed of light they stop running alto- gether All of this is from the point of view of an observer to whom the object is moving To an observer traveling along with the moving object, the clock keeps perfect time ticking off sixtv seconds each minute and nothing appears to get any shorter or more massive The special theory of relativity also tells us that space and time are

In fact, if light is assumed to be a wave phenomenon governed by a wave equation, it is expected that its measured velocity will be independent of the velocity of its source. The velocity of the sound waves reaching us from a jet plane, for example, does not depend upon the velocity of the aircraft.

It just doesn't make sense.\" The problem of absolute non-motion and the problem of the constancy of the speed of light converged in the Michel- son-Morley experiment. The Michelson-Morley experiment (1887) was a crucial experiment. A crucial experiment is an experiment which determines the life or death of a scientific theory. The theory that was tested by the Michelson-Morley experiment was the theory of the ether. The theory of the ether was that the entire universe lies in and is permeated by an invisible, tasteless, odorless substance that has no properties at all, and exists simply because it has to exist so that light waves can have something to propagate in. For light to travel as waves, according to the theory, something has to be waving. That something was the ether. The theory of the ether was the last attempt to explain the universe by explaining someffotng. Interpreting the universe in terms of things (like the Great Machine idea) was the distinguishing characteristic of the mechanical view, which means all of physics from Newton until the middle 1800s. The ether, according to the theory, is everywhere and in everything. We live and perform our experiments in a sea of ether. To the ether, the hardest substance is as porous as a sponge to water. There are no doors to the ether. Although we move in the ether sea, the ether sea does not move. It is absolutely, unequivocally not moving. Therefore, although the primary reason for the existence of the ether was to give light something to propagate through, its existence also solved the old problem of locating the origi- nal inertial co-ordinate system, that frame of reference in which the laws of mechanics are completely valid. If the ether existed (and it had to exist), the co-ordinate system attached to it was the co-ordinate system against which all others could be com- pared to see if they were moving or not. The findings of Michelson and Morley gave a verdict of e.g., the Doppler effect). Pre-relativity theory assumes a medium (like the atmosphere, for sound w«ves, or the ether, for light waves) through which the waves propagate. The paradox is that the measured velocity of light has been found (the Michelsou-Morley experiment) to be independent of the motion of the observer. In other words, assuming a light wave propagating through a medium, how can we move through the same medium toward the approaching wave without increasing its measured velocity?"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"130 / NONSENSE death to the theory of the ether * Equally important, they led to the mathematical foundations of Einstein s revolutionary new theory The idea of the Michelson-Morley experiment was to de- termine the motion of the earth through the ether sea The problem was how to do this Two ships at sea can determine their motion relative to one another, but if only one ship moves through a smooth sea, it has no reference point against which to measure its progress In the old days, seamen would throw a log overboard, and measure their progress relative to it Michelson and Morley did the same thing, except that the log that they threw overboard was a beam of light Their experiment was conceptually simple and ingenious If the earth is moving thev reasoned, and the ether sea is at rest, then the movement of the earth through the ether sea must cause an ether breeze Therefore, a beam of light traveling against the ether breeze should have a slower velocity than a beam of light sent across the ether breeze This is the essence of the Michelson-Morlev experiment Every pilot knows that it takes longer to fly a given distance if one leg of the trip is against a head wind (even though the return leg is with a tail wind) than it takes to fly the same distance across the same wind Similarly, thought Michelson and Morley, if the theory of the ether sea is correct, a light beam sent upstream against the ether breeze and then downstream with it will take longer to return to its starting point than a light beam sent back and forth across the either breeze To establish and detect this difference in velocity, Michelson and Morley created a device called an interferometer (from the word, ' interference ) It was designed to detect the inter- ference pattern created by the two beams of light as they returned to a common point A light source emits a beam of light toward a half-silvered mirror (similar to the lenses in sunglasses that look like a mirror on one side, but are transparent from the other side ) The original beam of light ( ~ ~~ ~ >) is split by the half- silvered mirror into two segments (————^) ( - - -

measuring device, any difference in velocity between them can be determined accurately When the experiment was performed, not the slightest dif- ference in velocity could be detected between the two

ether set, just as it carries its atmosphere with it as it travels through space and, therefore, close to the surface of the earth, the ether breeze cannot be detected No one had a better hypoth- esis until an Irishman named George Francis FitzGerald proposed (in 1892) an outrageous explanation FitzGerald reasoned that perhaps the pressure of the ether wind compresses matter just as an elastic object moving through water becomes shortened in the direction that it is traveling If this were true, then the arm of the interferometer pointing into the ether wind would be somewhat shorter than the arm that is not pointing into it Therefore, a reduction in the velocity of the light traveling into the ether wind and back might not be detected because the distance that the light travels also is reduced In fact, if the amount by which the interferometer arm pointing into the ether wind is shortened just corresponds to the amount by which the velocity of the light traveling up that arm and back is reduced, then both beams of light in the experiment will reach the measuring device at exactly the same time (the beam with the higher velocity traversing a greater distance in the same time that the beam with the slower velocity traverses a lesser distance) FitzGerald's hypothesis had a major advantage over all the others It was impossible to disprove It said simplv that there is a one-dimensional contraction (in the direction of motion) that increases as velocity increases The catch is that everything contracts If we want to measure the length of an object that is moving very fast compared to the speed of light, we have to catch up with it first, and when we do, according to the theory, the measuring stick that we are carrying with us also contracts If the object measured seventeen inches at rest, it still would measure seventeen inches Nor would anything look contracted because the lenses in our eyes also would contract, distorting them just enough to make everything look normal One year later a Dutch physicist, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, while working on another problem, independently arrived at FitzGerald's hypothesis Lorentz, however, expressed his discovery in

Plato's famous parable of the cave describes a group of people who are chained inside a cave in such a way that they can see only the shadows on the wall of the cave These shadows are the only world that these people know One day one of these people escapes into the world outside the cave At first he is blinded by the sunlight, but when he recovers, he realizes that this is the real world, and what he previously considered to be the real world was, in fact, only the projection of the real world onto the wall of the cave (Unfortunately, when he returned to the people who still were chained inside the cave, they thought he was mad) Figure A depicts a view looking down on the top of our head and the top of a sphere The lines connect our eyes with points on either side of the sphere If we are far enough away from the sphere, the distance between these points is almost equal to the diameter of the sphere Figure A is drawn as if the artist were looking down on the top of our head, our eyes, and the sphere"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"SPECIAL NONSENSE / 143 The first step in Terrell's explanation is to draw lines downward (back into the page) from each of the two points on the sphere to a screen direttlv below the sphere Figure B is a side view showing the two points, the lines that we have drawn downward, and the screen (If vou hold this book directly in front of you, your eyes are in the same position relative to the dotted lines as the eyes drawn in Figure A) To understand Terrell's explanation, suppose that the sphere is moving very fast relative to the speed of light from right to left If the sphere moves fast enough, some very interesting things happen For example, before the light from the point on the far left edge of the sphere can reach us, the ball moves in front of it, blocking it from our vision' The reverse happens on the far right The ball moves out from between us and the light signals originating from points that used to be on the \"back\" side of the ball These signals now are visible to us, while the signals coming from the point that used to be on the leading edge of the ball now are blocked by the ball itself as it moves to the left The effect of this is an illusion of sorts What we see is the same thing that we would see if someone had rotated the ball around its axis' Look what happened to the distance between the two points as projected on the screen It is considerably less than when we started The equations in the special theory of relativity (the Lorentz transformations) which show a contraction due to motion describe these projections (Is this beginning to sound like Plato's cave?) The fact that the ball, by moving fast enough, gets in the way of some of its own light signals and out of the way of others causes the ball to appear to rotate This causes the projected distance between any two points on it which are aligned with the direction of motion to decrease, just as if someone really had rotated the ball The faster the ball moves, the more it appears to \"rotate,\" and the closer together come the points projected on the screen It is the projection that contracts Instead of \"screen\" substitute \"view of the ball from our frame of reference\" and we have the

velocity of the object increases Newton would not have hesitated to call this nonsense, but then Newton s experience was limited to velocities that are quite slow compared to the speed of light Classical physics tells us that a specific amount of force is required to increase the velocitv of a moving object by a given amount for example, one foot per second Once we know what that amount of force is, whenever we want to increase the velocity of that particular object by one foot per second, all we need do is apply that amount of force to it If the object has a velocity of 100 feet per second, that specific amount of force will increase its velocity to 101 feet per second Accord- ing to Newton s physics, the same amount of force that in- creases the velocity of an object from 100 feet per second to 101 feet per second also will increase the velocity of the same object from 8,000 feet per second to 8,001 feet per second The problem is that Newtonian phvsics is wrong It takes much more force to increase by one foot per second the velocity of an object moving at 8,000 feet per second than it takes to increase by one foot per second the velocity of the same object moving at 100 feet per second That is because a faster-moving object has more kinetic energy (energy of motion) This additional energy makes it behave exactly as if it had more mass A given amount of force applied for a given amount of time will accelerate a single freight car to a greater velocity than the same amount of force applied for the same amount of time to an entire train Of course, this is because an entire tram has more mass than a single car When particles travel at velocities that are fast relative to the speed of light their high kinetic energy makes them be- have as though they have more mass than they have at lower velocities In fact, the special theory of relativity shows that the effective mass of a moving object does increase with velocity Since most subatomic particles travel at different velocities, each one of them can have many different relative masses Therefore, physicists have calculated the \"rest mass' of each particle The rest mass of a subatomic particle

an extraordinary, concept-shattering Yes There is a big difference Inside the room, we see the bulb flash and we see the light spread out in all directions at the same speed Since the walls of the room are equidistant from the bulb we see the light strike the forward wall and rearward wall of the room simulta- neously The outside observer also sees the flash, and he also sees the light

The irony of the special theory of relativity, as apparent by now, is that it is not about those aspects of reality that are relative, but about those aspects that are not relative. Like quantum mechanics, its impact on the assumptions of New- tonian physics was shattering. Not because it proved them wrong, but because it proved them to be quite limited. The special theory of relativity and quantum mechanics have propelled us into unimaginably expansive areas of reality, areas about which we literally had not one previous idea. The assumptions of Newtonian physics correspond to the clothes we always thought that the Emperor was wearing: a universal time whose uniform passage equally affects every part of the universe, a separate space, independent though empty; and the belief that there exists somewhere in the universe a place which stands absolutely still, quiet and unmoving. Every one of these assumptions has been proven untrue (not useful) by the special theory of relativity. The Emperor wasn't wearing them at all. The only motion in the physical universe is motion relative to something else. There is no separate space and time. Mass and energy are different names for the same thing. In place of these assumptions, the special theory of relativity provides a new and unified physics. Measurements of distance and duration may vary from one frame of reference to an- other, but the space-time interval between events never changes. For all this, however, the special theory of relativity has one shortcoming. It is based on a rather uncommon situation. The special theory of relativity applies only to frames of reference that move uniformly, relative to each other. Most movement, unfortunately, is neither constant nor ideally smooth.

Einstein, to explain the same phenomenon as seen from two different frames of reference, one of them moving uniformly and the other of them moving non-umformly, in such a way that there is a

a co-ordinate system which is moving non-umformlv in terms which are meaningful to an observer in a co-ordinate system which is moving uniformly, and the other way round Can we create one physics that is valid for observers in both frames of reference Yes, discovered Einstein, it is possible for observers m the two different frames of reference to relate in a manner which is both meaningful in terms of their own state of motion and in terms of the other's state of motion To illustrate this, he used another famous thought experiment Imagine an elevator in an extraordinarily tall building The cable which supports the elevator has snapped, and the elevator is plummeting downward Inside the elevator are several phys- icists They are not aware that the cable has broken, and, since there are no windows, they cannot look outside The question is, what is the appraisal of this situation by the observers on the outside of the elevator (us) and by the observers on the inside of the elevator (the physicists) Since this is an idealized experiment, we can disregard the effects of friction and the resistance of the air To us, the situation is apparent The elevator is falling and soon it will strike the earth and all of its inhabitants will be dead As the elevator falls, it accelerates according to Newton's law of gravity The motion of the elevator is not uniform, but accelerated, because of the gravitational field of the earth We can predict many things that might happen inside the elevator For example, if someone inside the elevator dropped a handkerchief, nothing would happen It would appear to the inside observers to float where it was released because it would be accelerating toward the earth at the same rate as the elevator and the people inside of it Nothing really would be floating, everything would be falling, but, since everything would be falling at the same rate, there would be no change in their relative positions To a generation of physicists born and brought

someone gives a floating object a shove, off it goes in a straight line until it hits the side of the elevator To the observers inside the elevator, there are no forces acting on any objects inside

results which agree exactly with theoretical predictions An object at rest remains at rest An object n motion remains in motion Moving objects are deflected from their paths only by forces which are proportional to the amount of deflection For every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction If we give a shove to a floating chair, it goes off in one direction, and we go off in the oppo-

ending their existence abruptly According to the special theory of relativity, moreover, it is significant that the elevator is limited in size because other- wise it would not appear to its

remain there This,"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"164 /NONSENSE to the outside observer, is because they are falling parallel to each other. However, if the elevator were the size of Texas and the baseballs were as far apart when they were dropped as Texas is wide, the baseballs would not fall parallel to each other. They would converge, since each of them would be drawn by gravity to the center of the earth. The observers inside the elevator would notice that the baseballs, and any other floating objects in the elevator, move toward each other with the passage of time, as though there were a mutual attraction between them. This mutual attraction would appear as a \"force\" affecting the objects in the elevator, and the physicists inside hardly would conclude, under those circum- stances, that they were in an inertial co-ordinate system. In short, if it is small enough, a co-ordinate system falling in a gravitational field is the equivalent of an inertial co- ordinate system. This is Einstein's principle of equivalence. It is a telling piece of mental dexterity. Anything like an \"inertial co-ordinate system\" that can be \"wiped out\" 2 (Einstein's words) by the assumption of a gravitational field hardly deserves to be called absolute (as in \"absolute motion,\" and \"absolute non-motion\"). While the observers inside the elevator exper- ience a lack of motion and the absence of gravity, the observ- ers outside the elevator see a co-ordinate system (the elevator) accelerating through a gravitational field Now let us imagine a variation of this situation. Assume that we, the outside observers, are in an inertial co-ordinate system. We already know what happens in inertial co-ordinate systems; the same things that happened in the falling elevator. There are no forces, including gravity, to affect us. Therefore, let us assume that we are comfortably floating. Objects at rest remain at rest, objects in motion continue in a straight line forever, and every action produces an equal and opposite reaction. In our inertial co-ordinate system is an elevator. Someone has attached a rope to the elevator and is pulling it in the direction indicated (next page). Since this is a thought experi- ment, it does not matter how this is done. The elevator- is being pulled with a constant force, which means that it is in a state of constant acceleration in the direction of the arrow.

Everything inside the elevator that is not attached quickly collides with the floor of the elevator. If someone in the elevator drops a handkerchief, the elevator floor rushes up to meet it. If someone in the elevator tries to jump off the floor, the floor, rushing upward, is instantly under his feet again. The floor of the elevator continually crashes into anything in its path as it accelerates upward. Inside the elevator, however, the appraisal of the situation is quite different. To a generation of physicists born and brought up inside the elevator, talk of acceleration upward is fantasy (remember, the elevator has no windows). To them, their co-ordinate system is quite at rest. Objects fall downward to the floor because of a gravitational field, just as objects on the earth fall downward to the floor because of a gravitational field.

earth exerts on an object Newton s laws describe the effects of this force which varv with the distance of the mass from the earth Although Newton s laws describe the effects of this force they do not define it This is the mystery of action-at-a-distance (page 23) How does the earth invisibly reach up and pull objects downward The second type of mass is mertial mass Inertial mass is the measure of the resistance of an object to acceleration (or deceleration which is negative acceleration) For example it takes three times more force to move three railroad cars from a standstill to twenty miles per hour (positive acceleration) than it takes to move one railroad car from a standstill to twenty miles per hour (page 144) Similarly, once they are moving it takes three times more force to stop three cars than it takes to stop the single car This is because the mertial mass of the three railroad cars is three times more than the mertial mass of the single railroad car Inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal This explains why a feather and a cannonball fall with equal velocity in a vacuum The cannonball has hundreds of times more gravita- tional mass than the feather (it weighs more) but it also has hundreds of times more resistance to motion than the feather (its mertial mass) Its attraction to the earth is hundreds of times stronger than that of the feather but then so is its inclination not to move The result is that it accelerates downward at the same rate as the feather although it seems that it should fall much faster The fact that mertial mass and

relativity The coincidence of the equivalence of gravitational mass and mertial mass was the clew 3 to use Einstein s word that led him to the principle of equivalence which refers via the equivalence

examples"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"168 / NONSENSE The special theory of relativity deals with unaccelerated (uniform) motion.* If acceleration is neglected, the special theory of relativity applies. However, since gravity and accel- eration are equivalent, this is the same as saying that the special theory of relativity is applicable whenever gravity is neglected. If the effects of gravity are to be considered, then we must use the general theory of relativity. In the physical world the effects of gravity can be neglected in (1) remote regions of space which are far from any centers of gravity (matter), and (2) in very small regions of space. Why gravity can be ignored in very small regions of space leads to the most psychedelic aspect of all Einstein's theories. Gravity can be ignored in very small regions of space because, if the region is small enough, the mountainous terrain of space- time is not noticeable.! The nature of the space-time continuum is like that of a hilly countryside. The hills are caused by pieces of matter (objects). The larger the piece of matter, the more it curves the space-time continuum. In remote regions of space far from any matter of significant size, the space-time continuum resembles a flat plain. A piece of matter the size of the earth causes quite a bump in the space-time continuum, and apiece of matter the size of a star causes a relative mountain. As an object travels through the space-time continuum, it takes the easiest path between two points. The easiest path between two points in the space-time continuum is called a geodesic (geo dee' sic). A geodesic is not always a straight line owing to the nature of the terrain in which the object finds itself. Suppose that we are in a balloon looking down on a mountain that has a bright beacon on the top of it. The mountain rises gradually out of the plain, and becomes more and more steep as its elevation increases, until, close to the top, it rises al- most straight up.

As the paths approach the mountain, all of them begin to curve in one way or another, to avoid going unnecessarily far up the mountain. Suppose that it is nighttime and that, looking down, we can see neither the mountain nor the footpaths. All that we can see is the beacon and the torches of the travelers below. As we watch, we notice that the torches deflect from a straight path when they approach the vicinity of the beacon. Some of them curve gently around the beacon in a graceful arc some distance away from it. Others approach the beacon more directly, but the closer they get to it, the more sharply they turn away from it. From this, we probably would deduce that some force emanating from the beacon was repelling all attempts to ap- proach it. For example, we might speculate that the beacon is extremely hot and painful to approach. With the coming of daylight, however, we can see that the beacon is situated on the top of a large mountain and that it has nothing whatever to do with the movement of the torch- bearers. They simply followed the easiest paths available to them over the terrain between their points of origin and des- tination. This masterful analogy was created by Bertrand Russell. In this case, the mountain is the sun, the travelers are the planets, asteroids, comets (and debris from the space program), the footpaths are their orbits, and the coming of daylight is the coming of Einstein's general theory of relativity. The point is that the objects in the solar system move as they do not because of some mysterious force (gravity) exerted upon them at a distance by the sun, but because of the nature of the neighborhood through which they are traveling. Arthur Eddington illustrated this same situation in another way. Suppose, he suggested, that we are in a boat looking down into clear water. We can see the sand on the bottom and the fishes swimming beneath us. As we watch, we notice that the fish seem to be repelled from a certain point. As-they approach it, they swim either to the right or to the left of it, but never over it. From this we probably would deduce that there is a repellant force at that point which keeps the fish away. However, if we should go into the water to get a closer look, we would see that an enormous sunfish has buried him-"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"170 / NONSENSE self in the sand at that point,

is not possible for us actually to see the geometiv of the space-time continuum because it is foui-dimensional and our sensory experience is limited to three dimensions For that reason, it is not even possible to picture it For example, suppose that there existed a world of two- dimensional people Such a world would look like a picture on a television or a movie screen The people and the objects in a two-dimensional world would have height and width, but not depth H these two-dimensional figures had a life and an intel- ligence of their own, their world would appear quite different to them than our world appears to us for they could not experience the third dimension A straight line drawn between two of these people would appear to them as a wall They would be able to walk around either end of it, but they would not be able to \"step over' it, because their physical existence is limited to two dimensions They cannot step off the screen into the thud dimension They would know what a circle is, but there is no way that they could know what a sphere is In fact, a sphere would appear to them as a circle If they like to explore, they soon would discover that their world is flat and infinite If two of them went off in opposite directions they would never meet They also could create a simple geometry Sooner or later they would generah/e their experiences into abstractions to help them do and build the things that the> want to do and build in their physical world For example, they would discover that whenever three straight metal bars form a triangle, the"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"GENERAL NONSENSE / 171 angles of the triangle always total 180 degrees Sooner or later, the more perceptive among them would substitute men- tal idealizations (straight lines) for the metal bars That would allow them to arrive at the abstract conclusion that a triangle, which by definition is formed by three straight lines, always contains 180 degrees To learn more about triangles, they no longer would need actually to construct them The geometry that such a two-dimensional people would create is the same geometry that we studied in school It is called Euclidean geometry, in honor of the Greek, Euclid, whose thoughts on the subject were so thorough that no one expanded on them for nearly two thousand vears (The content of most high-school geometry books is about two millennia old) Now let us suppose that someone, unbeknownst to them, transported these two-dimensional people from their flat world onto the surface of an enormously large sphere This means that instead of being perfectly flat, their physical world now would be somewhat curved At first, no one would notice the difference However, if their technology improved enough to allow them to begin to travel and to communicate over great distances these people eventually would make a remarkable discovery They would discover that their geometry could not be verified in their physical world For example, they would discover that if they surveyed a large enough triangle and measured the angles that form it, it would have more than 180 degrees' This is a simple phenom- enon for us to picture Imagine a triangle drawn on a globe The apex (top) of the triangle is at the north pole The two lines intersecting there form a right angle The equator is the base of the triangle Look what happens Both sides of the triangle, upon intersecting the equator, also form right an- gles According to Euclidean geometry, a triangle contains only two right angles (180 degrees), yet this triangle contains three right angles (270 degrees) Remember that in our example, the two-dimensional peo- ple actually have surveyed a triangle on what they presumed was their flat world, measured the angles, and come up with 270 degrees What a confusion When the dust settles they would realize that there are only two possible explanations The first possible explanation is that the straight lines used to construct the triangle (like light beams) were not actually straight, although they seemed to be straight This could ac-"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"172 / NONSENSE count for the excessive number of degrees in the triangle. However, if this is the explanation that they choose to adopt, then they must create a \"force\" responsible for somehow distorting the straight lines (like \"gravity\"). The second possible explanation is that their abstract geometry does not apply to their real world. This is another way of saying that, impossible as it sounds, their universe is not Euclidean. The idea that their physical reality is not Euclidean probably would sound so fantastic to them (especially if they had had no reason to question the reality of Euclidean geometry for two thousand years) that they probably would choose to look for forces responsible for distorting their straight lines. * The problem is that, having chosen this course, they would be obligated to create a responsible force every time that their physical world failed to validate Euclidean geometry. Eventually the structure of these necessary forces would be- come so complex that it would be much simpler to forget them altogether and admit that their physical world does not follow the logically irrefutable rules of Euclidean geometry. Our situation is parallel to that of the two-dimensional peo- ple who cannot perceive, but who can deduce that they are living in a three-dimensional world. We are a three-dimensional people who cannot perceive, but who can deduce that we are living in a four-dimensional universe. For two thousand years we have assumed that the entire physical universe, like the geometry that the ancient Greeks created from their experience with this part of it, was Euclidean. That the geometry of Euclid is universally valid means that it can be verified anywhere in the physical world. That assumption was wrong. Einstein was the first person to see that the universe is not bound by the rules of Euclidean geometry, even though our minds tenaciously cling to the idea that it is. Although we cannot perceive the four-dimensional space- time continuum directly, we can deduce from what we already know of the special theory of relativity that our universe is not Euclidean. Here is another of Einstein's thought experiments. Imagine two concentric circles, one with a small radius and * Eddington expressed this concept most concisely. \"A field offeree represents the discrepancy between the natural geometry of a co-ordinate system and the abstract geometry arbitrarily ascribed to it.\" (Arthur Eddington, The Mathe- matical Theory of Relativity, Cambridge, England, Cambridge University Press, 1923, pp. 37-38. Italics in the original)."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"GENERAL NONSENSE / 173 one with a very large radius. Both of them revolve around a common center as shown. Imagine also that we, the observers, are watching these revolving circles from an inertial co-ordinate system. Being in an inertial co-ordinate system simply means that our frame of reference is at rest relative to everything, including the revolving circles. Drawn over the revolving circles are two identical concentric circles which are in our co-ordinate system. They are not revolving. They are the same size as the revolving circles and have the same common center, but they remain motionless. While we and our non-revolving circles are mo- tionless, we are in communication with an observer who is on the revolving circles. He actually is going around with them. According to Euclidean geometry, the ratio of the radius to the circumference of all circles is the same. If we measure the radius and the circumference of the small circle, for example, the ratio of these two measurements will be the same as the ratio of the radius to the circumference of the large circle. The object of this thought experiment is to determine whether this is true or not for both the observers on the stationary circles (us) and the observer on the revolving circles. If the geometry of Euclid is valid throughout the physical universe, as it should be, we should discover that the ratio between the"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"174 / NONSENSE radius and the circumference of all the circles involved is identical. Both we and the observer on the revolving circles will use the same ruler to do our measuring. \"The same ruler\" means that either we actually hand him the same ruler that we have used, or that we use rulers that have the same length when at rest in the same co-ordinate system. We go first. Using our ruler, we measure the radius of our small circle, and then we measure the circumference of our small circle. Then we note the ratio between them. The next step is to measure the radius of our large circle and then the circumference of our large circle. Then we note the ratio between them. Yes, it is the same ratio that we found be- tween the radius and the circumference of our small circle. We have proved that Euclidean geometry is valid in our co- ordinate system, which is an inertial co-ordinate system. Now we hand the ruler to the observer on the revolving circles as he passes by us. Using this ruler he first measures the radius of his small circle and finds that it is the same as ours, since our circles are drawn directly over his circles. Next he measures the circumference of his small circle. Re- member that motion causes rulers to contract in the direction that they are moving. However, since the radius of the small circle is so short, the velocity of the ruler when it is placed on the circumference of the small circle is not fast enough to make the effect of relativistic contraction noticeable. Therefore, the observer on the revolving circles measures the circumfer- ence of his small circle and finds it to be the same as the circumference of our small circle. Naturally, the ratio between them also is the same. So far so good. The ratios between the radius and the circumference of three circles have been de- termined (our small circle, our large circle, and his small circle) and they all are identical. This is exactly what should happen according to high-school geometry books across the country. Only one more circle to go. The observer on the revolving circles measures the radius of his large circle and finds it to be the same length as the radius of our large circle. Now he comes to the last measure- ment, the circumference of his large circle. However, as soon as he puts his ruler into position to make a measurement on the circumference of the large revolving circle, his ruler con- tracts! Because the radius of his large circle is much larger than"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"GENERAL NONSENSE / 175 the radius of his small circle, the velocity of the circumference of the large revolving circle is considerably faster than the velocity of the circumference of the small revolving circle. Since the ruler must be aligned in the direction that the circumference is moving, it becomes shorter. When the revolving observer uses this ruler to measure the circumfer- ence of the large revolving circle, he finds that it is larger than the circumference of our large circle. This is because his ruler is shorter (Contraction also affected his ruler when he measured the radius of his large circle, but since it then was placed perpendicular to the direction of motion, it became skinnier, not shorter). This means that the ratio of the radius to the circumference of the small revolving circle is not the same as the ratio of the radius to the circumference of the large revolving circle. Ac- cording to Euclidean geometry, this is not possible, but there it is. If we want to be old-fashioned about it (before-Einstein) we can say that this situation is nothing unusual. By definition, the laws of mechanics and the geometry of Euclid are valid only in inertial systems (that is what makes them inertial systems). We simply don't consider co-ordinate systems which are not inertial. (This was really the position of physicists before Albert Einstein). This is exactly what seemed wrong to Einstein. His idea was to create a physics valid for all co-ordinate systems, since the universe abounds with the non-inertial as well as the inertia] kind. If we are to create such a universally valid physics, a gen- eral physics, then we must treat both the observers in the stationary (inertial) system and the observer on the revolving circles (a non-inertial system) with equal seriousness. The per- son on the revolving circles has as much right to relate the physical world to his frame of reference as we have to relate it to ours. True, the laws of mechanics as well as the geometry of Euclid are not valid in his frame of reference, but every deviation from them can be explained in terms of a gravitational field which affects his frame of reference. This is what Einstein's theory allows us to do. It allows us to express the laws of physics in such a way that they are independent of specific space-time co-ordinates. Space and time co-ordinates (measurements) vary from one frame of reference to another, depending upon the state of motion of"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"176 / NONSENSE the frame of reference. The general theory of relativity allows us to universalize the laws of physics and to apply them to all frames of reference. \"Wait a minute,\" we say, \"how can anyone measure distance or navigate in a co-ordinate system like the one on the revolving circles. The length of a ruler varies from place to place in such a system. The farther we go from the center, the faster the velocity of the ruler, and the more it contracts. This doesn't happen in an inertial co-ordinate system, which, in effect, is a system that is at rest. Because there is no change of velocity throughout an inerHal co-ordinate system, rulers do not change length. \"This allows us to organize inertial systems like a city, block by block. Since rulers do not change length in inertial systems, all the blocks that are laid out with the same ruler will be the same length. No matter where we travel, we know that ten blocks is twice the distance of five blocks. \"In a non-inertial system the velocity of the system varies from place to place. This means that the length of a ruler varies from place to place. If we used the same ruler to lay out all the city blocks in a non-inertial co-ordinate system, some of them would be larger than others depending upon where they were located.\" \"What is wrong with that,\" asks Jim de Wit, \"as long as we still can determine our position in the co-ordinate system. Imagine a sheet of india rubber on which we have drawn a grid so that it looks like a piece of graph paper (first drawing, opposite page). This is a co-ordinate system.

To get there we have to go two squares to the right and two squares up. \"Now suppose that we stretch the sheet of rubber so that it looks like the second drawing.\" The same directions (two squares right and two squares up) still bring us to the party. The only difference is that unless we are familiar with this part of the co-ordinate system, we cannot calculate the distance that we have to travel as easily as we could if all of the squares were the same size.\" According to the general theory of relativity, gravity, which is the equivalent of acceleration, is what distorts the space- time continuum in a manner analogous to our stretching the"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"GENERAL NONSENSE / 177 PARTY sheet of rubber.

In other words, the undistorted sheet of rubber is analogous to the space-time continuum of an inertial co-ordinate system and the special theory of relativity applies. However, in the universe at large gravity eannot be ne- glected. Wherever there is a piece of matter, it warps the space-time continuum. The larger the piece of matter, the more pronounced the warp. In the example of the revolving circles, the variation of velocity in different parts of the co-ordinate system caused the ruler to change size. With that in mind, remember that accel- eration (change in velocity) is the equivalent of gravity. Therefore, changes in the strength of a gravitational field will produce the same contractions of the ruler as changes in velocity. \"Acceleration\" and \"gravity\" are two ways of saying the same thing. That means that if a ruler is subjected to gravitational fields of different strength, it changes length."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"178 / NONSENSE Of course, it is impossible to travel through our solar system, much less our galaxy, without encountering gravitational fields of varying intensity, which would cause any maps that we somehow could produce to look distorted like the stretched piece of india rubber The terrain of the space-time contin- uum in which our earth moves is like a hillv countryside with a mountain (the sun) dominating the geography According to Newton, the earth wants to continue forever in a straight line, but forever is deflected from its inclination by the gravitational force of the sun A balance of the two keeps the earth in orbit around the sun According to Einstein, the earth's orbit is simpl> the easiest path for the earth to take as it moves through the space-time continuum, warped as it is in this neighborhood by the sun Imagine how complex is the geography of the space-time continuum which is our universe with its solar systems, star systems, galaxies, and galax> clusters, each of them causing major and minor bumps, curves hills, valleys, and mountains in the four-dimensional space-time continuum Would it be possible to navigate under such circumstances?

Astronomers consulted their star charts and discovered that May 29 is the ideal day for such an undertaking. This is because the sun, in its apparent journey across a varied stellar background, is in front of an exceptionally rich grouping of bright stars on that date. By incredible coincidence, a total eclipse of the sun occurred on May 29, 1919, only four years after the general theory was published. Preparations were made to use this event to test Einstein's new theory. Light signals from a star are bent in the neighborhood of the sun. Because we assume that starlight travels in a straight line, we assume that the star is in a position other than it actually is. Although light was supposed to travel in a straight line in a vacuum, a certain amount of bending already was theorized before Einstein's general theory of relativity. Newton's law of gravity was used to calculate this bending, even though it could not explain it. Einstein's theory predicted roughly twice the deflection that Newton's law predicted, and, in addition, it supplied an explanation for it. Physicists and astronomers alike eagerly awaited the outcome of this confrontation be- tween the new theory and the old. The 1919 eclipse was photographed by two different expedi- tions sent to two different parts of the world. These expeditions also took photographs of the same stellar background at times when the sun was not in the area. The results of both expeditions vindicated Einstein's calculations, not Newton's. Since 1919, the same verdict has been reached again and again during other eclipses. All of them confirm Einstein's predictions. Score two for the general theory. The third verification of the general theory of relativity is called gravitational redshift. Bemember that gravity (because"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"GENERAL NONSENSE / 183 it is the equivalent of acceleration) not only causes rulers to contract, but it also causes clocks to run more slowly. A clock is anything that repeats itself periodically. An atom is a type of clock. It vibrates at a certain frequency. When a substance, like sodium, is made to glow, the wavelength of the light that it emits can be measured accurately. This wavelength tells us exactly the frequency of the vibrations of the atoms that comprise the substance. If the frequency should vary, the wavelength also will vary. If we want to compare the rhythm of a clock here on the earth with the rhythm of a clock that is influenced by an intense gravitational field, like that of the sun, we do not need to send a clock to the surface of the sun. The clocks already are in place. Einstein predicted that any periodic process that takes place in an atom on the sun, where the gravity is very intense, must take place at a slightly slower rate than it does here on the earth. To test this prediction, all we need do is compare the wavelength of the radiation of a given element as it is found in sunlight and as it is found here on earth in the laboratory. This has been done many times. In each case, the wavelength measured from the sunlight was found to be longer than its laboratory counterpart. A longer wavelength means a lower (slower) frequency. Sodium atoms, for example, vibrate more slowly under the influence of the sun's strong gravitational field than they do on the earth. So do all the atoms. This phenomenon is called gravitational redshift because the wavelengths involved appear to be shifted slightly toward the red end of the visible light spectnim where the wavelengths are the longest. Score three for the general theory. Mercury's moving perihelion, starlight deflection, and gravitational redshift are all observable phenomena. Now we come to an area where theory is still predominant and obser- vation is minimal. Nonetheless, it is an area that is by far the most exciting and perhaps the most stimulating in the entire history of science. The fourth verification of the general theory of relativity appears to be the phenomenon of the black hole. In 1958, David Finkelstein published a paper in which he theorized, on the basis of Einstein's general theory of relativity, a phenomenon that he called a \"one-way membrane.\" 4 Finkel- stein showed that under certain conditions involving an extremely dense gravitational field, an invisible threshold can"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"184 / NONSENSE occur into which light and physical objects can enter, but from which they never again can escape.* The following year, a young graduate student at the Uni- versity of London heard Finkelstein, who was speaking there as a guest lecturer, explain his one-way membrane. The idea caught his attention and then his imagination. The young student was Roger Penrose. Expanding on Finkelstein's discovery, he developed it into the modern theory of the \"Black Hole.\"t A black hole is an area of space which appears absolutely black because the gravitation there is so intense that not even light can escape into the surrounding areas.tt Gravitation is negligible on the laboratory level, but quite important when bodies of large mass are concerned. Therefore, the exploration of black holes naturally became a joint venture of physicists and astronomers. Astronomers speculated that a black hole may be one of several possible products of stellar evolution. Stars do not burn indefinitely. They evolve through a life cycle which begins with hydrogen gas and sometimes ends with a very dense, burned-out, rotating mass. The exact end product of this proc- ess depends upon the size of the star undergoing it. Accord- ing to one theory, stars which are about three times the size of our sun or larger end up as black holes. The remains of such stars are unimaginably dense. They may be only a few miles in diameter and yet contain the entire mass of a star three times larger than the sun. Such a dense mass produces a gravitational field strong enough to pull everything in its vicinity into it, while at the same time allowing nothing, not even light, to escape from it. Surrounding this remainder of a star is an \"even horizon.' An even horizon is created by the enormous gravitational field of the burned-out star. It functions percisely like Finkel- *This pi Newtonia modern point of view, i.e., relativity theorv.

Anything within the gravitational field of this mass quickly is pulled toward it, and once past the event horizon, never can return. It is the event horizon which constitutes the essential feature of the black hole. What hap- pens to an object that passes through an event horizon is even more fantastic than the wildest (currently) science fiction. If the black hole is not rotating, the object will be pulled directly to the center of the black hole t-j a point called the singularity. There it literally will be squeezed out of existence, or as physicists say, to zero volume. At the black hole singularity all of the laws of physics break down completely, and even space and time disappear. It is speculated that everything which is sucked into a black hole is spilled out again on \"the other side\"—the \"other side\" being another universe! If the black hole is rotating, an object that is sucked into the event horizon could miss the black hole singularity (which is shaped like a \"ring\" in a rotating black hole) and emerge into another time and another place in this universe (through \"wormholes\"), or into another universe (through \"Einstein- Rosen bridges ). In this way, rotating black holes may be the ultimate time machines. Although black holes are almost invisible, we can search for observable phenomena that may be characteristic of them. The first of these is a large amount of electromagnetic radiation. A black hole continuously attracts hydrogen atoms, cosmic particles, and everything else to it. As these particles and objects are drawn to the black hole, they steadily accelerate through its gravitational field until they approach the velocity of light itself. This causes tremendous amounts of electro- magnetic radiation. (Any accelerating charged particle creates electromagnetic radiation). The second observable characteristic of an invisible black hole is its effect on a nearby visible star. If a visible star can be found which moves as though it were revolving around an invisible star (i.e., as though it were half of a binary star sys- tem), we might speculate that it actually is revolving around an invisible star, and that its invisible partner is a black hole. The search for black holes consequently became the search for these two phenomena. In 1970, the satellite Uhuru lo- cated both of them in one area. It pinpointed a high-energy x-ray source in the constellation Cygnus which emits a mil- lion times more energy than the sun.

This is a seriously considered possibility There are objects in our universe that appear to be the reverse of black holes They are called white holes (of course) These objects are quasi-stellar radio sources, or quasars for short Quasars are extraordinarily intense energy sources Most of them are only several times the diameter of our solar system, yet they emit more energy than an entire galaxy of over 150 billion stars' Some astronomers believe that quasars are the most distant objects ever detected, yet their incredible brightness allows us to see them clearly The relationship between black holes and quasars is purely speculation but the speculation is mind-boggling For example, some physicists speculate that black holes swallow up matter from one universe and pump it either into another universe or into another part and time of the same universe The output side of a black hole according to this hypothesis, is a quasar If this speculation is correct, then our universe is being sucked into its many black holes, only to reappear in other universes, while other universes are being pumped into our own universe which is being sucked through black holes and into other universes again The process goes on and on, feeding on itself, another begmnmgless, endless, endless, begmnmgless dance One of the most profound by-products of the general theory of relativity is the discovery that gravitational \"force,\" which we had so long taken to be a real and independently existing"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"GENERAL NONSENSE / 187 thing, is actually our mental creation There is no such thing in the real world The planets do not orbit the sun because the sun exerts an invisible gravitational force on them, they follow the paths that they do because those paths are the easiest ways for them to traverse the terrain of the space-time continuum in which they find themselves The same is true for nonsense It is a mental creation There is no such thing in the real world From one frame of reference black holes and event horizons make sense From another frame of reference absolute non-motion makes sense Neither is nonsense ' except as seen from another point of view We call something nonsense if it does not agree with the rational edifices that we carefully have constructed However, there is nothing intrinsically valuable about these edifices In fact, thev themselves often are replaced by more useful ones When that happens what was nonsensical from an old frame of reference can make sense from a new frame of reference, and the other way round Like measurements of space and time, the concept of nonsense (itself a type of measurement) is relative and we always can be sure when we use it that from some frame of reference it applies to us"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"PART ONE I Clutch My Ideas"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 The Particle Zoo The fourth translation of Wu Li is \"I Clutch My Ideas.\" This is appropriate to a book on physics since the history of science in general often has been the story of scientists vigorously fighting an onslaught of new ideas. This is because it is diffi- cult to relinquish the sense of security that conies from a long and rewarding acquaintance with a particular world view. The value of a physical theory depends upon its usefulness. In this sense the history of physical theories might be said to resemble the history of individual personality traits. Most of us respond to our environment with a collection of automatic responses that once brought desirable results, usually in child- hood. Unfortunately, if the environment that produced these responses changes (we grow up) and the responses themselves do not adapt, they become counterproductive. Showing anger, becoming depressed, flattering, crying, and bullying behavior are response patterns appropriate to times often long past. These patterns change only when we are forced to realize that they are no longer productive. Even then change is often painful and slow. The same is true of scientific theories. Not one person, except Copernicus, wanted to accept the Copernican idea that the earth revolves around the sun. Goethe wrote about the Copernican revolution: Perhaps a greater demand has never been laid upon man- kind; for by this admission[that the earth is not the center of the universe], how much else did not collapse in dust and smoke: a second paradise, a world of innocence, poetry, and piety, the witness of the senses, the convic- 191"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"192 / I CLUTCH MY IDEAS tions of a poetic and religious faith; no wonder that men had no stomach for all this, that they ranged themselves in every way against such a doctrine . . .' Not one physicist, not even Planck himself, wanted to accept the implications of Planck's discovery, for to do so threatened a scientific structure (Newtonian physics) over three hundred years old. Heisenberg wrote about the quantum revolution: . . . when new groups of phenomena compel changes in the pattern of thought . . . even the most eminent of physicists find immense difficulties. For the demand for change in the thought pattern may engender the feeling that the ground is to be pulled from under one's feet. . . . I believe that the difficulties at this point can hardly be overestimated. Once one has experienced the despera- tion with which clever and conciliatory men of science react to the demand for a change in the thought pattern, one can only be amazed that such revolutions in science have actually been possible at all. 2 Scientific revolutions are forced upon us by the discovery of phenomena that are not comprehensible in terms of the old theories. Old theories die hard. Much more is at stake than the theories themselves. To give up our privileged position at the center of the universe, as Copernicus asked, was an enormous psychological task. To accept that nature is funda- mentally irrational (governed by chance), which is the essential statement of quantum mechanics, is a powerful blow to the intellect. Nonetheless, as new theories demonstrate superior utility, their adversaries, however reluctantly, have little choice but to accept them. In so doing, they also must grant a meas- ure of recognition to the world views that accompany them. Today, particle accelerators, bubble chambers and computer printouts are giving birth to another world view. This world view is as different from the world view at the beginning of this century as the Copernican world view was from its predecessors. It calls upon us to relinquish many of our closely clutched ideas. In this world view there is no substance. The most common question that we can ask about an object is, \"What is it made of?\" That question, however, \"What is it made of?\", is based upon an artifical mental structure that is much like a hall of mirrors.

These reflections, all of them, are illusions. The only real thing in the whole setting is us (we). This situation is very similar to what happens whenever we ask of something, \"What is it made of?\" The answer to such a question is always another something to which we can apply the same question. Suppose, for example, that we ask of an ordinary toothpick, \"What is it made of?\" The answer, of course, is \"wood.\" How- ever, the question itself has taken us into a hall of mirrors because now we can ask about the wood, \"What is it made of?\" Closer examination reveals that wood is made of fibers, uut what the fibers are made of is another question, and so on. Like a pair of parallel mirrors, reflecting reflections, gives the illusion of an unending progression to nowhere, the idea that a thing can be different from what it is made of creates an infinite progression of answers, leaving us forever frustrated in an unending search. No matter what something—anything —is \"made of, we have created an illusion which forces us to ask, \"Yes, but what is that made of?\" Physicists are people who have pursued tenaciously this endless series of questions. What they have found is startling. Wood fibers, to continue the example, are actually patterns of cells. Cells, under magnification, are revealed to be patterns of molecules. Molecules, under higher magnification, are discovered to be patterns of atoms, and, lastly, atoms have turned out to be patterns of subatomic particles.

If both the projectile particle and the target particle are accelerated to the point of impact, so much the more kinetic energy is avail- able to create new particles to study. Every subatomic interaction consists of the annihilation of the original particles and the creation of new subatomic par- ticles. The subatomic world is a continual dance of creation and annihilation, of mass changing to energy and energy chang- ing to mass.* Transient forms sparkle in and out of existence creating a never-ending, forever-newly-created reality. Mystics from both the East and the West who claim to have beheld \"the face of God\" speak in terms so similar to these that any psychologist who professes an interest in altered states of awareness scarcely can ignore this obvious bridge between the disciplines of physics and psychology. The first question of particle physics is, \"What collides?\" According to quantum mechanics, a subatomic particle is not a particle like a particle of dust. Rather, subatomic parti- cles are \"tendencies to exist' (page 32) and \"correlations be- tween macroscopic observables\" (page 70). They have no objective existence. That means that we cannot assume, if we are to use quantum theory, that particles have an existence apart from their interactions with a measuring device (page 95). As Heisenberg wrote: In the light of the quantum theory . . . elementary parti- cles are no longer real in the same sense as objects of daily life, trees or stones . . . 4 * The mass/energy dualism of our ordinary conceptualizations does not exist in the formalism of relativity or quantum theory. According to Einstein's E = me 2 , mass does not change into energy or vice versa: Energy is mass. Wherever energy, E, is present, mass, m, is present and the amount of mass, m, is given by E = me 2 . The total amount of energy. E, is conserved, and hence the total amount of mass, m, also is conserved. This mass, m, is defined by the fact that it is a source of the gravitational field."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"198/1 CLUTCH MY IDEAS When an electron, for example, passes through a photo- graphic plate it leaves a visible \"track\" behind it This \"track,\" under close examination, is actually a series of dots Each dot is a grain of silver formed by the electron's interaction with atoms in the photographic plate When we look at the track under a microscope, it looks something like this Ordinarily we would assume that one and the same electron, like a little baseball, went streaking through the photographic plate and left this trail of silver grains behind it This is a mistake Quantum mechanics tells us the same thing that Tan trie Buddhists have been saying for a millenium The con- nection between the dots (the moving object\") is a product of our minds and it is not really there In rigorous quantum mechanical terms, the moving object—the particle with an independent existence-—is an unprovable assumption According to our customarv wav of reasoning,\" wrote David Bohm, a professor of phvsics at Birkbeck College, University of London we could suppose that the track of grains of silver indi- cates that a real electron moves continuously through space in a path somewhere near these grains, and by interaction caused the formation of the grams But ac- cording to the usual interpretation of the quantum theory, it would be incorrect to suppose that this really happened All that we can say is that certain grains appeared, but we must not try to imagine that these grains were produced by a real object moving through space in the way in which we usuallv think of objects moving through space For although this idea of a continuously moving obiect is good enough for an approximate theory, we would discover that it would break down in a very exact theory 5 The natural assumption that objects, like particles, are real things that run their course in space and time according to causal laws regardless of whether we are around to observe them or not is repudiated bv quantum mechanics This is especially significant because quantum mechanics is the theory of physics It has explained successfully everything from"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"THE PARTICLE ZOO / 199 subatomic particles to stellar phenomena There never has been a more successful theory It has no competition Therefore, when we look at the tracks in a bubble chamber, we are left with the question, 'What made them?

laid in 1928 by the English physicist, Paul Dirac Quantum field theory has been highly successful in predicting new types of particles and in explaining existing particles in terms of field interactions According to this theory, a separate field is associated with each tvpe of particle Since only three types of particles were known in 1928, only three different fields were required to

This convention has been extremely productive Over the last forty years almost one hundred particles have been discovered They constitute what Kenneth Ford calls the particle zoo * The first thing to

particle at rest is called its rest mass Any mass other than a rest mass is called a relativistic mass Since the mass of a particle increases with velocity, a particle can have any number of relativistic masses The size of a particles relativistic mass depends upon its velocity For example, at 99 percent of the speed of light a particle s mass is seven times larger than it is when the particle is at rest At velocities above 99 percent of the speed of light particle masses increase dramatically When the former electron ac- celerator at Cambridge, Massachusetts, was in operation, it

electrons and the final velocity of the accelerated electrons is the same as the difference in velocity between one automobile that can make a given trip in two hours and a faster automobile that can make the same trip in one hour fifty-nine minutes and fifty-nine seconds 8 The mass of each electron, however, increased from 60 times to as much as 11,800 times the electron rest mass' In other words particle accelerators are misnamed They do not increase the velocities of subatomic particles (the definition of 'acceleration ) as much as they increase their mass Particle accelerators are actually particle inlargers (massifiers ? ) The masses of particles, whether at rest or in motion, are measured in electron volts An electron volt has nothing to do with electrons An electron volt is a unit of energy (It is the energy acquired by any particle with one unit of charge falling through a potential difference of one volt) The point is that to measure something in terms of electron volts is to measure its energy, yet this is precisely the unit of measurement that particle physicists use to measure a particle s mass For example, the rest mass of an electron is 51 million electron volts (Mev) and the rest mass of a proton is 938 2 million electron volts The transformation of mass into energy and energv into mass is such a routine phenomenon in particle physics that particle physicists employ units of energy to designate a particle s mass Mass is only one particular form of energy (page 154), the"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"204 / I CLUTCH MY IDEAS energy of being. If a particle is moving it not only has energy of being (its mass) but it also has energy of motion (kinetic energy). Both types of energy can be used to create new particles in a particle collision.* Often it is easier to compare a particle's mass with the lightest massive particle, the electron, instead of referring to the number of electron volts it contains. This arrangement makes the mass of an electron one and the mass of a proton, for example, 1836.12. Using this system, the mass of any particle tells immediately how much heavier it is than an electron. This is the system that is used in the table at the back of the book. When physicists listed all the known particles by the order of their masses, from the lightest to the heaviest, they discovered that subatomic particles fall into roughly three cat- egories: the light-weight particles, the medium-weight parti- cles, and the heavy-weight particles. When it came to naming these categories, however, they unaccountably lapsed into Greek again. The group of light-weight particles they called \"leptons,\" which is Greek for \"the light ones.\" The group of medium-weight particles they called \"mesons\" (maze'ons), which is Greek for \"the medium-sized ones.\" The group of heavy-weight particles they called \"baryons\" (bary'ons), which is Greek for \"the heavy ones.\" Why physicists did not call these new groups \"light,\" \"medium,\" and \"heavy\" is one of the unanswerable questions of physics, t Since the electron is the lightest material particle, it is, of course, a lepton. The proton is a heavy-weight particle (a baryon), although it is the lightest of the heavy-weight parti- cles. Most subatomic particles are classified in this way, but not all of them, which brings us to a phenomenon of particle * Einstein's formula E = me 2 says that mass is energy: energy is mass. Therefore, strictly speaking, mass is not a particular form of energy. Every form of energy is mass. Kinetic energy, for example, ts mass. As we speed up A particle, and hence give it energy, AE, it gains mass. Am, in exactly the amount required AE = (Am)c 2 . Wherever energy goes, mass goes. t Physicists no longer use the terms leptons, mesons and baryons to refer to particle mass alone. These terms now refer to classes of particles which are defined by several properties in addition to mass.. For example, the tan particle (T), which was discovered by a joint team from the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) in 1975, seems to be a lepton even though it has more mass than the heaviest baryon! Similarly, the D particles, also discovered by a joint SLAC/LBL team fin 1976) are mesons even though they have more mass than the tan particle."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"THE PARTICLE ZOO / 205 physics which, like much of quantum mechanics, escapes the bounds of concept. A few particles do not fit into the lepton- meson-baryon framework. Some of them are well known (like the photon) and others have been theorized but not discovered yet (like the graviton). All of them have in common the fact that they are massless particles. \"Wait a minute,\" we exclaim. \"What is a massless particle?\" \"A massless particle,\" says Jim de Wit, who has studied this phenomenon, \"is a particle that has zero rest mass. AH of its energy is energy of motion. When a photon is created, it instantly is traveling at the speed of light. It cannot be slowed down (it has no mass to slow) and it cannot be speeded up (nothing can travel faster than the speed of light).\" \"Massless particle\" is an awkward translation from mathe- matics to English. Physicists know exactly what they mean by a massless particle. A \"massless particle\" is the name they give to an element in a mathematical structure. What that element represents in the real world, however, is not so easy to describe. In fact, it is impossible because the definition of an object (like a \"particle\") is something that has mass. Zen Buddhists have developed a technique called the koan which, along with meditation, produces changes in our per- ceptions and understanding. A koan is a puzzle which cannot be answered in ordinary' ways because it is paradoxical. \"What is the sound of one hand clapping?\" is a Zen koan. Zen students are told to think unceasingly about a particular koan until they know the answer. There is no single correct answer to a koan. It depends upon the psychological state of the student. Paradoxes are common in Buddhist literature. Paradoxes are the places where our rational mind bumps into its own limitations. According to eastern philosophy in general, oppo- sites, such as good-bad, beautiful-ugly, birth-death, and so on, are \"false distinctions.\" One cannot exist without the other. They are mental structures which we have created. These self-made and self-maintained illusions are the sole cause of paradoxes. To escape the bonds of conceptual limitation is to hear the sound of one hand clapping. Physics is replete with koans, i.e., \"picture a massless par- ticle.\" Is it a coincidence that Buddhists exploring \"internal\" reality a millennium ago and physicists exploring \"external\" reality

Every particle has a set of quantum numbers which identify it as a particular type of particle. * Every particle of a particular type has the same set of quantum numbers as every other particle of the same type. Every electron, for example, has the same quantum numbers as every other electron. An electron's quantum numbers, how- ever, distinguish it from protons, all of which also have the same quantum numbers. Individual particles don't have much personality, In fact, they don't have any personality at all. When Dirac imposed the requirements of relativity on quantum theory, his formalism indicated the existence of a particular positively charged particle. Since the only positively charged particle known in those days (1928) was the proton, Dirac, and most other physicists, assumed that his theory had accounted (mathematically) for the proton. (His theory even was criticized for yielding the \"wrong\" proton mass.) Upon closer examination, however, it became evident that Dirac's theory described not the proton, but an entirely dif- ferent particle. Dirac's new particle was like an electron except that its charge and some of its other major properties were exactly opposite to those of an electron. In 1932, Carl Anderson, at Cal Tech (who hadn't heard of Dirac's theory) actually discovered this new particle and called it a positron. Physicists later discovered that every particle has a counterpart which is exactly like it but opposite in several major respects. This new class of particles was called anti-particles. An anti-particle, despite its name, is a particle. (The anti-particle of an anti-particle is another particle). Some particles have other particles as anti-particles (for example, a positive pi meson is the anti-particle of a negative pi meson, and the other way round). A few particles are their own anti-particles (like the photon). All of the particles and their anti-particles are in the table at the back of the book. * The basic quantum numbers are spin, isotopic spin, charge, strangeness, charm, baryon number and lepton number."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"THE PARTICLE ZOO / 211 The meeting of a particle and its anti-particle is always spectacular.

Instead of saying that an electron moving through space emitted a photon which changed its (the electron's) momentum, we can say as well that an electron moving through space emitted a photon and went out of existence at that point! A new electron was created in this process and it departed the scene with a new momentum. There is no way of knowing if this interpretation is correct or not because all electrons are identical.

provide the necessary energy for a virtual photon to become a real photon without violating the conservation law of mass-energy, it does just that That is why an excited electron emits a real photon An excited electron is an electron that is in an energy level higher than its ground state An electron's ground state is its lowest energy level wheie it is as close to the nucleus of an atom as it

particle spontaneously decays, it always decays into lighter particles The total mass of the new particles is always less than the mass of the original particle The differ- ence between the mass of

In fact, all of the particles represented in an S-Matrix diagram (including those discovered by rotating the diagram) are defined in terms of each other.

Founda- tions of Quantum Mechanics ' In this book von Neumann, in effect, asked the question, \"If a wave function , this purely abstract mathematical creation, actually should describe something in the real world, what would that something be like?\" The answer that he deduced is exactly the description of a wave function that we already ha\\ e discussed (page 73) This strange animal constantly

of the observed system which it describes It would not be a simple mixture of possibilities, it would be a sort of organic whole whose parts are changing constantly but which, none- theless, is somehow a thing-m-itself This thing-m-itself would continue to develop indefinitely until an observation (measurement) is made on the observed system which it represents If the observed system is a photon propagating in isolation the wave function repre- senting this photon would contain all of the possible results of the photon s interaction with a measuring device, like a pho- tographic plate * (For example, the possibilities contained in the wave function might be that the photon will be detected in area A of the photographic plate, that the photon will be detected in area B of the photographic plate and that the photon will be detected in area C of the photographic plate) Once the photon is set in motion the wave function associated with it would continue to develop (change) according to a causal law (the Schrodmger wave equation) until the photon interacts with the observing system At that instant, one of the possibilities contained in the wave function would actualize and the other possibilities contained in the wave function would cease to exist They simply would disappear The wave function, that strange animal that von Neumann was attempt- ing to describe, would collapse The collapse of this particu- lar wave function would mean that the probability of one af the possible results of the photon-measuring-device interac- tion became one (it happened) and the probability of the other possibilities became zero (they were no longer possible) After all a photon can be detected only in one place at a time The wave function, according to this view, is not quite

(The Problem of Measurement) (page 77) Is it when the photon strikes the photographic plate? Is it when the photographic plate is developed? Is it when we look at the developed plate'' Exactly u-hat is it that collapses? Where does the wave function live before it collapses? and so on This view of the wave function, that it can he described as a real thing, is generally the view of the wave function attributed to von Neumann However, the real-wave-function descrip- tion is only one of two approaches to understanding quantum phenomena which he discussed in The Mathematical Founda- tions* of Quantum Mechanics The second approach, to which von Neumann devoted much less time, is a re-examination of the language bv which it is necessary to express quantum phenomena In the section, ' Projections as Propositions, ' he wrote the relation between the properties of a physical system on the one hand, and the projections [wave function] on the other, makes possible a sort of logical calculus with these However, in contrast to the concepts of ordinary logic, this system is extended by the concepts of simulta- neous decidability [the uncertainty principle] which is characteristic for quantum mechanics 2 This suggestion, that the novel properties of quantum theory can be used to construct a logical calculus which is in contrast to the concepts of ordinary logic, is what von Neumann considered the alternativ e to describing wave functions as real things Most physicists, however, have adopted a third explanation of wave functions Thev dismiss them as purely mathematical constructions, abstract fictions which represent nothing in the world of realit) Unfortunately, this explanation leaves forever unanswered the question, \"How, then, can wave functions predict so accurately probabilities which can be verified through actual experience^ In fact, how can wave functions predict anything when they are defined as completely unrelated to physical reality This is a scientific version of the philosophical question, \"How can mind influence matter? \"'"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"260 / ENLIGHTENMENT Von Neumann s second approach to understanding the par- adoxical puzzles of quantum phenomena took him far bevond the boundaries of physics This brief work pointed to a fusion of ontology epistemologv and psychology which only now is beginning to emerge In short, the problem, said von Neumann, is in the language Herein lies the germ of what was to be- come quantum logic In pointing to the problem of language, von Neumann put his finger on why it is so difficult to answer the question, What is quantum mechanics'* Mechanics is the study of motion Therefore, quantum mechanics is the study of the motion of quanta—but what are quanta? According to the dictionary a quantum is a quantity of something The ques- tion is, a quantity of what? A quantum is a piece of action (a piece of the action?)

are good examples of mythos They endow experience with value, originality and vitality, but they do not seek to replace it Theologically speaking, logos is the original sin, the eating of the fruit of

view, logos (literally) is a dead letter \"Knowledge,\" wrote e e cummings, \"is a polite word for / dead but not buried imagination \" He was talking about logos Our problem, according to Fmkelstem, is that we cannot understand subatomic phenomena, or any other kind of experience, through the use of symbols alone As Heisenberg observed The concepts initially formed by abstraction from particu- lar situations or experiential complexes acquire a life of their own 7 (Italics added) Getting lost in the interaction of symbols is analogous to mistaking the shadows on the wall of the cave for the real world outside the cave (which is direct experience) The an- swer to this predicament is to approach subatomic phenomena, as well as experience in general, with a language of mythos rather than a language of logos Fmkelstem put it this way If you want to envision a quantum as a dot then you are trapped You are modeling it with classical logic The whole point is that there is no classical

of mythos, a language which alludes to experience but does not attempt to replace it or to mold our perception of it is the true language of physics This is because not only the language that we use to commu- nicate our daily experience, but also mathematics, follows a certain set of rules (classical logic) Experience itself is not bound by these rules Experience follows a much more per- missive set of rules (quantum logic) Quantum logic is not only more exciting than classical logic, it is more real It is based not upon the way that we think of things, but upon the way that we experience them When we trv to describe experience with classical logic (which is what we have been doing since we learned to write), we put on a set of blinders, so to speak, which not only restricts our field of vision, but also distorts it These blinders are the set of rules known as classical logic The rules of classical logic are well defined They are simple The only problem is that they do not correspond to experience The most important difference between the rules of classi- cal logic and the rules of quantum logic involves the law of distnbutivity The law of distnbutivity, or the distributive law, says that \"A, and B or C\" is the same as \"A and B, or A and C \" In other words, \"I flip a coin and it comes up heads or tails\" has the same meaning as ' I flip a coin and it comes up heads, or I flip a coin and it comes up tails \" The distributive law, which is a foundation of classical logic, does not apply to quantum logic This is one of the most important but least understood aspects of von Neumann's work In 1936, von Neumann and his colleague, Garrett Birkhoff, published a paper which laid the foundations of quantum logic 9 In it they used an example of a familiar (to physicists) phe- nomenon to disprove the distributive law By so doing they demonstrated mathematically that it is impossible to describe experience (including subatomic phenomena) with classical logic, because the real world follows different rules The rules that experience follows they called quantum logic The rules which symbols follow they called classical logic Finkelstem uses a

Now rotate one of the polarizers from vertical to horizontal. As it is rotated, notice that less and less light gets through the pair. When one of the polarizers is vertical and the other polarizer is horizontal, no light gets through them at all. The first polarizer eliminates all but the horizontally polarized light waves. They are eliminated by the second polarizer, which passes only vertically polarized light. The result is that no light passes both the vertical and the horizontal polarizer.

we"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"274 / ENLIGHTENMENT decided to go to the movies today and not do the experiment. The null process stands for no emissions, nothing. The letter \"I\" stands for \"identity process.\" The identity process is a filter that passes everything. In other words, \"I\" tells us what kinds of polarized light pass through, say, an open window: namely, every kind. Two kinds of diagonally polarized light are included in the table to make it complete. The \"D\" represents light diago- nally polarized to the left, and the \"D\" represents light diago- nally polarized to the right (or the other way round). To use the transition table we pick the type of emission in which we are interested and follow it across the table. For example, an emission of horizontally polarized light, H), will pass through another horizontal polarizer, so an \"A,\" for al- lowed, is placed in the square where the horizontally polarized emission line intersects the horizontally polarized admission column. Horizontally polarized light also passes through a"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"MORE THAN BOTH / 275 diagonal polarizer tilted to the left, )D, a diagonal polarizer tilted to the right, )D, and an open window, I. An \"A\" is placed in each appropriate square. Notice that the square where the horizontally polarized emission line intersects the vertically polarized admission col- umn is hlank. This is because horizontally polarized light does not pass through a vertical polarizer. The blank squares show the forbidden transitions. All of the null process squares are blank because nothing happens if we don't do the experiment. All of the \"I\" squares are marked \"A\" because every kind of light, polarized and otherwise, passes through an open window. The third step in the proof is to make a simple diagram of the information contained in the transition table. The diagram made from this particular transition table looks like this: SINGUTS NUU PROCESS This type of diagram is called a lattice. Mathematicians use lattices to show the ordering of events or elements. Lattices are similar to the genealogical trees that we construct when we research our family roots. The higher elements include the lower elements. The lines show who is connected to whom and through whom. A lattice is not exactly a family tree, but it shows the same kind of inclusive ordering.

Solving for \"D or V,\" we follow the lines on the lattice upward from D and from V to their highest common point (\"or\" goes up). They meet at I.

Unlike most other theories, however, it contains the wtential to alter radically our conceptual framework. Von Neumann's discovery that our thought processes (the realm of symbols) project illusory restrictions onto the real word is essentially the same discovery that led Einstein to the general theory of relativity. Einstein disproved the universality of Euclidean geometry. Until the general theory of relativity, Euclidean geometry had been accepted without question as the underlying structure of the universe. Birkhoff and von Neumann disproved the universality of classical logic. Until now, classical logic has been accepted without question as a natural reflection of the nature of reality.

Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen thought up this experiment over forty-five years ago.

Communication be- tween space-like separated events defies one of the most basic assumptions of physics. Yet this is exactly what the Einstein- Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment seems to illustrate. Even though they are space-like separated, the state of the particle in area B depends upon what the observer in area A decides to observe (which way he orients his magnetic field). In other words, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect indicates that information can be communicated at superluminal (faster than light) speeds contrary to the accepted ideas of physicists. If the two particles in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment somehow are connected by a signal, that signal is traveling faster than the speed of light. Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen may have created the first scientific example of a superluminal connection. Einstein himself denied this conclusion. It is not possible, he argued, that the setting we choose for a measuring device here can affect what happens somewhere else. In his autobi- ography, written eleven years after the Einstein-Podolsky- Rosen paper, he wrote: ... on one supposition we should, in my opinion, abso- lutely hold fast; the real factual situation of the system S 2 [the particle in area B] is independent of what is done with the system Si [the particle in area A], which is spatially separated from the former. 4 This opinion is, in effect, the principle of local causes. The principle of local causes says that what happens in one area does not depend upon variables subject to the control of an experimenter in a distant space-like separated area. The principle of local causes is common sense. The results of an experiment in a place distant and space-like separated from us should not depend on what we decide to do or not to do right here. (Except for the mother who rose in alarm at the same instant that her daughter's distant automobile crashed into a tree—and similar cases—the macroscopic world appears to be made of local phenomena.) Since phenomena are local in nature, argued Einstein, quantum theory has a serious flaw. According to quantum theory, changing the measuring device in area A changes the wave function which describes the particle in area B, but (according to Einstein) it cannot change \"the real factual situa-"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"THE END OF SCIENCE / 289 tion of the system 82 [which] is independent of what is done with the system S t . . .\" Therefore, one and the same \"factual situation\" in area B has two wave functions, one for each position of the measur- ing de\\ ice in area A. This is a flaw since it is \"impossible that two different types of wave functions could he coordinated with the identical factual situation of 82- ' Here is another way of looking at the same situation. Since the real factual situation in area B is independent of what is done in area A, there must exist simultaneously in area B a definite spin up or clown and a definite spin right or left to account for all the results that we can get by orienting the Stern-Gerlach device in area A either vertically or horizontally. Quantum theory is not able to describe such a state in area B and, therefore, it is an incomplete theory.* However, Einstein closed his argument with an incredible aside. One can escape from this conclusion [that quantum theory is incomplete] only by either assuming that the measure- ment of S! ((telepathically)) changes the real situation of S 2 or by denying independent real situations as such to things which are spatially separated from each other.

This brings us to Bell's theorem. Bell's theorem is a mathematical proof. What it \"proves\" is that if the statistical predictions of quantum theory are cor- rect, then some of our commonsense ideas about the world are profoundly mistaken. Bell's theorem does not demonstrate clearly in what way our commonsense ideas about the world are inadequate. There are several possibilities. Each possibility has champions among the small number of physicists who are familiar with Bell's theorem. No matter which of the implications of Bell's theo- rem we favor, however, Bell's theorem itself leads to the inescapable conclusion that if the statistical predictions of quantum theory are correct, then our commonsense ideas about the world are profoundly deficient. This is quite a conclusion because the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics are always correct. Quantum mechan- ics is the theory. It has explained everything from subatomic particles to transistors to stellar energy. It never has failed. It has no competition. Quantum physicists realized in the 1920s that our common- sense ideas were inadequate for describing subatomic phe- nomena (pages 20, 260). Bell's theorem shows that common- sense ideas are inadequate even to describe macroscopic events, events of the everyday world! As Henry Stapp wrote: The important thing about Bell's theorem is that it puts the dilemma posed by quantum phenomena clearly into the realm of macroscopic phenomena . . . [it] shows that our ordinary ideas about the world are somehow pro- foundly deficient even on the macroscopic level.' Bells theorem has been reformulated in several ways since Bell published the original version in 1964. No matter how it is formulated, it projects the \"irrational\" aspects of subatomic phenomena squarely into the macroscopis domain. It says that not only do events in the realm of the very small behave"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"THE END OF SCIENCE / 291 in ways which are utterly different from our commonsense view of the world, but also that events in the world at large, the world of freeways and sports cars, behave in ways which are utterly different from our commonsense view of them. This incredible statement cannot be dismissed as fantasy be- cause it is based upon the awesome and proven accuracy of the quantum theory itself. Bell's theorem is based upon correlations between paired particles similar to the pair of hypothetical particles in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment.* For example, imagine a gas that emits light when it is electrically excited (think of a neon sign). The excited atoms in the gas emit photons in pairs. The photons in each pair fly off in opposite direc- tions. Except for the difference in their direction of travel, the photons in each pair are identical twins. If one of them is polarized vertically, the other one also is polarized vertically. If one of the photons in the pair is polarized horizontally, the other photon also is polarized horizontally. No matter what the angle of polarization, both photons in every pair are polarized in the same plane. Therefore, if we know the state of polarization of one of the particles, we automatically know the state of polarization of the other particle. This situation is similar to the situation in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment, except that now we are discussing states of polarization instead of spin states. We can verify that both photons in each pair of photons are polarized in the same plane by actually sending them through polarizers. Below is a picture of this (conceptually) simple procedure. 0\\M/^   0-AII/v — CLICK—    —CLICK — PHOTOMULTIPLIER V TUBE V PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBE B A *The original version of Bell's theorem involves spin '/2 particles.

On each side of the light source a polarizer is placed in the path of the emitted photon. Behind the polarizers are photomultiplicr tubes which emit a click (or an inaudible electronic equivalent) whenever they detect a photon Whenever the photomultipher tube in area A emits a click, the photomultiplier tube in area B also emits a click. This is because both of the photons in each photon pair always are polarized in the same plane, and both of the polarizers in this arrangement are aligned in the same direction (in this case, vertically). There is no theory involved here, just a matter of counting clicks We know, and can verify, that when the polarizers both are aligned in the same direction, the photo- multiplier tubes behind them will click an equal number of times. The clicks in area A are correlated with the clicks in area B. The correlation, in this case, is one. Whenever one of the photomultiplier tube clicks, the other photomultiplier tube always clicks as well. Now suppose that we orient one of the polarizers at 90 degrees to the other. Below is a picture of this arrangement. — CLICK — PHOTOMULTIPHER H    V PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBE      TUBE B  A One of the polarizers still is aligned vertically, but the other polarizer now is aligned horizontally. Light waves that pass through a vertical polarizer are stopped by a horizontal polarizer and the other way round. Therefore, when the polarizers are oriented at right angles to each other, a click in area A never will be accompanied by a click in area B. The clicks in area A, again, are correlated with the clicks in area B This time, however, the correlation is zero. Whenever one of the photomultiplier tubes clicks, the other photomultiplier tube never clicks. There also are correlations between the clicks in area A and"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"THE END OF SCIENCE / 293 the clicks in area B for every other possible combination of polarizer settings between these two extremes. These statistical correlations can be predicted by the quantum theory. For a given setting of the polarizers, a certain number of clicks in one area will be accompanied by a certain number of clicks in the other area. Bell discovered that no matter what the settings of the polarizers, the clicks in area A are correlated too strongly to the number of clicks in area B to be explained by chance. They have to be connected somehow. However, if they are connected, then the principle of local causes (which says that what happens in one area does not depend upon variables subject to the control of an experimenter in a distant space- like area) is an illusion' In short, Bell's theorem shows that the principle of local causes, however reasonable it sounds, is mathematically incompatible with the assumption that the statistical predictions of quantum theory are valid (at least valid in this experiment and in the Emstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment).* The correlations which Bell used were calculated, but un- tested predictions of the quantum theory. In 1964, this experi- ment was still a hypothetical construct In 1972, John Clauser *The Emstem-Podolsk\\-Rosen argument for the incompleteness of quantum theon was based upon the assumption of local

upon an important assumption nameh, that the states of the measur- ing devices prior to the arrival of the photons in area A and area B do not matter This is, after all, a reasonable assumption Normally we say that the orientation of a measuring device prior to a measurement is not relevant to the result that we get at the time of a measurement The result of an experiment depends upon the state of the measuring device at the time that the particle is detected by it, and not on the state of the measuring device before the particle gets there However, superlummal communication cannot be deduced from the results of the Clauser-Freedman experiment without this assumption Even though the photons in the photon pair cannot exchange information via light signals while thev are in flight

our physical reality. *'t Bell's theorem showed that either the statistical predictions of quantum theory or the principle of local causes is false. It did not say which one is false, but only that both of them cannot be true. When Clauser and Freedman confirmed that the statistical predictions of quantum theory are correct, the startling conclusion was inescapable: The principle of local causes must be false! However, if the principle of local causes fails and, hence, the world is not the way it appears to be, then what is the true nature of our world? There are several mutually exclusive possibilities. The first possibility, which we have just discussed, is that, appearances to the contrary, there really may be no such thing as \"separate parts\" in our world (in the dialect of physics, \"locality fails\"). In that case, the idea that events are autonomous happenings is an illusion. This would be the case for any \"separate parts\" that have interacted with each other at any time in the past. When \"separate parts\" interact with each other, they (their wave functions) become correlated (through the exchange of conventional signals) (forces). Unless this correlation is disrupted by other external forces, the wave functions representing these \"separate parts\" remain correlated forever, t For such corre- lated \"separate parts,\" what an experimenter does in this area has an intrinsic effect upon the results of an experiment in a distant, space-like separated area. This possibility entails a faster-than-light communication of a type different than con- ventional physics can explain.

We can calculate, for example, that a certain percentage of spontaneous positive kaon decays will produce an antimuon and a neutrino (63%), a certain percentage will produce a positive pion and a neutral pion (21%), a certain percentage will produce two positive pions and a negative pion (5 5%), a certain percentage will produce a positron, a neutrino, and a neutral pion (4.8%), a certain percentage will produce an antimuon, a neutrino, and a neutral pion (3.4%), and so on. However, quantum theory cannot predict which decay will produce which result. Indi- vidual events, according to quantum mechanics, are completely random. Said another way, the wave function which describes spontaneous kaon decays contains all of these possible results When the decay actually happens, one of these potentialities is converted into an actuality. Even though the probability of each potentiality can be calculated, which potentiality actually happens at the moment of decay is a matter of chance. Bells theorem implies that which decay reaction occurs at a certain time is not a. matter of chance.

There are other ways to explain the failure of the principle of local causes. For example, the principle of local causes—that what happens in one area does not depend upon variables subject to the control of an experimenter in a distant space-like separated area—is based upon two tacit assumptions which are so obvious that they are easy to overlook. First, the principle of local causes assumes that we have a choice about how we perform our experiments. Imagine that we are doing Clauser and Freedman's photon experiment. We have before us a switch which determines how the polarizes will be positioned. If we throw the switch up, the polarizers are aligned with each other. If we throw the switch down, the polarizers are oriented at right angles with each other. Suppose that we decide to throw the switch up and align the polarizers. Normally, we assume that we could have thrown the switch down and oriented the polarizers at right angles if we had wanted to. In other words, we assume that we are free to decide whether the switch before us will be up or down when the experiment begins. The principle of local causes assumes (\". . . variables subject to the control of an experimenter . . .\") that we possess and can exercise a free will in the determination of how to per- form our experiment. Second, and this is even easier to over- look, the principle of local causes assumes that if we had performed our experiment in a different way than we actuallv did perform it, we would have obtained some definite re- sults. These two assumptions—that we can choose how to perform our experiment and that each of our choices, includ- ing those that we did not select, produces or would have produced definite results—is what Stapp calls \"contrafactual definiteness.\" The fact, in this case, is that we decided to perform our experiment with the switch in the \"up\" position. We assume that, contrary to this fact (contrafactually), we could have performed it with the switch in the \"down\" position. By performing the experiment with the switch in the \"up\" position, we obtained some definite results (a certain number of clicks in each area). Therefore, we assume that if we had chosen to perform the experiment with the switch in the \"down\" position,"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"300 / ENLIGHTENMENT we likewise would have obtained some definite results. (It is not necessary that we be able to calculate what these other results are). Odd as it may seem, some physical theories, as we shall see, do not assume that \"what would have happened if . . .\" produces definite results. Since Bell's theorem shows that, assuming the validity of quantum theory, the principle of local causes is incorrect, and, if we do not want to accept the existence of superluminal connections (\"the failure of locality\") as the reason for the failure of the principle of local causes, then we are forced to confront the possibility that our assumptions about contrafactual definiteness are incorrect (\"contrafactual definiteness fails\"). Since contrafactual definiteness has two parts, there are two ways in which contrafactual definiteness could fail. The first possibility is that free will is an illusion (\"contra- factualness fails\"). Perhaps there is no such thing as \"what would have happened if. . .\" Perhaps there can be only what is. In this case, we are led to a superdeterminism. This is a determinism far beyond ordinary determinism. Ordinary determinism states that once the initial situation of a system is established, the future of the system also is established since it must develop according to inexorable laws of cause and effect. This type of determinism was the basis of the Great Machine view of the universe (page 23). According to this view, however, if the initial situation of a system, like the universe, is changed, then the future of the system also is changed. According to superdeterminism, not even the initial situation of the universe could be changed. Not only is it impossible for things to be other than they are, it is even impossible that the initial situation of the universe could have been other than what it was. No matter what we are doing at any given mo- ment, it is the only thing that ever was possible for us to be doing at that moment. Contrafactual definiteness also fails if the \"definiteness\" assumption in it fails. In this case, we do have a choice in the way that we perform our experiments, but \"what would have happened if ...\" does not produce any definite results. This alternative is just as strange as it sounds. It is also just what comes out of the Many Worlds Interpretation of"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"THE END OF SCIENCE / 301 Quantum Mechanics (page 83). According to the Many Worlds theory, whenever a choice is made in the universe between one possible event and another, the universe splits into dif- ferent branches. In our hypothetical experiment we decided to throw the switch into the \"up\" position. When the experiment was performed with the switch in the \"up\" position, it gave us a definite result (a certain number of clicks in each area). How- ever, according to the Many Worlds theory, at the moment that we threw the switch up, the universe split into two branches. In one branch, the experiment was performed with the switch in the \"up\" position. In the other branch, the experiment was performed with the switch in the \"down\" position. Who performed the experiment in the second branch? There is a different edition of us in each of the different branches of the universe! Each edition of us is convinced that our branch of the universe is the entirety of reality. The experiment in the second branch, the experiment which was performed with the switch in the \"down\" position, also produced a definite result (a certain number of clicks in each area). However, that result is in another branch of the universe, not in ours. Therefore, as far as we in this branch of the universe are concerned, \"what would have happened if . . .\" actually did happen, and actually did produce definite results, but in a branch of the universe which is forever beyond our experiential reality.* *A branching also occurs at the choice between results. This can be illustrated by the EPR experiment. On the original branch where, for example, the axis of the magnetic field is \\ertical and the result is either spin up or spin down, there is a branching into two \"twigs.\" In the first twig the result is spin up, and in the second twig the result is spin r/ourn. Similarly, on the second branch, where the axis of the magnetic field is horizontal, there is also a branching into two twigs. On the first of these twigs the result is spin rigftf, and on the second of these twigs, the result is spin left. Thus, on any given twig of any branch there is a definite result (spin up, down, rig/if, or left}, but the idea of \"what would have happened if one had chosen the 'other branch' \" makes no sense, for both results (up or down, or rig/it or left) occur on different branches. Thus the results on \"the other\" branch are not definite."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"302 / ENLIGHTENMENT Below is a diagram of the logical implications of Bell's theorem. It is drawn from informal discussions of the Funda- mental Physics Group at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, under the direction and sponsorship of Dr. Elizabeth Rauscher. These discussions, in turn, were based primarily upon the work of Henry Stapp. SUFERMTERMMSM MANY WORLDS THEOfiv To summarize, Bell's theorem showed, in 1964, that either the statistical predictions of (juantum theory are false or the principle of local causes is false. In 1972, Clauser and Freed- man performed an experiment at Berkeley which validated the relevant statistical predictions of quantum theory. Therefore, according to Bell's theorem, the principle of locals causes must be false. The principle of local causes says that what happens in one area does not depend upon variables subject to the control of an experimenter in a distant space-like separated area. The simplest way to explain the failure of the principle of local causes is to conclude that what happens is one area does depend upon variables subject to the control of an experimenter in a distant space-like separated area. If this explanation is correct, then we live in a nonlocal universe (\"locality fails\") characterized by superluminal (faster than light) connections between apparently \"separate parts.\" However, there are other ways in which the principle of local causes can fail. The principle of local causes is based upon two tacit assumptions. The first tacit assumption is thct we have the ability to determine our own actions, i.e., thai"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"THE END OF SCIENCE / 303 we have a free will.* The second tacit assumption is that when we choose to do one thing in place of another, \"what would have happened if . . .\" would have produced definite results. These two assumptions together are what Stapp calls contrafactual definiteness. If the first assumption (contrafactualness) fails, then we are led to a superdeterminism which precludes the idea of alter- native possibilities. According to this type of determinism, it is not possible that the world ever could have been other than it is. If the second assumption (definiteness) fails, then we are led to the Many Worlds theory in which the world continuously is splitting into separate and mutually inacces- sible branches, each of which contains different editions of the same actors performing different acts at the same time on different stages which somehow are located in the same place. There may be still ways to understand the failure of the principle of local causes, but the very fact that it must fail means that the world is in some way profoundly different from our ordinary ideas about it. (Perhaps we really are living in a dark cave). The \"no models\" option on the diagram is, in effect, the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (page 37). In 1927, the most famous assemblage of physicists in history decided that it might not ever be possible to construct a model of reality, i.e., to explain the way things \"really are behind the scenes.\" Despite the tidal wave of \"knowledge\" which has swept over us for forty years, the Fundamental Physics Group found it necessary, like the physicists at Copenhagen a half century before them, to acknowledge that it might not be possible to construct a model of reality. This acknowledgment is more than a recognition of the limitations of this theory or that theory. It is a recognition emerging throughout the West that knowledge itself is limited. Said * Physicists usually express philosophical phrases (like \"free will\") in more precise terms. For example, the concept of free will is defined within this experimental situation as the tacit assumption that \"each of the two observers, one located in area A, and the other located in area B. can choose between two possible observation-* [experiments].\" These two choices are considered \"free variables\" in the context of the study of the observations made on the two-particle system."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"304 / ENLIGHTENMENT another way, it is a recognition of the difference between knowledge and wisdom.* Classical science starts with the assumption of separate parts which together constitute physical reality. Since its inception, it has concerned itself with how these separate parts are related. Newton's great work showed that the earth, the moon and the planets are governed by the same laws as falling apples. The French mathematician, Descartes, invented a way of drawing pictures of relationships between different measure- ments of time and distance. This process (analytic geometry) is a wonderful tool for organizing a wealth of scattered data into one meaningful pattern. Herein lies the strength of western science. It brings huge tracts of apparently unrelated experience into a rational framework of simple concepts like the laws of motion. The starting point of this process is a mental attitude which initially perceives the physical world as fragmented and different experiences as logically unrelated. Newtonian science is the effort to find the relationships between pre-existing \"separate parts.\" Quantum mechanics is based upon the opposite epistemo- logical assumption. Thus, there are profound differences be- tween Newtonian mechanics and quantum theory. The most fundamental difference between Newtonian phys- ics and quantum mechanics is the fact that quantum mechan- ics is based upon observations (\"measurements\"). Without a measurement of some kind, quantum mechanics is mute. Quantum mechanics says nothing about what happens between measurements. In Heisenberg's words: \"The term 'happens' *In fact, most physicists do not believe that it is worthwhile to think about these problems. The main thrust of the Copenhagen Interpretation, which is the interpretation of quantum theory accepted by the bulk of the scientific commu- nity, is that the proper goal of science is to provide a mathematical framework for organizing and expanding our experiences, rather than providing a picture of some reality that could lie behind these experiences. That is, most physicists today side with Bohr, rather than with Einstein, on the question of the utility of seeking a model of a reality that can be conceived of independently of our experience of it. From the Copenhagen point of view, quantum theory is satisfactory as it is, and the effort to \"understand\" it more deeply is not productive for science. Such efforts lead to perplexities of just the sort that we have been discussing. These perplexities seem to most physicists to be more philosophical than physical. Thus most physicists choose the \"no model\" option shown in the diagram."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"THE END OF SCIENCE / 305 is restricted to the observation.\" lc> This is very important, for it constitutes a philosophy of science unlike any before it. We commonly say, for example, that we detect an electron at point A and then at point B, but strictly speaking, this is incorrect. According to quantum mechanics, there was no electron which traveled from point A to point B. There are only the measurements that we made at point A and at point B. Quantum theory not only is closely bound to philosophy, but also—and this is becoming increasingly apparent—to theories of perception. As early as 1932, von Neumann explored this relation in his \"Theory of Measurement.\" (Exactly when does the wave function associated with a particle collapse? When the particle strikes a photographic plate? When the photographic plate is developed? When the light rays from the developed photographic plate strike our retina? When the nerve impulses from the retina reach our brain?) (page 77). Bohr's principle of complementarity (page 93) also addresses the underlying relation of physics to consciousness. The experimenter's choice of experiment determines which mutu- ally exclusive aspect of the same phenomenon (wave or parti- cle) will manifest itself. Likewise, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (page 111) demonstrates that we cannot observe a phenomenon without changing it. The physical properties which we observe in the \"external\" world are enmeshed in our own perceptions not only psychologically, but ontologically as well. The second most fundamental difference between Newtonian physics and quantum theory is that Newtonian physics predicts events and quantum mechanics predicts the probability of events. According to quantum mechanics, the only determinable relation between events is statistical—that is, a matter of probability. David Bohm, Professor of Physics at Birkbeck College, University of London, proposes that quantum physics is, in fact, based upon a perception of a new order. According to Bohm, \"We must turn physics around. Instead of starting with parts and showing how they work together (the Cartesian order) (page 22) we start with the whole.\" lfi Bohm's theory is compatible with Bell's theorem. Bell's theorem implies that the apparently \"separate parts\" of the universe could be intimately connected at a deep and funda- mental level. Bohm asserts that the most fundamental level is"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"306 / ENLIGHTENMENT an unbroken wholeness which is, in his words, \"that-which- is.\" All things, including space, time and matter are forms of that-which-is. There is an order which is enfolded into the very process of the universe, but that enfolded order may not be readily apparent. For example, imagine a large hollow cylinder into which is placed a smaller cylinder. The space between the smaller cylinder and the larger cylinder is filled with a clear viscous liquid like glycerine (such a device actually exists). Now suppose that we deposit a small droplet of ink on the surface of the glycerine. Because of the nature of the glycer- ine, the ink drop remains intact, a well-defined black spot floating on a clear liquid. If we begin to rotate one of the cylinders, say in a clockwise direction, the drop of ink spreads out in the opposite direc- tion, making a line which grows thinner and thinner until it disappears altogether. The ink droplet now is enfolded com- pletely into the glycerine, but it is still there. When we rotate the cylinder in the opposite direction, the ink droplet reappears. A fine line appears which grows thicker and thicker and then collects into a single point. If we continue the counterclockwise motion of the cylinder, the same thing happens, but in reverse. We can repeat this process as often as we like. Each time the ink spot becomes a"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"THE END OF SCIENCE / 307 fine line and disappears into the glycerine only to reappear again when the motion of the glycerine is reversed. If it requires one complete revolution of the cylinder clock- wise to make the droplet disappear completely, one complete revolution of the cylinder counterclockwise will make it reappear in its original shape and location. The number of revolutions required to make the droplet disappear or reappear is the enfolded order. Bohm calls this enfolded order the \"implicate order,\" which means the same thing. Suppose that we deposit a drop of ink on the surface of the glycerine, revolve the cylinder clockwise until the drop disappears (one revolution), add a second drop of ink to the glycerine, continue to revolve the cylinder in the same direc- tion until it disappears (one more revolution), and then add a third drop of ink to the glycerine and revolve the cylinder one more revolution until the third drop also disappears. Now we have three ink drops enfolded into the glycerine. None of them are visible, but we know where each of them is in the implicate order. When we revolve the cylinder in the opposite direction, one drop of ink (the third) appears after one revolution, an- other drop of ink (the second) appears after the next revolution, and another drop of ink (the first) appears after the third revolution. This is the unfolded, or \"explicate,\" order. The three ink droplets appear to be unrelated in the explicate (unfolded) order, but we know that they are related in the implicate (enfolded) order. If we^ consider the condensation of ink droplets in this experiment as \"particles,\" we have Bohm's hypothesis of apparently random subatomic phenomena. \"Particles' may appear in different places yet be connected in the implicate order. In Bohm's words, \"Particles may be discontiguous in space (the explicate order) but continguous in the implicate order.\" 17 \"Matter is a form of the implicate order as a vortex is a form of the water—it is not reducible to smaller particles.\" 18 Like \"matter\" and everything else, particles are forms of the impli- cate order. If this is difficult to grasp, it is because our minds demand to know, \"What is the 'implicate order' the implicate order of?\" The \"implicate order\" is the implicate order of that-which-is. However, that-which-is is the implicate order. This world view"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"308 / ENLIGHTENMENT is so different from the one that we are using that, as Bohm points out, \"Description is totally incompatible with what we want to say.\" 19 Description is incompatible with what we want to say because our thinking is based upon an ancient Greek mode of thought. According to this mode of thought, only Being is. Therefore, Non-being is not. This way of thinking gives us a practical tool for dealing with the world, but it doesn't describe what happens. Actually, Non-being also is. Both Being and Non-being are that-which-is. Everything, even \"emptiness,\" is that-which-is. There is nothing which is not that-which-is. This way of looking at reality raises the question of the consciousness of the observer. Our minds demand to know, \"What is the 'implicate order' the implicate order of?\" be- cause our culture has taught us to perceive only the explicate order (the Cartesian view). \"Things\" to us are intrinsically separate. Bohm's physics require, in his words, a new \"instrument of thought.\" A new instrument of thought such as is needed to understand Bohm's physics, however, would radically alter the consciousness of the observer, reorientating it toward a perception of the \"unbroken wholeness\" of which everything is a form. However, such a perception would not cause an inability to see the explicate order. Bohm's physics contains an element of relativity parallel to that of Einstein's theories. The impli- cate or explicate nature of order (or order of nature) depends upon the perspective of the viewer. The problem is that our present viewpoint is limited to the perspective of the explicate order. From the perspective of the implicate order the apparently \"separate elements\" of the explicate order are intimately related. Even the phrases \"elements\" and \"inti- mately related\" imply a Cartesian separateness which does not exist. At the fundamental level of that-which-is, the \"separate elements\" which are \"intimately related in the implicate order\" are the implicate order. The requirement for a new instrument of thought upon which to base Bohm's physics may not be as much of an obstacle as it first appears. There already exists an instrument of thought based upon an \"unbroken wholeness.\" Furthermore, there exist a number of sophisticated psychologies, distilled from two thousand years of practice and introspection, whose sole purpose is to develop this thought instrument."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"THE END OF SCIENCE / 309 These psychologies are what we commonly call \"Eastern religions.\" \"Eastern religions\" differ considerably among themselves. It would be a mistake to equate Hinduism, for example, with Buddhism, even though they are more like each other than either one of them is like a religion of the West. Nonetheless, all eastern religions (psychologies) are com- patible in a very fundamental way with Bohm's physics and philosophy. All of them are based upon the experience of a pure, undifferentiated reality which is that-which-is. While it would be naive to overstate the similarities be- tween Bohm's physics and eastern philosophies, it would be foolish to ignore them. Consider, for example, the following sentences: The word \"reality\" is derived from the roots \"thing\" (res) and \"think\" (revi). \"Reality\" means \"everything you can think about.\" This is not \"that-which-is.\" No idea can cap- ture \"truth\" in the sense of that-which-is. The ultimate perception does not originate in the brain or any material structure, although a material structure is necessary to manifest it. The subtle mechanism of know- ing the truth does not originate in the brain. There is a similarity between thought and matter. All matter, including ourselves, is determined by \"informa- tion.\" \"Information\" is what determines space and time. Taken out of context, there is no absolute way of knowing whether these statements were made by Professor Bohm or a Tibetan Buddhist. In fact, these sentences were excerpted from different parts of two physics lectures that Professor Bohm gave at Berkeley in April, 1977. The first lecture was given on the campus to physics students. The second lecture was given in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory to a group of profes- sional physicists. Two of these three statements were taken from the second lecture, the one given to the advanced physicists. It is ironic that while Bohm's theories are received with some skepticism by most professional physicists, they would I find an immediately sympathetic reception among the thousands"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"310 / ENLIGHTENMENT of people in our culture who have turned their backs on science in their own quest for the ultimate nature of reality. If Bohm's physics, or one similar to it, should become the main thrust of physics in the future, the dances of East and West could blend in exquisite harmony. Physics curricula of the twenty-first century could include classes in meditation. The function of eastern religions (psychologies) is to allow the mind to escape the confines of the symbolic. According to this view, even/thing is a symbol, not only words and con- cepts, but also people and things. Beyond the confines of the symbolic lies that which is, pure awareness, the experience of the \"suchness\" of reality. Nonetheless, every eastern religion resorts to the use of symbols to escape the realm of the symbolic. Some disciplines use symbols more than others, but all of them use symbols in one form or another. Therefore, the question arises, if pure awareness is considered distinct from the content of awareness, in what ways specifically does the content of awareness affect the realization of pure awareness? What types of content prompt the mind to leap forward. What enables it to activate the self-fulfilling capability to transcend itself. It is very difficult to answer this question. Any answer is only a point of view. A point of view itself is limiting. To \"understand\" something is to give up some other way of con- ceiving it. This is another way of saying that the mind deals in forms of limitation. Nonetheless, there is a relationship be- tween the content of awareness and the ability of the mind to transcend itself. \"Reality\" is what we take to be true. What we take to be true is what we believe. What we believe is based upon our perceptions. What we perceive depends upon what we look for. What we look for depends upon what we think. What we think depends upon what we perceive. What we perceive determines what we believe. What we believe determines what we take to be true. What we take to be true is our reality. The central focus of this process, initially at any rate, is \"What we think.\" We at least can say that allegiance to a symbol of openness (Christ, Buddha, Krishna, \"the infinite diversity of nature,\" etc.) seems to open the mind and that an open mind is often the first step in the process of enlight- enment."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"THE END OF SCIENCE / 31 1 The psychological gestalt of physics has shifted radically in the last century to one of extreme openness. In the middle 1800s, Newtonian mechanics was at its zenith. There seemed to be no phenomenon which could not be explained in terms of mechanical models. All mechanical models were subject to long-established principles. The chairman of the physics de- partment at Harvard discouraged graduate study because so few important matters remained unsolved. 20 In a speech to the Royal Institution in 1900, Lord Kelvin reflected that there were only two \"clouds\" on the horizon of physics, the problem of black-body radiation and the Michel- son-Morley experiment. 21 There was no doubt, said Kelvin, that they soon would be gone. He was wrong. Kelvin's two \"clouds\" signaled the end of the era that began with Galileo and Newton. The problem of black-body radiation led to Planck's discovery of the quantum of action. Within thirty years the entirety of Newtonian physics became a special limiting case of the newly developing quantum theory. The Michelson-Morley experiment foreshadowed Einstein's famous theories of relativity. By 1927, the foundations of the new physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, were in place. In contrast to Kelvin's time, the allegiance of physicists today is to a symbol of extreme openness. Isidor Rabi, Nobel Prize winner and Chairman Emeritus of the Physics Depart- ment at Columbia University, wrote in 1975: I don't think that physics will ever have an end. I think that the novelty of nature is such that its variety will be infinite—not just in changing forms but in the profundity of insight and the newness of ideas . . , 22 Stapp wrote in 1971: . . . human inquiry can continue indefinitely to yield im- portant new truths. 23 The \"What we think\" of physicists today is that the physics of nature, like human experience itself, is infinitely diverse. Eastern religions have nothing to say about physics, but they have a great deal to say about human experience. In Hindu mythology, Kali, the Divine Mother, is the symbol for the infinite diversity of experience. Kali represents the entire physical plane. She is the drama, tragedy, humor, and sorrow of life. She is the brother, father, sister, mother, lover, and"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"312 / ENLIGHTENMENT friend. She is the fiend, monster, beast, and brute. She is the sun and the ocean. She is the grass and the dew. She is our sense of accomplishment and our sense of doing worthwhile. Our thrill of discovery is a pendant on her bracelet. Our grati- fication is a spot of color on her cheek. Our sense of importance is the bell on her toe. This full and seductive, terrible and wonderful earth mother always has something to offer. Hindus know the impossibility of seducing her or conquering her and the futility of loving her or hating her; so they do the only thing that they can do. They simply honor her. In a particular story, Kali, the Divine Mother, is Sita, the wife of God. Ram is God. Ram, Sita, and Laksaman, who is Ram's brother, are walking along a jungle trail. The path is so narrow that most of the time Laksaman can see only Sita, who walks between him and Ram. Every so often, however, the path turns in such a way that Laksaman can see his brother, God. These powerful metaphors have application to the develop- ing drama of physics. Although most physicists have little patience (professionally) with metaphors, physics itself has be- come a powerful metaphor. Twentieth-century physics is the story of a journey from intellectual entrenchment to intellec- tual openness, despite the conservative prove-it-to-me nature of individual physicists. The realization that the discoveries of physics never will end has brought physicists, as well as those who have followed the story of physics, to an extremely fertile plateau. This realization invites the intellect to leap forward, although at great risk to its present hegemony. The Wu Li Masters know that physicists are doing more than \"discovering the endless diversity of nature.\" They are dancing with Kali, the Divine Mother of Hindu mythology. Buddhism is both a philosophy and a practice. Buddhist philosophy is rich and profound. Buddhist practice is called Tantra. Tantra is the Sanskrit word meaning \"to weave.\" There is little that can be said about Tantra. It must be done. Buddhist philosophy reached its ultimate development in the second century A.D No one has been able to improve much on it since then. The distinction between Buddhist phi- losophy and Tantra is well defined. Buddhist philosophy can be intellectualized. Tantra cannot. Buddhist philosophy is a function of the rational mind. Tantra transcends rationality."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"THE END OF SCIENCE / 313 The most profound thinkers of the Indian civilization discovered that words and concepts could take them only so far. Beyond that point came the actual doing of a practice, the experience of which was ineffable. This did not prevent them from progressively refining the practice into an extremely effective and sophisticated set of techniques, but it did prevent them from being able to describe the experiences which these techniques produce. The practice of Tantra does not mean the end of rational thought. It means the integration of thought based on symbols into larger spectrums of awareness. (Enlightened people still remember their zip codes.) The development of Buddhism in India shows that a profound and penetrating intellectual quest into the ultimate nature of reality can culminate in, or at least set the stage for, a quantum leap beyond rationality. In fact, on an individual level, this is one of the roads to enlightenment. Tibetan Buddhism calls it the Path without Form, or the Practice of Mind. The Path without Form is prescribed for people of intellectual tempera- ment. The science of physics is following a similar path. The development of physics in the twentieth century al- ready has transformed the consciousness of those involved with it. The study of complementarity (page 93), the uncer- tainty principle (page 111), quantum field theory (page 199), and the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (page 37) produces insights into the nature of reality very similar to those produced by the study of eastern philosophy. The profound physicists of this century increasingly have be- come aware that they are confronting the ineffable. Max Planck, the father of quantum mechanics, wrote: Science . . . means unresting endeavor and continually progressing development toward an aim which the poetic intuition may apprehend, but which the intellect can never fully grasp. 24 We are approaching the end of science. \"The end of science\" does not mean the end of the \"unresting endeavor and continually progressing development\" of more and more com- prehensive and useful physical theories. (Enlightened physi- cists remember their zip codes, too.) The \"end of science\" means the coming of western civilization, in its own time and in its own way, into the higher dimensions of human exper- ience."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"314 / ENLIGHTENMENT Professor G F Chew, Chairman of the Physics Depart- ment at Berkeley, remarked, in reference to a theory of parti- cle physics Our current struggle [with certain aspects of advanced phvsics] may thus be only a foretaste of a completely new form of human intellectual endeavor, one that will not only lie outside phvsics but will not even be descnbable as ' scientific ' >20 We need not make a pilgrimage to India or Tibet There is much to learn there, but here at home, in the most incon- ceivable of places, amidst the particle accelerators and com- puters, our own Path without Form is emerging Al Huang, the Tai Chi Master who created the metaphor of VVu Li, once wrote sooner or later we reach a dead end when we talk \" 2fi He could as well have said that sooner or later we go round in circles when we talk since going round in a circle is one kind of dead end \\s we sat in a cabin at Esalen and talked late into the night, mv new friend, David Finkelstem, spoke to us softly I think it would be misleading to call particles the entities involved in the most primitive events of the theory [quantum topology] because they don't move in space and time, thev don t earn mass, they don't have charge, they don t have energy in the usual sense of the word QUESTION So what is it that makes events at that level?
