[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Population Control Agenda Stanley K. Monteith, M.D. Posted with permission on www.Net4TruthUSA.com/populationcontrol.htm One of the most difficult concepts for Americans to accept is that there are human beings dedicated to coercive population control and genocide. Many read ers will acknowledge that our government is helping to finance the Red Chinese program of forced abortion, forced sterilization, infanticide, and control of the numbers of live births. Most readers will accept the fact t hat our nation is helping to finance the United Nat ions’ world- wide “family planning program”, a form of populatio n control. Most rational men and women, however, fi nd it impossible to believe that such programs are really part of a “master plan” to kill off large segments of the world’s population. I shall have to admit that I studied the politics o f AIDS (HIV disease) for over a decade before I fin ally came to a horrifying conclusion. The real motivatio n behind efforts to block utilization of standard p ublic health measures to control further spread of the HIV epide mic was “population control.” That was not an easy concept for me to acknowledge, despite the fact that I had long recognized that the twentieth century has been the bloodiest hundred-year period in all recorded human history. It was not until I journeyed to Elberton, Georgia, stood within the dark shadows of the great Druid-li ke monument built there, and read the words engraved o n the massive stone pillars of that structure that I finally came to accept the truth. At that point it became o bvious that just as our Lord has given mankind Ten Commandments to guide our lives, so, too, those fro m “the dark side” have been given their instruction s from the “one” they worship. The ten programs of the “gu ides” are inscribed in eight different languages on the four great granite pillars of the American Stonehenge. T hat message foretells a terrifying future for human ity, and explains why efforts to approach the AIDS epidemic from a logical point of view have been consistently thwarted. 1 Before you scoff, and reject my suggestion as som e sort of madness, check out my references, then tr y to disprove my conclusions. If my allegations are u nfounded, you will soon recognize the deception and return to your daily activities, certain that there is no cause for concern. On the other hand, should you de termine that my assessment is correct, or even partially correct , then you have a moral obligation to decide just w hat part you intend to play in response to the unfolding wor ld genocide - how you will protect yourself, your l oved ones, and the countless millions of helpless human beings throughout the world who have been marked for destruction. You must never forget the warning recorded for post erity by Martin Niemoeller, the Lutheran minister who lived in Hitler’s Germany during the 1930s and 1940s. His words echo down to us over succeeding decades: “In Germany they came first for the Communists, and I didn’t speak up because I wasn’t a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I didn’ t speak up because I wasn’t a Jew. Then they came f or the trade unionists, and I didn’t speak up because I wasn’t a trade unionist. Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn’t speak up because I was a Pr otestant. Then they came for me, and by that time n o one was left to speak up.” 2   1 Copies of the material obtained in Elberton, Georg ia, on The Georgia Guidestones, and a four-audio-ta pe set on “Population Control” are available from Radio Liberty: P.O.

Why is that fact never m entioned? The question that I am most frequently asked is, “How can you possibly believe that there are pe ople who intend to kill off large segments of the world’s population?” My answer is really quite simple. I hold that beli ef because I have read their writings. I believe they are telling the truth. Just as Adolf H itler wrote of his plans for Europe in “Mein Kampf” (My Plan), so, too, those who intend to depopulate large segme nts of the earth have written of the necessity of l imiting the world’s population. They fully intend to “extermina te” a significant portion of the world’s population . The fact that the vast majority of Americans have never hear d of their intent, of The Georgia Guidestones in El berton, or of “The Plan” and “The Hierarchy” attests to the de gree of control that exists over what the American people have been allowed to know about the occultic forces which are working within our society today. Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood As you read on you will soon discover that I have p rimarily relied on material which can be readily found in books, audio-taped interviews, and public news sources. If you take the time to check my refe rences, you will soon discover that there really are those who have publicly advocated the elimination of “human weeds” and “the cleansing of society.” Indeed, to this very day your tax money is used to finance Planned Parenthood, an organization founded by Margaret San ger. During the 1930s Margaret Sanger openly suppor ted the Nazi plan for genetic engineering of the German population, and the propagation of a “super race.” In Planned Parenthood’s 1985 “Annual Report” leader s of that organization proclaimed that they were, “ Proud of our past, and planning for our future.” 3 How could anyone possibly claim to be proud of the organization founded by Margaret Sanger when history records that she wrote of the necessity of: “the extermination of ‘human weeds’ ...the ‘cessati on of charity,’ ... the segregation of ‘morons, misfits, and the maladjusted,’ and ... the sterilization of ‘genetically inferior races.’” 4 Margaret Sanger published “The Birth Control Review .” In that magazine she openly supported the “infanticide program” promoted by Nazi Germany in t he 1930s, and publicly championed Adolf Hitler’s go al of Aryan white supremacy. In the years prior to World War II Margaret Sanger commissioned Ernst Rudin, a member of the Nazi Party, and director of the dread ed German Medical Experimentation Programs, to serv e as an advisor to her organization. In his excellent bo ok “Killer Angel”, George Grant chronicles the life and writings of Margaret Sanger, and painstakingly docu ments Sanger’s plans for the genetic engineering of the human race. George Grant noted that in the 1920s Ma rgaret Sanger wrote “The Pivot of Civilization” in which she called for: “The ‘elimination of ‘human weeds,’ for the ‘cessat ion of charity’ because it prolonged the lives of t he unfit, for the segregation of ‘morons, misfits, and the maladjusted,’ and for the sterilization of gen etically inferior races.’“ 5 According to George Grant, Margaret Sanger believed that the unfit should not be allowed to reproduce. Accordingly, she opened a birth control clinic in: “The Brownsville section of New York, an area popul ated by newly immigrated Slavs, Latins, Italians, and Jews. She targeted the ‘unfit’ for her crusade to ‘save the planet.’“ 6   3 Killer Angel: George Grant: Reformer Press: p 105: available from Radio Liberty: P.O.

We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the Minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it e ver occurs to any of their more rebellious members.” (emphasis added-Ed.) 8 As Margaret Sanger’s organization grew in power, in fluence, and acceptance, she began to write of the necessity of targeting religious groups for destruc tion as well, believing that the “dysgenic races” should include “Fundamentalists and Catholics” in addition to “blacks, Hispanics, (and) American Indians.” 9 As the years went by, Margaret Sanger became increa singly obsessed with her occultic beliefs. Along with her acceptance of the occult, she became incre asingly hostile to both Christianity and the Americ an precepts of individual freedom under God. Her dista ste for America can be seen in her writings when sh e wrote: “Birth control appeals to the advanced radical beca use it is calculated to undermine the authority of the Christian churches. I look forward to seeing humani ty free someday of the tyranny of Christianity no l ess than Capitalism.” 10 Margaret Sanger eventually embraced not only commun ism but theosophy as well. What is theosophy? It is a covert, occultic religion based upon the repudiation of God and the worship of Luci fer. In modern-day America, theosophy is one of the most po werful hidden (occult) forces working behind the sc enes in New York City, Washington D.C., and across our n ation today. 11 How many times have you been told that Adolf Hitler killed 6 million Jews in the Holocaust? What you probably have never been told, however, is the segm ent of the Holocaust tragedy recorded by Professor Norman Cohn in his historical account of the Jewish Holoca ust, “Warrant for Genocide.” Professor Cohn chronic led the dark days of World War II, noting: “ Only about a third of the civilians killed by the N azis and their accomplices were Jews ...Other peoples were marked out for deci mation, subjugation, and enslavement, and the civil ian losses of some of these (countries - Ed.) amounted to 11 per cent to 12 per cent of the total populati on.” 12 If Professor Cohn’s figures are accurate - and I fe el certain that they are, because other Jewish researchers have come up with similar figures - the n why haven’t the Christians of America been allowe d to learn the fact that in addition to the 6 million Je ws murdered by the Nazis, somewhere between 7 and 1 2 million non-Jews were also ruthlessly liquidated in Hitler’ s Germany? I believe this information has been intentionally s uppressed because those who were killed were largel y Christians, and the covert forces which control the reality of the American public today do not want t he followers of Jesus Christ in our nation to awaken t o their peril ...until it is far too late. Hitler h ated not only Jews and Judaism, he also hated Christians and Christian ity as well. Why was that? Because Adolf Hitler, ju st like Margaret Sanger, was a disciple of theosophy and of Madame Blavatsky, the founder of a religion that worshipped Lucifer. Accordingly, both Margaret Sang er and Adolf Hitler were energized by the same “dar k, spiritual forces.”   7 Woman’s Body, Woman’s Right: p 332: see also Kille r Angel: p 73 8 Killer Angel: p 74: see also: Woman’s Body, Woman’ s Right: Linda Gordon: New York: Penguin Press: pp 229-334. 9 Woman’s Body, Woman’s Right: pp 229-334: see also Killer Angel: p 73 10 Killer Angel: p 104 11 Killer Angel: p 90: see also The Dark Side of Free masonry: Decker: Huntington House: p 71: equating S atan with the “white deity”: see also: The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow: Cumbey : Huntington House: available from Radio Liberty. 12 Warrant for Genocide: Cohn: Harper and Rowe: 1966: p 15."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The fact that most of our citizens have never heard of Madame Blavatsky, theosophy, or that two of theosophy’s most ardent disciples were Adolf Hit ler and Margaret Sanger clearly reflects the degree of control that exists over what the American people h ave been allowed to learn about the occultic forces at work in our nation today. As a researcher on the subject of the occult, I r egularly receive letters and publications from the Lucis Trust. The Lucis Trust of today is the modern-day e xtension of the “Lucifer Publishing Company”, an organization founded by Alice Bailey during the ear ly years of the twentieth century. Alice Bailey was a disciple of Madame Blavatsky and the nominal leader of the Theosophical Society between the early 1900 s and the late 1920s. Because the name “Lucifer” had such a bad connotation in those days, Alice Bailey chan ged the name of her organization from “The Lucifer Publishi ng Company” to “The Lucis Trust.” The nature and be liefs of her organization, however, have always remained the same. The Lucis Trust of today is one of the ma jor front groups through which theosophy works to influ ence life here in America. The supernatural powers that still energize The Lucis Trust today certainly come from the same dark, spiritual forces that energize d Madame Blavatsky, Adolf Hitler, and Margaret Sanger in gen erations past. Publications from The Lucis Trust regularly refer t o “The Plan” for humanity that has been established by “The Hierarchy.” Part of that plan is inscribed on the great granite pillars of the American Stoneh enge in Elberton, Georgia ... “The Georgia Guidestones.” 13 A full discussion on the subjects of population con trol and occultism is far beyond the scope of this short monograph. Full documentation on these subjects wil l be found in my soon-to-be-published book, “None Dare Call It Genocide.” At this point let me simply offer a few examples o f the views expressed by those who publicly advocate population reduction and/or genoc ide. David Graber, a research biologist with the Nationa l Park Service, was quoted in the Los Angeles Times Book Review Section, October 22, 1989, as saying: “Human happiness and certainly human fecundity are not as important as a wild and healthy planet. I know s ocial scientists who remind me that people are part of nature, but it isn’t true ... We have become a plag ue upon ourselves and upon the Earth ...Until such time as homo sapiens should decide to rejoin nature, some o f us can only hope for the right virus to come alon g.” 14 Michael Fox, when he was the vice-president of The Humane Society of the United States wrote, “Mankind is the most dangerous, destructive, selfish and unethi cal animal on the earth.” 15 In “The First Global Revolution”, published by Th e Council of the Club of Rome, an international eli tist organization, the authors note that: “In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shor tages, famine, and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention ...The rea l enemy, then, is humanity itself.” 16 The Los Angeles Times of April 5, 1994 quoted Corne ll University Professor David Pimentel, speaking before the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as saying that, “The total world population should be no more than 2 billion rather than the cu rrent 5.6 billion.” In the UNESCO Courier of November 1991, Jacques Cou steau wrote: “The damage people cause to the planet is a function of demographics - it is equal to the degree of development. One American burdens the earth much more than twenty Bangladeshes ... This is a te rrible thing to say. In order to stabilize world po pulation, we must eliminate 350,000 people per day. It is a h orrible thing to say, but it’s just as bad not to s ay it.” 17   13 Killer Angel: op cited: p 90: see also: Hitler and the New Age: Rosio: Huntington House: Available fr om Radio Liberty.

If a Bla ck Death could be spread throughout the world once in every generation, survivors could procreate freely withou t making the world too full ... the state of affairs might be somewhat unpleasant, but what of it? Reall y high- minded people are indifferent to suffering, especia lly that of others.” 18 Negative Population Growth Inc. of Teaneck, New Jer sey recently circulated a letter stating their long - range goal. “We believe that our goal for the United States sho uld be no more than 150 million, our size in 1950. For the world, we believe our goal should be a population of not more than two billion, its size shortly after the turn of the century.” 19 In the Global Assessment Report of UNEP (a United N ations sponsored study group), Phase One Draft, Section 9, the authors quoted an expert who suggest ed that: “A reasonable estimate for an industrialized world society at the present North American material stan dard of living would be 1 billion. At the more frug al European standard of living, 2 to 3 billion would b e possible.” 20 More New Age Influence Speaking at a round-table discussion group at the G orbachev Conference held in San Francisco in the fall of 1996, Dr. Sam Keen, a New Age writer and ph ilosopher stated that there was strong agreement th at religious institutions have to take a primary respo nsibility for the population explosion. He went on to say that, “We must speak far more clearly about sexuality, co ntraception, about abortion, about values that cont rol the population, because the ecological crisis, in short , is the population crisis. Cut the population by 9 0% and there aren’t enough people left to do a great deal of eco logical damage.” Mr. Keen’s remarks were met with applause from the assembled audience made up largely of New Age adherents, Socialists, Internationalists and occult ists. Many of the leading occultists of our modern world attended that meeting in San Francisco, a meeting o rganized by Mikhail Gorbachev, former Director of t he Soviet KGB, and later President of Russia. 21 What is the message found on The Georgia Guidestone s? What is the plan of the “guides”? If you read occultic literature, you will soon find that those who worship Lucifer today refer to a “Hierarchy” th at guides both their actions and the affairs of the world. Wh o are the “Hierarchy”? The Lucis Trust, formerly Th e Lucifer Publishing Company, recently sent a letter to their supporters stating, “The spiritual Hierarchy makes definite use of the twelve spiritual Festival periods. We ca n learn to cooperate with the members of the Hierar chy as they work to bring the divine Plan to the attention of men and women of goodwill and spiritual aspirat ion everywhere throughout the world. The idea of spirit ual approach - of Hierarchy to humanity and humanit y to Hierarchy - is the primary principle underlying med itation ...understanding of how the spiritual energ ies which flow through each zodiacal sign can illumine and in spire right human relations.” 22 The ancient Druids were members of an occultic re ligion; the circle of monuments at Stonehenge in England is occultic; and the message engraved on th e American Stonehenge in Elberton is occultic. Yoko Ono is the widow of John Lennon, a man who was deeply i nvolved in the occult.   18 The Impact of Science on Society: Bertrand Russell : 1953: p xv. 19 Material is available from Radio Liberty, P.O.

The first of the “guides” rea ds: “Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature. (This-Ed.) Means the entire hu man race at its climax level for permanent balance with nature.” The Infamous Tuskegee Study In recent history, we have seen the influence of oc cultic population control advocates here in America . Nowhere is that influence better demonstrated than in the Tuskegee Study, a scientific research progra m in which 400 syphilis-infected black men were recruite d by the U.S. Public Health Service back in 1932. T he participants were all told that they would be treat ed for their infections, but instead of treating th eir illness, all medicines were withheld. The black men were then ac tively prevented from obtaining treatment elsewhere as their bodies, and the bodies of their wives and chi ldren, were systematically ravaged by disease. The evil men who conceived that Nazi-style study ju stified their atrocity by alleging that scientists needed to learn how untreated syphilis progressed i n the human body. For a period of forty years, betw een 1932 and 1972, the genocidal Tuskegee Study continued. I t was not until 1972, when one newspaper finally ha d the courage to break the story to the public, that the Tuskegee Study was finally terminated. By that time , only 125 of the original 400 black men had survived. To this very day, 24 years after the end of that grotesque human experiment, none of the perpetrator s of that atrocity have ever been either accused or indi cted for their crimes. Back in 1932, when the Tuske gee Study began, Margaret Sanger’s ideas had already begun to infect the minds and souls of physicians and scien tists here in America. According to Margaret Sanger’s sen se of morality, experiments on “human weeds” were f ully justified in the name of “science.” Do you honestly believe for one moment that such an experiment wou ld have been tolerated here in America had the participants been white men? 24 Another far more effective method of reducing the w orld population was devised in the early 1960s by a group of environmentalists and population-control a dherents. They set out to block the use of DDT for mosquito and malaria control after it had been foun d that the insecticide was extremely effective in saving human lives. Alexander King, president of the Club of Rome, wr ote, “My own doubts came when DDT was introduced. In Guyana, within two years, it had alm ost eliminated malaria. So my chief quarrel with DD T,in hindsight, is that it has greatly added to the popu lation problem.” 25 In 1970 The National Academy of Sciences, in their book “Life Sciences”, stated that, “In little more than two decades DDT has prevented 500 million deat hs due to malaria.” To population-control advocates, this irresponsible preservation of human life was unconscionable, so they set out to outlaw further use of the pesticide .

Indeed, DDT was the safest pesticide ever known to mankind. Furthermore, it wa s inexpensive and could be widely used in third-wor ld countries to control the spread of insect-borne dis eases. Accordingly, population-control adherents se t out to have DDT banned in the name of saving the environme nt. You have probably read the contrived stories allegi ng that DDT caused softening of eggshells, interfer ed with the balance of nature, and endangered humanity by entering into the food chain. In truth, all of those stories were fabricated, and were simply part of a carefully coordinated program to block further use of the life- saving pesticide. If you are interested in learning the truth concerning the deceitful campaign waged against DDT, I suggest that you order a copy of my audio-ta ped interviews with Dr. J. Gordon Edwards. Dr. Edwa rds is a world-renowned biologist who led the fight in the 1960s to counter the propaganda program waged by environmentalists and population-control advocates to ban further use of DDT. You can also order a cop y of Dr. Edward’s excellent monograph, “Remembering Silent S pring and its Consequences.” William Ruckelshaus was a long-time member of the E nvironmental Defense Fund, and the Director of the EPA. He outlawed further use of DDT in 1972 des pite the recommendation of the chairman of the EPA investigating committee which had heard six months of testimony on use of the pesticide, and had deter mined that DDT was completely safe. When Ruckelshaus outl awed further use of DDT, he signed the death warran t for hundreds of millions of helpless human beings l iving in third-world countries. To those energized by the dark side, however, the loss of hundreds of million s of human lives was relatively inconsequential. In his excellent monograph, “Remembering Silent Spr ing and its Consequences”, Professor J. Gordon Edwards quoted from a speech delivered by Victor Ya nconne, founder of the Environmental Defense Fund. In that talk, Mr. Yanconne related a story told to him by a reporter who had asked Dr. Charles Wurster, o ne of the major opponents of DDT, whether a ban on DDT wouldn ’t actually result in far greater use of much more toxic pesticides. Dr. Wurster is reported to have replied : “So what? People are the cause of all the problems. We have too many of them. We need to get rid of some of the m and this is as good a way as any.” hen asked by the same reporter, “Doctor, how do you square the killing of people wi th the mere loss of some birds?” Dr. Wurster is reported to have replied, “It doesn’t really make a lot of difference, becaus e organo phosphate acts locally and only kills farmworkers and most of them are Mexican s and Negroes.” 26 How many people have died in the past 25 years sinc e the use of DDT was outlawed? If the National Academy of Sciences was correct in their 1970 asses sment that 500 million lives had been saved by DDT over a twenty-year period, then we have probably lost well over 600 million human lives during the past twent y-five years since advocates of population control succeed ed in outlawing DDT. 27 The Relationship Between Abortion, Breast Carcinoma , and Population Control Let me offer another example of a population contro l program which is being promoted here in the United States today. Many physicians have expressed their concern about the dramatic increase in breas t carcinoma seen in women in recent years. Despite th e fact that 18 scientific studies published in both domestic and foreign medical journals have clearly demonstra ted the direct causal relationship between first-tr imester abortion and breast cancer, all efforts to dissemin ate that information here in the United States have been consistently blocked by those who favor abortion an d population control.

That study clearly demonstrated a higher incidence of breast cancer in women who ha d had first- trimester abortions . In response to that publication, the American Med ical Association (AMA), the American Cancer Society (ACS), and pro-abortion/population-c ontrol advocates joined together in an unholy allia nce to attack the conclusions of the authors, and to block all efforts to disseminate that information to Ame rican physicians. All of the organizations mentioned abov e continue to oppose efforts to have physicians war n women of the risk they face when they submit themse lves to first-trimester abortions. Before carrying out all surgical procedures in America “advised consent” is required, except for abortion. The AMA. the ACS, and the pro-death lobby continue to insist that women must not be advised of the risk they incur when they destroy the life of their unborn child. Why is there such inconsistency? Cur rent abortion policies in America are absolutely necessa ry to reduce our population. That is why a minor ch ild can be taken from school to an abortion clinic without parental notification, yet that same child cannot b e given an aspirin without parental consent. It all has to do with population control. 28 Population Control in Russia Today Another dramatic example of population control is t he tragedy being played out in the “former” Soviet Union today in regard to male longevity. In Russia, the life span of the average Russian male has drop ped precipitously over the past several decades. The av erage life expectancy of an American male is 74-78 years of age, and in Japan the average life span is 78 years , but the average life span of Russian men has fall en from 68 years in the 1970s to 63.8 years in 1985, to 57.7 y ears in 1994. It is estimated that, if current tren ds continue, the average life span of a Russian male will be 53 year s shortly after the turn of the century. Do you rea lly believe that this shocking reduction in life span is happen ing simply by “accident”? The true cause of this dr amatic reduction in life span in Russia will be detailed i n my coming book, “None Dare Call It Genocide.” 29 The Massacres in Africa One has only to learn what really happened to the Christians in Rwanda between April and July of 199 4 to imagine what may lie in store for Christians her e in America at some time in the not-too-distant fu ture. After the Christian Tutsis had been disarmed by gov ernmental decree in the early 1990s, Hutu-led milit ary forces began to systematically massacre the defense less Christians. The massacre began in April 1994 and continued until July 1994 . Using machetes rather than bullets, the Hutu forc es were able to create a state of abject fear and terror within the helpless Christia n population as they systematically butchered hundr eds of thousands of them. The United Nations immediately c onvened hearings on the genocide taking place in Rwanda, but Madeline Albright, the American Ambassa dor to the United Nations, argued strenuously that neighboring African nations should not be allowed t o intervene until the “civil war had come to an end .” In reality, of course, there was no civil war since th ose being slaughtered had no weapons with which to defend themselves; it was simply a matter of mass murder. In addition to blocking intervention by neighboring nations, Madeline Albright also insisted that the word “genocide” must not be used , and that the United Nations forces stationed in R wanda were not to be allowed to intervene. In the three months that foll owed, between one-half and three-quarters of a mill ion Christians were systematically dismembered, hacked to death, and slaughtered in the bloody carnage tha t ensued.   28 Strong Abortion-Breast Cancer Link Revealed: Washi ngton Times: October 12, 1996: A1. 29 Russia Strives to Reverse Population Shrinkage: Wa shington Times: September 22, 1996: p A8."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Tens of thousands of Christians were murdered in th eir churches; tens of thousands more were murdered in their hospitals and in their schools.

They t hen stood by as their screaming charges were unceremoniously hacked to pieces. At the end of the carnage, in late July 1994, the American government rewarded the Hutu murderers with millions of dollars in foreign aid . Strangely, the American press has remained silent about the fact that almost all of those who were slaughtered were Chris tians, and it was the policies of our government that were primarily responsible for blocking efforts by neigh boring African countries to intervene . 30 There are literally dozens of other examples of p opulation- control programs which have been implemented throughout our world by modern-day “Mal thusians” in their effort to ensure that the world population is dramatically curtailed. To date it is estimated that far more than one billion human liv es have been terminated as a result of the world-wide abortion p rograms financed by the United States. In addition, we are beginning to see the devastating effects of the AID S epidemic as this modern-day plague begins to depo pulate large areas of both Asia and Africa. Because of the influence of occultic population con trollers, however, all logical efforts to address the HIV epidemic through out the world continue to be blocked . Rather than utilizing the proven public health methods used wit h all other illnesses, advocates of population cont rol continue to promote both hedonistic sex education a nd condom distribution. In the May 1996 issue of “S pecial Warfare”, a publication of the John F. Kennedy Spec ial Warfare Center and School, it was noted that: “The immediate future may present other daunting challen ges to Civil Affairs units. Because of complicated social and cultural reasons, AIDS already infects a high p roportion of the military and civilian officials of Zaire, Uganda, Kenya, Zambia, and other central Africa cou ntries. In some or all of these countries, governme nt establishments may collapse in the next 10-15 years . If this pattern is repeated in other areas where AIDS is spreading at an alarming rate, then civil rule may also erode or break down in parts of North Africa, the Middle East, India, and Southeast Asia.” 31 Let me assure you that there really are hundreds of thousands of occultly energized people throughout the world today who honestly believe that human com passion is outmoded, and that the inferior peoples of the world must either be allowed to die or be actively exterminated. I will conclude this monograph by quo ting from the writings of the English Churchman, Thomas Robert Malthus (1766-1834). In his “An Essay on the Principle of Population”, Malthus wrote: “All children born, beyond what would be required t o keep up the population to a desired level, must necessarily per ish, unless room may be made for them by the deaths of grown persons ...Therefore ...we should facilitate, instead of foolishly and vainly endeavoring to imp ede, the operations of nature in producing this mortality... ” 32 I personally believe that God expects each and ever y of us to become involved in the affairs of this world until He returns . Furthermore, I believe that all human life is sac red. We are told that Christians are to be the “salt and light of the world”, the preservat ive that keeps humanity from rotting. What is the C hristian Church doing today to preserve the lives of the inh abitants of God’s earth; what are you doing to prot ect the lives of those who have been targeted by the forces of darkness? Today, the AIDS epidemic is beginning to depopulate both Africa and the non-Communist countr ies of Asia?

Dr. Stan Monteith of Radio Liberty is a good friend of mine, and if you’ve never hear d of him, I can vouch for his credibility, and for his lack of ulterior motiv es. His book “Brotherhood of Darkness” is a MUST RE AD for anyone who is struggling to make sense of world eve nts today. This book, more by far than any I have r ead in my extensive library, puts the events of the day in to a perspective that is shocking, but which fit al l of the known facts about the “powers that be” who control world affairs. You will also want to read my book: “ Land of Childhood’s Fears ” about the Vietnam War – this book will help you understand the true reasons behind why we are w aging war in the Middle East.
