This current publication includes some modi- fications and amplifications that Doctor Russell made with regard to this particular volume prior to his refolding in 1963. Since THE SECRET OF LIGHT was released by Walter Russell, our year's Home Study Course in Universal Law, Nat- ural Science and Living Philosophy-and all of the other books listed herein-have been written and released , for the world is now fully ready and in great need of the ' new and basic knowledge contained in all of these writings. LAO RUSSELL VI CO NC ERNI NG THE DI VINE ILIAD THE DIVINE ILIAD is the basis of this book. THE DIVINE ILIAD is an inspired message from the Creator to give man the needed compre- hension of his relation to his universe , to man, and to God, for the coming cycle. Man progresses in cycles of approximately twenty-five hundred years. At the beginning of each cycle of his growing awareness of the Light within him, God sends messages through prepared 'm es s eng e r s to further his comprehension of the Light. Comprehension of these cosmic messages gradually exalts mankind into higher beings, and thus each cycle is one more step for man toward full awareness of the Light, and of his Oneness with God. THE DIVINE ILIAD cannot be fully published for many years. As much of it as can now be published will appear in these pages. Further portions of it will be released as the world is ready to receive them .

The preservation of the essence of Dr. Russell's thoughts and teachings has been foremost in our minds. Scientific investigation of Walter Russell 's ideas gives the reward of deeper understanding into the nature of the Universe, and will serve as an inspiration and light into the next cen- turies. Technological application of his princi- ples holds the promise of a non-polluting sus- . tainable energy future that is presently so des- perately needed.

The day is now here when all men must know what Jesus meant when He said \"GOD IS LIGHT.\" For within the secret of Light is vast knowledge yet unrevealed to man. Light is all there is; it is all we have to deal with, but we do not yet know what it is. The purpose of this message is to tell what it is. Today's civilization has advanced far in knowing HOW to deal with matter but we do not know WHAT matter is nor the WHY of it. Nor do we know what energy, . electricity, magnetism, gravitation and radia- tion are. Nor do we know the purpose of the inert gases and WHAT they are. Nor do we know the struc- ture of the elemental atoms nor the gyroscopic prin- ciple which determines that structure. Nor are we aware of the fact that this is a two-way continuous universe of balance in all effects of motion and not a one-way discontinuous universe. Nor have we even yet heard of or suspected the most important of all principles in physics, THE VOIDANCE PRINCIPLE and the mirrors and lenses of space which are the cause of illusion in all moving things. xi"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"r i I: i AUTHOR 'S FOREWORD Nor do we even consider the entire material electric universe to be the illusion which it is; there being no reality to it whatsoever. Nor have we the slightest inkling of the cause of curvature of space, nor the voidance of that curvature in planes of zero curvature at wave field boundaries. No one now knows how it is that crystals get their various shapes. It will amaze the world to know that those shapes of crystals are determined in space by the shapes of the wave fields which bound the various ele- mental structures. Nor have we the slightest conception of what con- stitutes the life principle , nor the principle of growth, nor the simultaneous unfoldment-refoldment principle which repeats all patterns in Nature sequentially and records and voids them as they are repeated. Nor are we aware of that recording principle by means of which the Creator carries forth the sum totals of every sequential cycle in His unfolding and refolding uni- verse unto the very end of its manifestations upon one planet and its beginning on anew one. Nor are we dynamically aware of the souls and seeds of things. These roots of universal repetition are now but metaphysical abstractions to religion and physical guesswork to science. Within the secret of Light is the answer to all of these heretofore unanswered questions, and many xii AUTHOR 'S FOREWORD more , which the ages have not yet solved . This revela- tion of the nature of Light will be the inheritance of man in this coming New Age of greater comprehen- sion. Its unfoldment will prove the existence of God by methods and standards acceptable to science and religion alike. It will lay a spiritual foundation under the present material one of science. The two greatest elements in civilization, religion and science , will thus find unity in marriage of the two. Likewise human relationships will become more ' balanced because of greater knowledge of universal law which lies behind all of the processes which light uses to interweave the patterned forms of this electric wave universe. There is no department of life which will not be vitally affected by this new knowledge of the nature of Light, from the university to the laboratory, from gov- ernment to industry, and from nation to nation . I therefore give it to you with all of its clarity as I myself have become aware of it from behind the scenes of this cosmic cinema of light illusion which is our universe.

Civilization progresses in cycles. New comprehension periodically transforms mankind into higher beings. A new cycle of three thousand years duration is now in its birth throes. God's omniscience, omnipotence and omnipresence are centered in the consciousness of every man; but few there are who know of the Oneness of their Self-Soul with the Universal Self-Soul. Man requires many mil- lennia to begin to be aware of that. Each cycle of Jtt an brings him nearer to his awareness of his Oneness with the Light of his Self-Source. Man lives in a bewildering complex world of EFFECf of which he knows not the CAUSE. Because of its seemingly infinite multiplicity and complexity, he fails to vision the simple underlying principle of Bal- ance in all things. He, therefore, complexes Truth until its many angles, sides and facets have lost balance with each other and with him. Truth is simple. Balance is simple. Rhythmic balanced interchange between all pairs of opposite expressions in Natural phenomena, and in human relations, is the con- summate art of God's universe of Light. It is also the Law. In this one fundamental Universal Law lies the balanced continuity of all creative expression in God's electric wave universe of two conditioned lights in 2 THE ETERNAL QUESTION seeming motion which record God's One Whole Idea of Creation into countless seemingly separate parts of that Whole Idea. THE VOICE WITHIN , The great unanswered question of man has a simple answer. The Silent Voice within every man is ceaseless- ly whispering it to his awakening consciousness. Every desire written upon the heart of man is carried to the Source, and its answer will come, but few there are who ask comprehensively and fewer still who hear. Many are the ages of preparation for worthiness to hear it, for man 's consciousness is insulated from his Source by the sensations of his electrically conditioned body which he wrongly thinks of as being his Mind and his personal Self. What he calls his objective human mind isbut the seat of electric sensations of his body. What he mistakes for thinking is but an electric awareness of things sensed and recorded within the cells of his brain for repetitive usage through what is termed \"memories.\" Memories have no more relation to knowledge of Universal Mind which is in man than Victrola records are related to the source of their recordings. What he thinks of as his living body is but an electri- cally motivated machine which simulates life through 3"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE SECRET OF LIGHT motion extended to it from its centering Self-Soul which alone lives and wills the body to move. What he calls his subjective mind is his conscious- ness , his spiritual storehouse of all-knowledge, all- power, and all-presence. That consciousness is his Self, his ETERNAL Self through which his omniscience, omnipresence and omnipotence are expressed as he slowly becomes aware of their presence within him . The electrically oscillating nerve-wires which operate his bodily mechanism act almost entirely through auto- matic reflexes and instinctive control, and to a very little extent through mental decisions. Each cell and organ of his body has an electrical awareness of its purpose and each fulfills that purpose without any mental action whatsoever upon the part of the Intelligence which occupies that body. The heartbeat, for example, is purely automatic . The white corpuscles of the blood rush to repair an injury to the body as automatically as a bell rings when a button is pushed. In this body and its electric recording brain, man thinks that he thinks and lives, loves and dies. He thinks himself conscious while awake and unconscious when sleeping; unaware that in all Nature there is no such condition as unconsciousness when sensation ceases in sleep. Man does not say that his tooth is unconscious when it is put to sleep by short-circuiting the electric current in the nerve-wire which gives sensed electrical awareness 4 THE ETERNAL QUESTION to his tooth. He knows that his tooth cannot be con- scious, but he does not know that his body cannot be conscious. Nor does he yet know that consciousness never sleeps , never changes , for consciousness in man is his immortal- ity. It is the Light which he is unknowingly seeking but assumes that the sensation of his brain is his thinking. Man is still new. He is barely out of the dark of his jungle. For the million or more years of his unfolding he has relied upon sensation for his actions and the evi- dence of his senses for his knowing. He has been aware of the spirit in him only a very few thousands of years. In this beginning of his new awareness he is confused, knowing not which is Mind in him , which is conscious- ness in him and which is sensation. He has not yet learned that bodies are but Self-created mechanisms which manifest their centering Self, and that Self manifests God as One with it. Likewise he has not yet learned that bodies neither live nor die , but repeat themselves continuously and forever as all idea of Mind likewise repeats itself. The wheel, for example, is a mechanism consisting of a hub, spokes and a rim . A little part of the wheel touch- es the ground , feels it , then leaves it, to disappear from reach of the sensations which connect rim, spokes and ground. But then it reappears. 5"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"· , I ~ I ' I ' , THE SECRET OF LIGHT When that happens to man we say, \"He was born, lived and died.\" When it happens to the apple, the flame\" or the tree, we say, \"The apple was eaten, the flame has gone out and the tree has decayed.\" We say that because only a small part of the cycle of any idea comes within the range of our senses. The larger part of the cycle is beyond our range of perception, just as the larger part of the wheel is beyond the sensed perception of the ground. We do not yet know that the invisible part of the cycles of all idea is as continuous as the wheel is contin- uous. The cycle of the apple is light reaching from the sun and earth to that positive half of the apple cycle which we hold in our hand. The negative half of the cycle is light returning to sun and earth for repetition as another manifestation of the eternal idea of the apple. The same is true of the flame, the tree or any other part of the One Whole Idea of Creation. The flame \"goes out\" to our sensing. But it still IS. Likewise the tree, the forest, mountain, planet and nebu- la of the far heavens appear, disappear and as surely reappear. Likewise man appears to disappear and reappear again and again in countless cycles to express eternal life of the spirit in eternal repetitions of that part of the man cycle which the body of man can sense. Man never dies. He is as continuous as eternity is con- 6 THE ETERNAL QUESTION tinuous. Jesus rightly said that man shall not see death, for there is no death to see or to know. Likewise the body of man does not live, and having never lived it cannot die. The spirit alone lives. The body but manifests the spirit. That which we think of as life in the spirit of man manifests itself by willing the body to act. Actions thus made by the body under the command of its centering Soul have no motivative power or intelligence in themselves; they are but machines motivated by an omniscient and omnipotent intelligence extended to them. These things we do not yet know, for man is in his infancy. He is but beginning to know the Light. BE YE FOREVER TRANSFORMED Man is forever seeking the Light to guide him on that long tortuous road which leads from his body's jungle to the mountain top of his awakening soul. Man is forever finding that Light , and is being forever transformed as he finds it. And as he finds it he gradually finds the Self of him which IS the Light. And as he becomes more and more transformed by the God-Light of the awakening Self within him, he leaves the jungle farther below him in the dark. There are those who seek the Light who are discour- 7"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":", I r I , · 1 , , , THE SECRET OF LIGHT aged because they seemingly cannot find it , wholly unaware that they have forever been finding it. Unknow- ing ones expect to find it all at once in some blinding flash of all-power, all-knowledge and all-presence. It does not come that way until one is nearing his mountain top. Man cannot bear much of the Light at a time while his body is still new and too near its jungle . All who are well out of the jungle have already found enough of the Light to illume their way out of its dark depths. He who is far out of the jungle and still seeks the Light in the High-heavens is forever finding it, and is forever being transformed as he finds it. One cannot for one moment remove his seeking eyes from his High-heaven, for ever so slight a glimpse below into the dark brings him back to the fears of the dark, which tempt him to plunge back into them. Look ye, therefore , forever upward into the High- heavens of inspiration, where glory awaits the fearless, all-knowing seekers of Beauty in the purity of the uni- versal Light. To him ' whose eyes are in the High-heavens , the Light will forever come , and he will be forever transformed as he finds it. The dark road from his jungle to his mountain top of glory becomes ever more illumined during the ascent from body to spirit. 8 THE ETERNAL QUESTION It is a hard, but glorious road to climb. All must make the climb. THE ASCENT OF MAN FROM THE DARK TO THE LIGHT is the forever repetitive play of man on the planets of suns. When all mankind has found the Light, the play will be finished. Likewise this planet will be finished as an abode for man. It will then be rolled off into its ever expanding orbit while Venus is gradually being rolled into place to become the stage for the next repetition of THE ASCENT OF MAN in this solar system. We actors of the play must, therefore, be content with the lines of the play revealed to each of us in Light. We must, likewise, be ever joyous at our continuous trans- formation, as each one of us learns our part, line by line, the better to fulfill it worthily. All parts of the play are experiences which become the action of the play. All man's experiences are part of his unfolding. Each experience is a part of his journey from the dark to the Light. All experiences are steps in that journey to his mountain top of glory. All experi- ences, therefore, are good experiences. There is naught but GOOD. There is no evil . There is naught but LIFE. There is no death. 9"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"nrrr , I I 1 I : I · I · ; · . t I I , ! , I , [ : r f , I· \"I am the One Whole, the ALL. \"Glorify thou Me, the One Whom I am, for I am ALL, and no other is . \"I, the sexless One, am Unity. \"What I am thou art, for thou art Me; thou art the Whole. \"Glorify thou thy Self, for in so doing thou art glorifying Me. \"I, the One Whole, am knowing Mind .

God's creating universe of matter in motion appears to exist. To our senses it sequentially disappears, to reap- pear. It has no reality. It but simulates reality through the illusion of two-way projected lights in motion. God, the Creator, is the One Being , the One Person , the One Mind, the One Thinker, the One Self, the One Life, the One Soul , the One Power, the One Reality. God's Creation is the imaged patterned form of God's imagining, built in His image. It is the body of God, the record of His thinking, created by Him for expressing the One-ness of Life , Love , Mind, Soul and Power which is in Him alone . THE ONE LIGHT God is Light. God is Universal Mind. Mind is Light. Mind knows. Mind thinks what it knows. Mind thinks in two opposed lights simultaneously projected from their centering white Light Source and sequentially repeated in cycles. 12 CREATOR AND CREATION God's thinking and imagining are qualities of God's knowing. God 's knowing Mind is timeless and still. So also are God 's thinking and imagining timeless and still. So, likewise, man's thinking and imagining are as time- less and still as is his knowing . Stillness never can be motion, or become motion, but it can appear to be. Motion merely seems, but stillness always is. The universal equilibrium can never be other than its own balance but it can seem to be. The illusion which is motion springs from stillness and returns to stillness. This is a universe of rest. There is naught but rest in the universe. Mind knows its One Idea of Creation as One Whole. Mind thinks its One Whole idea into seeming parts. Hence the illusion of motion which we call Creation , and the illusion of substance which we call matter. Matter, motion, time, change, dimension and sub- stance have no existence . The Light of knowing Mind alone exists. There is but One Mind and One Thinker. The One Light of knowing Mind is Self of God. It is the Universal Self which centers all omnipresent self - creating bodies of God-Selves. This self creating uni- verse is the Mind imagined body of God, and record of God 's thinking .

I THE SECRET OF LIGHT not KNOW the body of man but we can SEE it. What God is man is . God and man are ONE . OUR SEEMING DUALITY We seemingly live in two universes; the still cosmic Mind universe of KNOWING and the moving thought- of-Mind rhythmic wave universe of SENSING. We cannot sense the cosmic universe of God's know- ing nor can we know the thought -wave universe of God's thinking. The cosmic Mind universe of the One Light of all- knowing is all that is. The vibrating thought-wave universe of sensing mere- ly seems. THE COSMIC GOD LIGHT The one still Light of God is the cosmic Light which watches over all creating things at countless points locatable by man, but invisible to man. Man's senses have misled him into believing in a force called magnetism which attracts compass needles and lifts tons of steel. These phenomena of motion are due to electricity and not to magnetism. The cosmic Light is absolutely still . It neither attracts nor repels. We now need to comprehend the nature and purpose of the \"magnetic poles\" of suns, planets and all other moving extensions of the One Light. Likewise, we need . 14 CREATOR AND CREATION to know the nature and purpose of the two electric work - ers which interweave this light mirage of seeming motion and dissolve it sequentially for rebuilding. This will give a foundation of knowledge to man which will enable him to see behind the illusions which deceive his senses. The time has come in the history of man's journey from his material jungle to his spiritual mountain top when it is imperative that he must live more and more in the cosmic Light universe of knowing, and less in the electric wave universe of sensing. Man must know that his power lies in the stillness of his centering Self and not in the motion by means of which he manifests that stillness . He must know that his Self is God in him. Also he must know gradually the dawning awareness of the cosmic Light of God in him, for with it comes an awareness of his purposefulness in manifesting the Light and the power to manifest it. Man must now know the universe of God for what it is instead of what his senses have made him believe it to be. Also , he must know that this forever creating universe which seems so real to him is but a cosmic cinema, con- ceived by the Master Playwright. It is but an electrically projected, spectrum-colored light and sound-wave motion picture play of CAUSE AND EFFECT thrown on the black screen of imaged space and time. 15"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Tr u\" \" rr , I ! ~ t I I t I, THE SECRET OF LIGHT The CAUSE is real. The EFFECT is but a simulation of the reality. The Self of man is cause. His self-creating body is effect. God's universe of magnetic Light is static. God's perpetually creating electric wave universe of two moving lights is dynamic. It forever moves. The two moving lights are projected through each other from the static One to create the illusion of the idea they but manifest. The illusion which manifests the idea of Cre- ation through seeming motion is not the idea which it seemingly manifests. Creation is the product of Mind-knowing expressed in form by Mind-Thinking. The product of Mind is not the idea which it simu- lates. No idea of Mind is ever created. It is but simulated by form and motion. Idea is eternal and belongs to God's still universe of knowing. Form of idea in matter is transient but is eternally repeated as transient form of idea. THE POSITIVE PRINCIPLE The foundation of the spiritual universe is stillness; the balanced stillness of the One magnetic Light of God. Balanced stillness is the Positive Principle of stability and unity. In it there are no negations. 16 CREATOR AND CREATION THE NEGATIVE PRINCIPLE The foundation of the physical universe is motion; the ever-changing motion arising out of pairs of unbalanced conditions which must forever move to seek the bal- anced stillness of unity from which they sprang as mul- tiple pairs of units. Unbalanced motion is the Negative Principle of insta- bility, multiplicity and separateness which is this physi- cal universe of electric octave waves of opposed lights. In the Negative Principle there is no positive. It is composed entirely of pairs of negations which are for- ever void !ng each other, cancelling each other's action and reaction, thus negating each other by never allow- ing either one to exceed its fixed zero of universal still- ness. QUALITY BEGETS QUANTITIES The still magnetic Light universe of God's knowing is an invisible, unchanging, unconditioned and unmeasur- able quality from which visible, changing, conditioned and measurable quantities spring to simulate those qual- ities through two-way wave moti~:m. There is no one word in any language to express that quality so we must use many words, all having the same meaning but different connotations. 17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"f ' \" I t I I I I r t I ~ THE SECRET OF LIGHT These words are mind, consciousness, love, life, truth, desire, knowledge, power, balance and law. The God-quality of the One Light is seemingly trans- formed into quantities by being divided into pairs of oppositely-conditioned light pressures of this electric universe. These divided pairs are then multiplied into countless octave wave units of light pressures and set in opposite directioned motion to create the illusion of sequence, change, dimension, condition and time 'in a universe where none of these effects of motion exist. The calm sea, for example, is an unchanging, unmea- surable quality of oneness, of sameness and stillness. Upon its calm surface there is no change, nothing to count or to measure. The moment that quantities of waves spring from that quality of calm , those quantities can be measured. Like- wise, they are forever changing . Nor are there two points in them which are similarly conditioned. This creating electric universe is composed of moving light waves which sprang from a calm sea of the One still Light. It is a universe of moving pairs of quantities which simulate the quality of stillness from which those quan- tities spring . The quantities of divided and conditioned pairs of opposite lights which thus simulate the One are not the One they simulate. 18 CREATOR AND CREATION The Creator is One Mind indivisible. Creation is One Whole Idea of Mind divided into countless simulated ideas of mind , through motion. The simulation of Idea thus expressed is not the idea that it expresses. Parts of the One Whole Idea are only seeming . There are no two separate or separable things in the universe. There is but One Whole Simulation of the One Whole Idea. \"Everything that is is of everything else that is. All things are indissolubly united. \" -From THE DIVINE ILIAD Every happening anywhere happens everywhere. The milkweed fluff floating lazily in the summer sky affects the balance of the whole universe of suns and galaxies. Every part of the universe moves in interdependent uni- son as the wheels of a watch move in unison . The watch wheels are geared together mechanically. The rhythmic wave universe is geared together electrically. The entire universe is one and must be kept in balance as one.

Consciousness is static. Con- sciousness is the KNOWING of mind. Knowing is stat - ic. Consciousness is the spiritual awareness of Being, of all-knowing, all-power and all-presence. Thinking is electric. God's thinking is expressed by two-way moving wave extensions from consciousness, like a lever swinging upon a fixed fulcrum, or like waves extending from the calm sea. Thought expression is dynamic. Thinking belongs to the electrically sensed and conditioned vibrating universe of motion. Thinking is the motionless principle in light which creates the illusion of motion. The Self of man belongs to the static, invisible, con- scious, unconditioned universe of KNOWING. We express knowing in the dynamic, visible, electrically conditioned universe of sensation. Sensation is the electrical awareness of motion simu- lating the spiritual QUALITIES of the One Idea by cre- ating imaged QUANTITIES of separate forms which seem to have substance. 22 SENSATION AND CONSCIOUSNESS Consciousness is real. Sensation simulates reality through motion of interchanging lights, but the mirage of a city is not the city it reflects. Confusion and misunderstanding as to whether we are thinking consciously from knowledge or sensing electri- cally from memory records stored in our brains have led us to the necessity of distinguishing between the two by the common usage of such terms as \"the human mind\" and \"mortal mind.\" We know full well, while using them, that there is but the One Mind of the One Living God of Love. The universal Mind centers every particle and mass in this universe: animal, vegetable or mineral, electron, atom or sun. Man is the only unit in Creation who has conscious awareness of the Spirit within him and electrical aware- ness of dually conditioned light acting upon his senses. All other units of Creation have electrical awareness only. Man alone can be freed from body to think with God , to talk with God and be inspired by His centering Light. All other units of Creation are limited in their actions to automatic reflexes from sensed memories built up through ages of sensing and recording such sensing as instinct. Likewise the same confusion leads us to the adoption of such terms as \"subconscious mind,\" and \"superconscious mind.\" 23"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE SECRET OF LIGHT There is but One Mind functioning universally within all creating things, and that One Mind is not stratified nor divided into the more or less. There are no differing conditions of the One Mind, nor are there different kinds of minds. IMAGINATION God is the imaginer of His One Idea. All imagining is God's imagining. All creating forms in this thought universe of God's imagining are built in the image of His imagining, creat- ing \"in His image.\" All forms in this creating universe of imagined forms are but electric recordings of God's imaginings. They have no existence. Records of Idea are not the idea they record. They have no substance. They are but black and white lights of sun-centered wave fields of space assembled in vibrating systems to simulate substance in an objective universe which is not, but seems to be. God's imagining never began and will never end. It was not \"created\" at some remote past time by some vast cosmic event, as commonly believed. Nor is it con- demned to a \"heat-death\" by expansion into nothing- ness. 24 SENSATION AND CONSCIOUSNESS This is a creating universe, not a created one. God did not begin to imagine at some fixed time, for time does not exist. This light-wave universe which records God's knowing by His thinking and imagining is as eternal as God's thinking is eternal. INSPIRATION Inspiration is the language of Light which man uses to talk with God. Inspiration is that deep awareness of the conscious- ness of Being which differentiates the genius or mystic from the being of average intelligence. Inspiration in man is accompanied by an intense men- tal ecstasy which is characteristic of all who become intensely conscious of their closeness to God. Inspired geniuses forget their bodies while deeply conscious of their existence as wholly Mind. Their bod- ies, thus forgotten, act almost automatically in obedi- ence to instinct and cell memory reflexes . Inspired geniuses translate God's knowing into words of man for the soul of man. They uplift all mankind by reinspiring all who listen to their ecstatic words and rhythms. He who attunes his heart to the messages of genius purifies himself. No impurity can there be in his heart for verily he then is in communion with the Holy One . 25"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"( , ,'/ / \"Man alone of all My creating things hath begun to hear My whisperings.

The mystic is one who has attained cosmic conscious- ness by a complete severance of the seats of conscious- ness and sensation. He is then almost totally unaware of his body and is totally aware of the Light of God center- id g him. Omniscience comes to him in that timeless blinding flash of light which is characteristic of a com- plete severance. This experience was described in the illumination of St. Paul. Every timeless flash of intense inspiration which comes to any man is a partial illumi- nation, for inspiration is the manner in which new knowledge comes to man from the cosmos. Of all mystics, Jesus was the outstanding example of all time. He was the only One in all history to have known complete cosmic-conscious unity with God. The Bible refers to cosmic-conscious experience as \"the illumination\" or \"being in the Light\" or \"in the Spirit.\" In all history less than forty cases of partial cosmic consciousness are known, and probably not more than three of these anywhere nearly approached the complete 27"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE SECRET OF LIGHT state of illumination experienced by the Nazarene. Cosmic consciousness is the ultimate goal of all mankind. All will know it before the long journey of man is finished, but there are many in this new age just dawning who are ready for it in part, if not fully. Many desire it fully, but it is best that it come bit by bit for the complete severance is very dangerous. The ecstasy of this supreme experience is so great that one does not wish to come back. The power of severance of soul from body is within easy accomplishment, but to step back into the body is very difficult. The way to gradually attain cosmic consciousness is to intensify one's conscious awareness by much alone- ness and companionship with God while manifesting Him in every moment and in every task of life. Moment-by-moment companionship with God brings with it so great a realization of Oneness with Him that the transformation into that full realization of unity is apt to take place at any time. The deterrent to cosmic consciousness is the feeling that God is far away instead of being within, and that we can reach that far away God only through sources out- side of ourselves. 28 \"He who would interpret the rhythm of Me in art must walk his path in ecstasy, undiverted by deviations, that he may see Me only and hear naught but Me. \"Say thou to man these words: \"I am the source of inspiration.

The path to Me is Light, and by it thou canst well see thy way to Me. \"I am the soul of art.

To cre- ate we must first conceive . To conceive we must stop thinking and KNOW . All sensing must cease. There is no power in thinking. Thinking but expresses the power which lies in know- ing. We must project our Selves into the still Light of knowing to commune with God. We must become one with God to conceive idea in order to produce the form of that idea. A concept must precede its manifestation in form. The culture of the entire race is given to it by the few inspired ones who know God in them. They alone know immortality. The art of a civilization long outlives the civilization. The pyramids of Egypt still speak of the creation of a race which is long gone froni the face of the earth. The sculptural and architectural beauty of Greece still tell us of a type of creative genius which has never been excelled. The great in the arts are few. \"Art alone endures. All else passes.\" Great art can be created only by working moment by 31"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE SECRET OF LIGHT moment with God as co-creator. When man and God thus work together they commune one with the other as One Person. The language of their communion is the language of Light which man calls \"inspiration.\" When man works alone, his works are as the winds which blow. When man works with God as co-creator, his works are forever enduring. Every great genius manifests this law: that he is One with the God-Mind, that God in him is the source of every thought and that he is inspired by that omni- science and omnipotence within him which make his work enduring. 32 \"All knowledge existeth. All knowledge cometh to man in its season. Cosmic messen- gers periodically give to man such knowledge of My cosmos as man is able to comprehend, but that which he can bear is like unto a thim- bleful out of the mighty ocean, for man is but beginning to comprehend. \"When man knoweth Light then he will know no limitations, but man must know the Light for himself and none there can be who can make words of it, for Light knoweth Light and there need be no words. \" -From THE DIVINE ILIAD 33"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"..\".., - Chapter VI KNOWLEDGE Knowledge is cosmic. It belongs to the still Light of the positive principle . It never can become a property of the two negations which constitute this mirage universe - of matter in motion. To \"know all things\" means to have all knowledge of the Whole One Idea of the cosmos as CAUSE. It does not mean knowledge of created things which are effect - of cause . The whole Cosmic Idea is simple. It can be known by anyone of average intelligence . Its bewilder- ing complexities lie in effect of cause. Man cannot know transient effect. He can KNOW cause only . He can but comprehend effect. Man cannot know a sunset sky , for example, but he can comprehend it if he knows its cause . Knowledge is, therefore, limited to cause. All knowledge exists. All mankind can have it for the asking . It is within man, awaiting his awareness of its all-presence. Knowledge cannot be acquired by the brain from without; it must be \"recollected\" from within the con- sciousness of Self. Gradually dawning conscious aware- 34 KNOWLEDGE ness is but gradual recollection of the all-knowing which has always been within man . Man cannot acquire knowledge from books or schools. He can but acquire information that way , but information is not knowledge until it is recognized by the spiritual consciousness of man, just as food is not nourishment for the body until it becomes a part of the blood stream. Information gained by motion of the sens- es must be returned to the stillness of the Source before it becomes knowledge. For the same reason man cannot acquire knowledge from the so-called \"facts of matter,\" for there are no facts of -m atte r in a universe of transient matter in motion. All matter in motion is but a series of illusions which deceive man into drawing wrong conclusions . It is impossible for man to draw right conclusions from his observation of matter in motion until he has acquired the ability to translate dynamic effect back to cause . This he can do only through decentration to the One Light of his conscious awareness of the Source of all knowledge. Until he knows the WHY of effect and its deceptions , he has no knowledge whatsoever upon which he can rely. He has naught but unreliable infor- mation. Information concerning the body, for example, does not give knowledge concerning cause of body, or of the body's relationship to the universe.

His thinking is the expression of that power. The expression of power is .not power; therefore thinking is not power. As man gradually becomes aware of his omniscience, his thinking intensifies in voltage in proportion to the increase in awareness of his omniscience. Thinking is an electric wave extension from the cen- . tering fulcrum of knowledge which seemingly divides knowledge into ideas and sets those ideas in motion to create forms of ideas as product of knowledge. Man's knowledge is like a deep well of still water . His thinking is like a two-way pump which divides the QUALITY of that stillness into QUANTITIES of parts and sets them flowing. That is what the objective universe is, quantities of many seemingly separate forms of idea , all of which are but parts of the One Whole Idea. Each seemingly separate part is a dynamic extension of the One Static Unity, but separateness only seems, for all are indissolubly bound together in light as one part. Knowledge is the foundation of man's concepts. Thinking transfers concepts into product. The quality 38 KNOWLEDGE VERSUS THINKING of man 's product depends upon the degree of awareness of his knowledge and not upon the quality, quantity or intensity of his thinking. Water cannot be drawn from an empty well , nor can clear water be drawn from a muddied well. Likewise good product cannot come from intensive thinking unless knowledge backs that thinking . No idea of Mind can ever become matter, Idea of product can never become product. Moreover, no expression of anything in Nature is the idea which it expresses. The product of idea is not the idea it simulates. Idea is cosmic and cannot be produced in matter. Idea must be conceived in the Mind before it can be simulated as product. Conceptions belong solely to the magnetic God-Light and never become matter. A lever, for example , moving upon its fulcrum, expresses the idea of power by motion, but the idea of power is in the still fulcrum source of power. It is not in the moving lever. The lever would be both powerless and motionless if it did not have the stillness of the ful- crum from which to extend the simulation of power. A watch expresses the idea of time, but the watch is not time. Likewise it expresses the idea of mechanical principles, but the watch is not the idea which is expressed by those mechanical principles. The printed poem is not the idea expressed in the 39"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE SECRET OF LIGHT poem. That printed poem has no meaning to anyone whose intelligence is insufficient to reflect the idea from the composer's mind to his own. No idea of mind ever becomes matter. Likewise neither the musical composition on the printed page, nor the art of music which issues as sounds from musical instruments is the inspired idea of the musician. Inspiration can never be produced. It can ' but be reflected from one inspired mind to another rec- ognizing one. Idea and inspiration may be echoed from spirit to spirit but they can never become product of matter in motion. 40 \"Man's sense-seeing with his eyes binds him to the illusion of My dual thinking, for I but build illusion with My dual thinking for his sense-seeing. \"Sense-seeing binds man to forms and things, while Mind-knowing opens doors of glory to the opposed threads of Light with which I weave all idea of Mind into forms of many moving things. \"Mind-seeing decentrates unto the farthest reaches of My universe of Me, and sees all forms as One. \"With his seeing eyes man sees Light as matter energized, but senses not that the ener- ' gy of matter is the Light of My divided think- ing.

He has not yet learned to think powerfully from knowledge. He is just beginning to think as an extension of knowledge. We sense electrically and mistake that electrical sens- ing of observed effects for thinking. Sensing is not thinking. Sensation is but an electrical awareness of wave motion by other waves. We mistake the electrical records of the information which our brains have recorded as sensation, for think- ing and for knowledge. Information thus acquired by the senses is not knowl- edge, however. A man may have vast information and skill but have very little knowledge. The greatest scientists of today, for example , are well informed. They know how to do wonderful things but do they know the WHY of what they do? Information from observed effects, and skills in putting those effects together for useful purposes, have multiplied vastly since man first observed natural phe- nomena. His sense of observation told him how to make a boat; then a sail for the boat. He then discovered the 42 THINKING VERSUS SENSING wheel and ftre. Electric awareness of effects of motion, plus memory, plus the power to reason objectively , gave him the ability to do this. Very little of it has been due to either thinking or knowledge. We thus confuse sensing for thinking and knowing when, factually, we have been but functioning through sensed electrical awareness acquired from information. The \"information\" thus conveyed is electrical, not mental. The telegraph message which goes over any wire is not the thought conveyed by that message. Even the typed telegram is not the thought conveyed by it. Its symbols inform the thinker of the thought conveyed by it, but it is not the thought. Thus it is that our vast mechanistic, electrically moti- vated universe is inter-sensitized for the purpose of informing every nerve ganglion in every cell of every organic and inorganic part of it of the condition of every other part of it. OUR S UPPOSEDLY F IVE SENSES In speaking of an electrical awareness which we call sensation , we think of our senses as five in number. These are the senses of seeing , hearing , tasting, smelling and feeling. All of these five senses are but the one sense of feel- ing. We do not have five senses. Seeing is a sensation of feeling light waves through our eyes. Hearing is a sensa- 43"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"I' \\ THE SECRET OF LIGHT tion of feeling light waves through our ears. Tasting and smelling are sensations of feeling light waves reacting upon mouth and nostrils. All variation in sense of feeling is due to a difference of electric conditioning in pulsing wave matter. If puls- ing wave matter is but an electric wave record of thought, sensation likewise is but an electric wave record of thought. Neither of them have reality. Neither of them are the thought they record. It also follows that if matter, motion and substance are electric records of thought, then sensation has no reali- ty-for sensation is but an electrical awareness of wave motion by other waves. It likewise follows that if matter, motion and sub- ' stance are electric wave recordings of thought , then electricity which records thought, and thought itself, are nonexistent. There is but one thing in this universe-LIGHT-the still Light of all Knowing. The One Light which is God. God alone lives. His thinking and imagining is Know- ing; the Knowing universe is all that is; Knowing Mind is still. There is no activity whatsoever in the universe of either spirit or matter. EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE Man's present civilization is erected upon the founda- tion of empirical knowledge obtained through his sens - 44 THINKING VERSUS SENSING es. What is empirical knowledge? The definition in the dictionary is: \"conclusions founded upon experiment and observation alone.\" In other words, the so-called \"knowledge\" upon which man relies is founded upon the evidence of his senses, or more simply, upon the nonexistent waves of motion of a nonexistent substance. That fact is the answer as to why mankind has, as yet, practically no knowledge. During his amoeba and jungle days , he lived a purely sensed .existence . His body cells were controlled entirely by instinctive flux threads of light extended to him directly from the Creator. MAN IS STILL NEW Out of millions of such years, he has had but a few thousand years since the dawn of consciousness awak- ened in him the slightest suspicion of his spiritual inher- itance. The advance of man since the first messengers of God appeared on earth to kindle an awakening spark in him , has been based upon information gained by his senses and stored in his electric brain as memory records of sensed observations. These observations he has r ~a· soned into sensed conclusions by an electrically sensi- tized brain . All of such conclusions which are based upon the evi- dence of senses have within them the elements of decep- 45"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"\"\"' ''1 ·Ii THE SECRET OF LIGHT tion which characterize all effects of motion in this three dimensional universe of illusion. Man is aware of some of these illusions, such as those of perspective. He is aware of the fact that railroad tracks do not meet upon the horizon, but he is not aware of the fact that all effects of motion are not what they seem to be. He is thus misled into forming conclusions which have no relation to Nature whatsoever. One can have no knowledge of effect, for all knowledge lies in cause. Our new fundamental laws and principles must be based upon knowledge of cause. LA WS BASED U PON ILLUSION Newton, for example, confessedly did not know what gravitation was, yet wrote laws concerning it based upon his observation as to what gravitation did to an apple . Also, he concluded that the moon would fall upon the earth if it were not for its motion. He even proved this mathematically, not being aware of the fact that those same mathematical formulae would apply to every satellite, planet and star in the heavens , as well as to every electron in every atom, none of which are falling into their primaries. 1 Observers in natural phenomena are still calculating the age of the universe and weight of the earth. The uni- verse is ageless. It had no beginning. Likewise the earth 46 THINKING VERSUS SENSING has no weight in respect to anything else in the universe. Every orb in the heavens is in perfect balance with every other orb . M ESSENGERS OF THE LIGHT What little knowledge man has acquired during these last few thousand years has been given to him by the very few geniuses , prophets, mystics and other messen- gers of the Light who have come to reinspire mankind with their inspired knowledge. From these rare few, the beginnings of our culture have sprung. Without them there would be no under- standing of beauty in the world. Without beauty man would still be barbarian. Through beauty alone will he gradually become consciously aware of his oneness with the Light. When man knows the Light he will know all things . Today that Light is so dim in all mankind that no one has as yet fathomed the secret of Light, or of gravitation, radiation, electricity, growth, life, reincarnation or the ' wave. The day has now dawned when he will know these things.

Mind knows but one Idea as a whole. Thought is Idea taken apart and patterned as separate idea. Thought is patterned idea electrically expressed and electrically recorded in matter by its two pulsing, interchanging lights. This universe of matter in motion is but the electric record of thought. The process of recording is to take the One undivided Universal Idea apart and express it as many seemingly divided parts. This gives form and niul- tiplicity into many seeming parts and things of a uni- verseof but one thing. Electricity is the servant of the God-Mind. Electricity expresses the desire in the God-Mind for creative expression by seemingly dividing the One still light into transient waves of spectrum divided positive-negative colors of light. This entire universe of seeming substantiality consists solely of transient light waves in seeming motion. 50 SENSING BINDS ALL THINGS Motion itself is illusion. SEEMING SEPARATENESS All patterned thought creations of God or man are the interweavings of the spectrum colors of the two electric opposites of light-waves into the patterned designs of those thoughts. Creation might be likened to the tapestry weaver who KNOWS the one idea as a whole, then THINKS it into parts, then RECORDS those parts by interweaving their spectrum colors into the many forms which, together, manifest the whole idea. To exemplify our meaning, consider anyone part of the whole idea 'of Creation-iron, for example. Iron is a separate part of the whole. We think of iron as a hard, cold metal with certain properties which make it possible for us to manufactu~e it into many products. When iron is in its frozen condi- tion we do not think of it as light, but we can photo- , graph by it if we heat .it to incandescence. Not only is it then light but all of the properties which make it available to us as iron have then gone out of it. It is as though the divine tapestry weaver had unwoven all the threads of the idea of iron and sorted them into their spectrum colors, thread by thread.

Upon looking at them, he would say, \"That is iron.\" But it would not be the form of iron as we know it-it would be the formless idea of iron as the sun knows it. THERE IS NO SEPARATENESS In the incandescent sun is all idea that earth knows. The idea of the apple of earth is in the sun, likewise the wood of the tree and the violet in the meadow. Likewise the cool earth is there, with its rivers and mountains. All idea is one idea in the light of the sun. The light of the sun is never divided into its many seeming separate ideas until it is electrically extended from the sun and those extensions electrically echoed back to it. The sun is a crucible which melts all ideas into one, then sets them out into space to cool and separate into many units of that one. Likewise Idea of Mind never becomes the many ideas of Creation until electricity divides that One idea into many separate parts. The One Light cannot be divided, but extensions of the One Light can appear to divide it. The spots of sun- light upon the cathedral floor are many , but they are all extensions of the one light of their source in the sun . Likewise all mankind is an extension of the One Idea of man for man is but One in the Light of his Source. 52 SENSING BINDS ALL THINGS Likewise all moving extensions of the One still Light , as manifested in the white light of suns arid the black light of their surrounding space , are but extensions of one Source. ALL IDEA IS STILL The cinema exemplifies this meaning. Upon the screen are many patterned ideas in noisy, violent motion. We know, however, that all of the motion of separate ideas, and all of the sounds emanating from those patterned, moving forms, would instantly cease if the still source of light from which these images and sounds are projected were turned off. We know that the cause of all this transient division into positive and negative effect is in the one still light from which it is projected. We know that the sounds we hear emanate from that stillness , yet we seem to be totally unaware of the fact that all of our pulsing uni- verse is but an extension of One still Light of Universal Mind, projected through positive and negative light upon the universal screen of space. It is difficult to conceive earth and all of its phenome- na of motion, sound , people, animals, and plant life , as a motion picture projection from our sun.

It is also man's storage ware- house of electric records of memories and thoughts since his beginning. It is the servant of Universal Intelligence. It operates all mechanisms of the body. It acts as the central switch- board for all its instinctive voluntary and involuntary actions. The brain is the seat of sensation. Its purpose in this respect is to keep the body electrically informed of the condition of the body, through electrical messages. Such messages are not mental. They are purely electri- cal. They produce sensation. The brain senses and records every message. It sends counteracting messages to other parts of the body. 57"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"/ THE SECRET OF LIGHT The body is a vast and complex mechanism. The brain is an electrical recorder, distributor, broadcaster and receiver for all operational parts of that multi-celled machine, but its actions have no relation to intelligence. The brain records sensations of experiences and obser- vations which the senses convey to it. Such sensations are mistaken for thinking and knowing . Sensation aris- ing from electrical motion is purely automatic. The mistake in assuming that the brain thinks and knows is due to the fact that man believes himself to be thinking when he is only sensing. Man also believes that he is acquiring knowledge through sensed observation of sensed EFFECT, when he is but recording electrical sensations which inform him as to the nature of things observed by his senses. The body is a patterned machine designed to do many things. Electric motivation through nerve wires deter- mines each movement. When such sensations act in unison with his conscious awareness of the Light which centers him as PERSON, he is then thinking as well as sensing. The centering consciousness of man, the PERSON, transforms information received by the senses into knowledge to the extent of which he is capable of recog- nizing CAUSE in spirit, back of the EFFECT which his senses record . Until that transformation takes place, man is without 58 FUNCTION OF THE BRAIN knowledge no matter to what extent his senses may have informed him, for information is not knowledge. A man may be a veritable encyclopedia of informa- tion. He may have earned many college degrees for being well informed and yet be without sufficient knowledge to create anything. For instance, we cannot sense the idea of a harp while it is still, but we can know the idea of the harp. We can know its various possibilities of expression, even though its strings are not vibrating. Likewise we can imagine countless complexities of rhythms which lie unex- pressed within those still strings. Conversely, we cannot know the vibrations which come from those strings when we set them in motion. We can but sense those vibrations through our own sensed electrical awareness. 59"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"\"The Source of all things is within all things, centering them as Rest, from which their motion springeth.

The whole universe of countless parts is wired togeth- er by an electric fl~x of \"nerves\" which inform each part of the universe of the ever changing condition of every other part. There is no \"sensation\" between balanced parts or balanced conditions of matter . By \"sensation\" we mean the feel of the electric current which conveys the mes- sage . The electric current is impossible in an equilibri- um condition, hence we can feel no sensation whatso- ever when our bodies, or parts of them, are in a bal- anced condition. Electrical awareness is necessary to an electrically mechanized universe. An electrically controlled machine in one's factory has exactly the same electric awareness that a man has. Its wired nervous system con- veys electric messages to its parts for the dual purpose of motivating them as well as for adjusting all parts to each other in continuity. Electric machines do what electric awareness 61"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"I , I I / THE SECRET OF LIGHT demands of them through sensation. So does man, tree, the solar system and every nebula of the heavens. Man's body cells are electrically aware of their mech- anistic purposes and respond to electric messages sent to them. They have electrical cell memory of their individ- ual and group purposes. They act automatically when sensed reflexes are electrically motivated. Bodily functions , such as our heartbeat, digestion, chemical gland transformation, breathing and walking, are automatically operated by cell memory reflexes . Cell memory and instinct cause birds to migrate, spi- ders to spin webs and certain vegetable growths to close in on flies and fish . Instinctive actions and cell memory reflex actions are not mental. They are purely mechanical and automatic. ELECTRIC AWARENESS IS UNIVERSAL This principle of electric awareness, through sensa- tion , is not limited to animal life alone. It is equally characteristic of the mineral and vegetable kingdoms . It extends to the veriest electronic particle and to the mightiest galaxy. Not only is each particle in each mass electrically aware of its purpose , but each particle in the entire uni- verse reacts in response to electrical messages sent to it from every other particle in the universe. This physical 62 ELECTRICAL AWARENESS universe is controlled solely by electrical sensation which is measured and balanced by the still magnetic Light, centering all things. \"For behold, saith the Universal One, I am within all things centering them; and I am without all things controlling them. \" -From THE DIVINE ILIAD All of the electric universe of motion is thus so per- fectly conditioned by the two electric workers which build the universe and tear it apart sequentially for rebuilding , that all moving things in it sense all other moving things in it. Likewise, all differently conditioned things in the uni- verse readjust their conditioning to every change of con- dition of every other thing in the universe. There is a constant separating process in Nature which forever expresses the universal desire for change and multiplicity, and there is likewise a constant levelling process which forever expresses the universal desire for oneness . 63"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"\" \"I, with man, am creating man in My uni- versal image. \"What I am, man is. \"I think idea; and the form of My idea appears in the pattern of My thinking. \"I think man; and man appears in the pat- tern of My thinking. \"Man thinks man; and man appears in the image of man's thinking. \"Man:SO thinking is My thinking. \"All thinking things are thinking My think- ing. \"All creating things are formed in the ' image of My thought imaginings to manifest My thought imaginings. \"The universe is My image, creature of My imaginings. \" -From THE DIVINE ILIAD 64 Chapter XII INSTINCT Organic matter generates purely from the desire of mind to manifest idea in matter. That cosmic desire to create form produces the desired form. Desire is the motivating force of all Creation. Man begins to express the idea of man as a single cell. The whole idea of man is in that single cell . It then unfolds in orderly time and space according to cosmic law. Likewise the whole idea of all Creation is in that single cell. All idea is omnipresent. There are no parts of the Whole. Each step in the unfolding of the man-idea follows the continuing desire for unfolding. Cell memory of purpose is given to each cell as it unfolds. Pattern of idea follows in sequence as desire in God Mind and desire in the growing idea work together to express the idea in form. Every action of unfolding man is a part of the unfold- ing of the man -idea as it exists as a whole in God's Mind. Any desire of man is, therefore, a two-way exten- sion of the Light of that idea from God to man . Whatev- er God desires to express in man He will express, for He is man's Creator. 65"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"r\"\" THE SECRET OF LIGHT Whatever man desires, the God in him will create . Man must, however, co-create with God according to God's universal law. If man breaks that law , the law will break him to an equal extent. LIFE IS A SEQUENCE OF EXPERIENCES All of the expressions of desire in the unfolding of any idea are a part of the idea. They are experiences in deci- sions. All experiences are parts of the unfolding of any idea. Whatever those decisions are, however, they are recorded upon the individual man as his own interpreta- tion of the man-idea. Likewise they are recorded in the whole of the race of man as the sum total of all desires and experiences of the whole man-idea . As the idea of anything is one, so also the parts of that idea are one. INSTINCTIVE INTERCOMMUNICATION If it were not for instinct , animal life could not survive or develop. Instinct causes mechanical actions to take place in all bodies to meet the necessities of existence. Instinct pro- tects animal life from enemies. It tells the proper food to eat, how to build nests, how to take care of its young, 66 INSTI NCT how to return home when taken great distances, as the carrier pigeon does , and countless other wonderful things that animals do. A salmon, spawned in a certain river, instinctively leaves that river and makes its way to the sea until matu- rity . At the proper time for its mating and spawning , it then returns , over thousands of trackless miles , to the very river in which it was born. It is instinct which tells birds to fly south before win- ter. Instinct tells them the direction of south. Instinct tells them it is warmer in that direction. Instinct likewise governs the migration of seals, the building of the beaver's dam and the weaving of the spider's web. Instinct might be defined as a cell-memory record of all actions of a body, and of all of the sensations caused by those actions. THE BEGINNINGS OF INSTINCT Without instinct in all animal and vegetable life , their evolution would not be possible. All creations of the Creator are the result of electric wave recordings of the Creator 's thought. They are parts of the whole Idea taken apart and put together bit by bit. They are the result of Universal Law , of Cause and Effect. None of the creations of the Creator have in them at their beginning the power to think. It takes millions of 67"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE SECRET OF LIGHT years for complex organisms to recognize the spirit within them sufficiently to think at all. During these long ages , they are guided almost entirely by their instinctive reflexes . Man alone has begun to think , rea- son, imagine , create and invent , and then only during the last few thousand years. INSTINCT IS GOD -CONTROL Instinct is, therefore, God-control over the actions of His creations. The .involuntary actions of the body, such as the heartbeat, or the action of white corpuscles, do . I· not know their purpose in the healing process of the body, but God centers and controls every atom of His Creation and each must fulfill its purpose. INSTINCT BUILDING BY GOD AND MAN A good example of the manner in which God and man work together for creative expression is the familiar knitting woman. Knitting is part of the man-idea which requires a skill . The woman who desires to knit must desire to acquire that skill. Desire must precede all expression of that desire. Slowly she takes one stitch at a time . All of her power of concentration is needed to take those first stitches. Each stitch taken, however, has within it the desire for 68 INSTINCT taking the next stitch. Very slowly she interlaces yarns into the pattern required. The cells of her fmgers gradually acquire cell memories of their purpose. These cells coordinate with . other cells of the body in the development of the whole skill. Gradually she learns to knit instinctively. Her mind is freed from concentration and she may think of other things and converse freely. Her body cells alone will work from the memory of purpose given to them. Instinctive skills are thus imparted to bodies of man by the co-creative efforts of God and man. The pianist teaches his fingers to work instinctively in order to free his mind to think music. God is working with him . Without this moment-to-moment cooperation with God, he could do nothing . God, Creator of all things, knows all things and has all power. Man and God are One. Man may know all things and have all power to the extent in which he desires to know all things and have all power. Awareness of the Light in man will give him all knowledge and power. Man may not be apart from God at any time. Nor can any part of Creation be apart from God at any time. 69"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"\"A ll things come and go from My divided thinking. \"All things go from very heart of Me into My imaged universe; and when they disappear from there I also take them back to very heart of Me. \"Know thou that all creating things are res- urrected things, again manifesting life of Me through My divided thinking. \"Man divides his thinking in manifesting Me. \"The body of man sleeps, that it may awak- en in Me, to manifest Me. \"The body of man dies, that it may be res- urrected in Me, to manifest Me . \"The body of man disappears, that it may reappear to manifest Me. \"Man who sleeps or dies or disappears is but man 's image , for Self of man sleeps not, nor dies, nor disappears ; for Self of man is Me. \"A gain I say that I am One, and man is One in Me when he knows that I am he. \" -From THE DMNE ILIAD 70 Chapter XIII UNCONSCIOUSNESS, SLEEP AND PAIN There is much confusion regarding the supposedly possible condition known as \"being unconscious. \" When we sleep, or are anesthetized, we say we are \"unconscious .\" We cannot be unconscious. We have always been con- scious without the slightest awareness of it. Our confus ion in this respect lies in mistaking sensa- tion and thinking for consciousness. When we stop thinking , whether asleep or awake, we do not stop KNOWING, nor do we cease being con- sciously aware of our Being. We but cease to set our knowledge in motion to express idea through the pulsa- tions of thinking. Conscious Mind does not sleep. Sleep is merely the negative half of the wave cycle of electrical awareness of sensation. Wakefulness is the positive half. All nature sleeps when the sunlight lessens the ability of all things to manifest life . Sleep is the death half of the life-death cycle. One may say , \"I am unaware of this or that ,\" but one cannot say \"I am unconscious\" when one is always con- scious. 71"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THE SECRET OF LIGHT Conscious awareness is KNOWING. Unawareness means that one does not yet know. Knowledge is within him which he can know when he desires to know. Sleep and wakefulness are positive-negative wave parts of a wave cycle, just as birth and death are oppo- site ends of a life cycle. Sleep is but an anesthetic. Sleep can be induced chem- ically, either to the whole body or any part of it by desensitizing its cells. When the body or parts of it are thus \"put to sleep,\" they have not been rendered \"uncon- scious\"; their voltage has merely been lowered. The dentist does not refer to a local anesthetic as hav- ing produced unconsciousness; he refers to it as a desen- sitizing condition, but when the surgeon desensitizes the body, it is then supposed to be \"unconscious.\" We assume that the brain has stopped thinking. The brain does not think, therefore it cannot stop doing that which it never does. We assume that bodies cease to be con- scious, but consciousness is never in bodies. A local anesthetic stops pain. Pain is a too intense electric current. The voltage is too great for the nerve wires to stand the strain. They bum out, and the over- charge of burning out causes the pain. When the nerves of the body FEEL an electric current running through them, the body is aware that something is happening to throw it out of balance. When the body is in balance, it has no sensation. When the body is 72 UNCONSCIOUSNESS, SLEEP AND PAIN unbalanced, sensation informs it when and where, other- wise it could not function. Wakefulness and sleep are merely the charging and discharging of the uncountable electric batteries of the body. If these batteries were kept constantly charged, there would be no such alternating conditions as sleep and wakefulness . This planet is carrying us on our uphill journey to our pinnacle. The sun is the generator which charges its bat- teries. The sun is that generator, but the earth is turning toward and away from its generator continually. As the sun's charging light disappears from one edge of the planet's rim at evening, everything goes to sleep. Conversely, all things awaken at the dawn. The batteries of all things on earth are being forever charged daily and discharged nightly. 73"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"·1 I . \"I center the moving shaft of My universe, yet I move not , although its power to move springeth from Me . \"I center growing systems, and changing cells of growing systems, yet I change not, e'en though their changing patterns spring from me. \"I center living things which manifest My life, but they live not.

Motion can cease but it can never become rest. THIS MAKE-BELIEVE UNIVERSE . The entire dynamic wave universe of electric matter is not what it seems to be. Everything which seems at rest depends upon violent motion to make believe it is at rest. A wire wheel could appear to be a steel disk if spun fast enough. The faster it is spun, the more at rest it would seem. This planet, seemingly at rest, is in violent motion around its centering point of rest from which it is electri- cally extended .

The pencil in one's hand, the desk upon which one is writing, the room full of motionless things, seeming to be at rest, are but simulating rest through violent motion of their many parts. Tremendous vibrations may be in that glass paperweight. Not one thing could manifest the rest it simulates if it were not for the incredible speeds of those atoms which . so incessantly rotate and revolve to make that seeming restfulness possible. EVEN STILL THINGS ARE NOT STILL All seemingly still matter is manifesting make-believe rest by make-believe motion. Motion itself is an illusion. The motion one senses in one's brain has no more reality than the motion which one senses in a motion picture. The seeming motion of the cinema is ca~sed by sequences of changing patterned forms projected on the screen which give the impression of motion because of the rapid change of pattern in the negatives. That self- same illusion applies to the material universe. 76 \"Without change My play of Creation could not be played, nor its actors be.

There is no change whatsoever in the conscious uni- verse of knowing . There is only an illusion of change set up by the two interchanging lights of thinking to divide the One Whole Idea into many separate ideas and record them in moving matter. ' The senses are the audience for these thought pulsa- tions. The senses are a part of this illusion. Senses are electric. They belong to the thought universe of motion and do not respond to stillness. As motion itself is non- existent, so also are senses non-existent. The senses are but the imagined records of imagined motion , matter and change . As such they are limited to pin-hole peeks into the vastness which extends beyond their sensing . The senses have no knowledge of what they sense. They merely record motion . The senses respond to motion in only one direction. They sense the forward flow of time but not its back- ward flow. If they could register both directions, they would become aware of the stillness of this zero uni- verse of seeming motion. 78 THE ILLUSION OF CHANGE The Universal One planned it this way , otherwise there could be no sequential manifestation of thought which constitutes the creating universe. When our knowing exceeds our sensing, we will no longer be deceived by the illusions of our senses. A man seeing a technicolor motion picture for the first time and without knowledge of such electric effects would think he were looking through a window at real happenings , unaware that it was but an illusion \"created\" by projecting positive light through patterned negatives . That is all that creation is; two lights project- ed through each other to simulate motion, form and change. Our senses are like passengers on a fast-moving train . They sense parts of the landscape as they rush forward , while , to their senses, the landscape rushes backwards. The senses interpret these effects as matter in fast motion which is forever fast changing. A man , seeing the same train from a mountain, would sense that same fast motion and fast change as changeless and still. As man unfolds from sensed man to spiritual man he gradually becomes aware of the two-way motion of all effect ; that two ways being the visible effect which responds to his senses and the invisible effect which he knows but does not sense. Gradually the time arrives in his unfolding when his full awareness of Cause voids all reliance upon sensation. 79"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":", ., THE SECRET OF LIGHT He then rises above his sensing.

Every time the fly got back to the same point, it would compute the past time consumed on the journey and the forward time necessary for the next circuit. The wheel being still, motion, change and time are created by the fly itself as it takes the whole idea of the wheel apart by journeying around it and examining it bit by bit. The fly sensed motion by changing its position on the wheel. It sensed change by finding a seeming difference of condition at each forward movement. It sensed time by creating the sequences necessary in taking the one idea of the wheel apart and dividing it into many sepa- rate ideas. This simple analogy is a good symbol of Creation. This planet, like the fly on the wheel, moves forever around its motionless orbit. The orbit is as rigid and still as the wheel upon which the fly is moving. 83"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THE SECRET OF LIGHT As the planet moves upon the wheel of its orbit, it senses constant motion and change. It senses changes of days into nights, of spring merging into summer, autumn into winter. All of these seeming changes are in the motion of the planet and not in the wheel of its orbit. Each change is entirely due to the motion of the planet and not to the changeless orbit. The planet itself regis- ters change on its changeless wheel. Change therefore lies in motion alone. The senses are motion , therefore the senses sense only that which they themselves are. INADEQUACY OF THE SENSES Man overrates his senses. He places too much depen- dence upon them without justification, for they are not recording all of the phenomena of his surroundings. He likewise trusts them too much without justification, for they are constantly deceiving him . While his senses are recording the stillness and rest of Nature on a lazy afternoon, they are failing to record the violent motion of everything in his entire environment, from the blade of grass to the clouds in the heavens above him. Those seemingly motionless clouds are moving at the speed of a thousand miles an hour at the equator without the slightest evidence of that swift motion being record- ed upon his senses. The earth also is moving many miles 84 THE SENSES DEC EIVE ' per second in two directions; one of rotation upon its axis and the other of revolution around its orbit. His senses register stillness. They are electrically unaware of that motion. This deception is as it should be, just as the same deception in a cinema is as it should be. God's universe is but an electric recording of His knowing, manifested by His thinking. To thus record the idea of His knowing in the two lights of His thinking , a three dimensional universe is necessary. If the senses could detect and record all motion, instead of but a part of it, the illusion would disappear. The senses would see behind the illu- sion and find that all motion voids itself. Division of the whole into parts causes the illusion. If the film were removed from the projector of the motion picture, the illusion of motion and change would be voided. That is what Creation is, the One Light of knowing divided into the patterned parts of thinking. Sensing is but an electric tension set up by the seeming division of one into many which \"strain\" to fulfill their desire for - oneness. When a unity of condition is consummated, sensation between those parts ceases because the tension ceases. The senses , being but tension of desire for unity between divided parts, have no existence.

When strain of desire for balance, rest or unity ceases, sensation ceases. In this electric universe, sensation is the strain of resistance to the separation which exists between all separated masses. All matter is one. Separated particles desire to find that oneness. It is part of God's plan that the senses are limited entirely to the recording of a very small fraction of effect. The senses can never sense the Whole but the conscious Mind can KNOW the Whole. 86 \"These words I now say for newly compre- hending man of his new cycle. \"Love ye one another all men; for ye are one in Me. \"Whatsoe'er ye do to one in Me ye do to all; for all are one in Me. \"Love thy ·brother as thy self Serve thy brother before thy self.

During the last century of the greatest scientific progress in the history of man, great nations of the world have killed, robbed, and enslaved other men to build their own empires. Even today man kills by the millions, condoning his killing as necessary for his self-preservation. He is now but reaping the seed of his sowing. He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword.

Each past cycle in the growth of man toward higher levels has been illumined by the few inspired messen- gers of the Light who have known God in themselves. New inspired messengers who know God in them- selves will likewise give the Light to this new cycle. And these few messengers of the Light must multiply into legions, for the need of a spiritual awakening is great. Man's whole reason for being is to gradually pass through his millions of years of physical sensing into his . ultimate goal of spiritual knowing. Man has now reached a transition point in his unfolding where he must have that knowing.

His senses have deceived him mightily. The other is the illusion of man himself. With the exception of the Nazarene, man has never as yet known man. Nor has he known his relation to the universe, nor to his still more unfathomable God. The little that man knows of himself and his universe is what the eyes and ears of his body have told him they have seen and heard about himself and his universe. . But man has eyes and ears of the spirit which see and hear what man 's sensed eyes and ears can never see or hear, for man is still too new in his unfolding .

He can accept the illusion of the railroad tracks meet- ing upon the horizon, but the railroad tracks are real, even though their seeming meeting is not. They, at least, still remain as a basis for their own illusion. A mirage of a city is comprehensible to man also as an illusion. He knows it does not exist but he also knows of the reality of the city which thus repeats itself, ghostlike, in the mirrors and lenses of light waves of the heavens above the city. To tell him that the city, as well as its own mirage, has no existence is to lay too heavy a tax upon his credulity and patience. Yet that is what the secret of Light reveals, and that is what we must tell, simply and convincingly, to layman, churchman and scientist alike, and in the language stan- dards and methods which each requires for his convic- tion. So come, therefore, and know God, His universe, and man with eyes other than our sensed ones. The eyes of the spirit are knowing eyes. God's universe of knowing is all that is.

The One Light of the Father in His Kingdom of Heav- en divided the void. And behold, two father-mother lights of nightless suns shone out of the darkness of the void and day appeared in undivided oneness of everlast- ing day. . And the Father centered His suns as seed of His desire that forms should appear from formless Light to fulfill His desire for division of the One into many divided ones formed in the image of His imagining.

By disobeying the law he is but hurting himself while on his journey, but he must make the jour- ney and must balance every unbalanced action while on the way. It is as though a man on a great ocean liner disobeyed the laws of the ship. In spite of his disobedience the ship is taking him to his destination and he must go with it. Likewise, he has hurt himself by lessening the , happiness of his journey. The whole principle of Creation lies in equal giving. The Oneness of the Light is divided into an equal and opposite two, and all interchange between the two must be equal in their giving. God's division of the Light into a seeming two is man- ifested in Nature by electric waves of two opposing lights springing from the still sea of God's magnetic Light, just as waves of water spring from the still ocean. The outstanding characteristic of waves is that they forever interchange. Troughs become crests and crests become troughs. Gravity pressure above and below their axis is equal. So long as equality of interchange contin- ues rhythmically, waves repeat their interchange. When the sloping sand at the beach prevents this equality of 108 THE LAW OF BALANCE rhythmic balanced interchange, the waves accumulate unbalance until they crash on the shore. Every transaction in human relations either continues or discontinues in accord with obedience or disobedi- ence to this one law. A man who sells and gives less value for what is given to him lays the foundation for his own wreckage. He finds it ever harder to sell and loses many purchasers by gaining their ill will. He who gives equally for what is given to him multiplies his pur- chasers and prospers by gaining their good will. The pulse beat, the swinging pendulum, the inbreath- ing and outbreathing of living things all exemplify God's one law of rhythmic balanced interchange. Any deviation from that law in the heart-beat of a man would endanger his continuance, but when there is a rhythmic balanced interchange between the two compression and expansion opposites, man 's life continues to function at maximum. Man has free right to choose his own actions, but he must balance those actions with equal and opposite reac- tions until he learns that God's one law must be obeyed. This God holds inviolate. The whole purpose of life is to learn how to manifest God in Truth and the Law. The lesson is a hard one but man, himself, makes it hard by his unknowing of the law.

Each sexed condition gives unbalance to the other to separate each from each to increase the power of each to oppose each. Each then gives of itself to the other to void the unbalanced condition of each other. In order to effect balance in each , each must become the other . The charging one must discharge and the dis- charged one must charge . Voidance of unbalance can \" only come that way. Likewise repetition can come only that way. 118 THIS SEXED ELECTRIC UNIVERSE The electric universe is the negative principle. It is EFFECT. The two moving lights of the electric universe are two equal halves which express themselves in oppo- site directions. Their sole purpose is to oppose. Opposites which violently oppose and void each other can never become one, nor can they attract each other. SEX DEFINED Sex is the division of a balanced equilibrium condition into two equally unbalanced conditions which negate each other periodically for the purpose of repeating the two unbalanced conditions. Sex is the creative principle. It is the dual desire force in Mind for expressing its One Idea . Without a division of the one unconditioned Light into two seemingly con- ditioned lights, Creation could not be. Sex is not a thing, it is a condition of a thing . An electrically balanced condition of anything is sex- less whether it be a man, woman, electric battery, or the atmosphere. A sexed condition is an unbalanced condition. An electric battery which is fully charged is dually unbal - anced by the opposite electric pressures of compression and expansion. These two opposite unbalanced condi- tions violently desire to return to the oneness of balance from which they were divided into two. A short circuit 119"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE SECRET OF LIGHT between the two poles of the battery will give it that bal- ance. We then say it is dead , for it will no longer per- form work by expressing its desire for balance. An unbalanced atmosphere will violently seek a bal- anced condition , depending upon the intensity of the unbalanced condition. When calm follows the storm , it means that desire for balance has gone out of it, for when balance has been attained by rest, motion is no longer possible. The sexed condition of unbalance in man is exactly the same in all phenomena in Nature. An unbalanced sex condition in man demands balancing in the same way, and its violence depends upon its electrical mea- sure of unbalance. When that desire is satisfied and bal- ance is restored, man is as sexless as the dead storage battery and for the same reason. Man is recharged into a sexed condition by his heart- beat, by the food he eats and by his inbreathing-out- breathing. These are the generators which recharge the \"dead storage batteries\" of all the universe into sexed conditioned \"live batteries.\" A sexed condition and an electric condition are identi- cal. Electricity conditions all sexless matter into its sexed condition, by dividing a pressureless condition into two opposite pressures which desire release from their opposition. All of the work of the universe is per- formed as a result of that desire in unbalanced matter to 120 THIS SE XED ELECTRIC UNIVERSE seek rest in a balanced condition. This is a sexed electric universe in every effect of motion, whether ,it be in the heart of a giant sun or in the petal of a meadow violet. Every action of motion in the universe is a result of sex desire for motion from a state of rest, or for rest from a state of motion. These two sex desires of electric action and reaction are the result of the two desires of the Father to manifest His One Light through the extended father-mother lights which interweave His idea of Creation into the multiple forms of that idea and void them periodically for the purpose of repeating them. The desire for two-way motion in equal action and reaction is reflected in the dual electric desire to give for I regiving , and to unfold for refolding. 121"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"\"Each thing in My universe is paired as opposite expressions of that thing.

In other words , they are all being either compressed or expanded if we use pressure terms; or charged and dis- charged if we use electrical terms. Both are the same. Likewise, all that are being compressed or charged by positive electricity are simultaneously being expanded and discharged by negative electricity to a lesser extent. 123"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"THE SECRET OF LIGHT Likewise, all that are being expanded by negative elec- tricity are simultaneously being compressed and charged by positive electricity to a lesser extent. This is a two- way universe in all effects of motion, and both opposite effects are expressed in both mates simultaneously as well as sequentially. THIS TWO-WAY UNIVERSE Electricity is forever winding light up into hot spheres, surrounded by cold cube wave-fields of space, and likewise sequentially unwinding them for rewind- ing. While winding them into compressed light masses, they are simultaneously unwinding to a lesser extent. Conversely, while unwinding they are simultaneously rewinding to a lesser extent. Every opposite of a pair charges in excess of its dis- charge for one half of its cycle. It then discharges in excess of its charging. Life and death are good exam- ples. Life charges a body in excess of its discharge for one half of its cycle and death discharges it in excess for the other half. Likewise the sun charges the earth during half of its twenty-four hour cycle in excess of its charge on the night side of the planet. The night side sequentially becomes the day side. The discharge of night then reverses to a preponderance of charge. 124 SEX -CONDITIONED OPPOSITE The father-mother principle is fundamental in every expression and both are simultaneously manifested in every expression, each being preponderant sequentially during half of each cycle. The father principle multiplies light into density and high potential. The mother principle divides it into vapors and gases of lower potential. Light is thus multi- plied and divided into suns and planets surrounded by \"space.\" The \"matter\" of earth is the same as the matter of heavens with but one difference; VOLUME. And there- in lies the secret of the universal pulse beat. Space is a division of solidity into tenuity. It is also a multiplica- tion of volume at the expense of potential. Interchange between these two unbalanced opposites is the basis of all motion in this rhythmic universe. Sex mates are two equal halves of one. They never can be one. They can never unite for they are the oppo- sites of motion. Opposites of motion can cease to be and by thus ceasing to be they can give birth to the other opposite, but they never can be other than opposite.

Each pulse beat brings each opposite nearer to voidance of each and complete interchange into the other, It becomes the other sequentially at the halfway point in its cycle, but it is still an opposite. Opposites oppose. They never perform any other office than to oppose. Opposition alone produces the idea of separateness in a universe of one inseparable thing. The opposite of water is water vapor. Water is a com- pressed condition. It is of the father-light. Water vapor is the expanded condition of water. It is of the mother- light. They are two halves of one which never can be one . The mother-light unfolds from the father-light. The father-light refolds the water vapor into water . Each has been born from the other. Each IS the other but they can never unite to become one. All idea of Mind is thus divided into sex pairs of opposite mates . Matter is divided into solids and gases. The gases are the solids outwardly bound toward the heavens. Solids are those same gases inwardly bound toward gravity . Heat and cold are opposites . Inwardly bound light rays generate heat from cold by compressing cold. Outward- ly bound light rays degenerate heat into cold by expand- 126 SEX -CONDITIONED OPPOSITE ing heat. It is said that cold is less heat. One might as well say that east is less west. East and west are two opposites just as cold and heat are opposites. OPPOSITE SE X CONDITIONS BORN EACH OTHER Matter and space likewise are sex mates . Each has become what each is by opposing the other to attain the appearance of separateness. Then each interchanges with each by breathing into and out of each other until space disintegrates matter and becomes what the other was. Space disintegrates suns and earths by the way of equators and generates them by the way of poles . Heat generated by cold by the way of poles is radiated by the way of equators. Suns thus turn inside-out. Cold bores black holes right through their poles and great suns become rings, like those in Lyra and other ring nebulae which are plentiful in the heavens. All matter is generated by the degeneration of its opposite. Likewise all generated matter is sequentially degenerated by the generation of its opposite . Compression in matter is balanced by an equal evacu- ation in space. Every unbalanced condition in Nature must be balanced by an equal opposite.

It is this desire for oneness which causes them to interchange. When credits and debits are balanced by interchange with each other, they cease to be. They do not become one. When electrical opposites thus cancel each other out by interchange of their plus and minus conditions, they do not neutralize each other, as commonly believed- they cease to be. MOTION CANNOT BE NEUTRALIZED There is no exception to this process of Nature. All idea is recorded electrically in equal pairs of opposite expressions. Each of the pair cancels the other out in cyclic periodicities. Each then becomes what the other was. Generation of any idea exceeds radiation during the first half of its cycle. Radiation then exceeds generation for the second half of the cycle. Both of these simula- tions of the idea, as expressed by motion, disappear. The idea still exists, however. The idea is at rest in its seed from which it can again appear in form of idea. 128 SEX -CONDITIONED OPPOSITE The two points of rest which are the fundamentals of every cycle are: the point of beginning at the wave axis, and the point of interchange between positive and nega- tive opposites at the wave amplitude.

Reproduction of two unbalanced mates cannot be repeated until balance has first been restored. The calm surface of the ocean may be broken up into waves, but those waves cannot be repeated until the calm surface of the ocean has been restored to the equilibrium of its rest position, even though that rest position is not main- tained. Reproduction begins at the rest point where the previ- ous wave cycle ends. Reproduction of unbalance must find a fulcrum from which the wave lever may leap into wave expression for repetition of pattern. That is what Creation is, merely the repetition of pattern with added pattern forever. This is a universe of waves within waves and waves without waves ; pulsing waves of dual light, extending forever outward to the ends of mirrored space and reflecting back again to microscopic centers of rest from which they may again spring from rest to seek rest through dual motion , but never finding it. 132 THE SEX REPRODUCTIVE PRINCIPLE This is a sex divided , opposed, two-way electric uni- verse which creates and voids through unbalanced pairs but repeats (reproduces) through voided ones. SEXES DO NOT UNITE Reproduction of dynamic sexed pairs does not come through the union of dynamic sexed pairs, but from the voidance of sex condition, and with it, the power of dynamic sex expression reproduction. Reproduction is not the unity of two opposite halves of one patterned thing; it is the voiding of the power of dynamic expression which all unbalanced opposites express. Reproduction is the cessation of those two unbalanced conditions which restores a balance from which similar- ly patterned negative forms reverse their expressions and become positive forms. SEX OPPOSITES REPRODUCE THRO UGH SEX VOIDANCE In this manner all patterned forms repeat their patterns sequentially. All pairs of unbalanced opposites come from God, the One, and return balanced as one, to God. All unbalanced pairs of separately conditioned things must first find voidance of unbalance and voidance of opposition. They must then become their own opposites 133"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"THE SECRET OF LIGHT to again acquire an unbalance necessary for another voidance and consequent repetition. All twos must become voided in the One in order to again become two. Reproduction of unbalanced opposites, by unbalanced opposites, is impossible . Opposition must first be voided . The dynamic must emerge from rest and it must be void- ed in rest in order that it may again become dynamic . THE DESIRE FOR BALANCE All things seek balance. Two opposed, unbalanced halves of one are forever seeking to balance their oppo- sition. Two children on a seesaw are balanced when they are on a level with their centering fu~crum . When they are on two different levels they are then unbalanced with their centering fulcrum . They are then dynamic. The ful- crum no longer centers them although they are balanced in themselves. In such a position they are obliged to move. Repetition of their motion is impossible while they are in balance with their fulcrum, but is imperative when the fulcrum no longer centers them. A sexless condition is imperative before a sexed con- dition can be repeated. Just as all motion starts from rest and returns to rest, so does a sexed electric condition arise from a sexless one. The two sexes, therefore, cannot be united to cause reproduction. They must first be voided. 134 THE SEX REPRODUCTIVE PRINCIPLE Unbalanced condition and change cannot unite to reproduce unbalanced condition and change. The unbal- anced condition and change must be voided in order to repeat unbalance and change. SEX OPPOSITES DO NOT NEUTRALIZE-THEY VOID The sexes like the two opposites of motion cannot \" neutralize\" each other by so-called \"union.\" The dynamic cannot be \"neutralized.\" Likewise, it cannot become static. But it can be void- ed. The static condition does not then take its place , for the static condition is eternal. It was there before the dynamic condition arose. The dynamic condition of sound, for example , arises from the static condition of silence , but sound does not become silence . Sound is voided; silence is eternal. The dynamic conditions of sodium and chlorine do not unite to become the static condition of sodium chlo- ride, nor are they neutralized. They must be voided before they can be repeated. SEX DETERMINED BY DIR ECTION OF PRESSURES Opposites are not things ; they are conditions of things. Just as heat and cold, or east and west, or inward and outward, or compression and expansion cannot unite to become one, so also, the opposite sexes cannot unite for they are but inward-outward pressures. 135"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE SECRET OF LIGHT Sex opposition is a difference in the pressure condi- tion of things. The male condition is one of compres- sion, the female is one of expansion. The sexes are thus differently conditioned by the two directions of electric pressures, in accord with the two opposite desires ,of the Creator. The difference of conditioning makes basically similar substances appear to be different things and dif- ferent substances. All things are sex divided. When, therefore, any two opposed and unbalanced sex halves of one conditioned thing balance their opposed conditioning through motion, they appear to become another thing or sub- stance. This appearance is a deception of the senses for they do not become another thing . They become voided and another thing from which both are extended, appears in their place . In chemistry we call these pairs stable com- pounds such as the salts. Water, for another example, is a voidance of oxygen and hydrogen, for there is no oxygen or hydrogen in water. Nor do oxygen and hydrogen become water. Water is the result of the voidance of two unbalanced and opposed conditions caused by equalizing opposed pressures at static equators. Consider the static condition of the calm ocean. A storm transforms that surface into a dynamic condi- tion. 136 THE SEX REPRODUCTIVE PRINCIPLE Waves which spring from the static ocean surface toward crests and troughs do not unite to reproduce another wave; they withdraw into the ocean surface . They disappear entirely and then reappear from it in reverse to repeat the next wave. Absolute voidance of one condition must take place before repetition can follow . Voided motion is recorded in the stillness from which it was unfolded in order that it can be repeated from that record. Records of motion are seeds for repetition of motion.

All matter is conditioned into greater or lesser strains according to the intensity of desire which is the cause of all electric strain to which it is subjected. The farther removed from rest, the greater the strain or tension. That which we call high electric potential is merely great strain to maintain a condition which is far from the condition of rest. The familiar return ball with which a child plays is a good example of electric strain. When the ball is thrown from the hand, the elastic gradually tightens to increase the tension of resistance to strain generated in the elas- tic. The strain continues to intensify until the ball comes to rest. When the ball returns, the strain gradually lessens until the ball again comes to rest in the child's"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE SECRET OF LIGHT hand. When that happens, the strain and tension have been voided. Tension has not BECOME rest; it has ceased to be. This whole electric universe is a complex maze of similar tensions. Every particle of matter in the universe is separated from its condition of oneness, just as the return ball is separated from the hand, and each is con- nected with the other one by an electric thread of light which measures the tension of that separateness. It is as though all of the universe of separated particles were playing return ball with each other. When a condi- tion of oneness has been attained in matter, the electric tension ceases to be.

When sodium and chlorine desire separateness from their oneness of condition in sodium chloride, an electric strain is set up between that separated trinity. When the desire for separateness has gone out of sodi- um and chlorine, the electric tensions which bound them to the rest condition from which they sprang are voided. Likewise sodium and chlorine are utterly voided. The reason for this is because all matter is a series of electric tensions. When the tensions cease, the condi- tions set up by them cease. It is as though two children on a seesaw withdrew into their fulcrum. Sex tensions and strains intensify the farther they are removed from rest.

We see the tides rise toward the moon on one side of the earth and away from it on the other. We conclude that the moon attracts the earth and thus pulls the ocean toward it, but that does not account for the fact that the tides also rise on the opposite side of the earth away from the moon. What is actually happening is that all conditioned matter is constantly seeking to balance its condition with all other matter.

The very shapes of wave fields of earth and moon are forever changing to adjust their bal- ance as the moon revolves around the earth. As a result, the mutual equators of both fields must lengthen, disc- like, on a plane which intersects the center of gravity of each body. Naturally the tides rise toward , and away, from the moon. If the earth were all liquid instead of solid, it, likewise, would lengthen appreciably at its equators, disc-like, and flatten at its poles to meet the interchange of balance between the fields of the moon and sun, as Jupiter and the outer planets are so notice- ably doing.

POLARITY We see the positive pole of a compass needle pointing toward the negative pole of a magnet and the negative pole of the magnet pointing toward the positive pole. This evidence is one of the bases of our conclusion . That is what our eyes see. What actually is happening is that they are voiding each other s unbalanced condition to seek balance through each other. Opposite poles get as far away from each other as they can, until their opposition is voided by balance in their fulcrum and they cease to be. THE ILLUSION OF ATTRACTION AND REPULSION OF MATTER When the positive pole of a magnet is brought into contact with the negative pole of another magnet, that effect which we think of as attraction is one of voidance. It isa cessation of opposition or power to manifest any- thing. Polarity utterly ceases at that point and each opposite extends to each opposite end, each getting away from the other and through the other, spirally , as far as it can. If opposite poles attracted each other, they would be together in the middle of a magnet instead of at its ends. MATTER IS POWERLESS TO ATTRACT Matter neither attracts nor repels other matter. Unbal- anced conditions in matter seek balanced ones . All mat- ter is motion constantly seeking rest. Matter neither attracts nor repels other matter . Unbal- anced conditions in matter seek balanced ones. All mat- ter is motion constantly seeking rest.

That alone is the cause of motion and the reason for its continuance or discontinuance. ALL MATTER IN MOTION SEEKS REST This is a universe 'of ONE THING. All matter which is electrically separated from that oneness seeks it. This is a fundamental principle and underlying desire of all Creation.

Thus there are but two conditions of matter-s-either expanding from stillness or contracting toward stillness. Each condition arises from the other; The instant it becomes its own opposite it gets as far away from that opposite as is necessary to find balance in a like condi- tion. It seeks its like condition to find rest in a balanced condition and not because the matter of it is attracted by the matter it seeks.

These opposites represent the compression-extension father-mother principle which integrates light into solids and disintegrates it into vapors and gases . ALL MOVING MASSES ARE UNBALANCED To say that these opposites attract each other is equiv- alent to saying that north attracts south, that inward attracts outward , that wetness attracts dryness , or that darkness attracts incandescence. Water, for example , is a compressed condition. THE ILLUSION OF ATT RA CT IO N AND REPULSION OF MATTER When water vaporizes it expands into its own opposite condition. It then seeks rest in clouds of like condition. When it thus finds rest in a balanced condition, its motion ceases and its opposition also ceases. ILLUSIVE EVIDENCE Another effect of motion which has misled the senses into believing that opposites attract is that hot air is said to rise toward cold and cold air to descend toward heat. That is not what is happening, for like seeks like. Cool- ing air is expanding and rising toward cold, and heating air is contracting and falling toward heat.

What is actually hap- pening is that the positive pole is taking the positive condition out of the water, leaving the negative oxygen as residue. The negative pole is, likewise, taking the negative condition out of the water, leaving the positive hydrogen as residue. Again like seeks like. The outstanding demonstration of the principle of like conditions seeking like is in the elements of matter. If opposites attracted opposites according to present con- cepts, it would be impossible to gather together one ounce of the same elements. All elements seek their kind.

Man's confusion concerning this differentiation lies in his long assumption of the reality of matter. His assump- tion that his body is his Self, that his knowledge is in his brain, and that he lives and dies because his body inte- grates and disintegrates, has been so fundamental a part of his thinking that it is difficult for him to reverse his thinking to the fact that matter is but motion and has no reality beyond simulating reality. gr~'S lifflt dI~m~gta1e~,:1J.las·oeeft-sb' luiidameftfal ~;tpaft of his thinking that it is difficult for him to reverse his thinking to the fact that matter is but motion and has no reality beyond simulating reality.

CONFUSION CONCERNING LIGHT CORPUSCLES There is much confusion concerning the many kinds of particles of matter such as electrons , protons, pho- tons, neutrons and others. These many particles are sup- posedly different because of the belief that some are LIGHT negatively charged, some are positively charged and some are so equally charged that one supposedly neu- tralizes the other. There is no such condition in nature as negative charge, nor are there negatively charged particles. Charge and discharge are opposite conditions, as filling and emptying, or compressing and expanding are oppo- site conditions . Compressing bodies are charging into higher potential conditions. Conversely, expanding bodies are discharg- ing into lower potential conditions.

It might then appropriately be called a neu- tron . A particle which is spirally heading inward toward the apex of a vortex in the process of becoming a sphere might appropriately be called a proton, because of its LIGHT expressing the father-light principle. Again, if it is moving spirally outward, it could appro- priately be called an electron because it would then be discharging in excess of its charge or expanding in excess of its contraction. Light rays, for example , leaving the sun, are discharg- ing the sun. They are also discharging themselves because they are expanding into greater volume.

LIGHT DOES NOT TRAVEL The speed with which light presumably travels is 186,400 miles per second. The distance between stars is so great that the speed of light is computed as light years, for the distance computed by lesser units of time would yield figures so great that they would be mean- ingless.

They reproduce each other from wave field to wave field of space. The planes of zero curvature which bound all wave fields act as mirrors to reflect light from one field into another.

The potential of all orbits of matter in space in which matter floats is equal to the potential of the mass which floats in it. The plane of our earth's equatorial region coincides with an equipotential plane of pressure which is equally balanced in respect to that part of the earth which floats above that plane , and that part which floats below it.

At the present rate of solar radiation, the sun should have burned out long ago. What keeps its fires burning? What is it that generates heat in the sun to keep it from cooling? One theory is that its contraction generates it, for con- traction supposedly heats. But that is not the answer, for contraction does not heat in the sun to keep it fromcooling? One theory is that its contraction generates it, for con- traction supposedly heats. But that is not the answer, for contraction does not heat nor generate. Contraction is possible only as a result of generation, not as its cause. Generation must precede contraction . It does not fol- low it. Heat follows as a result of contraction. Heat radiates. Radiation is the opposite of generation, and opposites act in opposite ways. Radiation expands and the resultant expansion cools; while generation contracts and the resultant contraction heats.

THE TEMPERATURE CYCLE The temperature cycle resulting from balanced inter- change between the cold of space and the heat of suns is as follows: cold generates; generation contracts; con- traction heats; heat radiates; radiation expands, and expansion cools . Thus ,our hot sun is being generated from cold space via its poles and is radiated back again into space via its traction- heats ; heat radiates; radiation expands, and expansion cools.

Life in him is God in him. The body of man manifests God in him by manifesting life in life- death-resurrection sequences, as all creating-decreating- recreating things in Nature likewise do. The body of man must be forever reborn unto the endless end to manifest God in him . There is naught but birth in this cyclic, pulsing universe. There is no death. The idea of man is a part of the One Whole Idea of Creation. All Creation is but an expression of that One Idea, part by part , each being a part of the Whole. God THE LIFE PRINCIPL E gives an eternal repetition of bodies to all parts of His Idea to manifest that idea in wave cycles of the divided light of His thinking . One half of each cycle unfolds the idea into the form of that idea and gives it action for producing that form. The other half of the cycle refolds the idea to give it rest in the Light of its Source for the purpose of repeating the manifestation in a repetition of that body. A return to rest in the Light is not death ; it is a return to Life for the purpose of rebirth to again manifest Life in a renewed body. We do not say that man is dead when he rests in sleep to partially renew his body.

Waves of light which give transient form to a man 's body are but his body. They are not the man, nor the man-idea. The body of the man is an extension of other waves of father-mother light in the sun, and the idea of man exists in the still Light which centers the sun. Man can never die for he is omnipresent Light and he exists everywhere. Likewise man's body cannot die for man's body manifests immortal man, and immortal man always has a body in which to manifest.

The senses of man are not attuned to the rest of the cycle of man's bodily journey from disappearance to reappearance but man's knowing reaches out over the entire cycle and man can know eternal repetitiveness of his body when he knows God in him. When water disappears beyond the senses as water vapor and gases, we know they will reappear as water when they have completed their cyclic journey.

He still has a long way to go, and the body he needs in which to manifest will return to him as surely as the light of day reappears from the darkness of night into which it has disappeared. WHAT HAPPENS AF TER \"DEATH\" The unanswered mystery of \"where do we go when we die\" needs a comprehensive answer. Abstractions and theories are not satisfying.

Organic life cannot be expressed in form in the sun although the idea of it is there . Everything which appears on earth as form of idea is in the sun as concept of that idea in the seed. The seed is the father-light which extends its idea of man and other creating things out into far space where its children , the planets , have sufficiently cooled to manifest the man-idea in organic form. THE LIFE PRINCIPLE Suns are crucibles which born their children, the earths , and set them out to cool in order that God 's idea which is in the formless suns, can manifest form in the sun 's extensions. SUNS ARE THE SEEDS OF CREATION The Creator scatters His seeds of light throughout all space to father and mother all borning imaged forms of His imagining. In the still center of suns is all idea for borning into the images of God's imagining, but in the oneness of the light of suns they are without form and void.

All expression of idea of earth is likewise in the sun and must be extended to earth for manifestation. Moun- tains and oceans are in the sun but also . all things else , the crying sound of a newborn babe, the roar of an avalanche or the street noises of a city.

These forms gradually complexed until the man-idea began to be expressed, not by a germ, but by the polarization of light itself, as manifested in the interchanging heartbeat of the father-mother light of the universe. The idea of all things is omnipresent in the One still Light. The expression of all idea is extended to the two lights of white suns and black space surrounding suns which manifest the Creator's two desires .

It is like extending a lever from a fixed fulcrum and setting it in motion to express the idea which is in the still fulcrum. In this manner the womb of mother earth becomes impregnated with the seed of the man-idea extended from the sun, and the first cell of man unfolds from mother earth into the heavens toward the refolding light of the father.

This is Nature's method of giving formed bodies to formless idea.

His body is composed of a few chemical elements borrowed from earth and sun to fashion into an instrument for his use. When his body disappears, the individual which inhabited that body is not dead.

That keynote is alwa ys i n one 's consciousness whether the note is being sounded or not. It is the balance of its octave. All tones are out of balance with it at all times and forever desire balance.

Carbon alone crystallizes in true cube, with all of the qualities of the true cube and sphere fully exemplified. All other ele- ments which crystallize as cubes are octave extensions of carbon. All such extensions occupy the four-zero-four position of wave amplitude. In carbon are all of the elements of its previous stages, just as in man are all of the actions and reactions of his previous stages. Hydrogen is a one octave younger prototype of carbon. It forms on the wave amplitude at four-zero-four just as carbon forms at four-zero-four one octave ahead. In hydrogen is a THE SECRET OF LIGHT idea, we think of him as grown up to fullness of middle age. Until then , we think of generating man as infant , child and youth. Following his generating cycles come the degenerative ones in which he gradually repays all of his borrowings from his zero of rest and returns to that zero to again borrow power to re -express the idea of man. (Fig. 71) This process of Nature, which expresses its cycles of idea in nine lesser cycles, is conspicuously present in the life-death cycles of the elements of matter. Carbon alone expresses the idea of matter. All the nine octaves of the elements are stages of unfoldment and refoldment of carbon . The first four and a half octaves lead to the maturity of carbon by the generative contraction of gravity. It is the hardest of all of the other stages of its elements are stages' of unfoldment' and refoldiiieni of carbon. The first four and a half octaves lead to the maturity of carbon by the generative contraction of gravity. It is the hardest of all of the other stages of its transition, having the highest melting point. The last four and a half octaves lead from maturity through old age to disappearance at the end of the nine octave cycle by the radiative expansion 'of vacuity. (Fig. 70) Genero-activity begins at the birth of carbon in the first octave with genero-active, inner explosive speed of light which is 186 ,400 miles per second.

Several of these have been recently discovered and wrongly named isotopes. Isotopes are split tones such as those which a violinist could produce between full tones. An amazing thing happens at this point in the unfold- ing of carbon's life record. Hydrogen's melting point is 259 degrees below zero centigrade and in one octave the winding up process of nature acts like a whiplash at its halfway position where genero-activity and radioac- tivity meet as equals. This effect tightens the winding of carbon into such a dense substance that the melting point jumps to 3600 degrees above zero in that one octave. Nature immediately counterbalances this accelerative action by dropping nitrogen, the next element beyond polBfjuinps fo-3f>lJU1.iIegfee~·aD'Ove12et6TIf'Yh;\\rlm~ octave. Nature immediately counterbalances this accelerative action by dropping nitrogen, the next element beyond carbon, into a gas which melts at 210 degrees below zero centigrade. It does not recover from the gaseous condition during the rest of its octave. The cosmic seed of the carbon octave is helium. Silicon is one octave older than carbon. The melting point of silicon drops to less than one half of its younger stage: 1420 degrees. The cosmic seed of the silicon octave is neon. When carbon becomes still another octave older at the four-zero-four position of cobalt in the sixth octave, it divides its full tone into ten split isotope tones; five on either side . (Fig. 70) THIS MAGNETIC · ELECTRIC UNIVERSE Carbon at this stage has lost much of its vitality and changes its character by thus dividing it into cobalt iso- topes. Its melting point has dropped to 1480 degrees, which is slightly higher than the silicon stage of carbon. Because of sharing that position with ten others it has lost much of its true cube-sphere quality of balance which the four-zero-four position manifests. The evidence of that is the metallic quality of cobalt which would be impossible in the true cube-sphere posi- tion of four-zero-four in the octave wave. The four-zero-four position is one of balance between the pairs of metallic opposites such as iron and nickel, manganese and copper, chromium and zinc or sodium and chlorine. When any of these pairs lose their metallic quality, such as iron and oxygen in iron rust, or sodium the' pairs 'of metallic opposites such as' iron and nickel, manganese and copper, chromium and zinc or sodium and chlorine. When any of these pairs lose their metallic quality, such as iron and oxygen in iron rust, or sodium and chlorine in sodium-chloride, they find both rest and balance in the stony quality of the salts; they crystallize in the cubic system if they are equal or near equal oppo- site pairs. Sodium-chloride is a good example. One can see its approximately true cubes in sodium-chloride (ordinary table salt) or in the distorted cube crystals of sodium-iodide. The four-zero-four position in the octaves of the ele- ments is the position of rest where any action must end its half cycle and begin its other half. It comes to a point of rest before returning to a point of rest, as all actions and reactions in nature do."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":", I THE SECRET OF LIGHT At one octave of still further aging, carbon becomes rhodium and again climbs to its amplitude position at four-zero-four by five efforts and descends by five more. Rhodium is more vital than cobalt, for its melting point is 1950 degrees. (Fig. 70) The cosmic seed of the rhodium octave is krypton. Great vitality is often evidenced in Nature's creations Fig. 73 Cycle of the elements from rest to rest after they have fully matured. The radioactive death principle is as vital in disintegrating the body as the gen- ero-active principle is in integrating it. That vitality is enhanced by the opposition of the genero-active resis- tance set up against it. Such strong , vital metals as sil- ver, nickel, copper, tantalum, tungsten, osmium, plat- inum and gold belong to the aging half cycles of carbon. Tantalum is a radioactive metal which becomes so dense because of opposition between the two electric THIS MAGNETIC-ELECTRIC UNIVERSE conditioners that its melting point reaches 3400 degrees centigrade, or within two hundred degrees of carbon. Osmium follows with a melting point of 2700 degrees and platinum at 1755 degrees . In this octave, the violent drop from carbon's melting point to nitrogen's melting point at minus 210 is balanced by this corresponding genero-active reaction. In the next octave of carbon 's aging, the radioactive death principle becomes more evident in lutecium. After reaching its three position in the positive half of its octave, it arrives at its balance position of four-zero-four only after making thirteen efforts, as evidenced by thir- teen isotopes including unknowns .' These are balanced by thirteen in the negative half cycle. Among these thir- teen is the vital tungsten , a negative metal of great com- oh1y 'aitediiaking thirteen efforts: as evidenced by thir- teen isotopes including unknowns.' These are balanced by thirteen in the negative half cycle. Among these thir- teen is the vital tungsten , a negative metal of great com- mercial value . By bombarding this metal with a suffi- ciently high current to cause it to disintegrate, it will dis- charge its seed of inert cosmic gases just as an oak tree will discharge its cosmic seed in acorns. The cosmic seed of the lutecium octave is xenon . The cosmic seed of carbon's last octave of disappear- ance arises from the inert gas niton. \" Octaves unfold from their past recorded seed and they must have a seed into which their present record can refold.

By looking through its lenses in the dark, one can see the shedding of the cosmic seed of the slowly dying carbon in its radium stage as the rays of those cosmic seeds bombard the screen. The effect is beauti- ful, like looking into the heavens on a starry night with all of its stars twinkling into appearance and dis- appearance as fireflies twinkle in the meadow on a dark night.

Carbon never comes within perception at tomium, but its efforts to reach tomium are evidenced in the uranium group of isotopes , of which there are fifteen before tomium is reached. Out of this group several have been found and made use of, especially those from which the atom bomb has been produced . (Fig. 70) Radioactivity has so nearly reached its maximum at this point that the speed of the cosmic seed shed by these isotopes has been measured at 180,000 miles per second, which is approximately the speed of light near- ing its ending point at tomion where the octave again begins at alphanon.

They are different pressure conditions of light waves. The light units of the elements are all alike but are differently conditioned by the electric pres- sures exerted upon them during the inward or outward spiral journey from zero to zero. The unanswered mystery of how the elements become mathematically precise octave tones, just as musical tones or color tones of the spectrum are mathematically precise in vibration orderliness, lies in the wave field gyroscopic principle. Together the eight elements of an octave form two halves of one whole cycle of tones which ascend from zero to the four-zero-four position of amplitude and then descend again to zero to begin anew.

THE SECRET OF LIGHT This spiral journey contracts into greater pressures as it approaches wave field amplitude positions at spiral apices, and expands into lower ones on the return jour- ney to spiral bases. That two-way spiral journey of each half cycle extends between six mirrors of still Light which com- pose the wave field, and winds around a still shaft which Fig . 75 Loc at ion s of el em ent s on w av e fields a re d ete rmined b y w av e-fi eld mirrors THIS MAGNETIC-ELECTRIC UNIVERSE centers the spiral. Three of these mirrors are the mirrors of action and three are the mirrors of reaction. (Fig. 75) . The three of action are the inner intersection planes of the cube and the three of reaction are the outer boundary planes of the wave field. All of these planes of the wave field are of zero curva- ture, but the spiral universe which is forming within those planes is curved. Curved planes of light act as two-way lenses which bend light to focal points and extend it from those focal points radially. As the two-way spirals of forming matter extend from the wave field center in opposite directions toward wave field intersections, the six mirror planes of still light focus three points of still light upon the still shaft of each half cycle. Centers are formed at these focal points &bi~Q.~~~J...lw . .9.n~~ !y!p>.Jrne~_p.9 _sitive and negative field intersections, the six mirror planes of still light focus three points of still light upon the still shaft of each half cycle. Centers are formed at these focal points which become the one, two, three positive and negative elements of matter by rotating gyroscopically upon the wheels of light which act as equators for those borning tones. Multiplying and dividing pressures determine the den- sity and volume of each succeeding element. The color spectrum records these pressures as the complete history of every element from octave to octave of the whole nine octave cycle of the elements. Multiplying pressures of the spiral also affect the cur- vature of its light lenses to such an extent that the focus- ing positions change their mathematical ratios in confor-"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"I : THE SECRET OF LIGHT mity with the acceleration of gravity and the decelera- : tion of radiation.

The direction of gravity is the inverse square , and the opposite direction is the direct square. The volume of each succeeding element is likewise affected directly and inversely as the cube. '\"1'70 THIS MAGNETIC-ELECTR IC UNIVERSE Six of the eight gyroscopic wheels of the whole octave are thus accounted for by geometric projection of two- way opposed lights through each other, from two sets of three mirror boundary fields. The fourth double tone is formed at the rest point where eight cube wave fields meet. This is the point of rest which is known as the center of gravity in earths or suns-where motion and curvature cease. The completed sphere thus becomes a section of eight adjoining wave fields and revolves around that point of rest upon the wave shaft where the two half cycles of the wave meet.

One or more added or subtracted would not change the element into another substance any more than one or more children would affect the nationality of their par- ents. Transmutation will become simplified by observing that the plane of gyration, in relation to amplitude , and the speed of revolution of the gyroscopic wheel upon its THI S M AGNETI C -ELE CTRIC UNIV ERSE still shaft, will alone change volume by either multiply- ing or dividing density. Great possibilities in new metals lie in the proper application of this principle. THE SHAPE OF THE UNIVERSE This ageless universe has no shape. It has a seeming infinite extension, but that extension is a reflected one.

The idea of continuity or discontinuity is based upon mirrored effect of an initial Cause. Continuity infers time. Time is but one of the effects which constitutes this universe. Time flows two ways, but the senses detect only the forward flow . They cannot detect the backward flow which cancels out the forward flow . Time is as unreal as the wave universe is unreal. What is true in principle of one wave is true of all waves. Each wave is a two-way reflected extension of an equilibrium zero which we call a vibration.

The three centering planes are centered by zero. All intersections of these planes add up to eight. Eight, centered by their zero source, equals nine. Likewise the cube itself adds up to eight by counting the intersections of its six faces. Also there are eight directions of action and eight of reaction ; each eight being four pairs, which are nine by adding the centering zero. Nine is the three times three of length, breadth and height extended from zero. The length, breadth and height of any expression is two extended zeros centered by zero.

Walter Russell shows here that sensed observation can result in incom- plete vision and incomplete scientific laws . He points out that Newton based his law of gravitation on his observation of what gravity did to an apple, while admitting he did not know what gravity was. Newton did not se~se !~e whole cycle of the apple in time \"falling\" up to the heav- ens as It disintegrates and reverses potential.

Walter Russell implies that Newton s laws of gra vitation were incomplete : It is o~vious from the Russell cosmogony that the moon can never stop Its motion, nor can any of the other bodies that move around their. primarie~ st?P mov~g . They do not fall becau se they are always see .king and fmdmg , losmg and refinding their potential positions in their movements. If they were to stop their motion, they and all the Uni- verse would disappear . If they were to stop their orbital motion and move inward .or outward, to or from their primary, there would be a counterbalancmg movement from their primary to balance this change of pattern unto the furthermost reaches of the Universe.

See reference to this note on page 46 in this thud edition of Th e Secret of Light . 2. Walte~ R~ssell in all of ~s later writings spoke of gra vity as being a thrustmg mward from Without. For example , in Atomi c Suicide? this concept is expres sed in various ways , as on page 134: \"Bear in mind the fact t~at you .are c ompressing from the outside inward, \" and on page ~35 , There IS no force of any n ature which holds it together by an m~~rd pull. Nat~:e does not attract nor does it repel. It compresses within a vacuum . He also expresses this idea on pages 89 , 104-105 , 138-139 , and 145. In the Home Study Course this idea is expressed on page 719: \"The word 'magnetism ' is also unjustifiable . The word ~R .A VITY sho~Id !'e used instead, for gravity both multiplies and divides by thrusting inward from without to compress and outward from within to expand.\" This viewpoint is explored in considerable detail on pages 719, 724-727 , and 733-735 of the Home Study Course. On page 10 of A New Concept Of The Universe Russell says \"One of these two electric conditions thrusts inward toward a center to create a NOTES centripetal vortice to simulate gravity. On the other side of the dividing equator , the other condition thrusts outward from a center to create a centrifugal vortice to simulate vacuity. \" On page 40 the idea is expressed as, \"An outward explosion compresses in advance of the direction of the action and simultaneously evacuates in the opposite direction . The following half of the cycle is in reverse. The evacuated condition becomes a compressed 2ne, and the compressed condition becomes an evacuated one .\" This idea is expressed directly and implied in many other pages . throughout A New Concept Of The Universe .

In all other places in his works , Walter Russell speaks of the north and south magnetic poles as both being charging poles that wind the sphere into density by centripetal force. He also later removed the term mag- netism in relation to what we normall y call the magnetic field, saying that this too was electric motion. On page 30 of A New Concept of the Univ erse Ru ssell says, \"Radiation i s an electric effect. It is not magnet- ic.\" And again on the same page he says, \"There are no magnetic lines NOTES of force in Nature .\" The term magnetism was reserved for the \"still - ness \" of the \"Zero universe of mind knowing .\" On page 27 of A New Concept of the Universe Russell says, \"These two point s of stillness where electric motion reverses from one opposite pres- sure condition to the other are wh at science calls magnetic pole s. The office of magnetic poles is to balance and control all electrically-divided motion in the universe. . . . All electrically-di vided matter , ... is controlled by a still centering point of magnetic light. \" In this view all effects that science normally calls electric and magnetic he chose to call electric. This corresponded to his change in describing gravity. He also named electricity and gravity as One. He called gravity both the inward and the outward directed electric motion , saying it was a thrusting inward from without and a thrusting outward from within. See note number one. In this way he unifies what is normally called gravity , radiation , elec- tricity and magnetism as the same entity or proce ss. In one phase it is inward bound , compressing , heating, charging and contracting; in the other it is outward bound, extending , cooling , discharging , and expand- ing. On page 715 of the Home Study Course , the Russells say , \" Cre- ation must henceforth be looked upon as AN OPTICAL UNIVERSE OF GRAVITY CONTROLLED LIGHT ... \" On page 31 of A New Concept of the Uni verse he says , \" The curvature of gravitation is centripetal. It is controlled b y the north-south magnetic poles .\" And , on the same page he continues with , \" The system of radial curvature is centrifugal. It is controlled by two as-yet-unknown magnet- ic poles which will amply be described later as east-west poles. \" ffi. -CiRAVITYTOJI.ITRdLLBIJ \"(.lGffC~\" : ' M' Q 'QFQ ~' n nn nono '\")70 On page 31 of A New Concept of the Universe he says, \"The curvature of gravitation is centripetal.

It is controlled by two as -yet-unknown magnet- ic poles which will amply be described later as east-west poles .\" Therefore, we could rewrite the sentences this not e refers to on page 279 of The Secret Of Light as follows : At the two points upon the still shaft of the turning sphere where the shaft penetrates its surface are the north- south magnetic poles of still Light , which along with the east-west equipotential circumferential poles of still magnetic Light, control the balance of the sphere's turning. The north-south magnetic poles control the winding of the sphere into density by centripetally directed genera- tive , electric force of gravity, and the east-west poles control its unwind- ing by the centrifugally directed radiative, electric force of gravity .\" In this way the statement conform s to his later vision of how he termed magnetism , radiation, and generation: Magnetism resides in the stillness of the zero point c enter of the pole-shaft (the still magnetic Light of Mind); radiation exhibits the outward electric thrust of gravity; and ge~­ eration exhibits th e inward electric thrust of gravity.

Light is all there is; it is all we have to deal with, but we do not yet know what it is. The purpose of this message is to tell what it is. Today's civilization has advanced far in knowing HOW }O deal with mat- ter but we do not know WHAT matter is nor the WHY /iof it. Nor do we know what energy, electricity, magnetism, gravitation and radiation are . Nor do we know the purpose of the inert gases and WHAT they are. Nor do we know the structure of the elemental atoms nor the gyroscopic principle which determines that structure. Nor are we aware of the fact that this is a two-way continuous universe of balance in all effects of motion and not a one-way disco tinuous universe . Nor have we even yet heard of or suspected the most important of all principles in physics, THE VOIDANCE PRINCIPLE and the mirrors and lenses of space which are the cause of illusion in all moving things . Jesus said, \"GOD IS LIGHT,\" and no man of that day knew wha t He meant. The day is now here when all men must know what Jesu s meant when He said \"G O D IS LIGHT.\""}]
