During this period. I lectured upon the misconceived idea that hydrogen is the basic number one atom of the periodic table. I explained that there are twenty-one other elemcnts which precede it and that hydrogen itself is not a single clemen( but a whole complex octave. I also explained thc impossibility of there being any element without an inert g.rs as its source. At that time I distributed my periodic charts to approximately li00 scientists and universities. Further than inciting research which yielded so-called isotopes of hydrogen and heavy water, nothing came of my effort. nordid I receive thecreditdue me. lncidentally, those so-called isotopes are not isotopes but full-toned elementsof an orde y octave group series. Isotopes do not occur in Nature until they reach the octave following tlle silicon (rtave. The reasons for this are fully explained in our Study Course. I wrote two books. gave many lectures and set up a demonstration laboratory in a university to prove that the elements are not different substances but are differently- conditioned pressures of motion - and that the structure of the atom is based upon the gyroscopic principle. As one after another of my discoveries appeared under othernames.I acted on the advice of a friendly science editor to withhold any more of my new cosmogony until it was fully completed in words and diagrams. and again copyrighted. xv It has taken many yea$ to so complete it that it is invulnerable to attack. but this has now been done, and this present treatise isascomplete in briefas the whole cosmogony is complete in detail. I do not look for immediate acceptanoe o[ this revolu- tionary new knowledge. I do hope and expect, however, that the seed of it will grow within the consciousness ot science, and as I am nearing 82 years of age I feel it incumbent to announce the fact to science through this open letter and rrcatise that The Russell Cosmogony, which my gifted wife, L o, and I have togetherwritten into a year's Study Course of 9.15 uncontradictable pages, and 182 diagmms, is now com plcte.

Since the days of Galileo this undependable method of gaining knowledge through the senses has served to multiply man's reasoning powers by teaching him HOW to do man'e- lous things with elecfficity and the elements of matter. but not one great savant of science can tell the WHY - or the CAUSE - of his familiar eiiects.

His laws are free from such claims and demonstrate to a high degree the orderliness of effects of strains and tensions in a wave field. If wave fields were not balanced in their polarity, such laws would not work out in Nature as they do. It is because of the absolute equality of division of opposing pressures in every wave field that such laws are workable. Kepfer's first law reads as follows: \"Each planel moves untutl lhe sun in an ellipse, with the sun in one of its foci.\" 1'his htw is right as far as it goes, but there are two foci to cvcrv orltil, {nd cach of them has equal power in deter- nrininl lhc rotc$ of l|cccleration and deceleration of speed. Jusl us Ncwlon's law accounted for the falling apple, but ignorctl thc uther half of the apple cycle from the zero of its bcginning k) the zero of its ending so, likewise, Kepler's first law accounts for but one-halfof an orbit by the refer€ncc to otlly one of its two foci. Every orbit is balanc€d and controlled by four magoetic poles, not two. It has not y€t b€en known that there are four magnetic poles, but a threedimensional cube-sphere univenc would be impossible with only th€ two north-south poles. I will enlarge more upon these four magnetic poles in a later chapter, and describ€ the s€parate offic€s which each fulfills in the extension and retraction of wave fields.

This periodicity is balanced by an angular periodicity lhncts' equators moving away from the equators of their ningand lengthening elliptical orbits are those inferen- referred to in the KeDler law. In order to comprehend the periodicity of the familiar {outh magnetic poles, it is necessary to comprehend tclationship between these two opposing pairs of no h- and east-west magnetic poles, and their malner of ndon from a common fulcrum and their retraction to it. As planets oblate, their north-south poles gradually gway from their poles of rotation. Our earth hiu become tly oblate for its magnetic poles to move to an angle flng suns, where all planets of all systems are born from Thc equator of our earth has moved out of the plane of cquatorto keeppacewith the polar shift.

Conversely, the earth is being r\\tnstantly discharged into lower potential by the centrifugal, rlividing force of negative electricity which depolarizes and rlcvitalizes. Witness outgoing earth rays. Both are the same rays. They have but changed their lrrlarities by reversing their outward direction of expansion to un inward direction of contraction. When sun rays leave licir cathode in the sun, they are negative particles - or vor'tices of motion which we call matter. Their polarity rorsl.rntly changes until they change their direction at the filritt()r between sun and eafih.

It is commonly stated in sciene textbooks that the earth is a giant magnet. That is nottrue to Nature\\ processes. The equator of a magnet is not a center of gravity. The c€nter of the eafth is a center of gravity. All matter, whether of earths, suns, or corpuscles, is formed between the opposite poles of two magnets. To produce the effect of gravity, two dividing equators must be united as one. (See Figure 78 to 83, page 151) Man's bar magnets are cylinders of unchanging condition. Nature's magnets are cones ofever-changing conditions. (See Irigurcs l5ft-159. page 168). 'l hc cqultor of man\\ magnets is of zero curaature and centen lls;rrlcs. 'l'hc cquutor of Nature's magnets is curved and is ofl ccnlcr, Much c()nfusion has arisen from this misconceDtion. (Scc l'igulcs l5$16{). p ge l6tl) XXIV EVERY PARTICI,E OF MATTER IS BOTH CATHODE AND ANOD& TUST AS LIVING BODIES ARE ALSO DYING 37. This is a radial universe of ever-changing pressures. Every extending particle which leaves a cathode or anode is negative, for it expands as it leaves its primary and thus discharges. That very same negative particle - electron or otherwise - changes its polarization intensity every miltionlh of-an-inch from either its cathode or anode. That is th(. reason science has so many names for the same particles. '79 When a.partir.le arrives al \\.rave amplirude - or an) equalor wnere the pressure condirion is rerersed _ ir crn will be called a neutron, for its polarity is balanced at that reversal polnr. Afterits cuftature is revelsed, it then becomes a positively_ charging particle, for it contracts as it radially approaches iis anode. lt might then be called a positron or poiitive meson, ormany other names as its condition changes. (See FigLrre 77, page 150.) xxv THERE ARE NO SEPARATE PARTICLES OR ELEMENTS This same principle applies to all of the elements of separate substances having separate properues. l_ol Ihe elemenrs are made up ol the \\erJ sellsame spiral tts ol motion - or voflices.

This universe consists solely of waves of motion. Any theory which cannot lind a fitting place within the wave has no other place for it in Nature. The present-day concept of atomic structure is based upon concentric shells. one within the other, which become the basis for revolving electrons placed according to formula upon lhose shell strata. Centering th€s€ ge(xentrically and geometrically plaoed elec- trons are nuclear groups of separately-and-oppositely-charged protons and photons. By adding one electron to an outer shell. an element next in number is produced. Conversely, it is believed that if one electron could be knocked out of an element. such as mercury. the n€xt succeeding element - gold - could be produced.

Thev wohhle when lheir shafts are off center. The huhs of gyroscopic wheelsdo not center their rims in tht first three pairs of tonesofthe nctave. The wheels are ellipses and lhe hub of the wave shaft is gravity. so gravity does n()l center the wheel for the first three octaves- A metal gyroscopic wheel, <r flywheel, multiplies centrifugal force as it increases in speed. but Nature'satomic gyroscopic wheels are centripetal vortioes which cont.act around thcir shafts. They are like whirlpools or cyclones which thntsl inward and multiply centripetal force as they thus contract t(! form hubs for their wheels which are cenlerinIl suns. 4d8e!- 109 93. Two children cannot move whil€ they are in balance with theirfulcrum, for motion is impossible in an equilibrium Balance must be divided into unbalanced opposite pairs before motion becomes Possible. Nature likewise cannot ptoduce motion without thus dividing balance to produce two opposing conditions. Centripetal fo.ce thus produces carbon when its speed has multiplied sufficiently in each succeeding tonal elfort to find a balance between thos€ two opposing conditions. Wobbling gradually decreases as the prolating spheroidal hub of the gyroscopic wheel contracts to a true sphere and the shaft otgravity centers the hub. and its north-south poles are parallel with the wave axis ol its heginning. XXXVII HOW GRAVITATION AND RADIATION BORN EACH OTHER 94. Nature works in stmnge ways. C)f all her myslifying processes, her manner of producing the double polarity, which assures twcway balanc€ for the two-way journey of her two conditions, is perhaps the most illusive of her illusions. It is well to cladfy this mystery step by step at this point' 1A) The carbon wheel spins lalue rpon ^ hoi2ontal rhaft whicb arose vertictrlly flrom its plane of equilibriLrm. (B) The rim of the wheel begins to spin on the horizontal plane of equilibrium and arises to become the verrr'cdl equatot of its hub.

(F) The rim of the wheel is now qldegrees from the equilibrium plane of its birth. and is 90-degrees from the shafr of its hub. From a plane of no motion, it has become asphere of maximum motion.

This is Nature's process of dividing the still Light of the Creator into the two moving lights of matter and space tcr simulate the Mind imaginings of the Creator by moving image forms of His Creation. A word picture of this proc€ss might simplify Nature's methdl. Imagine, therefore, the seed of idea placed upon the wave axis like the seed of a tree put into the ground. Now irnagine the ground rising as a hoop would rise from thc ground until it stood straight up instead oI lying down. As the ground rises to stand up. imagine the idea of thc trce 111 unfolding in a series of four effo s which we will call stages of growtn, The seed of the idea becomes a fully formed mature body when the ground has arisen lrom wave axis level to wave amplitude height, 9Gdegrees from its axis lerel. The ground, which bomed the formless seed, is now the vertical equator which balances the fully formed body. Half of the upright tree extends to the north of that equator and ihe other half to the south of it. Its roots extend north toward gravity, and its branches radiate south toward space. This is the manner in vNhich growing matter appears. Now comes the reverse process. That fully formed body which has unfolded from its seed must now refold into its seed. This it does in lour reverse stages of decadence. and rs it thus refolds the ground lies down gradually with all of thc body still contained in it but refolded as patterned sced. This is the manner in \\hich decayiry matter divplteut.t. This visualization pictures that method of Nature which borns and reboms its pattemed ideas forever and forever without cnd. Thal which comes from the ground must return to it for rebirth. Patterned forms must disappear into their seed and be added to at each rebirth. ldea is eternal. Bodies which manifest idea are transient but their repgtitions are etemal. There is no exception to this process of repetitions of bodies which is called reincamation vhen applied to man. The process is universal, however, and applies to all creating things -- not man alone. 96, lf onc woulcl know the heartb€at oI the universe, one coukl know it ht c()fiprchcnding this rhythmic balanced"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"1 t I I t12 intcrchnnge lttrvccn the pairs ()t ()pfosilc condiritrns * hich galc rternitt lo lhis uni\\elsc thtough cl!fnal rcpctilions ol lir in! d\\inl seqrtcnees 'I bus ii is th.lt rhc lilc.dcuth gro$th_dcr:a\\ pr()cc\\s ol di\\ rsrorl ol aln cquilibnu|rr int() t\\rr) ol]p()si1el! ciDrlirion.d slelcs ()f nlolion is repfrtcd rn c\\et\\ aclritl tclctron ()l mr)11()n. ni) nriltlel hdv simple or holr ltreat.

Carbon is still tremendously strong of body in its cobalt stage but cobalt is not a truesphere, nor is its wave field atrue cube. For this reason cobalt is metallic, and so are the carbon prototypes in the rhodium and lutecium octaves.

Free hydrogen is the logical supply because free hydrogen is the basis of the four space octaves. The entire population of ten planets like ours could not lessen its total because Nature balances the withdrawals of gases with replacements continuously. Nature's replacemenas for with- drawals of solids consumes the amount of time taken to grow them. Nature may take a million years to grow forests into coal. Coal is multiplied nitrogen, for nitrogen is a gas of carbon- Nitfogen can be transmuted conlinuously from the atmosphere in unlimited Eutnlities forever. The atmosphere is composed of nitrogen and oxygen. Oxygen is carbon twice removed, just as nitrogen is carbon once removed. Likewise hydrogen is carbon one octave lower. but not removed tonally. Gyroccopically, carbon and hydrc gen are the same, for their planes of structure are identical. Hydrogen could. therefore. be transmuted from the rlmo$phcrc in unlimitcd quantities by merely changing the $yrussopic planc of nitrogen to the 9Gdegree angle of wave umpliturlc upon which hydrogen rotates. It would simplify scientific thinking if science would view the universe of \"matter\" and \"space\" as gravity which accumulates generoactive predominance into hydrogen in the first three-and-a-half invisible octaves of matter that man today thinks of as space. The visible universe begins at the middle of the fourth octave and conlinues locarbon - its generoacl ive maximunl - where fourth and fifth octaves meet at wave amplitude.

That is N)l Nature'.s wav 127 In Nature, one tone ceases to be and another becomes. In otier words, one formula for a patterned wave vibration ceases when another measured vibration begins. We must also ca.ry this thought fa.ther by not thinking of cessations, beginnings and endings. We must think of them as awakened continuities wtich we can \"put to sleep\" when we have no furth€r need of them, or \"awaken\" when we have need of them. The electric current ofthe universe isready to motivate any tone as we desire to awaken it, just as the electriccuffent of the organ is ready to awaken any tone when the organist desires to awaken it. We should not think oI sodium and chlorine as having Decorne sodinm chloride - or that sound ha,t become sllence - for each ofthem is and always will b€, We should think of each of them as another note played on the universal organ. We change its tuning pattern if we want new isotopes which Nature has not yet given us or we unite two unbalanced halves to secure stability or produce explosives by multi- plying unbalance. That is Nature's way. Carbon unwinds to nitrogen because of the predominant power of east-west negative polarity. Likewise, nitrogen unwinds to oxygen. That does not mean that carbon has ceased to be, or that 1t has become nitrogen and oxygen. It means that carbon still lJ but it has changed its pressure dimensions, just as John Jones is the same John Jones that he was ten years ago. Nature demonstrates this fact by \"transmuting\" nitrogen and oxygen back again into carbon. Every root oi all vegetable growth rewinds both of them upward again into carbon.

With a steel or glass disc tor an equator and a steel rod for arnplitude, I adjusted my solenoids approximately to a planeanglewhere I roughly calculated oxygen belonged in its octave. I improvised an adjustment apparatus which would enable me to fasten any adjustment securely at any angle I chose. I then inserled a iew cubic centimeters of water in an evacuated quartz tube which had electrodes at each end for spectrum analysis readings.

When I reversed the polarity to east-west preponder- ance, the analysis showed more than its proper amount of oxygen and inert gases and less of hydrogen. This meant tbat preponderant east-west polarity had oblated the hydrogen nucleus. The following analysis is agood example. When I took the tube to the laboratory, there was no water in it.

All down the ages suffedng man has lifted up his voice untohis God saying: \"Lead us out of the dark oI our iniquities into the Light of Thy kingdom.\" And God has answered man's prayers through inspired messengers who bring new knowledge of the Light of Love and the Brotherhood of Man into the world for the r€newing ol man's Mind with the power of new kno\\ring. But man did not hear God'sVoice through His messen' gers, Ior man lvas still new in his primate days of little compr€hension, Man crucified God's messengers and again suffer€d the fall of civilization after civilization bv makins every man fear €very other man. And yet again in our day the agonies of ten times ten million suffering mothers of men are crying unto Godto save the world from another plunge into long ages of darkness. For\" once again the humin ruce is neaing another downfall into uges of darkness of its own making, for once again man has made a worlcl of hate rthere erer! ndn Jbals ever! other mun."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"142 Over and over again man has climbed far into the heavens in his search for the peace and happiness which Love of man for man alone can give to him, and over and over again he has fallen because he has leamed only to hate and fear and kill his fellow man for selfish greed, thinkingthus by the power of might he will gain the riches of his seeking. Man has never known Love as the very heartbeat of this universe - the motivative force behind all matter and motion which controls the stars in their orbits and brings forth the fruits oI the earth for man's sustenancc. He has never known Love as Law - irrevocable Law - not emotion or sentiment within man's free-will right of giving and taking - but inviolate Law which brings an inescapable penalty to any man who violates that Law in his relations with other men, or with his own My. He has never known that l,ove is balanced giving for regiving which Nature ob€ys in all of its transactions. Man has always taken what he wants, not knowing that the hult of such taking is his alone. Man has never known that lnve is balanced interchange between the pairs of opposites of this divided universe. Without balance in Nature's transactions the universe could not survive. Likewise, without balance in man's transactions man cannot survlve. There never has been balance in man's relation to man. Love has not yet entered the world or the Consciousness of man. Man has never practiced the principle of universal brotherhood which God's rnessengex gave to age after age of Iearing man. There never has been a time in world history when man has not feared and hated his fellow man, and locked his doors and policed his stre€ts because he feared his neighbor. Nor has there ever been a time when nations of men 143 have not a-rmed themselves in fear of other nations nor killed when one nation wanted th€ possessions of other nations or to enslave their peoples for greed of power and gold. There has never been a time in the blackest day of world hi$ory than the black hopelessness of today's world of fear and hate of one-halJ oI the world for the other half. and the growing degradation and lowering of the spiritual standards of the world. This divnited, fear-iclden, tax-burdened world of man's centuies of empire building by conquest of the weak by the strong catumt surtire.It is doomed to self-destruction unless at this eleventh hour the lesson of Love, once again given to man in God's Dvine Iliad Message, is leamed and heeded by the few among men to whom God will give new power to immunize the few from the harm of the many. Unless the iew amolg the leaderc oi men will a se to the power of new knowing given in God's Message of The Divine lliad, the free world of man will disappear. The slave world will then appear as a foremath to unthinkable degrada- tion of the whole human race. where Love is there also is unity, harmony and the peace of Love's balanced rhythms in a united world. Where hate is there follows the degeneracy of disunity as night follows lhe day. That is the lesson which unfolding man has still to learn. Until he leans that simple lesson of power which comes from giving of service to his fellow man instead of taking from him against his tvill, his civilizatioru will disappear in their own mon-mnde chaos, one after another, until he leams that lesson. After millions of years of taking by the power of his might, his six thousand years out of thejungle have not been long enough for him to learn that lesson of power which lies"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"IM alone in the g/vrag of l-ove, nor has he yet learned that his destruction is of his own making through violation of the Law of Love. Man acquired no knowledge and but little comprehen- sion during his slow unfolding through primate and pagan ages, for he was not ready for it. Consciousness of Mind in him had not yet dawned. Through dense ignorance of God's ways man has suffered the agonies caused by dense ignorance. Then came the dawn of Consciousness in barbarian man and his first suspicions oI a God{reator who to him was a vengeful god of wrath for whom he shed the blood of bullocks, and even men, upon sacrificial altars to appease his vengeful god of fear and wrath. God sent new knowledge and His message of Love and the unity of man through illumined messenger after illumined messenger all through his €arly barbarian days, but man was still too new to comprehend, for he was not yet ready to comprehend a God of Love nor His message of I-ove. He still shed blood upon his sacrificial altars to appease his vengeful god of fear, and he still suffered the agonies of his little comprehension. Man is still barbarian, for man still kills rwn: and he still worships a wmthful god offear. And nan willforever $rIfer th? agonies of his ignorance until Mind awareness of the God ol Love awakens in him in its fullness, and nun knows rtan as on( brotherhood, and begins to serve nQn insteod of killing him. Man learns his lessons by deep suffering, for only at times of great suffering does he turD to God for Light l(, illumine his path out of his dark pit of hopeless despair. Man of today has had a half century of deep suffering and manv there are amone men who have lurned their filcc\\ 'ddr*l* 145 to the high heavens and cried aloud to be sav€d irom their agonies. Man of today is not so new. His comprehension is now great enough ao understand God's ways as manifested in His One Law of Love. Man of today is ready for new knowledg€ and God has given to those few who are able to comprehend it the power of new knowing to command the forces which order the movements ol stars in their orbits and the earth to bring forth its fruits. The knowledge of God's ways given to man for his new day will give the few among men mighty new power to cont.ol all men of earth tbrough God's One Law ol Love until the s€ed of it will multiply over the face of the earth and bring wirh it the ha.mony and peace of its balanced rhythms. When Mind Consciousness dawns in man. God aware- ness likewise da\\rns in him. and he becomes illumined with full howing of the On€ness of Mind of man and Mind of God. When that day daww for man, he has command over all the universe, for energl of Mind in him created the universe, and knowledge of Mind in Him controls its energj. Fear then leayes him. for he knows he has dominion over all things. He can no longer be hurt by man, nor will he hurt man, but the power will be his to prevent man from hurting man by awakening Consciousness in him to Love, e'en tiough he may lose one more life to find it.
