Chapter 1: In Propria Persona Propria Persona: Silk Purse v. sow's ear: in personam. God's Republic plays \"Public Law\" and is Thee Sovereign Silk Purse. Democratic \"public policy\" plays the part of the sow's ear at \"engrafted\" contract, with a couple of wiggly tails as \"devise,\" no police power pun intended. No actual pig's wiggly or silk purses were at \"action\" in this treatise. The old Dragon however, must covet its many lobes or lo se her entirety to Truth. This treatise does not contain fancy word s, only the tongue of the \"serpent\" and to be \"as wise\" you must Kn ow it, for the words are soothing to the old Dragon's lobes and your Grace is Peace. This information is Scribe of Black's Law 5th Edition and Thee King James Bible. Personam is your individual God given silk purse, as free as your Creation. You give up your silk purse each time yo u sign an agency sow's ear contract, because you waive another contract, Thee Bill of Rights and New Covenant. I have all my purses in silk; mine are just dirtier than yours should be. You will be collecting many ears as you stutter throug h this material, and it is my prayer that all your Covenants are silk purses with pearls. To become \"subject\" and \"made liable\" to Article I Legislated and Article II Executor/Admiralty is as easy as signing your children into pre-school. Enrollment office will show our proud flag, Admiralty. The signing of the corporate birth certificate, the Child's assignment of SS# , is where the birthright switch is made from \"entitled\" Rights to \"subject\" civil Liberties. Under the Common Law a parent may contract a Child 's name to an instrument, seeking faith and fairness, but agency has not the power. This activity does not take much practice because we sign contract s all the time. The W-4 instrument was by far the best Dragon lobe I ever pi nched, because it was the most obvious and worrisome \"devise.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Sponsored by: Solutions for Debts (310) 734-4284, All Rights Reserved W/out Prejudice, W/out Recourse.

Police activity cannot dissuade Personam to switch loyalty in the schoolyard to in personam and \"thing in action.\" The sow's ear is obtained by signing ne gotiable units unconditionally, thereby triggering the police power of agency . The winged Serpent \"Penumbra\" has \"engrafted\" the Separation of Powers at the Voting House of Article I and the War Wagon of Article II, which makes an d enforces the sow's ear unit for your \"benefit.\" Article III and Thee Bill of Righ ts are the only conquest left for the many headed Beast and Penumbra is diverting Lady Justice with \"engraft\" of law and \"devise.\" Black's Law 5th. Personal jurisdiction. Th e power of a court over the person of a defendant in contrast to the jurisdiction of a court ov er a defendant's property or his interest therein; in personam as opposed to in rem jurisdiction. A state citizen is born with silk purs e personam and becomes in personam and actionable to recover money after signin g an \"unconditional\" agreement with the Article I sow's ear agency. Rights are inalienable within Thee Bill of Rights and Articl e III Judiciary, but seldom \"prayed\" for lack of knowledge . Natural Law Rights cannot be taken away, but may be waived by contractua l \"devise,\" because agency does not have police power over the state Citize n without assent and nexus. Without force being applied we give police agency permission to send corporate officers to our homes and schoolyard by contract , which are \"unconditional\" Maritime requirements at Rule 12. (b). Jurisdiction over your \"personam\" requir es assent by \"devise\" so we do not wiggle. Subsequently agency units, contracts with police power of 14th Amendment \"due process\" to \"gang sweep,\" \"profile\" and declare state Citizens \"persons of interest,\" and charter agency to take your pet ferret. Statutes charter agency \"makes\" police power to issue \"obligation\" \"certificates,\" which are \"negotiable\" in the sow' s ear Tribunal. W-4 is such an instrument, as is bank accounts, presentments, selective servi ce, jury duty summons, and drivers' license and school enrollment. These are only a few of the many heads of the statute Beast \"Penumbra Doctrine.\" Black's Law 5th. Penumbra Doctrine. The implied powers of the federal government predicated on the necessary and Proper Clause of the U.S.Const., Art. I Sec. 8 (18) permits one implied po wer to be engrafted on another implied power.

We Thee People give that power at signature assent and th ereby contract our silk purse state Sovereign \"personam,\" to in personam U.S. Citizen at \"domestic product\" \"action.\" Congress gave us the choice, as God does , and we contracted our children into \"forum\" public schools. Article I Legislative is firmly \"engrafted\" to Article II Executive/Admiralty. The \"devise\" are \" unconditional\" \"negotiable instruments\" signed by you and executed by Execut ive/Maritime Law and sister Heads of Penumbra \"inferior\" Tribunals that brings police power to the schoolyard by contract. We collect the \"engraft\" sow's ear by ag ency fiat of \"unconscionable\" contract, license, and enrollments. The signing at UCC 3-104.1, which if \"unconditional\" at UCC 3-104.2 gives agency police power to access your prop erty by executing negotiable \"dishonored\" instruments of \"promise\" per UCC 3-104.3. This power does not extent to the shopping mall, be cause not all Citizens are contracted in the same permissive manner and street citizens wiggle more than contracted children with parental consent to use \"p ublic policy,\" as protective \"devise.\" No Citizen may sign an \"unconditional promise\" without waiving Rights and becoming in personam to actions of non criminal issue. \"Without prejudice\" UCC 1-207 turns the sow's ear instrument into a silk purse for the state Citizen, because all Rights are reserved and in personam is restored to personam. A resident alien gets the sow's ear whether he wants it or not. He must assent to his master, as we must Obey God. God' s silk purse has the Choice. We must give credit to \"civil\" Law of man at Ar ticle I and use our \"reserved\" rights to God's Judicial law of Article III and Sepa ration of Powers to complete our work via Acts 22:25 and avoid Article II altogether. A \"centurion\" agent is on \"Notice\" that his jurisdiction extends to criminal matters only and teaching Truth is not an \"enabling cause\" for police power. \"Probable cause\" must be at action agai nst Paul of Tarsus, who was a \"natural born Citizen\" Art. 2, Sec 1, Cl. 5, of Rome. Today his Plea of Sovereign Covenant is called Habeas Corpus. We Thee People have this great power to defeat the same inferior and presumpt uous adversary. A crime requires the judgment of man based on God's Law. If the State is harm ed without victim, then Caesar is obvious with his elliptical manner and the tithes he seeks are not his. Judgment in a \"competent\" court of jurisdiction must reflect Truth. Knowledge of Law will assure Grace. A Grand Jury may summon a state Citizen with Police Power, which begins at \"probable\" cause. A U.S. Citizen may be \"held\" by \"devise\" of \"reasonable cause.\" An \"action\" in personam is stat ute and has no power over a silk purse,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Sponsored by: Solutions for Debts (310) 734-4284, All Rights Reserved W/out Prejudice, W/out Recourse.

The administrative record of \"inferior\" Tr ibunal in \"corporate America\" \"must\" be \"unconditional\" in personam to \"promise \" and must be Maritime in nature of contract. \"Navagatable waters\" take on a different meaning when on the \"highway\" \"cruisers\" violate the state Ci tizen's Right to free intercourse, by turning Liberty into license of sow's ear \"devise.\" God intended us to care for others an d knowledgeable operators of equipment are very necessary. We also must have insurance to protect our brother from errant behavior and accident. All I want to do is blend with the sow's ears, not become one. We state Citizens are not corporate until we sign the corporate license. I sign as a silk purse and agency cannot get confused or their interference is actionable under \"col or of Law\" statutes of Title 18. In Personam enlistment and swearing perj ury oath in ignoranc e is voidable, but YOU must rebut each agency individua lly, selective service may reappear and you can rebut the presumption of \"subjec t\" Citizenship. Enlistment requirements are the same as a negotiable W-4, merely sign unconditionally and it is a done deal, up to and including the \"promise\" at UCC 3-104.3 and \"scourging.\" The state Citizen is not \"made liable\" until signature upon an \"unconditional\" instrument at UCC 3-104.2. The best wa y is to write on the face of the enrollments or prima facie, Thee Reserva tion of Rights on the unit prior to signing it. You make agency wiggle that tail whilst it has it. Agent may also object to further violation of his \"unc onditional\" instrument being conditioned and snatch it from you. Knowing Thee Truth will make you \"meek\" and therefore not humbled. Cooperate with agency offi cers and sign all documents with Your Silk Purse personam intact, your Spirit will not worry. If I were Alpha wolf and you were Omega wolf: all you would have to do is roll over on your back, let me nip you in a co uple of my favorite places, don't dare bite me and I'll only \"make action,\" and I won't nip you too hard unless you try to wiggle, defend yourself, or spray me. This is why US \"sheep\" are alpha to th e omega wolf. Truth stands the middle of the two with shepherd's staff of authority. Jesus has allowed my pasture with the wolf, only because I am very humbly as wise as the serpent. News from the front is very promising, MPs everywhere, if only there were a few more sheep up here. A petition of \"persons\" will only \"give\" wh at Congress legislates as civil rights; a lot of sow's ear contracts, simmering in the old Dragon's milk of Admiralty.

Personam signature to an \"unc onditional\" agreement at UCC 3-104.2, while vital to the Military, is \"unconsci onable\" to the silk purse of the state Citizen.

We Thee People who sign \"unconditional\" agreements leave the s ilk purse open to the same Choice, mischief of Admiralty \"subject matter\" only court. After signature you have no freedom of Choice until you personally void the instrument. Agency is the \"cruiser\" of choice for Admiralty, for the sow's ear cannot admit its \"engrafted\" police power upon the silk purse. Instead fraudulent license \"devise\" is used as presumed mandate to action force, until rebutted. Legislative Acts are Sister \"implied powers \" at \"unconditional\" \"engraft\" contract of \"Penumbra Doctrine.\" The \"in personam \" or possession of the \"person\" who is being sued by a sow's ear contract in Admiralty, are now termed \"person of interest\" by \"reasoned cause\" and \"made liable,\" because it is easy for agency to use the Dragon's elliptical words with \"public policy\" blessing, because we \"volunteered.\" When the citizen perjures th e oath, it is \"made\" a \"criminal\" act by agency. There is no amount of lipstick that will cover that kiss. Signature of the personam to agency is assent of a free Citizen \"person\" and gives the court jurisdiction to do in personam action when silk purse \"dishonors\" a \"promise\" under penalty of perjury. \"I n personam\" jurisdiction cannot be had when Rights are reserved and Federal Rule 12. (b) may supply Remedy. We should never perjure our flag, but the Federal flag has its place and the republic flag has my silk purse. An immigrant becomes a Citizen of the United States by signature to an \"unconditional\" document. The \"person\" is sworn to oath and allegiance and becomes in personam or possessed by hi s new \"master,\" Article I Legislative and \"forum\" Admiralty of Article II. This has become the executive master to us all, because both the wolf and Thee Sheep covet sow's ears. We Thee People are Alpha with Truth of Law and the stranger must absorb the nips.

II, Sec. 1, Cl. 5. If you moved to France, you would be an in personam subject citizen. The immigrant is now an \"artificial\" citize n and \"person\" of the 14th Amendment and \"subject\" of this \"New Cove nant\" Nation. Their rights are \"fair and impartial\" due process of statute Article I and other \"civil\" Liberties. Corporations and municipalities take si milar oath and sign \"unconditional\" documents and are \"artificial persons\" by contract. Agency \"persons\" birthright is Legislated Statute staple to the 14t h Amendment due process and civil right Liberties. \"Subject\" Citizens consent to Legislation and become \"persons\" of subject matter only jurisdiction and agree to be policed by \"public policy,\" this is not the yoke of a Freeman. The \"unconditional\" signing gives agency ex ecutor \"power of attorney\" to \"act in your stead\" when issue arises at admi nistrative \"dishonor or execution\" of contract. If the issue is \"dishonored\" by the contracted Citizen and cannot be resolved, an Article I agency Tribunal will hear the \"subject matter\" dispute, IF Magistrate has the TWO jurisdictions re quired for \"competent\" Tribunal. The most important ONE is in personam, which represents to the world that another silk purse Sovereign has fallen to the wolf. Black's Law 5th. Subject matter. Nature of cause of action, and of relief sought. The 2nd required jurisdiction is su bject matter, which depends upon the \"subject\" status in personam for suit of negotiable contract, and its material of situs. Agency \"must\" follow the \"charter\" of its maker in exercising its \"implied\" and \"inferior\" police power for it is limi ted to \"subjects\" by signature to their sow's ear contract. If the proper \"subject\" Citizen is on the Administrative record with assent to Maritime contract, there will be no need for a \"crime\" to have been committed or \"probable cause\" for indictment and warrant, the sow's ear will do just fine with \"subject matter \" \"information\" of \"public policy\" only. \"Without\" personam, We Thee People Stand next to the soldier, salute smartly and take our leave, only with permission. State Sovereign Citizens are \"entitled\" at Art. IV, Sec., 2, Cl. 1 to demand Article III Judiciary if the \"answer\" to agency \"presentment\" is \"timely, on point,\" \"without dishonor,\" or other \"a ffirmative defense.\" The Separation of Powers protects the silk purse at \"reserva tion\" of Rights as \"the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspende d,\" Art.

A moth to this flame is just as \"dead in law.\" It does not matter at this po int which birthright is before the Tribunal, all US silk purse Citizens and strangers sign the same sow's ear contracts. Agency mischief is \"without\" our personam if we contract with \"condition.\" Having a license to do or not to do a \"thing\" has \"made liable\" Sovereign personam to in personam \"action.\" If you put a \"condition\" such as \"Without Prejudice\" UCC 1-207 above your signature on the license, W-4, 1040, ferret bill of sale or bank account you \"reserve Rights\" to your personam and the Tribunal is \"without in personam jurisdiction\" per Rule 12 (b), the issue is abated, and is as \"dead in law\" as the moth. You are non-assumpsit and did not \"promise\" to appear, for a \"condition\" must not be written upon the instru ment, Thee condition makes a unit non- negotiable. Nature of subject matter is Article I stat ute and for \"facts,\" there is no better place. The IRS alone will smother a citizen with facts. Civil law uses devise, presumption, voidable contract, and st atute police powers if Rights are not reserved. An \"action\" cannot be brou ght against a knowledgeable \"Personam\" \"within\" Thee Bill of Rights unless \"criminal intent\" is probable in cause. When a state Citizen becomes a soldier he /she gives up the Bill of Rights by signature to an \"unconditional\" contra ct, which is not \"unconscionable.\" The document gives agency \"in personam\" pers onal \"promise\" to be \"made liable\" as the W-4 negotiable instrument also pr esumes. You may rebut the presumption of the W-4 by reserving your \"entitled\" Rights to exemption. The sow's ear instrument may be \"sued out\" to compel performance of obligation, and you are now a sworn \"thing in action\" as a \"subje ct\" U.S. Citizen. The crime committed is \"dishonor\" or failure to pay under penalty of perjury to follow oath and \"promise.\" Municipal police power is the sa me incorporated \"public policy\" oath of jus civis.

In its usual sense, to entitle is to give a right or legal title to. (cite omitted) To \"give\" a right would be Legislative Civil Statute of 14th Amendment. A \"reservation\" of rights \"represents\" pe rsonam and \"legal title to\" Article III Judiciary, a U.S. Citizens does not. The sow's ear was just a curly tail before the 14th Amendment. Supreme Cour t and its \"decision\" play the curly tail over Thee Silk Person of Dred Scott. This decisi on dealt a \"presumptive\" blow to state Citizenship, which has forever suffered th e \"Penumbra\" glare of its \"devise\" at Law. The silk purse must commit a \"crime\" \"int entionally\" and have an actual silk purse \"victim\" and Thee People must \"i ndict\" the errant brother, prior to incarceration if the issue were \"crimina l.\" The sow's ear agency of State cannot be a victim and use police power to su mmon the silk purse \"without right.\" Agency use of presumptive \"delict\" and po lice powers is the blood of the sow's ear, and yet NO foundation. Truth cannot be \"made,\" and the false teachers are found. The \"Privileges and Immunities\" of a state Citizen's silk purse is enumerated in the Bill of rights.

The Sovereign of Man awaits obedience of Law. The Shepherd must depend upon Law for His lost Sheep . The flock is precious an d the good Shepherd must take authority with a little salt to find th e words to heal an issue of Law. Many of the lost have simply too much worry for the Shepherd and seek counsel elsewhere. Teaching is as easy as ta king ignorance to \"want\" of knowledge. Truth is the only proper derivative of Law, and must always be at quest, least the Sovereign Church loose sight of the old Dragon. A soldier's choice to give up his person am to the Executive Branch and become \"Government Issue\" is a voluntary act. Soldier in personam and Article III are no longer married, for his waived Bill of Rights is now diverse with U.S. Citizenship by Article II Maritime Contract Law. The soldier has a silk purse contract because his \"in personam\" knows what a soldier's duty is. After the discharged soldier signs civilian \"unconditional\" instruments \"without\" his state Citizens hip, he gets the sow's ear cluster, Penumbra. He has waived state Citizenship for U.S. Citizenship without knowing what he has done. A passpor t would contain the \"silk purse\" name, as a U.S. Citizen, a W-4, application for employme nt or license would not, because you waive state Citizenship upon assent to the sow's ear if you do not reserve Rights. The \"writing\" at UCC 3-104.1 \"must\" be \" unconditional\" at 3.104.2 to sustain a \"promise\" at 3-104.3. Prima facie \"Conditi on\" provides Remedy. Agency fails to disclose the waived status of your \"perso nam\" state Citizenship. The \"negotiable instrument Law\" is \"Registered\" Federal Agency Law and it is also state Citizen friendly, because \"liability\" is limited to \"subjects\" only per \"immunities and entitlement,\" which is why it is Law of Thee People.

Many states have adopted the Uniform Code of Justice, and others have adopted acts su bstantially following the Uniform Code.

The Admiralty flag is very obtuse and because the Tribunal is using its \"devise\" to its comfort, it must have your uncondition al signing or jurisdiction cannot be \"made\" at Rule 12 (b). \"Substantially following\" the Admiralty Code, has led to state Citizens being assigned as \"person of interest\" in gang sweeps and medicine being withheld without prop er \"indictment.\" Only the Beast has moaned for victim cannot be found least we forget the sick and our ferret friends. Schoolyards are a natural ground for s ilk purses to gather in knowledge. Enrollment to the sow's ear allows sist er Penumbra to use its implied police powers under \"devise\" contract at the public school enrollmen t. The same silk purse from the \"gang sweep\" cannot be a \"thing in action \" at his home or on the street without \"probable cause.\" The sch ool children are in a \"public policy\" playground and easy to catch and are co ntracted \"birds of a feather.\" What victim or \"crime\" deserved the sow's ear?

Jurisdiction of agency is confined to sow's ear subjec t matter and U.S. Citizens. Reasonable cause is merely a step up the chain of Admiralty when a state Citizen may be held as \"a person of interest.\" All U.S. Citizens are under contract and oath.

The Citizen \"assigns the nature\" of remote \"devise\" to agency as \"in personam\" and becomes actionable by a ssent and possession to police power. Acts of Law are anything the Citizen sign s, which \"made liable\" his \"obligation of contract,\" or confiscation of his ferret \"within\" the Article II forum, even at parole, taxation, or garnishment.

The Civil Procedures may ONLY sue an Article III citizen if he gives them permission, volunteers, waives or sign s an instrument he knows full well is worthless to him and his children. I lik e the \"QUASH\" word because it voids negotiability of \"unit.\" Black's. Quash. To overthrow; to abate; to vacate; to annul; to make void; e.g. to quash an indictment. This is what happens to civil laws, they break apart when we advise agency we are a diverse class of citizen and we do not wish to be \"subject\" to the same \"public policy\" as an \"artificial subject matter\" corporate citizen. This act does not make us different as Nation, but We Thee People are inherent. The Bill of Rights and the Article III Power of Judi ciary are declarations of personam.

Motor vehicles, school app lications etc., give agency the \"implied power\" to \"presume\" we have waived our \"personam\" or personal rights. All this mischief makes for a bad handshake. Such action \"activity\" takes place in Maritime jurisdiction. Subject matter and in personam jurisdiction at Rule 12(b) are certified and \"make liable\" all soldiers and \"persons\" of artificial creation. We give agency permission to pry into Gods word for the elliptical blue smoke they think they have found to cover our eyes. Maybe that is why the lady at the courthouse is blindfolded. When we ta ke the \"New Covenant\" path, that lady wont need the sword. Generalship is wh ere that sword comes to play and We Thee People have the political savvy to bring all to Gods Law and Sovereign Covenant. Thee People have just as much trouble in the mirror of the 14th Amend. The inferior courts assault on the Bill of Ri ghts is more devise domestication than Law. The Bill of Rights stands untouched by civil rights. Civil Libertarian rights allow subject matter citizens to express th eir \"actions\" by using the Bill of Rights for only a few issues, which favor their de fense. I think this is subterfuge to cover the overall subjugatio n of We Thee People into Maritime jurisdiction. Black's. Artificial person. Persons crea ted and devised by human laws for the purpose of society and the government as distinguished from NATURAL persons. Corporations, Citizens born in Washington D.C., fore ign residents and lawyers are examples of created persons. These \"persons\" are \"made\" and \"liable\" if their \"sworn\" \"agency\" duties do not fo llow proper statute procedure of their contract or dishonored promise to do or not to do a thing. Persons who are created by devise for the purpose of so ciety and government, as distinguished from natural persons shows that Diversit y of Citizenship would not be necessary if all persons were free, but alas some are subject and made liable to contract.

A produced belief that lies on presumption is sufficient as \"subject matter\" and \"personam\" are waived in ignorance at signing. Black's. Resident alien. A resident alien is a \"person\" within the meaning of the due process and equal protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. C.D.R. Enterprises, Ltd. v. Board of Ed, of City of New York, D.C.N.Y., 412 F.Supp. 1164, 1168. When you sign contracts into the very same school, license, bank, and forums artificial citizens sign, then the same \"domestic product\" st atus applies to you and your children. The resident alien may only rely upon the 14th Amendment and there is no mention of Law or the B ill of Rights. Once again, the reason is because there are separate Citizenship Ri ghts. Which would you prefer, taxes or ferrets? Black's. In Personam. Against the person . The action in personam is that by which we sue him who is under obligati on to us to do something or give something. A personam right is your personal atta chment to the Bill of Rights. In most issues the violation for which you are be ing \"held\" (5th Amen d.) had nothing to do with any of the Bill of Rights. Most are police power of Maritime instruments signed voluntarily. A state Citizen violat ion must be of \"criminal intent\" and indictable at probable cause, or you ha ve waived your personam by contract. The same way the soldier voluntarily join s Admiralty. Subject matter persons do not have the right to personam jurisdic tion. They are already liable by their negotiable presents and contracted to do business with the \"masters\" of court. Subject matter and in personam Maritime ju risdiction are all that is needed, to obligate school children, the alien citizen, ignorant state Citizen and the soldier at Rule 12(b). The school child and stat e Citizen share the same status, both waived Rights voluntarily, for \"unknown benefit\" and suffered the loss of their Sovereign Flag. Black's. Subject Matter Jurisdiction. Term refers to courts competence to hear and determine cases of the general cla ss to which proceedings in question belong; the power to deal with the ge neral subject involved in the action. Standard Oil. v. Montecat ini Edison S. p. A., D.C. Del., 342 F.Supp. 125, 129. A soldier, alien, and corporate subject ar e of \"general class\" and the court must determine if the person can be tried und er the statute before the court. The unprotected contract raises its ugly he ad to darkness once again.

The courts \"hearing\" gets much be tter when we declare our entitlement of \"personam,' Preamble \"state Citizen\" and not liable to any of the \"implied Powers\" unless we assent to \"benefit\" of protection. The Federal Civil Judicial Procedure and Rules book, Rule 12(b). Defenses and Objections; (b) \"...the following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter. (2) lack of jurisdiction over the PERSON... A motion making any of these defenses shall be made before pleading...(h) (3) \"Whene ver it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lack s jurisdiction of the SUBJECT MATTER, the court shall dismiss the action.\" A court would not have jurisdiction if you would not sign unconditional obligations voluntarily. An Article I Brady Bill, Patriot Act, A.T.F., F.B.I., I.R.S., Courts Martial, or D.E.A. have jurisdiction over their subjects ONLY in an Article II \"inferior court.\" A state citizen is enti tled to \"probable cause\" with \"criminal intent\" and warrant prior to arrest. Declar ation of entitlement is issue of Article III, Judiciary. Actions for artificial pers ons are tried in the Article II court of Maritime jurisdiction, a state Citizen must have been \"made liable\" per dishonored instrument to be at action or assent tacitly. Both personam and subject matter issues are to be asce rtained prior to \"pleading,\" at the Administrative level. A court appearance a ll but assures jurisdiction if allowed to go that far without reserving your pe rsonam. \"Without Prejudice\" UCC 1-207 gives the court NOTICE that you are exercising \"REMEDY\" available at the Common Law and the Code \"must\" now be construed in \"HARMONY\" with the Common Law at UCC 1-103.6. Black's. Unconstitutional. When the legisl ation conflicts with some provision of our written Constitution, which is beyo nd the power of the Legislature to change. U.S. v. American Brewing Co., D.C.Pa., 1 F.2d 1001, 1002. Congress must \"make liable\" its subjects, for this is a necessary function. The problem is, most of us get caught up in this \"domestic war\" and are surprised when our in personam is cuffed around ou r ankles. A court of foreign jurisdiction does not take kindly to the Constitution being brought up before their Mast. The Maritime beast will not survive a broadsid e of \"Without Prejud ice\" UCC 1-207 for it strips her of police power and captur es your state flag.

UCC 1-207:3 Sufficiency of reservation. An y expression indicating any intention to preserve rights is sufficient, such as \"without prejudice,\" \"under protest,\" \"under reservation,\" or \"with reservation of all our rights.\" The Code states an \"explicit\" reservation must be made. \"Exp licit\" undoubtedly is used in place of \"express\" to indicate that the reservation must not only be \"express,\" but it must also be \"clear\" that such a reservation was intended. The term \"explicit\" as used in UCC 1-207 means \"that which is so clearly stated or distinctly set forth that there is no doubt as to its meaning.\" UCC 1-207:7 Effect of reservation of rights . The making of a valid reservation of rights preserves whatever rights the person then possesses and prevents the loss of such right by application of concepts of waiver or estoppel... UCC 1-207:9 Failure to make reservation. When a waivable right or claim is invo lved, the failure to make a reservation thereof causes a loss of the right and bars its assertion at a later date... UCC 1-203:6 Common law - The Code is \"Complimentary\" to the common law, which remains in force except where displaced by the code. A statute should be construed in harmon y with the common law unless there is a clear legislative intent to abrogate the common law... \"The Code cannot be read to preclude a Common law action.\" Example: Your Honor, my use of \"W ithout Prejudice UCC 1-207\" above my signature on this document indicates that I have exercised the \"Remedy\" provided for me in the Uniform Commercial Code in Book 1 at Section 207, whereby I may reserve my Common law ri ght not to be compelled to perform under any contract, commercial agreemen t, or bankruptcy, that I have not entered into knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally.

The Sovereign Citizen may force th e court order a \"clean bill.\" States Citizen \"entitlement\" to Article III judicial is mostly waived by devise, fraud, duress or unconscionability. Personam is necessary to sever police action by signature or revocation on the volunt ary obligation.

I have heard the saying, \"the only things that are sure in life are death and taxes.\" I defeated both with God's blessing, the Biblical \"death\" and taxes. The W-4 signing is of a mutual benefit, wrong, government does not benefit by giving anything, sort of like the casino s in Las Vegas. Your unconditional W-4 gives license and permission to do, or no t to do a thing. Duress and coercion do not make a good hand shake at contra ct.

Permission by competent authority to do an act which, without such permission, would be illega l, a trespass, or a tort. I am sure you would be surprised to le arn that very few licenses are required under the common law. Those who have license to practice anything, drive, or fix boilers, may protect your property as license with a reservation of your natural Rights. A statute claiming to have power over a \"subject\" who does something that is \"illegal\" should not re present to the natura l Citizen that the issue is unlawful. We give the IRS \"per mission by competent authority\" to do something that would be illegal ot herwise, when we sign the W-4 unconditionally. The Citizen gives IRS licen se to in personam jurisdiction by signing the W-4 Maritime instrument unconditionally. Black's. Offer. \"A promise to perform is inferred if the offeree commences the undertaking.\" You are the one who fills out a contract and \"commences the undertaking\" of the W-4 whether required or not. Agency 's \"infer\" you will follow the statutory procedure prescribed and expectation mu st meet the terms or police power is activated. Presumption is all over the place. Problem is we never rebut the \"inference\" that a presumption exists . Helmet laws, jaywalking, selling personam firearms, dog license, and ferrets are illegal and considered contraband at \"possession,\" but not unla wful as property. These are adhesion contracts to your \"registered\" in pers onam and expectation of assent may be rebutted, which is a rare declaration by the entitled Citizen.

In ALL civil actions and proceedings not otherwise provided for by Act of Congress or by th ese rules, a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is di rected the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption, but does not shift to such party the burden of proof in the sense of the risk of nonp ersuasion, which rema ins throughout the trial upon the party on whom it was orig inally cast. Federal Evidence Rule 13. I am not at all sure you got that so I w ill presume to \"imply\" it . A civil action is an \"artificial issue\" with \"Implied Powers\" as force of police action at \"dishonor\" of promise. Acts of Congress cannot provid e rules of procedure for the citizen of Article III; those are inalienable and scribed Thee Ten Amendments. Rights enumerated in the Bill of Ri ghts are already in place; all your Personam must do is \"declare entitlement.\" Agency makes presentment and we have the burden of going forward with evidence of our not being \"made liable.\" The best proof is prima facie upon the original unit and you demand certified signature of obligation. A unit with reserved Rights prima-facie cannot be used as evidence in a Maritime jurisdiction tribunal, lest agency forget Rule 12(b). Reserve your rights and remember a st ate citizen cannot be sued unless he assents. Agency may impose obligations presumptively and you are not guilty until proven innocent in Maritime juri sdiction. When the Citizen refutes the issue, he trumps the burden of proof to agency. It is a violation of Law if you are \"subject\" and fail to pe rform as promised.

When you cannot predict contractual outcome of Federal Maritime jurisdiction, protect the Rights of your state Flag and Article III with Personam declaration. Go California! Yo ur state becomes your State when you contract with State Departments of Federal forum statutory creation, as subjects are required to do. The 14th Amendment due process of police powers and units of dishonor, are of Maritime ju risdictional obligations, and voluntarily assigns capture of your state flag upon unconditional signing. Agency failed to disclose this Penumbra as part of your subjugation and you have the Right to revoke the negotiability of the unit at any time. Fraud cannot hide behind \"color of law\" and non disclosure. Black's. In propria persona. In ones own proper person. It was formerly a rule in pleading that pleas to the jurisdiction of the court must be plead in propria persona, because if pleaded by attorney they admit the jurisdiction, as an attorney is an officer of the court, and he is \"presumed\" to plead after having obtained leave, which admits the jurisdiction. Personam is your treasure of Rights wh ich was created as a temple for God to judge the sins of it. Propria persona is your Personam, standing before the court and challenging jurisdiction over your pe rson to obligation presented by agency. Reality of Truth gives authority to speak, but silence is best until the adversary has been delivered. My Personam dares not make a step or sign a contract without Counsel. Jesus warned about lawyer s and he speaks with \"authority.\" Penumbra has retained lawyers who us e statutory procedures and translate Executive Maritime jurisdiction as an \"offi cer of the court.\" Have no fear of these guys unless you rely on even one to kn ow Law. When the lawyer files papers with the court, you are no longer Personam, but in persona because you have agreed to terms per instrument devise and the lawyer is \"standing in your stead.\" The state Citizen must plead in his own state Citizen person. Only a sovereign citizen may enter a plea in a common law court or with \"competent state counsel.\" All pleas by the sovereign Citizen must challenge the jurisdiction over his PERSONAM or st ate citizenship person and the subject matter. Remember, an \"artificial person\" is a creature of State origin, and has no PERSONAM for juristic notice. An attorney knows only subject matter procedure and cares not about personam. He does not know Law and is an artificial citizen and cannot plea to th e common law. He can only represent others of his corporate status who hire him to \"stand in their stead.\" Lawyers are Executive forum officers of Maritime jurisdiction."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Sponsored by: Solutions for Debts (310) 734-4284, All Rights Reserved W/out Prejudice, W/out Recourse.

State v. Knight, 219 Kan. 863, 549 P.2d 1397, 1401. Now this is where the Truth is apparent. First of all a sovereign citizen needs no Law of notary at Deuteronomy 19:15 for the purpose of establishing \"notice\" of our intention to de-foliate their garden of dragon food. We give unconditional signature under penalty of perjury, which makes an excellent \"declaration\" and conveniently easy to \"confirm,\" when written upon the instrument at issue. A judge or artificial person \"must\" jump through many hoops of implied power before the ferret dies, go now and make that baby a proper ty issue.

If the citizen ignores the instrument, ticket, summons, or 30-day notice it becomes negotiable, because you have \"dishonore d\" a \"unit\" demand for payment under UCC 3-504(1) after you promis ed to appear. I have used the following \"rebuttal\" to a debt I did not owe, and it has never failed me.

Do not trade barbs with collection agents over the telephone; force agency to mail yo u presentment, or facts of the matter stated. A couple of times the agency has sent again the instrument, usually from another agent, and I again respon d. This time with a UCC 3-505, which states; \"In order to protect himself, the party to whom presentment is made may require the following without thereby dishonoring the instrument.\" A copy of such form can be found within this writing. ONLY demand the information enclosed therein. It is a demand for the debt instrument containing your signature, without prejudice denies th e instrument life and police power which makes the unit \"dead in law.\" Someone \"must,\" sign under penalty of perjury that instruments of debt exist and proof mu st be certified by trier of fact before warrant shall issue. The agent must fu rnish reasonable identification. The Common Law sues the individual agent and not the \"whole world.\" Direct correspondence to a person if possible, the IRS usually does not put names on their presentments, but the paper work w ill have traceable numbers on them in case a John Doe is needed.

A presumption means that the trier of fact \"must\" find the existence of the fa ct presumed unless and until evidence is introduced which would support a findin g of its non-existence. UCC 1-201(31). What \"trier\" needs to hear is an affirmat ion of Truth as a rebuttal. No fact of debt exists if rights are reserved upon the instrument. Withou t prejudice is an \"affirmative defense\" and notifies agency of your \"entitlement\" to state citizenship and Article III Bill of Rights. The burden of proof has been rebutted for implied powers of agency to prove th e assumption of debt, claim, or use of police power.

The term \"complaint\" is used in the fede ral courts AND in all states that have adopted Rules of Civil Procedure. \"It may, however, be considered settled that letters or admissions containing the expression in substance that they ar e to be \"without pr ejudice\" will NOT be admitted in evidence... an arrangement stating the letter was without prejudice was held to be inadmissible as evidence ... not only will the letter bearing the words, \"without prejudice\" but also the answer thereto, which was not guarded, was inadmissible...\" Ferry v.

People v. Sourisseau, 62 Cal.App.2d 917, 145 P.2d 916, 923. Agency \"must\" prove probable cause at the administrative level, prior to court; because this is where Article III superced es any and all Article II implied power.

You may have signed the negotiable instrument and are now \"avoiding\" the consequences of the act. You definitely should not waive to contrary \"words of art\" or \"arbitrary and capricious\" obligation. Rules of another's court are more the reason to re main silent.

Twenty-five years of fighting facts came down to two words in Law; \"Without Prejudice,\" and Maritime juri sdiction has no claim to action.

Michigan Empl oyment Sec. Commission v. Patt, 4 Mich.App. 228, 144 N.W.2d. 663, 665. An enforced contribution using police power is manifest by the unconditional signing of subject matter forms to the de triment of your personam. We all work for a living and sign the instruments of our employers, which have \"made liable\" its employees by the implied legislativ e authority of taxation. The enforced contribution becomes \"declared\" uncon scionable and void when the signing contains a condition, which is arbitrar y to UCC 3-104.2 \"unconditional.\" Without prejudice UCC 1-207, written above your signature, vitiates the W-4 at perjury and the agent who dares an \"executor action,\" is personally responsible at the Common Law.

Department of Human Resources Development, 11 Cal.3d 313, 113 Cal.Rptr. 374, 380, 521 P.2d 110. Equity is a body of jurisprudence, or field of jurisd iction, differing in it s origin, theory, and methods from the common law; though pr ocedurally, in the federal courts and most state courts, equitable and legal ri ghts and remedies are administered in the same court. A state citizen is born under the Article III flag of a Judicial God. Article I devise of Social Security at state Citizen Bi rth engrafts police power of Article II Maritime jurisdiction.

Social Security was not contemplated in the Co nstitution but the IRS was. \"Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes.\" IRS is Legislative and agency activity within the Penumbra Separation of Powers grows fat as We Thee People watch our Flag being raided by our indi vidual ignorance. Article II Admiralty furnishes the IRS with police power of collection. Each Citizen must stand in Propria Persona or Article III will not hear you. Equity is an implied power of very presumptive nature and must have contractual nexus to the subject matte r for the most important part of a Maritime jurisdictional challenge, Pers onam. Fairness does not equal \"probable cause\" for the state Citizen But, if you do not reserve your Rights; you are not \"entitled.\" Black's. Equity acts in personam. Bouv ier's Dictionary of Law (1856): Courts of equity have concurrent jurisdiction in ma tters of account with courts of law, and sometimes-exclusive jurisdiction. In thos e states where they have courts of chancery, this action is nearly supersed ed by the better remedy which is given by a bill in equity, by wh ich the complainant can elicit a discovery of the acts from the defendant under his oath, instead of relying merely on the evidence he may be able to produce. 9 John.

Fitzsimmons v. New York State Athletic Commission, Sup., 146 N.Y.S. 117, 121. An imposition of restraint is not freedom. State Citizenship is being waived by most and enjoyed by only a few. The corporate citizen must take wh at civil liberties are offered, \"all else is reserved\" for those who are \"suitors\" entitled to Thee Bill of Rights. Agency cannot impose restraints on all to subjugate a few. \"P articular persons\" are residents of the 14th Amendment within your State and ar e contracted, sworn, and subject to domestic product restrictions. The state Citizen may declare entitlement of Liberty and not yoke of \"imposition of restraint.\" Political contracting to Penumbra engrafts from the \"four corn ers\" or \"intention of parties\" is negotiable. \"Unconditional\" units are yo ur restraints; reserve your rights! Black's. Term \"Liberty\" as used in Co nstitution means more than freedom of action, freedom to own, control, and use property, freedom to pursue any lawful trade, business or calling, and freedom to make all proper contracts in relation thereto.

You must individually declare entitlement to your Rights or loose th em to presumptive agency process. Black's. Presentment. The production of a negotiable instrument to the drawee for his acceptance, or of a promissory no te to the party liable, for payment of same. Presentment is a demand for a cceptance or payment made upon the maker, acceptor, drawee or other payor by or on behalf of the holder. UCC 3- 504(1). The IRS considers your cooperation a co ndition of employment because your employer is a corporate partner. IF you do not sign the W-4 non-assumpsit, by reserving your rights prima facie, you are also a partner in want of benefit. The W-4 is of IRS issue and your signature a ccepts, through a meeting of the minds, an \"offer\" and \"makes\" the instrument \"ind icia of title.\" By promissory note and oath, you are now \"made liable\" by contract. Your employer deducts the \"graduated income tax\" and the \"act ivity\" shows \"jurisdiction on the administrative record.\" If you do not pa y the correct amount or make an error the presentment comes. After all required warning and invitations to tax court have gone unanswered; dishonor, \"Notice of Lien\" and police power may rear its ugly head. Although the instrument is only notice, and not a \"true bill,' the employer feels duty bound and exacts yo ur \"obligation\" from your pay. This procedure is executed with your assent to an uncon ditional contract and the police power your signature actuates. Many Patriots are in prison at this writing because agency keeps its jurisdictional delict hidden within the administrative record.

Commercial paper. Bills of exch ange (i.e. drafts), promissory notes, bank-checks, and other negotiable instruments for the payment of money, which, by their form and on their face , purport to be such instruments. UCC Article 3 is the general law governing commercial paper. \"On their face purport to be\" non-negotiab le if \"without prejudice\" were on the face and which further declares notice of the unit's \"dead in law\" promise. The W-4 is a negotiable instrument at the \"unconditional\" signing, at UCC 3-104.1 and is a \"must\" requirement for its nego tiability. A condition on the instrument vitiates \"unit\" obligation and the polic e powers are without activation. The contract will not sustain the promise at UCC 3-104.3, for the unit \"must\" be \"unconditional\" at 3-104.2 to actuate perjury. Black's. Negotiable document of title. A document is negotiable if by its terms the goods are to be delivered to \"bearer, \" or to the order of a named party, or, where recognized in overseas trade, to a named person \"or assigns.\" Terms are settled IF, you reserve your Rights. \"Or, where recognized in overseas trade\" is Maritime jurisdiction. We Thee People must respect a commanded authority, but demanded lo yalty is bruising at my heel. This Truth stuff is much easier to und erstand and the best part is, God has given \"understanding\" of the words and I di dn't make anything up, save the silk purse, sow's ear and the old dragon. Black's. Negotiable words. Words and phrases which impart the character of negotiability to bills, notes, checks, etc., in which they are inserted; for instance, a direction to pay to A. \"or order\" or \"bearer.\" There are a few other words that matter for the instrument to be negotiable. MUST is real good but, UNCONDITIONAL is my personal favorite because the obvious happens; the CONDITION of \"repre sentation,\" of all your \"entitled\" rights may be written upon the face of the instrument, which makes the unit non negotiable \"by its terms.\" The state citizen may amend any contract he perceives as unconscionable.

Drivers licen se, banking, real estate, 1040, social security, taxes, insurance etc., all have yo u registered as promising to pay sister Penumbra and follow rules of procedure in the event of dispute. The great news is; it comes down to whether the agency is able to negotiate the instrument you protected and declared entitlement upon as your condition of accepting license or W-4. The ones you do protect will give you knowledge and generalship of future issues with others, or if you ch oose, assent to the obligation and partake of any benefit you may, it is your choice, at least for now. Black's. Negotiable instruments. To be negotiable within the meaning of UCC Article 3, an instrument must meet the requirements set out in Section 3-104: (1) it must be a writing signed by the maker or drawer; it must contain an (2) unconditional (3) promise (example: note) or order (example: check) (4) to pay a sum certain in money; (5) it must be pa yable on demand or at a definite time; (6) it must be payable to the bearer or to order; and (7) it must not contain any other promise, order, obligation, or powe r given by the maker or drawer except as authorized by Article 3. For your W-4 to be a negotiable note, it \"must\" meet the abov e requirements or it is not a negotiable \"unit.\" When te rms are met within any business sense, there is a meeting of the minds. Our political entity has decided that the contract is good or bad and we sign, mo st of the time, without a representation of rights to declare our Personam signatur e. The Code requires a contract to be on \"unconditional\" terms, which is unco nscionable, for We the People have the right to \"Obligate to Contract\" or not. An artificial citizen per statute must sign unconditionally. Your promise to pay has b een cast into stone after signing, or until you realize your ignorance and revoke promise by affidavit to in personam relief. The instrument \"must not contai n any other promise or power.\" The IRS will surely not enjoy your Common Law reservation of rights written across the W-4, but alas, they are helpless. Neit her are Common Law Trusts taxable, BUT you MUST know at least this material before you rely on any Common Law Trust. A foundation of knowledge must co unsel or you may be measured for an \"agency ankle bracelet.\" W-4 \"must not contain any other promise\" and must not be authorized when a \"condition\" of \"without prejudice\" is prima facie upon the instrument. Neither your employer, nor the agent may change any item, for the unit is worthless, and no action up on your personam may be certified. \"It has been held that one may buy his peace by compromising a claim which he knows is without right, Daily v. King, 70 Mich. 568, 44 N.W. 959, but the compromise of an illegal claim will not su stain a promise.\" Read v. Hitchings, 71 ME 590.

These works cause a Tr uth virus to spread among agents, if one hair of your head is harmed, Ti tle 18 and 1983's will issue to all who \"action\" with \"color of Law.\" Black's. Payable to bearer. A negotiable instrument is payable to bearer when by its terms it is payable to (a) bearer or the order of bearer; or (b) a specified person or bearer; or (c) \"cash\" or the order of \"cash,\" or any other indication which does not purport to designate a specific payee. UCC 3-111. Your W-4 is negotiable and in the hands of bearer. It becomes payable when the terms are met or from \"the order of be arer,\" for non-payment or dishonor. Liens, summons, tickets etc., are of this type. Orders from be arer are easy to obtain with facts, presentments, appear ances or not appearing at all. All the judge needs to see from plaintiff is if the instrument is negotiable and you did not pay it or make arrangements. Failure to appear becomes a criminal issue from a civil cause and off you go to ig norance and very poor generalship. The IRS does not go to court to issue orders. They have special treatment from their own Article II \"implied power\" court. The UCC protects Maritime jurisdiction and prompt payment is demanded from all who \"promise\" and thereby \"made liable\" in personam. We Thee People must gain the knowledge God intended in order to make these very complicated instruments \"dead in law\" by having no standing therein. The instrument is payable if by \"its terms\" you sign unconditionally. We Thee People cannot be forced to sign an unconscionable document for there is no activation clause for slavery."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Sponsored by: Solutions for Debts (310) 734-4284, All Rights Reserved W/out Prejudice, W/out Recourse.

A state as sovere ign has no capacity to be sued except in cases in which it has consented. The \"State of California\" is sovereign only to its \"resident citizens\" of the 14th Amendment, and State is protected at contract enforcement. A state Citizen may sue after they have notified activi ty agent of their representation of entitlement at \"without prejudice.\" The state agent gives permission for a suit when your state rights have been violated, after your representation of \"notice\" or \"without prejudice.\" Black's. Standing to sue doctrine. The requ irement of \"standing\" is satisfied if it can be said that the plaintiff has a legally protectable and tangible interest at stake in the litigation. Guidry v. Roberts, La.App., 331 So.2d 44, 50. Your unconditional W-4 is protected by contract and is tangible. The \"Standing Master\" of the court will give the collector s their next duty, which is seizure. If your W-4 represents your entitlement to Article III, a judge will never see it because he would not have jurisdiction. Black's. Standing is a jurisdictional issu e which concerns power of federal courts to hear and decide cases and does not concern ultimate merits of substantive claims involved in the action. Weiner v. Bank of King of Prussia, D.C.Pa., 358 F.Supp. 684, 695. The \"implied\" power of federal courts take s them as far as the Constitution will allow. There is no amount of voting or petition by any Citizenship status or Congressional Act, which will amend a B ill of Rights. A Federal Executive officer or lawyer will sue a ferret, just to prov e he has the power of obligating you to participate. He will then send you a pr esentment and force you to pay for the service. Reserving your Rights to proper ty will change this scenario to squeaky toys all around. Enjoy your ferret; the little guys are as free as you are. Black's. Standing orders. Rules adopte d by particular courts for governing practice before them. In some states, th e presiding judge has authority to adopt standing orders for his court alone. They may include rules as to the time at which court commences each day, a proc edure for requesting continuances of cases and a method by which cases are plac ed on the trial list of the particular court. They may be system wide or affect only a particular court in the system. This is beginning to feel more like, co urts-martial. Adopt is the \"engraft\" of Penumbra. The \"inferior\" courts of most states have adopted the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and engrafted Code of Military Justice, which has secured survival of Penumbra.

Norton v. Shel by County, 118 U.S. 425, 6 S.Ct. 1121, 30 L.Ed. 178. \"Officer de facto\" includes on e whose duties of office are exercised under color of election or appointment by or pursuant to public, unconstitutional law, before same is adjudicated to be such. Platte v. Dort ch, 255 Ind. 157, 263 N.E.2d 266, 268. Public law concerns the relations of states to each other and sovereign private individuals whom domicile within. \"An Act of public law may be (1) general (applying to all persons within the jurisdic tion of the act) (2) local (applying to geographical area), or (3) special (relat ing to an organization which is charged with a public interest).\" No act, statue , or \"emergency\" can \"imply\" a \"power\" of jurisdiction upon a state Citizen after rights are reserved.

You are being assessed for bene fit or privilege at contract for presumed personal gain or benefit. Liberty to obligate is your Choice.

The Judiciary at Article III gives its inferred and \"implied power\" to the agency system of subjugat ed \"persons\" through Article II inferior courts, with \"negotiable units\" as prize. The doctrine of \"public policy\" is to seduce \"persons\" to \"engraft\" The Separate Powers as benefit by contracting in personam. We Thee People have given the Power of domestication to agency by our own individual ignorance and this ha s made agency fear no God or Law.

Th is \"color of law\" system exists at \"unconditional\" contract with those US Ci tizens whom reside within our separate Sovereign states. The military, postal workers, attorneys, municipal and court employees are of this artificial and sworn status citizenship. We Thee People are un-sworn state Citizens, but contract our political power foolishly and \"unconditionally,\" for fear of being misplaced and ridiculed as a \"belligerent\" Citizen. Federal jurisdiction breaches Thee Sovere ign state Citizen; by presuming we will not know the difference between our status and that of \"artificial\" US Citizen.

Edward Mandell House had this to sa y in a private meeting with Woodrow Wilson. Very soon, every American will be required to register their biological property in a National system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient system of pledging. By such methodology, we can compel people to submit to our agenda, which w ill affect our security as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency. Every American will be forced to register or suffer not being able to work and earn a living. They will be our chattel, and we will hold the security interest over them forever, by oper ation of the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactio ns. Americans, by unknowingly or unwittingly delivering the bi lls of lading to us will be rendered bankrupt and insolvent, forever to remain economic sl aves through taxation, secured by their pledges. They will be stripped of th eir rights and given a commercial value designed to make us a prof it and they will be none the wiser, for not one man in a million could ever figure our plans and, if by accident one or two would figure it out, we have in our arsenal plausible deniability. After all, this is the only logical way to fund governme nt, by floating liens and debt to the registrants in the form of benefits and privileges. This will inevitably reap to us huge profits beyond our wildest expectations and leav e every American a contributor to this fraud which we will call Social Insuranc e. Without realizing it, every American will insure us for any loss we may incur an d in this manner; every American will unknowingly be our servant, however be grudgingly. The people will become helpless and without any hope for their re demption and, we will employ the high office of the President of our dummy corporation to foment this plot against America.

A municipal bounty was issued for my driver 's license because it is a \"prize\" in Admiralty. I have not paid bail because I want to be tried and found guilty first. Without criminal intent I cannot be tried, so agency plays the only game they can by offering commercial forum redress. They wait and see if you know that you can sue the individual agent demand ing money after you asked for a copy of the debt instrument. The IRS operates the same way. You pay the \"debt\" first and when you loose they have guaranteed compliance. Contract clauses with waivers, is the only way this happens. In this case it was for the lack of the public obligation to license. The summons was made \"dead in law\" by my signature and representation . I did not go to court.

The agent w ill then need to swear an oath that the presentment is a legitimate \"true bill, \" or find another fool who will commit perjury to do so. The Common Law does not sue out the entire state or agency, it becomes more personal and the agen t must use great caution. The next presentment may be a request for confirma tion of your \"protest\" or any other subterfuge indicating agency does not understand your demand.

Paul used his knowledge of \"competent Law counsel\" with Jesus to provide his \"sover eign Exemption\" at punishment of a victimless crime.

The State of Rome was demanding loyalty to the Pharisees so Paul would stop teaching, but Paul had his duty to perf orm in Jesus name and he stated the words of his Sovereign Counsel. The burden of proof was put upon Paul as it is to this day at Law of presumption and inferior courts of the IRS type agency.

Diversity status is of a Preamble citizen born in a Republican free state with Th ee Bill of Rights and Article III Judiciary as intercede when not waived per cont racted police power. Alien status is contractual United States citizenship at Article I/Legislative and Article II/Executive Admiralty and Article1 Sect ion 8 Clause 17, which overshadows even the most wary of Patriots. U.S. Citizens are registered with the government and are \"artificial,\" corp orate and subject to their master, Congress. These \"persons\" are transient from other Nations and joined at the Admiralty flag, as is a soldier, per contract. Your local bank, stocks, insurance companies, real estate, motor vehicles, fishing license, wills, HMO's, ferret hunter s, police state officers and your child's school, claim you as U. S.

The difference being, Article III Judicial and Thee Bill of Rights are individual, personal Rights.

Our prime political goal at blending with the wolf is the knowledge of the serpent. Is the signing an intentional act or brought upon by duress and, or fraud? The signing is presumed to be a voluntary meeting of the minds, on terms and conditions of the issue. Our jobs, drivers license, bank accounts, contractors license and even enrolling our children in school, is hazard ous to our Rights, and waivers abound thereto, because we are ignorant at ag ency compliance and tolerance is tacit agreement. The W-4 is the best contract of this sort to explain. Who, in their right mind would sign such an agreement in the fi rst place? You and I, every day of the week, engage agency with our suffrage in ignorance an d the inevitable outcome is tribute. The W-4 is the negotiable unit, which gives agency in personam possession obligates for tax purposes. This type of contract is duress and unconscionable in any court at UCC 2- 302. With that, consider UCC 3-104.2, which insist the signing be \"unconditi onal,\" because a condition of without prejudice would vitiate perjury, and will not sustain a \"promise\" of obligation at UCC 3-104.3. The signing \"Without Prej udice\" UCC 1-207, directly above our signature would then be a non-assumpsit, which avers, \"he did not partake\" of the unconscionable act.

If you do not answer properly with all Rights reserved, land , taxes, summons an d other notices are put into effect. It's all in the language of compliance or \"tacit\" non-compliance. Doing nothing will also allow agency a ccess to your sovereign status. Remember justice is both blind and being mugged constitutionally.

Article III, only comes into play when a Sovereign state Citizen asked for their Bill of Rights. Th ose who are successful in not waiving their rights at contract are fortunate an d will prosper. Those who do not refute the age old question of \"do you understan d the charges\" in a court of chancery, have in \"tacit\" agreed to tribunal jurisdic tion, when the \"answer\" yes, spouts the ignorance of their political values and Ci tizenship status. If we do not respond properly, we are bound by the presumption that we need agency to care for our daily needs and \"tacit\" admission that the court has the right to proceed, by pleading for us. Most of our Rights are contracted away and we do not notice the difference, because like begets like and who is the wiser. Within the District and Territories, th is implied power is 100% enforceable because the federalist has total control over \"subjects under the jurisdiction thereof,\" at 1-8-17 and the 14th Amendment. We Thee Pe ople are safe as long as we keep our right hand closed an d our personam remains intact. Federal citizens have not personam, because they owe their Citizenship and sovereignty to the government as their artificial \"maker.\" Their citizenship and allegiance is as a soldier, at contracted residence of US Citizenship, with \"subject matter\" jurisdiction being the only applicable \"remedy\" and ju risdictional challenge. A soldier has not the personam of character per contract, nor does the corporation. Facts of subject matter presume you were AWOL and it is up to the soldier to rebut. If asked, \"do you understand the charges,\" by a magistrate, the only proper response I can think of is \"N O\" \"Without Prejudice\" under Uniform Commercial Code 1-207, I wish to remain silent.\" A judge would be stepping on Holy Ground even if he asked you what the phrase means.

The cour t cannot proceed without personam and subject matter jurisdiction. The \"no\" also puts a wrinkle in the proceeding because if you do not understand the charges, they cannot be applied to you, because you have rebutted the presumptio n of acceptance of them via your citizenship or Lawful status. An artificial citizen may be charged with these codes and must comply by \"procedura l due process\" when \"answer\" is demanded. HOW HOW are We Thee People \"made liable?\" We sign \"unconditional\" contracts without \"representative\" signature and thereby fail to protect ourselves from avoidable controversy.

We have a job to do and now is the time to act like WHO we are and WHO our Sovereign representative is. A government, which is not of Thee People, cannot amend or properly teach its Law. The History of a Nation is only educational and has no value beyond its merit as a knowledge tool at our base. Base knowledge is our rock and God has given us the burden to understand the political building blocks of our indivi dual character and maintains Law of \"intercourse\" with mankind. Only then will love of our fello w survive us with posterity, or the corporate seductio n spirit will depriv e and predate our children's future. The Dred Scott \"decision,\" Jim Crow La ws, Civil Rights/Liberties and the 14th Amendment exist as examples of our being unfaithful to the God of this Nation by allowing its People to be subjugated and our punishment will be cast upon us through the actions of in personam ignorance.

If you are involved with the SALE of any of these items you may be taxed 100%, IF you are within the jurisdiction and subject to the corporate statute. For instance, the income tax on Sovereig n Citizens of these united States is omitted as law for it is a voluntary function authorized by \"public policy\" statute. The Brady Bill and subsequent gun Laws do not apply to the natural born when buying \"without\" the jurisdiction of licensed gun shops where \"stamps\" and information are required for subjects of statute.

Soldiers, bankers, IRS agents, and ferret killers ar e such subjects and appropriate taxes apply. No wonder they insist on the So vereign Citizen being subjugated, if they have to pay tribute it is easier to convin ce others. This can be done to creatures of a State who contract as corporate en tities, such as municipalities, schools, roads, post offices, 1040s, libraries and other National Citizens who seek \"due process of law\" per the 14th Amendment.

The best way I have found to get along with agency is to do as they say, well almost. Keep in mind that all documents are negotiable in one form or another. I like the form that makes the document non-assumpsit and \"dead in law.\" A contract is not negotiable if a condition is affixed \"on the face of it.\" Prima facie evidence is the best kind and cannot be disputed when \"without prejudice\" UCC 1-207 is written above your signature on any unconscionable contract you sign, and it is the first thing the tribunal sees at bar and affords the trier of fact a ffirmative \"notice.\" A proper reservation of Rights will not \"sus tain a promise,\" or perjury as found in Thee \"Without Prejudice\" treaties. Facts, which are \"within\" the instrument, do not apply to you if you stay \"without\" its terms. Personam is your individual close and cr eated Right of God to work as Covenant to His Law. A contract signing waives your right to divine intercede if you commit yourself to it, or allow assent to agency mischief and police power. These facts of in personam are the meat of IRS and other agency intimidation and \"mail box policy,\" of which now we know to rebut. If you do not sign knowingly, willingly, and intentionally you cannot be held to the letter of the agreement unless there is an \"accord and satisfaction.\" A simple rental agreement would be accord and satisfac tion, when all parties are happy and nothing is forced or unconsci onable at the signing. The W-4 is an opportunity to put at end this beast before it gets th e \"unconditional prom ise\" it needs to survive, and \"Remedy\" is Thee Law Staff that will scourge the old Dragon. Thee Truth is sometimes covered with the cloak of Law. When a situation occurs, and your Generalship is called upon, look at the contract. Revoke signatures so you can enter the issue with \"clean hands\" or abate its action. If there is no contract, or even if there is , sign the document before you \"without prejudice\" UCC 1-207 and mail it back da ted and signed certified mail. Put this directly upon the presentment, for it wi nds up on your administrative record which is brought forward by agency. If agency contacts you again write; \"I hereby refute the validity of your unattested presentment \"without dishonor ,\" I do not owe this money,\" without prejudice UCC1-207. OR, \"I hereby refute the validity of your unattested claim, without dishonor, I am not \"made liable.\" It takes agency a couple of letters for them to look up what you are saying, but one thing is certain, nothing can go to court unless the Administrative Record is clear of controversy.

Where an offer or admi ssion is made \"without prejudice,\" or a motion is denied or a su it dismissed \"without prejudice,\" it is meant as a declaration that no rights or privileges of the party concerned are to be considered as thereby waived or lost accept in so far as may be expressly conceded or decided. A signing of \"without prejudice\" entitl es the Sovereign Citizen to Thee Bill of Rights, which attach to his person or \"personam\" and those rights are not waived unless through actions on the part of the sovereign at a future date or a court decision in advance of your reservation. Your political knowledge must defend your contracting needs and all cont roversies must be settled with written correspondence. Youâre right to avoid co nsequences of statute or commercially assigned obligations put th e burden on plaintiff to prove his statements with verified or sworn instruments. Agency police power is voided upon notice of the \"personam\" Citizen. \"Probable cause\" rather than civil statute of \"rea sonable cause\" is required. \"Artificial\" \"persons\" who obligate to the subject ma tter instrument are \"made liable\" to its delict. An \"unconditional\" signing gives the agency court in personam and subject matter jurisdiction per Rule 12( b). Without prejudice reserves your personam and takes away the \"inferior\" court requirement, of having both subject matter and in personam jurisdicti on. The Article I court cannot judge an action until it clears the administrative le vel and has acquired both jurisdictions. Article III Judicial must try sovereign citize ns by design, after criminal intent has been alleged. Uniform Commercial Code 1-207. \"Per formance or Acceptance Under Reservation of Rights.

The use of the UCC is for those contracts, which are commercially forced upon the Sovereign Citizen and are essential for proper remedy at Law. The W-4, drivers licen se, bank, school and agency protective services are the presumptive contractua l systems and these are \"engraft\" of \"Penumbra Doctrine\" and the \"implied powers\" of Article I and Article II, which \"makes\" Admiralty, and puts you before th e \"inferior\" courts with the burden of proving innocence. Penalties of perjury are of criminal intent and must be protected or the adversity of the issue will apply via your waiver. Black's.

A contract signed under duress is unc onscionable and must be represented \"without prejudice\" or the instrument is treated as \"satisfaction and accord\" before the trier of fact. Black's. Unconcionability. Unconcionability is generally recognized to include an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties, to a contract together with contract terms, which are unreasonably favorable to the other party. Gordon v. Crown Central Petrol eum Corp., D.C.Ga., 423 F.Supp. 58, 61. Procedural advantages are granted to the executor, which allows facts agreed upon to be carried out, even police powe r of court. The only reason I signed a W-4 was to engrave without prejudice up on it. My job requires the W-4 form and the reservation brings peace to th e issue of being ex empt. Without the reservation, I would have been assessed a $500 frivolous penalty. My employer and the IRS are contracted entities and I do not wish to participate or \"benefit\" with them. Remember, the perjury portion is a statut e criminal matter. Once into the body of the contract, all corporate rights are protected and wiggling the facts are forbidden. The 5th Amendment cannot protect your waived rights, for court decisions advise the reservation must be made upon the instrument as a clear indicator of your intention. Your vo luntary act of signature without your representation is your cause of worry. Since there is no place in the 1040 to put a claim for defense, the Citizen must write their objections upon the \"unit\" or prima facie. The \"Privacy Act\" states that when a person is \"made liable;\" they are required to send a \"return or tax st atement.\" A reservation of rights breaks this \"made liable\" into Constitutional issues that the IRS cannot deal with.

All signings are voluntary and lawful, but the Sovereign ca nnot allow \"good faith\" alone to guide our political knowledge. When in doubt protect yourself at all times.

The mischief We Thee People suffer come s as assumpsit. Black's. Assumpsit. He undertook: he promised. A promise or engagement by which one person assumes or undertakes to do some act or pay something to another. It may be either oral or in writing, but is not under seal. It is express if the promisor puts his engagement in distin ct and definite language; it is implied where the law infers a promise (though no formal one has passed) from the conduct of the party or the circumst ances of the case. Duke v.Rogers, 67 Ga.App. 661, 21 S.E.2d 295, 297. The law \"infers\" a promise when it gives a child a social securi ty card at birth. When the conduct of the child has moved them out into the real world, their application to the system is \"express.\" Wh en the paperwork is signed, your child will toil as you have in this Promised Land. We Thee People must reserve our childrenâs rights from birt h, and at their school. Black's. Unconscionable bargain.

False. The word \"false\" has tw o distinct and well-recognized meanings: (1) intentionally or knowingly or neglig ently untrue, (2) unt rue by mistake or accident, or honestly after the exercise of reasonable care. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Adams, D.C.Mun.App.,37 A.2d 345, 350. You can see that it does not take much to sign an instrument incorrectly, and be fined by agency without proof of being guilty. The diffe rence is obvious only in the \"writing.\" Once you are inside the bo dy of the W-4 and have agreed to the amount of deductions and terms \"uncon ditionally,\" the waiver takes place because the unit has been \"executed.\" Without prejudice does not allow the \"execution\" of a contract and reserves your rights. Your reserv ation also puts a condition on the unit, vitiates its pe rjury and summary procedure which makes the unit non-negotiable and \"dead in law.\" Black's. Negotiable instruments. To be negotiable within the meaning of U.C.C. Article 3, an instrument must meet the requirements set out in Section 3-104: (1) it must be writing signed by the maker or drawer. The W-4 unit is required to be signed and delivered to sworn persons of Executive Branch Departments \"Penumbr a\" HEAD.

This not so innocent W-4 unit will \"engraft\" with other required instruments of on e type or the other as clarified in the \"Penumbra Doctrine\" and created de facto police power. The marriage between Article I and Articl e II is a convenience for the sovereign citizen because of the Separation of Powers. The W-4 is the vilest of the \"implied power\" forms. To be separate and not joined at the Flag, Congress at Article I nor Admiralty at Article II combin ed, can interfere with Article I Section 2 Clause 3; \"Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned.\" There is not a soul around who can help you with the mystery.

I think this odd, coming from Congress at Article I, but I am grateful to God for His Grace, because this appears to be the only way to reserve our freedom without contest. The W-4 is not viable unless you wish to have the agent deduct your social security. My next job will be to exclude a social security number on the same \"reserved\" unit.

Jesus illustrated God's power ov er mans civil lex law and demonstrated The Epistle of Grace to those who walk in the Path of Truth with Sovereign Covenant of thy Constitution of th ese united States of America. Truth at Law is the only counsel God will hear or minister. Our political contracts of presumption and words of art are of da rkness. We the People must beware of agency that would protect our children in a trusted schoolyard. Those who pray to thee with license of deliverance and protection are many of false teaching and yet beguile the little ones. Our Spirit recognizes Truth as conscious worry when an issue arises of which we have very little generalship knowledge. The more Law We the People translate to Trut h, the more Faith in God's promise and blessing of Peace and Grace are made apparent. Belief comes to many foreheads, but Fait h, only Thee One. We Thee People can believe there is a God and find a lesser without faith. Law and Thee Truth of it, gives faith at deliverance of thy Spirit to Jesus Christ. Faith in God goes before each of us as intercede at Law. Ye must \"ask\" for knowledge before we \"seek\" in ignorance, for we must not \"knock\" withou t faith in Truth. If we fail, ask again to seek knowledge and fear not the pray erful knock, but have respect of its Power.

Your lack of polit ical knowledge, in evidence, will give you up, for you did not seek Trut h. When Thee People allow th e flagram to fall, it is from the third party. Jesus did that al ready and this is th e reason we must realize how important and secure our Pr omised Law is. We must live together with the wolf and share God's bounty.

God Created Man and He Is Sovereign of my Rights and has jurisdic tion over my Spirit and its Works. The Constitution of these united States of Am erica is a wonderful place to start with counsel at Law. The instrument is the Law of The Land. Paul of Tarsus had a personal Covenant with Jesus from a close encounter and did not get one prophesy out of place. Paul taught The Gentiles the Sovereign Law of God and did his work well. There will be no predation on the Children whom Covet the seal of the Natural Law of God within their forehead. God's word stands with the Moses Sta ff as Law of the land. Jesus Truth and Grace hold the Shepherds Staff. We Thee People have the work of study to the Civil Law. The Reality of Christ in Law is our foundation and We Thee People will divine knowledge and posterity. We must understand better the vanity of Jezebel and its need for Greed through Power instead of Law. To follow a Third Pa rty whose soul is forfeit for lack of Law is folly. Jesus will not know us if we fail with this Truth. A further proof of covenant is found in the Uniform Commercial Codes. These Covenants have been torched by God to fulfill His purpose for the Gentiles and make excellent council against proclivit y of Third Party. When Sovereignty issues are questioned, the Mantel of the Codes is Article III and Thee Bill of Rights.

The reality of our political heritage ha s been waived to \"social engineering\" within our schools and \"corporate American\" standards of Democracy via statute Lex. Our parents, who were guided by theirs, accepted the gradual changes that domesticate our young today, and taught us the political standards of this generation. Licensed Ministers counsel and chartered church teach compliance and obedience for benefit and exemptio ns that are already granted by Our Father. The knowledge of these Truths ha s been besmirched by an educational system that has clouded our Natural Law with social engineering. Thee Rights that were hard fought through countless wars, have manifest to the destiny of Federalism. We Thee People have waived our Bill of Rights and \"Public Law\" of the individual state Citizen, to that of \"benefit\" at \"public policy\" and corporate statute staple for the masses. We are to be \"sheep among the wolves,\" not dinner, nor are we to be fleeced without consent, which we have given freely. To be good sheep we must be as \"wise as the serpent,\" not tribute for itâs den. In a fight you can only perform the way you are taught, for it is the only way you know how to protect yourself. If trained to lie down, you lay down beca use to struggle only tightens the bite. The Roman Lex system of law works in the same manner. We are taught early to be an obedient mass, rather than the proud People we are intended to be as individuals. Principals of \"corporate cu lture\" are a part of our daily lives. We have been put to trance by \"cries of th e people\" to the Beast. We have waived our Sovereign, God given Rights to greed and ignorance. The \"New Covenant\" of personal and inti mate standing with Jesus, has been made void by statutes of man. Prescrib ed codes of conduct produce prejudices to our brother.

It is our nature to get bored with ed ucational systems in the quest for Truth of Heritage at Law. Thee Truth shall set you free. This Generation has born itself \"subjec t\" to man instead of Sovereign God. The State educates all to honor statute systems and takes the Bible out of knowledge and removes the 10 Comma ndments from our courts.

If agency has a copy of an instrument of obligation, they must present it as satisfaction and accord or rely on you to dishonor. The well-placed UCC 3-505 puts proof to agency for contractual evidence of debt and if they do not respond properly or timely, you have \"agency by estoppel.\" \"Mail box policy\" is not part of the Chartered law of agency; it only seeks an answer or dishonor as proof of your belligerence. An answer would be like ad vising the court you had to work a jury duty day and could not comply with the order.
