For most readers, you may well be best off reading this as a sort of \"adventure novel.\" You can learn of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"some of the actual documents and procedures being used by many freedom fighters. If you were to actually use th ese documents and procedures you would probably be at substantial risk to chan ge your life in very major ways, some of which may be very unpleasant. The use of Commercial Liens as described in this manual is EXTREMELY high-profile. For mo st readers, it may be advisable to use some of the \"lower-profile\" applicat ions of Freedom Technology. Generally, we think that rather than fight existi ng systems it’s much more productive, useful, and exciting to create alternative new systems. This disclaimer is especially important, b ecause this is a relatively new strategy, and has not yet been subjected to a Supreme C ourt challenge. Until that takes place, the soundness of this strategy cannot be fully known. The Commercial Lien Strategy is still evolving, and new information is bei ng discovered daily. If you use this strategy, who knows? Your name may be on a fam ous Supreme Court case! Whether that prospect thrills you or distur bs you depends upon your outlook. These liens, because they are so powerful, should be treated with respect. We, at Build Freedom, do not advocate th e use of these liens agains t all government officials, nor to any official in particular. We honor the fact that there are many virtuous people in government offices, who are truly strivi ng to harm no one and to benefit as many people in society as possible. The liens described in this manual are not directed towards these harmless officials. Scope and Purpose of Manual This manual is an introduction and primer to the Commercial Lien Strategy. It does not pretend to be the final word on the subject. The authors and editors have synthesized material from several sources. We have organized it into a form that should be comprehensible to the average reader. After reading this manual, you will know the fundamental principles of this strategy. This understanding, plus the Bibliography in Appendix A , will allow you to do further research on your own. Some Notes on the Sample Briefs Included with this manual is an Appendix containing sample legal briefs, based upon actual examples used by others. You will have to reformat these briefs using your word processing software, and you MUST adapt them to your situation, and to the requirements of your state or locality. These are not and (in the natu re of things) cannot be \"f ill-in-the-blank\" forms. The Commercial Lien Strategy - Background Faced with corrupt lawyers and judges, no litigant can expect to win in court by simply playing defense. To beat them, you mu st be able to scare them. You must be able to make them respect you, and that mean s you must be able to take the offense — attack them personally. Unfortunately, judges, lawyers, and other gove rnment officials enjoy various levels of personal immunity provided by both law and \"professional courtesy.\" How do you sue a lawyer for malpractice? You hire another lawyer — if you can find one who’ll"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"take the case. How do you sue an IRS agen t for violating your Constitutional rights? Only with great difficulty. How you sue a judge for railroading you in court? You don’t. As a practical matter, private citizens can’t sue the President of the United States, a Governor, judge, or even an IRS agent for failing to obey or enforce the laws. If we try to sue in court to compel our governme nt officials to obey the law and perform their lawful duties, the judges routinely ignore our petitions and laugh us out of court. Because legal and de facto immunities shield government personnel from being sued for committing crimes against the People, th e public is legally disarmed, unable to aggressively sue the government or its agents and compel them to obey the Law. As a result, the public’s legal posture is funda mentally defensive: we try to duck, dodge, and hide in legal loopholes to defend ourselv es against the government and the courts. We try to escape, evade, and avoid, but we seldom counter-attack against our antagonists, largely because we think there are no lawful weapons to do so. However, it appears that a powerful o ffensive legal weapon may now have been discovered, tested, and proven for common Citizens — th e commercial lien. We don’t try to sue a government official for failing to perform hi s lawful duties. Instead, we simply file a lien that encumbers the official’s personal property and credit ra ting like a ton of bricks until he voluntarily satisfies our de mand to perform his lawful duty, and we, in turn, voluntarily agree to excise the lien. Some Examples of the Strategy Example 1 — Edward J. Wagner, an hourly, uni onized employee at General Electric, received Notices of Levy from the IRS, garnishing his wages and moneys received from several other sources. Wagner tried to persuade G.E. not to honor the Notices, since they were not properly attested as \"t rue bills of commerce.\" His efforts met with no success. After giving G.E. proper Notice and Demand, Wagner and his wife filed a Commercial Lien in the amount of $224,640,00.00. In the lien, Wagner impounded G.E. inventory that he had worked on (including air conditioning units, analyzing equipment, etc.) as security for the lien. This is similar to an auto mechanic impounding a car he had repaired (\"mechanic’s lien\"). This meant that G.E. could not lawfully sell or transfer the equipment until the lien was either extinguished or satisfied. Among the reasons for the high dollar amount are that the law allows for such high sums as rewards for damages incurred, a nd it generally has to be large enough in relation to the size of the company involved, to get its attention. Otherwise such a large company might just ignore it. Consequently, a legal war followed, and by June of ’92, G.E. had gone to court several times trying to remove Wagner’s lien, all without any real success. This was in spite of the fact that G.E. had the best, most highly paid, and highly motivated lawyers. In June of ’92, the first major victory fo r the Wagners came. The IRS issued four different official Releases of Levy, one to General Electric, plus three other places"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"where they had wages and income that the IR S had levied — the Port of Seattle, Dean Witter Reynolds, and Ohio State Life Insura nce Company. These effectively released the IRS’s attachment on the Wagners’ inco me and assets. That’s a pretty solid testimonial to the power of th e arguments in Mr. Wagner’s lien. Example 2 — In August 1992, Mr. Nelson Starr, who lives in Florida, filed a lien on several federal judges, the Commissioner of the IRS, the Attorney General of the United States, one or more U.S. attorneys fo r the Southern District of Florida, and several other individuals, in the amount of $350,000 on each individu al. The officials asked Mr. Alan Diamond, President of the Florida Bar Association, to inspect the lien and see if it was lawful or not. In spite of his desire to please his powerful friends, Diamond could find nothing illegal about the lien. In fact, in a swor n affidavit, Diamond d eclared that, \"...the document causes irreparable harm to the sy stem of the administration of justice. While some of the harm may be compensa ble at law, no degree of compensation will adequately remedy the damage to the appear ance of integrity of those named and of the system of the administrati on of justice. In my opinion, the filing of this type of lien is a direct attack on the justice system and on the general re putations of those named in the \"lien.\" It may negatively imp act on the financial credit rating of those individuals. It wi ll probably have a negative impact on their willingness to continue to serve as representatives of the United States. And, it cons titutes an abuse of civil process that cannot be adequately remedied by an action at law . [emphasis added]\" In plain English, Diamond did not like the lie n, but couldn’t find any way to extinguish it. Further, he seemed to say that these liens could drive public officials right out of office! For libertarians and patriots, that is a powerful endorsement! Example 3 - Another a man in Florida filed Commercial Liens against nine IRS agents and was later taken to court by the IRS agents’ wives . The wives tried unsuccessfully to remove the liens, becau se their credit cards had stopped working. The liens had compromised their credit ra ting, and they couldn ’t go shopping except with cash. Imagine the distress that the IRS agents themselves had to endure from their wives on account of these liens! Eviden tly, the liens hit the agents where they lived , in a way that other ac tions at law could not do. Example 4 - Perhaps the most imaginative use of the Commercial Lien Strategy is a lien by Mr. Phil Marsh of the Pilot Connec tion against the President of the United States, the U.S. Congress, the Federal Reserve, and the Commissioner of IRS on behalf of all 250 million Americans (see Appendix B.6 ). For each of the 250 million Americans, the lien demands $10,000. If the li en were enforced, it would mean the government would owe the people $2.5 trilli on, over half the annual Gross National Product. This \"class action lien\" will almost certainly never be enforced. However, if the courts find a way to extinguish it, it may have the effect of weakening the power of all liens (including the one the IRS files on us!). [ Editor’s Note: Everything in this manual is \"i nformation\" only, not legal advice. This caveat applies with particular force to Mr. Marsh’s lien. We present this lien as"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"an interesting and imaginativ e application of the Commerci al Lien Strategy, not as an \"endorsement.\" Build Freedom originally included Phil Marsh and The Pilot Connection on our list of sources. However, some of our customers be gan to complain about poor service, and some raised questions about the integrity of the group. Later, Marsh appeared on the television show 20/20 and vigorously denounced the IRS. Also, it appears that The Pilot Connection may have been stockpiling arms and ammunition. These actions invited official retaliation, which was not long in coming. In 1994, Phil Marsh and other members of The Pilot Connection were prosecuted by Federal territorial gangsters on a smorgasbord of criminal charges. In November of that year, the trial ended in a hung jury on most counts, and a few outright acquittals, with no convictions. The defense team included \"public defenders\" and two experienced pro se litigants from the National Commodity and Barter Association. The pro se’s from N.C.B.A. later reported that Marsh was highly resistant to their legal advice throughout the trial. These facts suggest that Marsh is relatively blind to strategy, and that his reasoning is at a \"proto-conscious\" le vel, with a strong commitment to being \"right\" regardless of new information. Given Mr. Marsh’s track record, we strongly advise readers of his lien to thoroughly scrutinize and research his legal theories before using any of them.] THE POWER OF COMMERCIAL LIENS Ease of Use Although this lien strategy is explosive, it ’s more like nitro-glycerin than hydrogen bombs. You need to be knowledgeable and careful to use nitro-glycerin, but you don’t need to be a nuclear physicist. However, ni tro-glycerin can blow up in your face if you handle it carelessly! Likewise, \"bombing\" government officials with liens is a craft, not a science, that can be used as easily by knowledgeable pro se’s as it can by lawyers and legal scholars. The commercial lien is simple, inexpensive, and takes very little time. It requires no court action or judge’s approva l. And, it has proven to be very direct and effective, if it is handled correctly . However, a few careless pro se’s have had their liens \"blow up\" in their faces (see Chapter 5), so be meticulous when you use them. Long Range You can file a commercial lien on property in another state or on property you’ve never seen. With a commercial lien, you can attack the person al property of your adversary at long range rath er than merely fighting to defend your own property in your own back yard. This offensive capabil ity makes the commercial lien a powerful legal weapon. With the commercial lien, you can literally take the fight to their back yards. The Helplessness of Judges The commercial lien, which is authorized both by the common law and by Title 15 of the United States Code (USC), is reportedly the same lien the IRS uses to take"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Americans’ homes and cars. However, some pro se litigants do not depend upon Title 15, but upon the common law of negotiable in struments (a.k.a. Co mmercial Law). As such, it’s almost impossible to remove a commercial lien w ithout the approval of the individual claimant who filed the lien. Although a commercial lien can be challenged by a common law court or by a 7th Amendment jury trial, it does not require a court process or a court judgme nt for its establishment, validity, or execution. Therefore, it appears that the cour ts may not be able to simply extinguish this lien on their own discretion (or on motion from the lien debtors) without the voluntary approval of the pe rson who filed the lien. Traditionally, these liens can only be remove d by the voluntary decision of the person who filed the lien, by th e decision of a constitutional co mmon-law jury trial, or by waiting 99 or 100 years. Since the common law has been smothered in the U.S.A., all judges are essentially powerless to overcome the liens. The Right Way L.A.W. Before utilizing any of the procedures sugge sted in this manual, we strongly suggest that you join an organizati on called \"The Right Way ... L. A.W.\" They are experts on legal and court procedures, as well as liens in general. They also have great expertise regarding Title 42 (civil ri ghts violation suits. For more details see Report #LAW01 — The Right Way ... L.A.W. Chapter 2 - Theory of Commercial Lien Strategy Introduction To effectively use the Commer cial Lien Strategy, you should have a good grasp of the principles of law involved. Immediately following this Introduction is an essay, written from a Christian/Theistic persp ective, explaining th e foundations of the common law. (The author has not copyrighted this material, and wishes to remain anonymous. The same author also composed several of the briefs listed in Appendix B ). This explanation will, no doubt, be very different from anything you have been taught. In fact, licensed attorneys may ha ve the hardest time understanding this, because they have been taught to think only in a certain way. An intelligent lay reader will probably understand the following article without much trouble. Most of us have been hypnotized into be lieving that the meaningless scribbles of \"legislators,\" \"Presidents,\" etc., constitute \"the law.\" After reading this chapter, one thing should be absolutely clear to you. The law is whatever you give your consent to . This insight frees you from being a \"v ictim\" and a \"subject,\" and restores you to your rightful position of power and sove reignty. (Always remember, though, that Territorial Gangsters [TG’s] have all sorts of ways to obtain your \"consent\"! Standing up for your rights always involves risk.) THE COMMERCIAL AFFIDAVIT PROCESS"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"by an anonymous Christian patriot A Powerful Weapon The Commercial Affidavit Process — or \"CAP\" — is perhaps one of the most powerful devices available to the common man for righting wrongs and accomplishing justice. The process is not ne w, as some may believe. At its foundation are the laws of commerce which spring from the eternal, immutable Laws of God, and those laws have been in force since the beginning of human existence. Provoke the use of the Commercial Affidavit Process against you and you provoke the wrath of all that is just and right. Today, those who are availing themselv es of the CAP system are equipping themselves with a very powerful equalizer. Make no mistake! The CAP is a very lethal weapon in the war ag ainst injustice. It is capable of righting wrongs while eliminating the \"cost factor\" that deprives thousands of people from getting justice. The expression \"equal under the law\" again has real meaning, thanks to CAP. When the CAP methodology is properly loaded and sighted on a wrongdoer, success is \"as good as in the bag.\" The Process is powerful and dangerous to those who are in the line of fire. There is no escape: either acqui esce and justly recompense or suffer the awful consequences. And, those consequences can be calamitous as will be shown. The Foundation Of Law There are basically th ree classes of laws: The Laws of God, which encompass the Laws of Nature; The Law of the Land, also referred to as the Common Law; and lastly there is Private Law, or man-made law, also referred to as Contract Law. Our Founding Fathers believed that it was self-e vident that the God of Nature is the sovereign of the universe and everything in it (as well as mankind) and that He had endowed all mankind with \"certain unalie nable rights\" making them self-directing sovereigns, which means that any governme nts instituted among men derive their just powers (only) from the consent of the gove rned, who are the sour ce of earthly power and authority. Hence any attempt to ex ercise any powers NOT conveyed by the People is unjust and unauthorized, and any act done pursuant to such usurpation of power is void. They were further convinced that God’s temporal law for mankind was expressed in the law of the land. Common law is common-se nse law. It is simple, straightforward and self evident, primarily because it is based on God’s La ws. It is the foundational law of the union of States. The Founding Fathers authorized three legal systems in the Constitution, first Common Law, secondly Equity Law, and thir dly Admiralty Law, which is the law of the sea. Gradually Common Law has been displaced by Equity Law until today the Common Law is rarely heard of or unde rstood because it has been covered up and hidden away by the legal profession for ve ry understandable business reasons. Such people are pursuing their own private agenda . In fact the Common Law is generally looked upon as obscene, example: to have a common law marriage is considered to be unclean. Why? The first marriage license in the United States was issued in 1863. The question is not whether some third party shoul d or should not perform the service; it is"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"whether sovereigns must get permission from their servants (the government) before they can be married. Private Law Private Law is that law which comes into being when people enter into agreements creating the rules and te rms by which they agree to be bound together. State and federal constitutions are examples of private law. They come under the heading of contract law because they are contracts that establish governments and are designed to protect the People from the government. To keep the government under control, the People were very precise in th e language they used to make it perfectly clear exactly what powers were being dele gated AND that any powers not specifically delegated were reserved (by the Peop le) to the states or the People. It should be remembered that the People are the sovereigns of State governments and the States are the sovereigns of the fede ral government. Thus the People, either directly or indirectly, are the sovereigns over both governments. The States have been given specific and limited power. They also made sure there were provisions that safeguarded the People’s right to abolish or change that government and to create a different one if they chose. Public Law is a form of private law that results when laws are made in proper application of the delegated authority conveye d to the legislators. Title 18 (the Federal Criminal Code) is an example of public law. It was drafted to gr ant unto non-citizens the protections and defenses Citizens ha ve under common law; Title 18 does not apply to sovereign Citizens, who answer directly to violations of GOD’s Laws. Administrative Law is one term used to desc ribe private law that comes into existence when someone acquires dominion over others an d can dictate to them what the law is. Title 26 (the Internal Revenue Code) in an example of Administrative Law; it and the other federal titles classified by congress as \"non-public\" (adminis trative) laws, thus apply only to subjects of the federal government. In 1938 the United States abandoned Public Law and adopted an unconstitutional system called Public Policy. An understanding of this distinction is so vital that the definitions of these terms follow: Public Law That portion of law which deals with th e powers, rights, duties, capacities and incapacities of government and its dele gated authority. Those laws which are concerned with a government in its political capacity, considered in its quasi-private personality, i.e., as capable of holding or exercising rights or acquiring and dealing with property in the charact er of an individual. Public Policy The rules and procedures (policy) of a sovereign over its subjects. It holds that no subject can lawfully do that which has a te ndency to be injurious to the public or against the public good as defined by the sove reign. Public policy is set by legislative acts and, pursuant thereto, by judicial and administrative promulgating of rules and regulations."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Such rules and regulations are therefore not laws but rather terms imposed by contract agreements. It’s the contracts themselves which make these rules and regulations binding. If you are not a party to those contracts, not a subject (property) of the government, you can make yourself a party by volunteering to comply. But once you decide to play the game you are compelled by the rules of that game to continue to play. Once compelled, the best out is to r eassert your sovereig n rights. The very concept of Public Policy and its inherent usurpation of power from the sovereign People is so addictive and has become so widely accepted by bureaucrats in all levels of government that they act as if th ey were the masters of the People. This shift in government was instituted with the Supreme Court’s decision in the Erie Railroad case, as a result of which, all Suprem e Court decisions prior to that time are being treated as no longer relevant in equity court proceedings. And so another milestone was reached in the conspiracy to overthrow the rights of the People. This Administrative Law is much like Roman Law which is also called Civil Law. Conceptually, Roman or Civil Law, which is practiced in most of Europe, is diametrically opposite to the Common Law. Under Roman or Civil Law you are guilty un til proven innocent and have only those rights your master the government chooses to grant you; and what your master giveth, he can take away. Under the Common Law as practiced in America, you are innocent until proven guilty and retain all ri ghts not delegated to government. We are seeing more and more of this Roman class of laws in this country: if you are charged you are treated as bei ng guilty until proven innocent. If that is happening to you, it’s because of your legal stat us — or what \"they\" percei ve as your legal status. If your legal status is that of being a sovere ign Citizen your unaliena ble rights are being violated! Principles Of Law Making In the days before the turn of the century in America, the custom was for those studying law to study the Bible and the laws co ntained therein so that those principles would occupy a preeminent place in the minds of those practicing law. This is not the case today; rather the opposite is true. The eternal truths containe d in the Bible have been lost from the view of those who need th em the most. It is still the best place to learn about laws generally, as well as other eternal truths. The concept of a system of laws not founded upon those eternal truths is tantamount to building a house on quick sand. In America, the sovereign power resides in and comes only from the People. \"We the People\" are the sovereigns. All the power and authority the government has ... was given to it by the People! If we don’t have the right to do a thing, then we cannot delegate such a right to any government! (\" We cannot give to a nyone or anything any power or authority we do not have!\") Is it not in controversion to this princi ple that representativ es of the People — legislators or bureaucrats or judges — pretend they can make laws to implement powers We the People did not and cannot give them? It is self-evident! Yet they pretend they can do virtually anything they or even a majority of them merely agree"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"among themselves (vote) to do; they publish interpretations of laws and promulgate rules based on those interpre tations; or they render de cisions that are clearly antithetical to the concepts set forth in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution as the Founding Fathers understood and expounded them; and thereby they violate their sworn oath to defend and uphold the Constitution. They know that few if any who discover su ch usurpation will have the perseverance, let alone the financial means and time required to find a qualified, willing attorney to utilize the court system to expose their usurpation and br ing them to account and thus rectify their malfunction. They also promote and rely on the genera l MISCONCEPTION that any statute passed by a legislature is valid. It is impossible for both the Constituti on and a law violating it to be valid; one must prevail! This is succinctly stated as follows: \"The general rule is that an unconstituti onal statute, though having the form and name of law, is in reality no la w, but is wholly void and ineffective for any purpose since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment, and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it. An unconstituti onal law, in legal contemplation, is as inoperative as if it had never been passed ... \"Since an unconstitutional law is void, the general principles follow that it imposes no duties, confers no rights, cr eates no office, bestows no power or authority on anyone, affords no protection and justifies no act s performed under it ... No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law and no courts are bound to enforce it.\" 16 Am Jur 2nd §177 \"The general rule is that an unconstitutiona l act of the Legislature protects no one. It is said that all persons are presumed to know the law, meaning that ignorance of the law excuses no one; if any person acts under an unconstitutional statute, he does so at his peril and must take the consequences.\" 16 Am Jur 2d §178 \"Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them.\" Miranda v. Arizona , 384 US 436 at 491. In order for a law to be proper, it must be just. It must protect e qually the rights of all without violating the rights of any. There is nothing mysterious about proper law; it is based on reasonableness and common sense, and is harmonious with the Laws of God. Check a law against this measure to see if it fits the mold of eternal truth and justice: say to yourself, \"Would I be unwilling to ha ve this law applied to myself or my closest friend?\" If such application se ems repugnant to you, if it seems unfair or unjust, then there is probably someth ing wrong with that law. God knows that people’s political standards ar e a reliable reflection of th eir moral standards and that the laws which they support are a good test of how they wish to be judged (Matthew 7:1). People can clearly see that taking money from so me one by force is a crime when done by individuals, but they may fail to recognize the criminality of the same act when done by government."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"For example, how would you feel if you ha d a particular \"entitlement\" and the government told you that you were authorized to collect a portion of this government handout from each of your neighbors? Let’s su ppose that your \"entitlement\" is food stamps: instead of giving you stamps, the government gives you a list of people from whom you are \"authorized\" to collect the money to buy the food. How would you feel if they told you it was all right to for ce your neighbors to give you the money? And every time you needed more food, you had to do it all over again? Would that be right? If not, why? Would changing the name of the collector make it right? Would it go against your grain to do so? How would your neighbors feel when you presented your \"authorization\"? How w ould you feel if your neighbors were coming to collect FROM YOU for some other \"entitlement\" pr ogram they were \"authorized\" to collect? The Commercial Affidavit Process is a pre-co mmon law process. It is also referred to as a \"commercial law process,\" not to be confused with the [Uniform] Commercial Code and other manipulated and complicat ed rules and regula tions. It is a pre- common law process because until there is a disagreement, there is no dispute. All that is being done is the establishment of claims and obligations. The purpose of the CAP is to make claims and determine if the accused agrees or not. If the Accused does not contest the claims there is no dis pute to be adjudicated thus the appropriate damages are consensually agreed-upon. Thus it is pre-judicial. It may also be completely non-judicial if it is properly (composed of unrebuttable truth) and successfully implemented. The term \"commercial\" as used herein refers to any dealings people have among themselves. Thus the \"laws of commerce\" refers to the just rules of procedure governing human relationships, the self-evide nt principles of right and wrong which are the foundation of the common law. The foundation of COMMERCIAL LAW rests solidly on the bedrock of justice and common sense. These laws are so sound and so universally accepted that they cannot with impunity be overturned, overwritten or tampered with in any way: they are founded on eternal truths, needing no proof from anyone to justify their validity (i.e., self-evident); they are immutable; they provide equal justice to all parties of interest and thus are completely fair. That is th e KEY to their power. All other just laws spring from this foundation. (By contrast, co rrupted laws are mere shadows of these true and correct principles.) Justice is delivered quickly, simply, fairly and conclusively with the Commercial Affidavit Process. This may be a terribl e disappointment to wrong-doers who are confident they can get away with thei r illegitimate activit ies. Those who are subverting just laws, setting them aside, covering them up, creating shadow-law or colorable law and just generally using self -serving laws to subject and plunder their fellow man are in for a rude awakening. In summary, the Common Law grows out of the laws of commerce which themselves are based upon self-evident truths. Such truths are commonly e xpressed as maxims. Maxims In Law Maxims are as much a part of the laws of human relations (commerce) as a foundation is a part of a building. They ar e fundamental and immutable, having their basis in God’s Laws. No one of sound mi nd argues against them. They are the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"bedrock of logic, of reason, of common sense, of truth. They are fundamental principles upon which all that is right, just and true is founded. They are the standards to measure the correctness of any course or action. The word \"maxim\" is defined as an expres sion of an absolute truth or principle. Maxims are so powerful and unequivocal th at they are the foundation of all human relationships. They have the pow er to cut to the heart of a matter in a heartbeat with reason, logic, and authority. They cover ever y topic imaginable and every aspect of our lives. They are not ea sily misunderstood, misapplied, or subverted; they are universally accepted for what they are: self-evident TRUTHS. Maxims might be considered the redundant backup system when all else fails. Anyone who is not schooled in the logic of maxims is easily confused for the want of such understanding. The legal profession has a vested interest in keeping the People ignorant of these principles: protecting the n eed for their \"priestcraft.\" Priestcraft is \"the craft of specialists who work to create the illusion their craft is too complex to be understood by anyone else.\" It doesn’t take a law degr ee to understand maxims. The light of truth in maxims cannot be extinguished through the evil works and craftiness of men. They may be forgotten by many, intentionally concealed by some, but they still exist, no matter what, and they won’t go away! Below are maxims that surround the rightfu lness and lawfulness of the Commercial Affidavit Process. This by no means is an exhaustive list: Regarding Justice . . . — All are equal under the Law. — A matter must be expr essed to be resolved. — Claims made without accountability are void. — Might does not make right. — Force, perjury or subornation of perjury, voids all. — Fraud vitiates the most solemn promise. — While the battle continues, he who first leaves the field or refuses to contend loses by default. — You are free to make any decision you wish, but you are never free to escape the consequences of your decisions. — A laborer is worthy of his hire."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"— Thou shalt not steal. — Notice to the agent is notice to the princi pal and notice to the principal is notice to the agent. — Do unto others as you would have others do unto you. Regarding Truth . . . — Truth stands supreme. — Truth affects but cannot be affected. — Truth is expressed in th e form of an affidavit. — Truth will out. — An unrebutted affidavit stands as the truth. — An affidavit must be rebutted point-for-point. — Thou shall not bear false witness. — Ignorance is no respecter, it affects all without regard to position or title. Regarding Sovereignty . . . — It is self-evident that all men are endowed by their cr eator (God) with equal and unalienable rights. — The created cannot be greater than its creator. — A man can give to another no more than he himself has. — A man may not with impunity in fringe upon another man’s rights. — The People are Sovereign. — In America the government is the servant of the \"sovereign\" People. Regarding Power and Authority . . . — We cannot give to anyone or anything any power or authority we do not have. Failed Legal System Although the court system MAY have an esse ntial part to play once the Commercial Affidavit has been served AND ANSWERED , that system is not and cannot be invoked until the charges in the affidavit ha ve been answered by (1) acquiescence, (2) rebuttal or (3) default: until that point, THERE IS NO DISAGREEMENT TO ADJUDICATE. A disagreement could arise only from a rebuttal."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"But even though it would be feasible to invol ve the court system to adjudicate such disagreement, no one seeking JUSTICE really would want to do so because the court system has become extremely costly, ve ry slow and corrupted by the conniving convolutions of man-made rules and legalism s and by the natural inclinations of those who live from the legal system to promote the financial success of the legal business! If any adjudication is found necessary (only in the event of rebuttal) it will be done by a common law jury invoked at the discre tion of the Claimant (see \"RESOLUTION BY JURY\" below). In stark contrast to th e equity court system of today, the CAP system is so effective in exposing the truth, in rendering and enforcing justice, that it is a lethal weapon in the war for the fr eedoms and liberties — the unalienable rights — of the People. Private Matter The Commercial Affidavit Process places the full power of justice back in the hands of the common man. It cannot be overstate d that the whole Commercial Affidavit Process is not dependent on the court sy stem. It functions quite well on its own outside the current legal system. It needs to be thoroughly understood that because it is driv en by SWORN TRUTH, the Commercial Affidavit Process is outside the jurisdiction of any equity court. It is a private contract matter. Should an attempt be made to involve an e quity court it would result in a trespass against the Affiant’s right s: those interfering i ndividuals, who were unlawfully involved, would themselves become one of the accused. An equity court has no jurisdiction whatsoever, for the CAP is strictly a non-judicial or pre-judicial process between individua ls and is private. This alone presents a very real dilemma for those who are accustomed to using the legal system to work wrongs and trespass ag ainst others with s eeming impunity. They can’t hide behind a legal system that only dispenses justice to those who can afford to play the game. Those who are used to shielding themselves under \"sovereign immunity\" protections, hiding be hind legions of attorneys and judges, and using other \"legal tricks\" now have none of this protection. NO judge, court, law, or government can invalidate these commercial processes, i.e., an affidavit or complaint or a lien based thereon because no third party can invalidate someone’s affidavit of truth. A judge CANNOT interfere with, tamper with, or in any way modify testimony without disintegra ting the truth-seeking process of his profession, destroying the very fabric of his own occupation and abrogating the First Amendment which was established to protect truth. For a judge to interfere with testimony is to commit professional suicide a nd to invite countless civil and criminal repercussions. ANYONE who tampers with testimony is a threat to the peace and security of society, violating its laws and acting as its enemy and is therefore justifiably subject to the a ppropriate penalties. The Comm ercial Affidavit Process is by its very nature private, and strictly between parties of in terest, only. It is unequivocally non-judicial. Sworn Truth The foundation of the law, commerce and the whole legal system consists in telling the truth (\"I solemnly swear to tell the tr uth, the whole truth ...\" ) either by testimony,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"by deposition or by affidavit. Every honorable judge requires those who appear before him to be sworn to tell the truth and is compelled by the high principles of his profession to protect an d seek out the truth. A Commercial Affidavit is an Affidavit of Truth. It is the sworn testimony of the Affiant who solemnly swears that the fact s contained therein are true, correct and certain. Every claim made in the Affidavit is backed up by documentary evidence that is provable without any contrivance. Meeting The Demands If (as is usually the case) the Accused rec ognizes the charges are true and/or decides (correctly) that the wisest thing to do is meet the demands rather than face the staggering punitive damages which accompany the issuance of the Criminal Complaint, the Accused has th e option of simply meeting the demands for redress as required by or negotiated with the Claimant. If the Accused has the good sense to meet the demands of the Claimant, then the wrongs have been sati sfactorily redressed; and that is the end of the issue: all char ges are resolved; the Commercial Affidavit Process is closed. Anyone is free to use the CAP system; but it is a two-edged sword: it cuts both ways! Anyone who undertakes it MUST follow the maxim, \"Be honest with yourself,\" because, especially under the Commercial A ffidavit Process, \"Truth will out!\" Consequently it is extremely important to en sure that everything in the affidavit is true and unrebuttable. Acquiescence When one is the Accused in a commercial affidavit process prope rly (truthfully) done, by far THE WISEST COURSE IS TO REDRESS THE CLAIMANT AS DEMANDED — whatever must be done to accomplish it. Should the Accused be misguided in to choosing ANY response other than acquiescence, the Criminal Complaint will issue accompanied by the Commercial Lien based on the Complaint’s ledger of charges, counts, redresses demanded and ADDING (1) PUNITIVE DAMAGES and (2) INCARCERATION as provided in the applicable federal and/or State criminal c odes. Although it is extremely unlikely in the face of a properly done affidavit, should th e Accused believe that Affiant’s charges are somehow in error, he or she may (DURING THE GRACE PERIOD ONLY) rebut any such charge; however, (1) such res ponse will NOT avoid issuance of the Trial Criminal Complaint; (2) the Commercial Lien will still issue for any charges not rebutted AND (3) a second Commercial Lien wi ll issue for any rebutted charges about which the Common Law Jury thereby convened remains unpersuaded! Hence REBUTTAL (unless 100% successful — wh ich is highly unlikely) WILL NOT AVOID the horrendous PUNITIVE DAMAG ES and INCARCERATION provided by law. Rebuttal The sworn Affidavit will stand as truth if not timely rebutted by the Accused. In the instant case, thirty (30) days."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The only one who can rebut a Commercial A ffidavit is the Accused who alone, by his own affidavit, must speak for himself and only for himself. If the Accused uses someone else to speak for him, the third pa rty must speak for and in behalf of the Accused as if he were the Accused; and th e Accused still stands completely liable as if he himself were speaking. If however, the third party is identifie d as separated from the Accused, he also becomes a co-party with the Accused as an accomplice, thus a co-conspirator having no immunity whatsoever. Every charge or claim contained in the Cl aimant’s Affidavit must be rebutted point- for-point by the Accused. The Accused’s rebu ttal must be done in the form of an Affidavit of Truth. That means it must be SWORN TESTIMONY and must be signed by at least two witnesses. The Accused/Affiant must swear to the truth, the correctness and the certainty of his or her rebuttals within that affidavit, thereby assuming complete liability for the statements contained in it and must be prepared to prove his or her statements, preferably w ith documentation that is unimpeachable. Failure to follow the correct process of rebutting the charges or ANY ATTEMPT TO PRESENT REBUTTAL EVIDENCE THAT IS NOT SWORN AS BOTH TRUE and \"THE WHOLE TRUTH\" INVALIDATES such re sponse as if no evidence or rebuttal were given at all. SUCH FAIL URE IS FATAL TO THE DEFENSE! If a proper rebuttal is offered, any of several conclusions may result: 1. If any or all charges are rebutted, those charges will (at Claimant’s discretion) be resolved as described unde r \"RESOLUTION BY JURY.\" 2. Any charges not rebutted or redresse d will result in a DEFAULT CONVICTION for those charges and the issuance of a \"non- trial\" criminal complaint which will be covered under \"CRIMINAL LIABILITY.\" Resolution By Jury The Claimant may accept or reject Accused’ s rebuttal of any charge, point-for-point. Claimant’s acceptance of th e rebuttal of any point reso lves that point. At the discretion of the Claimant ALL UNACCEPT ED POINTS may be either resolved by another affidavit on those points, repeati ng the process. The fallout of all the Affidavits are resolved by a common-law jury. If and when the jury system is used, the Claimant will draft the Criminal Complaint, subpoena a jury, and the process will move to a full-blown, common-law criminal trial. If the matter goes to a common-law criminal trial, the trial will be held under the rules of common law. These rules are significantly different from those in an equity court proceeding. In common-law trials, technical rules are virtually non-existent. Like its name, the rules of common-law trials are fr om common sense. The procedure is very simple and straightforward. It’s designed to arrive at the true facts, assess guilt and render a just verdict without undue delays or fancy maneuvering, thus eliminating delays intended to forestall or get the Accused acquitted on some technicality. The jury is the real boss. It deci des what is relevant and what is not. The jurors hear what they want to hear and exclude what they feel is not relevant. The Claimant or his appointee becomes the prosecutor, and th e Accused or his appointee becomes the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"defense attorney. The parties of interest (the Claimant and the Accused) may have anyone they want as counse l, professional or not. The risk faced by the Accused is very real. A common-law court only recognizes common law, and it applies common-law deci sions. Equity court decisions and rules that conflict with the common law are w ithout standing in common-law proceedings. In the Commercial Affidavit Process, the claimants are almost always sovereign Citizens. As such they have legal standi ng at common law. The Accused are usually \"subject citizens\" being char ged with crimes against \"s overeign Citizen s.\" Typically the acts committed have been done under colorable law with colorable authority or colorable jurisdiction, in which case is patently unconstitutional and therefore void, leaving the Accused defenseless: so a s econd Commercial Lien will issue for those redresses and punitive damages of which th e jury has not exonerated the Accused. Due Process In order to meet the demands of due process, the parties must have reasonable time to express their versions of the controversy (\"In order for a matter to be resolved, it must be expressed.\") Therefore a grace period mu st be allowed, commonly referred to as \"commercial grace.\" Many c ourt jurisdictions allow onl y 20 days, which may be sufficient; but the Claimant in his discretion believes that 30 days is more reasonable. At the Claimant’s discretion, even more time may be grante d without notice; HOWEVER, that does not relieve the defense of the obligation to respond within the time of commercial grace given — default fa lls by declaration in thirty (30) days. How important is it to TIMELY answer the accusations made in a Sworn Affidavit of Truth? IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT! If the Accused fail to properly and timely answer, he stands to lose all and will have foreclosed to himself any future possibility of redressing or rebutting those charges. The primary objective is to insure justice quickly and with a minimum of difficulty. Failure to timely answer is fatal to the outcome. It is equivalent to abandoning th e battlefield and causes loss by default (\"While the battle continues, he who first l eaves the field or refuses to contend loses by default.\") The Accused, having started the contes t by violating and trespassing upon the Affiant’s rights, cannot with impunity leave the contest. The victory and the spoils goes to him who stays and is the last to l eave the battle. The loser loses and in so doing, grants the spoils to the victor. There is no recovery for the loser; notwithstanding any new battle which may ensue, the loss still stands; it can’t be set aside. Consequently, the Accu sed’s failure to redress or rebut charges contained in a Commercial Affidavit is ta ntamount to abandoning the ba ttlefield: thus losing by default. Some in government, by trying to hide behind some rule or procedure that requires Claimants to follow some predetermined course or time limit, commit a fatal error! They are usually relying on some statute or other inferior leve l of protection, which might apply to those who are subject to such jurisdiction, but not to sovereign Citizens. When \"estoppel by acquiescence\" caused by failure to timely answer enters the picture, as it surely will in this setting, the result ha s a far-reaching impact on the future of each Accused."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Criminal Liability Responding to the Commercial Affidavit is critically important: the Accused is usually being charged with very serious crimes that carry very heavy, punitive penalties. The law has always viewed trespassing upon unalienable rights as being an offense so serious that it is beyond satisfa ction merely by payment of the approximate money damages demanded. The Affidavit is a commercial complaint, but it is not yet a \"criminal\" complaint. The main distinction is that by resolving the charges during the Affidavit stage, the Accused can get off by simply redressing the grievances as specified in the Affidavit or as mutually negotiated. If the Accused r ecognizes his or her errors and wants to redress the Claimant but does not have the ab ility to do so within the time limit, the Accused may contact the Claimant and express that desire with a written statement to that effect. Then arrangements can be ma de to stop any further action. If some such arrangements are not made, then th e CRIMINAL COMPLAINT issues adding PUNITIVE DAMAGES and JAIL TIME! The Criminal Complaint is in reality a ledger in which those details which were omitted in the Affidavit are (now) spelled ou t. It lists the cause s of action, the number of counts, redresses demanded and the MASSIVE CIVIL PENALTIES (which occur when unalienable rights are violated), thus compounding the problems for the Accused: now, on top of the redres ses being demanded, massive PUNITIVE DAMAGES are added as well! Normally this increases the cost to the Accused by a factor of at least a hundred if not a th ousand fold. The effects of the criminal complaint invariably destroy all prospects for the future of the Accused! An S.E.C. Security When the Commercial Affidavit has matured, (after 30 days) it is evidence of a debt and/or obligations. In order fo r it to be classed as a security, it must carry the United States Securities and Exchange Commissi on (S.E.C.) TRACER FLAG on it from the very beginning. As a security it must conf orm to the rules governing securities and must be identified and monitored as such from the beginning. A Ledger Identifying The Penalties Since the Criminal Complaint is in reality a ledger in which the causes of action and the number of counts are listed and the civi l penalties (punitive damages) determined, the criminal complaint acts as a punishmen t tool for wrongdoers who will not repent. Should the Accused be so foolish as to ALLOW the Criminal Compliant to be activated (i.e., fail to answer by redressmen t or rebuttal), the war is over: all that remains is collecting the spoils of battle. Th e Accused has lost and lost in a very big way. In all probability the Accused will ne ver recover from the consequences. This is true is because THE \"TRI AL\" WAS GOING ON DURING THE 30 DAYS. To compare the Commercial Affidavit Proce ss to a conventional tr ial would look like this: The Commercial Affidavit presents th e prosecutor’s case in one fell swoop. The moment the Accused is served, the defense process begins. THE ACCUSED THEN HAS 30 DAYS TO MAKE A CASE. IF during that time the Accused make no defense nor redress of the charges, he or she then stands convicted by default! The"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"\"trial\" is now over. The Criminal Complaint is only a formality to calculate the punitive damages against the Accused which thus have been awarded to the Claimant. Accompanying the Criminal Complaint is the COMMERCIAL LIEN which issued by CONSENSUAL DEFAULT against all the asse ts of the Accused. This effectively gives the Claimant lien rights against all of the property of the Accused. Such a lien may be filed in the county recorder’s office; however, this fili ng is not a necessity, but, a convenience. Any common law commer cial lien will stand by law for one hundred years or until the damages have been collected. In most cases that means practically forever because the Accused does not, and probably never will have enough property to satisfy the damages thus assessed. Now the full power of the legal enforcement system can be brought to bear to collect the damages owed by the Accused. The Sher iff is empowered to seize pay checks, cars, homes: anything and everything. Loss Of Government Employment The Accused is in fact a convicted fe lon: unbondable by any insurance company, subject by law to immediate termination if employed by the government and forever barred from holding public office. Jail The Criminal Complaint is turned over to the appropriate Prosecuting Attorney, who must institute a sentencing hearing wherein a judge will impose the incarceration (jail- time) prescribed in the appropriate crimin al codes for the offenses of which the Accused stands convicted. Should any such authority fail to prosecute sentencing against the convicted party, the mildest char ge then faced by such authority is Felony Misprision; but such Prosecuting Attorney c ould also be charged with conspiracy to aid and abet the convicted party in commission of the same offenses. Under our current political situation, where the enemies of the People often occupy positions of power and authority and those same people can prevent or slow the wheels of justice, there are still many ways to publish the convictions and misdeeds of parties so convicted that can be even more humiliating to the convicted than the normal methods of publishing the results of their conviction. Summary The fundamental purpose, and one of the major objectives of the Commercial Affidavit Process is to educate wrongdoers to the fact they have abused the unalienable rights of a sovereign Citizen and cannot get away with it, and to give them an opportunity (commercial grace) to repent and undo the wrongs they have done. Unlike the typical criminal trial wher e the Accused no longer has the option of simply redressing the wrongs he or she has done, the Commercial Affidavit Process DOES give the Accused that option! Further, the CAP is designed to educate wrongdoers that they ar e being used by the conspirators in the war agains t the People. Thus they may see for themselves what is really going on and decide which side they choose to serve."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Role of the Courts An affidavit is someone’s solemn expression of truth. The foundation of the law, commerce, and the whole legal system consists of telling the truth (\"I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth . . . \"), either by testimony, deposit ion, and/or by affidavit. Every honorable judge requires those who appe ar before him to be sworn to tell the truth, and is compelled by the high principles of his profession to protect truth and do nothing to tamper with that tr uth, either directly or indire ctly, either in person or by proxy, or by subornation of an affiant or other person. A judge CANNOT interfere with, tamper with, or in any way modify testimony without disintegrati ng the truth-seeking process in his sacred profession and destroying the fabric of his own occupation. To do so abrogates th e First Amendment, which was established to protect truth. It is committing professional suicide, as well as inviting countless civil a nd criminal repercussions. ANY judge who tampers with testimony, depositi on, or affidavit, is a threat to the Commercial Peace and Dignity of the County, State, and United States of America, thereby violating the laws of all those politic al subdivisions and acti ng in the nature of a foreign enemy agent (A MIXED WAR), justifiably subject to penalties of TREASON. WHOEVER acts against Commer cial Affidavits without executing the necessary Commercial Paperwork under a ffidavit is subject to bei ng charged criminally. Said charges begin with FRAUD, which is gaini ng at the expense of the loss of another using trickery or deception, and the charge s expand from there to include all those violations that extend to and are a natural outgrowth of such fraud. Commercial processes are fundamentally non-judicial and pre-judicial. NO judge, court, law, or government can invalidate thes e commercial processes; i.e., an affidavit or a lien or complaint based thereon, becau se no third party can invalidate someone’s affidavit of truth. To act against such affidavit is to crea te a situation and or enhance the condition of A MIXED WAR. No one can rebut an affiant except a party (e.g., a lien debtor) who alone, by his own affidavit, must speak for himself if challenged. Only someone himself knows his truth and has the right and responsibility to assert it. The MIXED WAR situation and or condition is that where those in authority have violated their oaths of office, violated the fundamental law they took an oath to uphold and protect, violated the codes, st atutes and regulations that govern them thereby they disregarded the peace and sa fety of the community by their actions, acting for undisclosed foreign agents or gove rnments, against those whom they swore to protect [see Black’s Law Dictionary on War ]. Simply, an act or acts of TREASON in a secret war against the people. Notes on the Above Article What you have read gives you the theoretical foundation for most of this manual. Practically, there are difficulties with the strategy described above. Conducting a common-law criminal trial is not easy, as th e author noted. The court system has, for practical purposes, extinguish ed that option. Thus, territo rial gangsters are often shielded from criminal prosecution. However, the one aspect of the strategy that can"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"still be effective is Commercial Liens. As of this writing, it seems that no judge can extinguish such a lien if it is properly executed . Constitutions as Enforceable Contracts The Commercial Lien Strategy depends upon one \"maxim\" as its linchpin: the idea of a constitution as a specific performance contract between a governing official and the people in a particular juri sdiction. Some writers (such as Lysander Spooner) have denounced the U.S. Constitution as a fraud, on the grounds that it is not an enforceable contract (see Report #TL07: The Constitution of No Authority available at this website). The Commercial Lien Strategy, by c ontrast, holds that constitutions are enforceable contracts. The instruments of contract ? OATHS OF OFFICE. The Commercial Lien Strategy assumes that, when an o fficial signs an oath, he/she signs a contract to exercise the powers of office within the limitations of the constitution and the laws. On paper, there are sanctions against officials who violate their oaths. \"Whoever, having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the Unit ed States authorizes an oath to be administered, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury and shall be fined no more than $2,000.00 or imprisoned not more than five years or both.\" 18 U.S.C. §1621 In practice, it is very difficult to prosecu te a malfeasant public official. However, such officials may be exposed to great personal, commercial liability for violating their oaths of office. Apparently, many government officials reali ze this. Alfred Adask, editor/publisher of The AntiShyster , writes: \"A friend of mine recently asked the [Tex as] Secretary of State for copies of Governor’s and AG’s oaths, but received no response for nearly two months. Finally, he received a copy of the AG [Dan] Mora les’s oath which was dated January, 1991, but was not file stamped until March 26, 1993. Very suspicious. Governor [Anne] Richard’s oath is yet to be found by the Secretary of State. Likewise, very suspicious. \"It appears possible (probable?) that the G overnor and AG had not taken their oaths of office for two years after they were elected. If so, they were (are?) probably in office illegally. It would follow then, that anything th ey’d done or signed in an official capacity in the last two years might also be unlawful and without legal merit. \"The potential for legal havoc could be huge. Laws signed by the Governor during the last two years might not be lawful; the en tire Executive branch of the Texas State government might be without lawful author ity to enforce any law or regulation; innumerable criminal convictions might be reversed. All of the civil court cases prosecuted by Attorney General Morales and the entire AG’s office (which derives its authority from the AG’s oath) might also be unlawful."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"\"Of course, it’s virtually impossible that the courts will rule that all official acts of Texas for the last two years are unlawful. But whether those official acts are bogus or not, there is an infinitely more important question: \"Why weren’t the oaths of the Governor a nd Attorney General of Texas — the two most important officials in the Executive branch of our state’s government — on file at the Secretary of State’s office? \"Why? Some sort of clerical error? \"I don’t think so. I think the oaths were missing because they didn’t exist . . . [Emphasis added] \"So perhaps some officials simply choose to be ‘oathless’ in an attempt to ‘cover their butts’ from being sued (or ‘liened on’) for not ‘upholding and defending’ the state constitution? Could be.\" Bonding of Government Officials Some pro se litigants postulate th e requirement that government officials be \"bonded.\" As far as anyone knows, this theory has not been tested in court. Nonetheless, some readers of this manual may wish to research this topic further. Therefore, what follows is a brief exposition of the theory. The \"bonding\" theory states that most elected officials and government administrators (perhaps even lawyers), ar e legally required to be \" bonded.\" That is, they must purchase a \"performance bond\" (a kind of insu rance policy) which guarantees that the official will perform the duties required by his office. In the event the government official fails to perform his duties, any party injured by this breach of contract can recover th e cost of his damages from the bonding company. According to these pro se litigants, despite the legal requirement that government officials be bonded, many, perhaps most, are not. Therefore, the \"bonding requirement\" strategy is based on first determining if a given official is legally required to be bonded. Then, if he is bonded — and evidence can be shown to the bonding company that he is failing to meet the performance requirements of his bond — the bonding company may revoke the bond or raise his premium, which should help \"encourage\" the wayward official to obey the law. Further, if the bond is require d by law in order to hold a pa rticular office, once that bond is lost, it’s possible that the office must also be surrendered. If the official is not bonded, then the lien process includes not ifying the government official of this legal deficiency. If he does not correct the deficiency (purchase a performance bond) within 90 days, then anyone damaged by his actions can file a commercial lien on the government official for all of his personal property. Also (according to this theory) a gover nment official’s bond is dependent upon his legal immunity, and that immunity is to so me extent based on having a legal Oath of"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Office on file (usually with the Secretary of St ate). If his Oath of Office is insufficient to meet the Constitutional or statutory requirements, he may lose his immunity and his bond. If he loses his bond, he becomes personall y liable (\"lienable\") for any illegal act he commits in office. Chapter 3 - Basic Concepts of Liens Lien — Definition \"Lien. A claim, encumbrance, or charge on property for payment of some debt, o bligation or duty . . . Qualified right of property which a creditor has in or over specific property of his debtor, as security for the debt or charge or for performance of some act .\" Black’s Law Dictionary , 6th Ed., p. 922 [emphasis added] A lien is a public declaration of commerci al debt and/or oblig ation. \"Debt\" usually refers to money or property. \"Obligation\" us ually refers to the fulfillment of specific performance. Examples include the fulf illment of oath of public office or the provision of the tax-financed due process, as in the provision of a jury trial instead of a summary process. Examples of liens include mortgages and automobile loans. In both instances, the possessor has the right to use the property. However, he may not sell or otherwise alienate the property without fi rst satisfying the lien. Any a ttempt to evade the lien is known as poundbreach , which is a felony in most jurisdictions. An individual who has no debt, no need to borrow money and does not contemplate selling or refinancing his house or car can probably live with a lien for a long time. However, most people (especially most gove rnment officials!) do not fall into that category. Therefore, even though a Commer cial Lien does not cause outright forfeiture of property, it can still cause significant hardship. Even more vexing to the lien debtor is th e fact that the lien is not causing him any actual damages . Rather, it prevents him from doing that which he may want to do. Therefore, suing the lien claimant for dam ages is not easy, provided that the lien has been properly executed. Types Of Liens • Common Law Liens are non-commercial \"Lis Pendens\" Liens that must be upheld by judicial action in a court before claims to assets can be executed. Common law liens are usually used more in a defensive wa y to shield and protect assets, rather than an offensive way to lay claim to assets. (See further discussion under Comparisons). • Equity Liens arise from an equity cour t or administrative court. • Statutory Liens are established by the statutory laws of the state."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"• Mortgage Liens are created by contract between borrowers and lenders, with the asset of the borrower pledged as collateral to the lender. • Mechanics Liens are typically used by repair se rvice providers as a claim on an item repaired, to ensure payment for repair services rendered. The name originated from when an auto mechanic repairs a car and the owner fails to pay for the repair. Then the mechanic can file a lien on the car. • Commercial Liens , also known as contract liens, are true bills in commerce publicly declared. A true bill in commerce al ways contains, and is characterized by, a one-to-one correspondence between an item or service purchased and a debt owed. This commercial relationship is what is known as \"just compensation\" (5th Amendment, U.S. Constitution). A normal true bill in commerce is private, whereas a commercial lien is publicly declared, using means such as media advertising and/or filing at the County Recorder. When it is un contested by a categorical point-by-point rebuttal of the affidavits, it is considered an account receivable security (15 U.S.C.). In general, commercial liens (e.g., mechanic s and workmens liens) take seniority over common-law liens, which, in turn, take prec edence over mortgage liens. Tax liens are classified as commercial liens, which is why they are so troublesome. Comparisons Common Law liens are well-known in the Sovereign community for asset protection. They are considered non-commercial, because they do not contain a declaration of one-to-one correspondence between an item or service purchased and the debt owed. Thus, they don’t represent true bills in commerce. Because of that defect, a non- commercial lien must be adjudicated by a c ourt of common law before the asset can be claimed by the other party, and is th erefore known as a Lis Pendens Lien. The commercial value of a Lis Pendens Lien rests upon the outcome of the pending litigation. Hence it is a securi ty, but is not an account rece ivable until it is adjudicated as such. So, common law liens are normally used as defensive shields, in that by placing it on one’s own asset to be protected, no other party can legally ge t access to the asset without first challenging the lien in court. That’s why it is called a Lis Pendens Lien. The lien might be filed at a county recorder and never be challenged in court, because parties who have no just and legal right to the property will usually avoid the risk of failing to prove the claim in court. It is c onsidered asset protecti on, since it is difficult or impossible for anyone to get at the equity in an asset if a Lis Pendens Lien of sufficient size has senior position. A commercial lien, by contrast, is offensive in nature, in that it declares a legal right to someone else’s asset as a debt owed as a one-to-one correspondence with an asset that was given. It is not a Lis Pendens Lien, because the exact value is already specifically determined, consistent with the laws of commerce. It is a true bill in commerce. Although a commercial lien can be challenged by a common law court or by a 7th Amendment jury trial, it does not require a court process or a court judgment for its establishment, validity, or effectiveness."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"A commercial lien may not be removed by anyone except the lien claimant, or a properly-convened, properly-conducted jury trial (due process). It may not be removed by a summary process. A summary process is t oo vulnerable to bribery, kickbacks, and fraud of process. Like the common law lien, the commercial lien can be filed by common citizens, without the aid or expense of a lawyer, and without the approval or interference of the courts. You do the necessary research, you fill ou t the lien, you have it notarized, and you file it with your County Clerk. It’s simple, inexpensive, and so powerful it can give a common person an enormous amount of legal \"leverage\" that is largely beyond the reach of the courts. (In some countie s among the thousands of counties in the U.S., you may find recalcitrant clerks who will refuse to file your properly-executed documents. While such clerks are violati ng their sworn public duty to record and make a matter of public record your prope rly-executed documents, as a practical matter suing a recalcitrant country clerk usually will be less effective than various alternatives. Your best bet is probably: (1) Be low prof ile in recording any properly- executed, good-faith documents. Don’t partic ularly discuss the contents of the documents you’re filing with the clerk. You’re not trying to hide anything — after all, you’re making a matter of public record various statements you are affirming the truth of, in good faith. But attracting undue atten tion may impede the progress of anything you may wish to make a matter of public reco rd. (2) If you do run into a recalcitrant clerk who doesn’t like what you’re doing, simply try another county, or try the same county on a different occasion . This fits very well with our strategy of \"creating your own creative alternative\" when confronted with certain bureauc ratic obstacles. (3) You could as a different alternative try using appropriate media publications to make your documents a matter of public record (by \"publishing the document\"). You’ll need to research the particulars of how to do this in your area, if you use this option. But finding a county clerk that does their job routinely and properly is probably lower-profile.) Unlike the common law lien (used to defend property you possess), a commercial lien is \"offensive\" in nature since it enables you to \"attack,\" threaten, or seize someone else’s property which you do not possess. The fundamental difference between commercial and common law liens centers on the issue of possession. In many states, such as Oklahoma, a common law lien can only be filed against property which you lawfully possess; this was decided in the Oklahoma Supreme Court case Williamson v. Winningham , 186 P.2d 644. Check the laws in your own state. A commercial lien, by contrast, can be filed against the propert y of anyone who owes you a financial debt or duty of performance, regardless of whether you possess their property or not. Liens vs. Levies \" Levy. A seizure. The obtaining of money by legal process through seizure and sale of property; the raising of the money for which an execution has been issued. \"The process whereby a sheriff or other state official empower ed by writ or other judicial directive actually se izes, or otherwise brings under her control, a judgment debtor’s property which is taken to secure or satisfy the judgment.\" Black’s Law Dictionary , 6th Ed., p. 907"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"A levy is the outright seizure of a property in satisfacti on of a debt or obligation. A lien , on the other hand, is an encumbrance on property. Although the two often accompany one another in judicial or commerc ial actions, they are not the same thing. Chapter 4 - Procedures and Implementation Research First, obviously read everything in this manual, and anything else on the subject you can find. While this manual provides all th e most important basic information, it does not presume to possibly cover comprehensiv ely everything you would ever need to know on commercial liens. New information is coming out every day, and you may discover additional information from your own research and experience. Further, because Build Freedom is not in the business of giving licensed legal advice, even this manual cannot be relied upon as your law. This is simply information we believe to be accurate, and it is your responsibility to confirm that it complies with the laws in your state, to protect yourself. It is assumed that you will already have specific purpose in mind, for the use of the lien. You either have had property taken by officials in government-related agencies, which you would like returned, or you have otherwise been damaged by their specific actions or failure to fulfill their obligations in office. Or, you have some large ideological goal you would like fulfilled for th e benefit of society at large, like Mr. Marsh’s lien against the U.S. Government. Whatever the case, much of the language of the documents to be used will have to be composed by yourself, to articulate the necessary factors for the fulf illment of your chosen purpose. Notice and Demand The first document you will be creating is th e \"Notice and Demand.\" It is imperative that this step be included before filing the lien; otherwise, if this step is skipped, you could be prosecuted, convicted, fined, and jailed for failure to follow legal due process. Properly following due process is part of your actions being done in good faith. After an errant official has been served a Notice and Demand, he must be given a lawfully adequate period of time (check your local jurisdiction’s requirements) to correct his error or breach of contract. Us ually this is anywhere from 30 to 90 days. For example, there was a Notice and Dema nd reportedly served by Charles Gray (a pro se ) to Judge Joel Feldman in Georgia (see Appendix B.1 ). In this Notice, Mr. Gray alleges that Judge Feldman had broken various laws in the process of taking of some of Mr. Gray’s property to repay back taxes to the IRS. Although you can use ideas from Mr. Gray’s Notice and Demand, obviously your own must be custom designed for your ow n purpose. Yet there are certain common elements that should always characterize it:"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"1. It should be in the form of an Affidavit, and it should address the individual(s) personally. 2. The Notice should be as concise as po ssible, preferably avoiding religion or morality. It should focus on applicable law, a nd contain appropriate ci tations of law, if possible, to support what is being claimed. 3. It must quote the legal amount of time gi ven for the recipient to fulfill the demand, and what will happen if the demand is not satisfied within that time. 4. It should give the recipien t a certain period of time in which to rebut the claims made therein. 5. Finally, it should be hand-delivered or sent certified mail, return receipt requested. Notice of Default If the individual does not respond to or rebut your Notice and Demand (see Appendix B.1 ), you should then send a Notice of Default , stating that (1) the recipient has acquiesced to your claims by default, and that (2) payment or satisfaction is expected. Filing this Notice of Default (see Appendix B.2 ) with the County Recorder or Clerk of Court where the lien debt or has property creates a public , legal record in support of your subsequent lien. Commercial Lien If, after the lawful period passes without correction, only th en can a Commercial Lien be served to the offending o fficial or sent Certified Ma il, Return Receipt Requested, and also filed at the court house(s) for the county(ies) in which the offender has property . The lien must be accompanied by (or must contain) a Commercial Affidavit, containing a ledger of damages su ffered. The lien must also cite the law(s), action(s) or obligation(s) that gave rise to the damages. Models of both documents are listed in Appendix B . Lawsuits and Criminal Complaints Some pro se litigants will first file a lawsuit (Title 42 U.S. Code §1983) or a criminal complaint before filing a commercial lien. This step is included to show a \"good faith\" attempt to obtain justice according to normal legal procedures. After the courts refuse to consider the litigant’s legal co mplaints (which is usually the case), the litigant declares a state of \"Mixed War,\" and files the commercial lien. An example of a Criminal Complaint is included in Appendix B.4 . If you use it, you must change the document to suit your particular situation . There is no \"fill-in- the-blanks\" magic here! Chapter 5 - Mistakes and Pitfalls to Avoid"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Defective Legal Form and Procedure When filing any lien, it is important to follo w the legal forms and procedures of your state or locality. Study the stat utes for the locality in wh ich you are filing, and follow those forms and procedures religiousl y. Failure to do so can have serious consequences. First, you may be civilly liable for \"slander of title.\" In some jurisdictions (notably Louisiana) this is called \"j actitation,\" and a suit to rem ove the \"cloud of title\" and recover damages is known as an \"action of jactitation.\" Even worse, in many jurisdictions, someone who files liens in ba d faith, or who uses defective forms or procedures, can be c onvicted of \"felony slander of title.\" An example of the possible repercussions is s hown in the following newspaper article: Headline on March 3, 1993, front page of the San Luis Obispo Telegram Tribune: \"Bogus Lien Filer Convicted.\" \"When Sheriff Williams tried . . . to refinan ce his . . . home . . . a routine check of county records . . . showed someone had placed a $100,000 lien on the home . . . The lien was filed by ‘Steven K. Jones, whom Sheriff Williams had never seen,’ until they met in court on the issue of the lien. \"Jones defended himself without a lawyer against charges he filed the bogus liens against property owned by Sheriff Williams an d six others . . . who were involved in the sale of his truck . . . conducted by the Sheriff’s Department to collect a portion of the $22,000 in back taxes the Franchise Tax Board says Jones owes. \"Liens were also placed on property owned by the towing service operator who seized the truck and on the man who bought the truck at the tax auction. Jones later placed that man under citizen’s arrest for theft of this truck. \"Jones is one of what law enforcement authorities believe is a loosely affiliated group of county residents who call themselves common law citizens — people who take extraordinary steps to disavow government control in their lives. Jones has a notarized document renouncing his citizenship . . . has take n steps to void his birth certificate . . . relinquished his drivers licen se and social security number . . . and closed his bank account because the bank card, he believes, gives the bank power of attorney. \"Jones’s two sons, 13 and 12, sat with his wife throughout the week-long trial. They are taught at home and don’t attend school . . . ‘I have two small children who I want to see grow up . . . and not be slaves to the government,’ he told the jury. \"But the prosecuting attorney said Jones we nt too far when he filed official looking documents [the liens] for a $17 filing fee. According to the prosecutor, the documents were ‘just garbage.’ \"What Jones did is hardly a prank. Liens ar e a ‘ticking time bomb,’ said one expert on real estate law. ‘The victim doesn’t even know it exists. Once a lien is recorded, it remains on the books forever. Having a lien nullified — even one that’s fraudulent —"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"requires a court order. That process likely i nvolves hiring an atto rney and could take anywhere from months to years.’ \"A jury convicted Jones on two felony charges after deliberating less than a hour. The maximum punishment is three years in prison on each count and a $75,000 fine. \"Outside the courtroom, Jones admitted that recording the liens was a mistake. He couldn’t tell the jury, Jones c onfided, but he regrets what he did and blames advice from a Sacramento-based anti-tax organiza tion . . . which he paid $3,200 to join. He used documents supplied by the anti-tax orga nizations to file the liens.\" [Emphasis added] Evidently, Jones did not substant iate his liens with a \"true bill in commerce,\" nor did he serve the sheriff, et al, with the proper Notice and Demand (commercial grace). The prosecuting attorney used both of these facts as eviden ce of bad faith, and easily obtained a conviction. Let that e xperience be a lesson to others! Don’t use this material unless you are very sure you know what you’re doing. Any actual results are your own responsibility. The pro cedures discussed in this manual are not to be used \"for fun.\" Consider them to be \"of academic interest only\" if you’re less than fully sure, in good faith, of what you’re doing. You, and you alone, are fully responsible for any results that might arise from any actual use of these materials. We specificall y disclaim any such responsibility. \"Hanson-type\" or \"Nebulous\" Liens In the 1970’s, a man named Gerald Hanson started filing liens on various government officials whom he regarded as corrupt. According to Hartford Van Dyke, a current exponent of the Commercial Lien Strategy, Hanson’s liens were \"nebulous.\" Apparently, Hanson did not connect the o fficials’ misconduct with any specific monetary damages suffered by him. (In other words, they were not true bills in commerce. Therefore, judges ru led that these liens were Lis Pendens Liens, rendering them subject to equity proceedings. That, of course, defeats the entire purpose of the commercial lien strategy. A lien seems more likely to stand if a specific official violated he r/his oath of office, resulting in specific and identifiable damages to you. \"Hanson-type\" liens and \"class action liens\" (such as Phil Mars h’s) stand on a shakier foundation. Aiming Too High Many proponents of the Commerci al Lien Strategy have file d liens (like Phil Marsh’s) upon the President of the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury, state governors and the like. Whether or not such liens are legally accurate, they create a credibility problem. First of all, did the President (for example) damage you by his specific actions? If not, your lien has a weak foundation. Second, if you file such a lien, you may temporarily get the attention of the public official (and some headlines) but you ultimately risk looking like a \"crank.\" Rather than aiming to win \"big,\" you may be more effective filing $10,000 or $100,000 liens on minor officials (like IRS agents) who have less public sympathy, and are easier targets. Judges and sheriffs ar e more difficult, but not impossible. In the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"case of a judge or a sheriff, it may be advisable to give more Notices of Demand than you technically have to. This shows \"good fa ith,\" and gives the other party a chance to correct the fault. Beware of \"Exotic\" Arguments Another \"double-edged sword\" is the insertion of books like Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars as evidence for a lien or a suit. The question here is not one of merit, but effectiveness. Can you win with such ev idence? The answer is, \"it depends.\" Dr. Gene Schroeder, of the American Agri cultural Movement, appealed a case last year, in which he submitted evidence that the Federal court’s Admiralty jurisdiction was obtained by a written declaration of war upon the American people , enacted by Congress March 9, 1933 (48 Stat. 1). He states that two Federal judges involved with the case resigned (\"retired\") shortly after the appeal was over. So, yes, it can work. However, the risk of this approach is obvious. Unless your evidence is very strong, and you (or your lawyer) have superb presentation and speaking skills, you risk looking like a \"mental case\" if your ac tion ever comes in front of a jury. The key here may not be legal, but psychol ogical. You need to have an accurate measure of your opposition. If your \"exotic\" evidence is strong, and you can scare off the prosecutor with an \"embarrassing issue, \" then it may be effective. However, if your opponent is psychologically more secure , that may not work. To put it another way, what you can frighten a prosecutor or a judge with is one matter, but what you can convince \"twelve people in a jury box\" to believe may be quite another! Before you use such evidence (either in a lie n or in court) you should take an honest inventory of yourself. Do you have the ps ychological acumen, the strategic thinking skills and the rational courag e (which does not cross the line into recklessness) to effectively use this evidence? If so, well and good. If not, you may wish to use more conservative strategies. \"Know yourself, and know your enemy, and in a thousand battles you will never be in peril\" — Sun-tzu, The Art of War Chapter 6 - Obstacles and Strategies for Overcoming Them Refusal to File Liens There have been instances reported (in Ca lifornia and Ohio, primarily) where county recorders or clerks of court refuse to file Commercial Li ens on government officials. Usually, they have been instructed by their (frightened) supe riors to do so. One strategy for dealing with th is problem (based on the Uniform Commercial Code) is described by David DeReimer as follows: 1. Bring at least two witnesses along to every face-to-face meeting with the clerk, Recorder of Deeds, Sheriff, etc."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"2. After the meeting, have your witnesses prepare sworn affidavits of whatever they saw and heard the clerk, offi cial, sheriff, say, do, etc. 3. Get a written explanation or reason from cl erk who refuses to record your document. 4. As per your state Unifor m Commercial Code section 3-505/501, send a \"Notice And Demand For Exhibition Or Pr esentment Without Dishonor\" by certified mail to the office that refused to accept your lien, demanding that they exhibit: a) The Statute or Law passed by the Legislature which authorizes them to condemn the \"Public\" records for thei r personal and private use; b) Their personal Bar/Lawyer I.D. Number issued by the State Bar or State Supreme Court which authorizes them to ma ke \"Legal Determinations\"; and, c) The Statute or Law passed by the Legislature which authorizes them to edit and/or censor documents prior to recording. Give them reasonable time (30 days) to comply with your DEMAND to prove written authority, and then put them ON NOTICE that the \"Law of Principal and Agent\" specifies that \"The Agent is personally liable for acts not authorized by the Principal.\" As such, unless there are laws granting the cl erk the power to refuse to record certain documents, the clerk/agent has no corporate ve il of immunity for his refusals and may be personally vulnerable to a lawsuit. 5. If, after the reas onable time has elapsed, and they have failed to produce the written \"authority\" you Demanded, se nd a Notice Of Default by certified mail, noticing them that they have defaulted by not answering. In it, provide them with a \"right to cure\" their Default by recording your original li en (or other documen ts) without further interference, or suffer the consequences. Allow 10 to 30 days for their response. 6. If they don’t respond in the 10 to 30 days, send them via certified mail, a \"Notice of Amount Due\" for the damage caused by their injury to you (or your Property Rights) by their defalcation, dereliction of duty, de fault, and unauthorized \"Refusal to Record\" in a sizable amount ($1,000??). Agai n, give them reasonable time (30 days) to pay you. 7. After the 30 days reasonable time has pa ssed (plus 4 or 5 days for the mail), send them certified mail a \"Final Notice of Amount Due\" for the damage caused by their injury to you. Again, give them reasonabl e time (30 days) to pay you the amount of damages you’ve demanded. 8. If they don’t pay your \"Final Notice\" Demand in 30 days (plus 4 or 5 days for the mail), go to the Country Elected Peace Offi cer (Sheriff), present copies of the two certified mail Demands for payment, sign a \"Distre ss Warrant\" or \"Distraint Warrant\" stating that you have NOT been paid, and ha ve the Sheriff go get your money or sell the clerk’s assets."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"9. If the Sheriff refuses to execute your \"Distraint Warrant,\" inform him that you personally will perform his sworn duty FO R HIM, and on his behalf. Inform him, also, that the newspapers will be informed that he has refused to perform his own sworn duty but continues to cash his pay ch eck, and that this constitutes FRAUD by him since he only performs \"Selective Enfor cement\" of the law — which is unlawful. Inform him that the resultan t publicity may have a negative impact on his chances for running for reelection, and that you may have to sue him in his personal capacity for money damages due to his Dere liction of Duty, Defalcati on, Embezzlement of Public Funds, and damage due to his injury to you and/or your property rights. 10. Send the Sheriff certified mail a \"Notice and Demand For Production or Exhibition Without Dishonor\" of the Law or statute that authorizes him to: a) perform \"selective enforcement\" of the Law; b) accept the People’s pay and not execute on lawful Warrants; c) personally edit and censor docum ents, or refuse to perform his duty under his sworn oath . 11. If either the Sheriff or th e Recorder of Deeds says that they take their \"orders\" from some government lawyer, get that in writing. After, and only after, you have the above \"Admission and Confession\" in writing, leave their office. Then perform the previous certified mail step and add item: d) provide the Statute or Law passed by th e Legislature that authorizes them to relinquish their office over to another (w hoever — regardless of whether they’re government attorneys or not) while continui ng to accept and negotiate (cash) their pay check after having turned over th eir office to said \"other.\" Once the clerks, sheriffs, etc. realize their po tential liability, it is likely that they will do their duty long before you get to step 11. Here’s an alternative analysis, which may have a better practical success rate in accomplishing your goal of getting various documents recorded as a matter of public record, in good faith: In some counties among the thousands of counties in the U.S., you may find recalcitrant clerks who will refuse to file your properly-executed documents. While such clerks are violating thei r sworn public duty to record and make a matter of public record your properly-executed doc uments, as a practical matter suing a recalcitrant country clerk usually will be less effective than various alternatives. Your best bet is probably: (1) Be low profile in reco rding any properly-executed, good-faith documents. Don’t particularly discuss the contents of the documents you’re filing with the clerk. You’re not trying to hide anything — after all, you’re making a matter of public record various statements you are affirming the truth of, in good faith. But attracting undue attention may impede th e progress of anything you may wish to make a matter of public record. (2) If you do r un into a recalcitrant clerk who doesn’t like what you’re doing, simply try another county, or try the same county on a different occasion . This fits very well with our st rategy of \"creati ng your own creative"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"alternatives\" when confronted with certai n bureaucratic obstacles. If you try another county, remember that for some types of documents there may be a requirement that property that’s a \"subject\" of the documents may have to be located in the county of recording. (3) You could as a different alternative try using appropriate media publications to make your documents a matter of public record (by \"publishing the document\"). You’ll need to rese arch the particulars of how to do this in your area, if you use this option. But finding a county cl erk that does their job routinely and properly is probably lower-profile. Abuse of Judicial Power There have been cases reported of judges who have threatened to jail lienors for \"contempt of court\" if they do not \"voluntarily\" lift their liens. In two cases, the judges actually carried out th eir threat. Such legal coerci on on their part is almost certainly unlawful. Nonetheless, some judges will use that tactic, if they think the lienor is vulnerable. To deal with this problem, it is helpful to remember the following: 1. The only reason the judge is making that th reat is because he has no lawful means of extinguishing the lien. It is a move of fear and desperation. 2. Assess your own vulnerability. Will a few days in jail seriously affect your life? If not, you have some psychological leverage. Ot herwise, the judge has a lever over you. 3. If your lien does end up in court, you ma y want to have a lawyer or a talented pro se with you, so that somebody can file an effective writ of habeas corpus, if necessary. Also, you may wish to learn how to effectively defend yourself against contempt charges. 4. If the judge actually does imprison you on a bogus contempt charge, he becomes personally liable for civil damages under Title 42 USC §1983 (or st ate equivalent), criminal sanctions, and a commercial lien. The judge is taking a risk by violating your rights. He is probably hopi ng that you don’t know how to pursue an effective legal remedy. In many ways, this is a game of \"chicken.\" Chapter 7 - The Coloring Agreement Approach Background Many libertarian and patriot pro se litigants have had their Constitutional arguments rejected by a Federal judge, with the word s \"We won’t have that document in this courtroom; this is an Admiralty court, not a court of law!\" Don Smith, a pro se \"attorney-in-fact,\" has devise d an approach that may get around this problem. He calls it \"The Coloring Agreement.\" The idea is to make the Constitution and the Bill of Rights c olorable law in Admiralty jurisdiction. In this way, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are simply contractual provisions that can be enforced in an Admiralty court. This is a kind of \"Chinese box\" approach to the Constitution, whereby: • The Constitution encompasses Admiralty jurisdiction, and"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"• Admiralty jurisdiction encompasses the Uniform Commercial Code, and • The U.C.C. encompasses contracts, in cluding the \"coloring agreement\" and • The \"coloring agreement\" encompasses the Constitution, once again! Instructions If a Federal, state or local o fficial violates your rights (or credibly threatens to do so), take the Coloring Agreement ( Appendix B.5 ), substitute your name and the name of the government official in question, and be sure to substitute all references to Arizona law with those of your own state or locality. If the presentee is a Federal official, you may choose to omit the references to state law. Present the Coloring Agreement to the offici al in question, either in person or by certified mail. If the official is under oa th to defend the Constitution of the United States (or the state in question), (s)he is bound by the agreement, whether or not (s)he accepts it or dishonors it. Present the agreem ent up to three times. If it is returned (dishonored) each time, then you may sue to compel him/her to accept it, based upon the oath of office. Don Smith expands upon the theory as follo ws: \"The object is to create a civil contract (not tort) liability for the govern ment agent for violating your constitutional rights, which rights are probably not part of the agreement that you signed, and is the reason the government agent is bothering you in the first place. This will likely have a chilling effect on the agent’s activities toward you; i.e ., you will probably not hear from him again . . . \"For any violation, simply file contract (not tort) action to recover the amount specified in the Coloring Agreement’s sche dule. If the violator is a Federal sworn employee, sue in U.S. Court of Federal Claims, 717 Madison Pl N.W., Washington, D.C. . . . \"When The Beast invades [your] rights thereaf ter, your suit is in CONTRACT instead of equity. If IRS is involved, this moves th e case into the Court of Claims, if over $10,000, sounding in admiralty-instance. Unde r $10,000, the District Court sits as a Court of Claims to enforce the contract di spute if a federal defendant, and if the case sounds in admiralty-instance . . . You WA NT TO BE IN ADMIRALTY, not equity, since you don’t have any ‘squish’ in the deci sion of the court. The same can be done in state court, sounding in admiralty-instance. You need only characterize your pleading as a complaint in the way of libel. Libels may be used for judgments as well as prize. You want strict enforcem ent of the contract. You don’t want equity civil rights enforcement . . . \"If the government employee/official ignores the Coloring Agreement and proceeds to violate the rights you have established by c ontract, you may file a Commercial Lien against him . . . \" [for a sample lien see Appendix B.8 ]. Smith points out that this approach only creates an agreement between you and the specific government official involved. He also states that it will only work if the official has sworn an oath of office; otherwise the offici al will simply dishonor the agreement. However, if the official is not unde r an oath of office, this can still have a chilling effect."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Imagine an official pleading, in court, to ha ve the agreement set aside because he (the official) has not sworn an oath of office! This creates many \"embarrassing issues.\" For example, if the official is not under oath, is he an impostor, acting in his own capacity? If not, who does he really work for? Are all his official acts legally void? Should all prisoners prosecuted by him/her be released from prison ? Rather than open up such a \"can of worms,\" the \"oathless\" official is much more likely to drop matters and leave you alone.

If you encounter one of these megalomaniacs, he may decide to exceed his lawful power and jail you for contempt of court (for insisting on your lawful rights). Since he cannot declare the lien illegal or invalid, charging you with contempt of court is probably his only recourse — his last resort . . . So as you already know, you can be absolutely right in your application of the law, and still wind up in the slammer. Therefore, before you start \"liening on\" government officials, you’d best learn how to de fend yourself against contempt citations. The various lien strategies are not toys for playful pro se ’s. These strategies appear to be so powerful, so threatening to the \"b ad guys,\" that you can bet that they will respond forcefully and exploit whatever power s they have, lawful or otherwise, to defeat these liens. So be careful. IT TAKES MORE THAN BRAINS Judges routinely abuse their authority and ge t away with it, so what’s to stop ’em from abusing their authority in any case involving commercial liens?"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"You. Your courage. Your commitment. Br ains and knowledge ar e not enough. It also takes guts. Only you can stop the judicial abuse. And, initially, it’ll be tough. There will be some casualties. But what it boils down to is this: 1) This is a Civil Ri ghts struggle. It’s po litical . That means lots of people. Therefore, you can’t go after the system or its he nchmen by yourself — you must work with others who are in a position to support you in court, in the media, and, if necessary, in jail. 2) Initially, a few folks who file commercial liens will have to be willing to \"pay the price\" of going to jail in order to draw medi a attention to the judi cial abuse and to the original crimes that precipitated the particul ar commercial lien. (If that thought is distressing, realize that from th e point of view of the \"oth er side\" it will be necessary for a few judges to risk being sued, impeached, even jailed in order to \"scare\" us out of filing liens; i.e., unknown to most of us, the judges are also in jeopardy.) 3) A judicial t hreat is not the same as a judicial act . Threatening to jail you is not likely to create a \"cause of action\" since you have not been \"damaged.\" Without the \"damage\" of false imprisonment, you can’t su e/lien the judge himself. So the judge is more interested in threatening (bluffing) you into compliance than in actually jailing you since your incarceration may expose the judge himself to personal liability. 4) Just as judges will try to scare us off with threats of contempt, we must try to scare the judges with \"threats\" of public exposure, and even civ il and criminal charges filed against the judges. The \"law\" is not the only issue. This is also a test of will and nerve. He’s got to know that you won’t quit. . . . You’ve got to realize that th e \"practice of law\" involves a great deal more than just \"law.\" It involves psychological warfare, gu ile, bluff, and the ability to \"read\" your adversary. Remember, despite what you might be led to believe by the movies, court cases are not scholarly \"debates\" so much as contests, even street fights. Knowing the law is just the beginning. You’ve also got to be able to \"know your opponent\" and, also, to keep your opponent from \"knowing\" you. . . . It’s not enough to have the words. You’ve got to have the guts enough to stand behind them, knowing that you might not win, knowing that you might even suffer a serious punishment for saying the words. If the j udge smells fear, he can slap you around even if you’re right. If he smells cour age and conviction sufficient to cause him personal liability , he will be reluctant to mi streat you even if you are wrong. This is not just law, it’s politics. And more than politics, it’s a fight. A fight . Do you understand? Complete with black eyes and bloody noses, and sometimes even worse. But it’s a fair fight, because, as bad as t hose judges may be, they are human and they know they are outnumbered thousands to one. The judge can hurt you if you stand alone, but if you stand with ot hers, you can hurt the judge."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"In the final analysis, the issue will be settled as an act of will and courage. It will be won by the side that refuses to lose. A \"SILVER BULLET RIFLE\" \"Patriot\" and \"pro se\" public ations . . . routinely presen t new strategies which purport to overcome the various forms of instituti onalized injustice in the American legal system. Often, these new strategies are implicitly \"guaranteed\" to work first-time- every-time to quickly defeat injustice and ach ieve results most people would regard as impossible. These \"can’t lose\" strategies are generall y known as \"Silver Bullets.\" Adherents of these Silver Bullet strategies often embrace and espouse them with a religious fervor, so sure that they are absolutely right, th ey tolerate no deviation from their \"ultimate truth.\" Critics, however, remind us that the term \"Silver Bullets\" is derived from the \"can’t miss\" accuracy of the Lone Ranger and the mystical effect of \"silver bullets\" on werewolves and other creatures of the night (like lawyers, judges and IRS agents). These critics contend that today’s Silver Bu llets are every bit as fictitious as their forebears, and to believe in any of them is equally naive or perhaps even delusional. The critics may be right. Perhaps there are no Si lver Bullets to stop injustice. After all, our laws and courts are so capricious and complex, that every search for Justice has become a kind of crap-shoot in which anything is possible and nothing can be precisely predicted or relied upon. So do Silver Bullets really exist? I think they do. I believe in Silver Bullets b ecause ultimately, I believe in rule by law rather than rule by men , and so I mus t believe in the LAW and its essence — Silver Bullets. After all, in the final analysis, Silver Bullets are nothing more than quintessential, irrefutable, unbeatable principles and a pplications of LAW. . . . So, having confessed my belief in Silver Bu llets, do I claim to sell ’em in publications like this [AntiShyster]? Can you depend on ev ery article, on every opinion, on every word we publish to be accurate, irrefutable, and \"guaranteed\" to give you victory every time? Absolutely not. Can you depend on any of the theories and strategies presented in this publication to qualify as Silver Bullets? Maybe. Sometimes. Actually, it depends . . ."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Depends on what? Depends on you . To continue the Silver Bu llet analogy, answer this: Do you think you can throw a Silver Bullet with enough arm speed and accuracy to pierce the heart of a charging werewolf? Of course not. See my point? Armed with Silver Bullets and a proper rifle , you can kill werewolves. But without a rifle , Silver Bullets are no bette r than a handful of pebbles. Without the proper rifle, all you can do is fling bullets at the were wolf, and that’ll only make the mutt mad. So, where can you buy a \"rifle\" that shoots S ilver Bullets? Sorry, you can’t buy one. But you can make your own. And where can you make such a \"rifle\"? In a quiet room, a freedomry, or a church. So metimes on an athletic field, in a war, or hospital emergency room. Does this \"Silver Bullet Rifle\" analogy confus e you? Well, it’s just a riddle to try to make my point: You see, you are the \"Rifle.\" Just as you can’t shoot a .22 caliber bullet w ithout a .22 caliber rifle, you can’t fire a Silver Bullet without a \"Silver Bullet Rifle.\" To successfully aim and fire a Silver Bullet, you must become a \"Silver Bullet Rifle.\" You must be \"machined\" to achieve the proper caliber and barrel strength to withstand the explosion. You must have your \"sights\" aligned with solid judgment to reliably strike your target. And, pe rhaps most importantly, you must have or create enough personal courage to pull the trigger. To fire Silver Bullets, you need more than information, you need understandin g — which only you can provide. And more th an understanding, you need determination, persistence and courage — in other words, you must have the personal c haracter necessary to \"shoot werewolves.\" So who will \"machine\" you into a \"rifle\" of the proper strength and caliber to fire Silver Bullets? The answe r’s obvious. It’s a do-it-yourself project and you’re it. And how will you \"machine yourself\" into a Silver Bullet Rifle? The answer is beyond the scope of this publication. Suffice it to say that each of us will use a different method to discover or create our own courage, morality and character. But know that you can’t fire Silver Bullets accurately until you first make yourself into someone with a long-term commitment to Just ice rather than a shor t-term appetite for a quick personal advantage."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Remember, Silver Bullets are not magic incantations. Some folks use Silver Bullets with great success; others us e the very same words and fo rms but fail. It’s not enough to merely say the words or fill out the form. You must understand what you are doing. Silver Bullets are merely in structions, procedures and directions which tell you how someone else killed their particular werewo lf. Silver Bullets provide only information. You must provide the understa nding, courage and character necessary to apply the information correctly. . . . Don’t depend on mere words and form s; don’t depend on luck. Don’t depend on Silver Bullets. Depend on you . Depend on your perseverance, your understanding, and your determination to seek Justice ra ther than unearned wealth or revenge. So. Are the theories and strate gies in this publication Silv er Bullets? Maybe. Will they save your house or your car? Will they save your money, your job, your business, or your family? Sometimes, yes. Sometimes, no. But even if you lose, your efforts won’t go unrewarded. In the end, the search for Silver Bullets may create something unexpected and more valuable than property or even relationships: it may create a human \"Rifle\" — a moral being endowed with understanding, courage and character. Belie ve it or not, the c ontinuing study of Law (not procedure, which the lawyers revere) wi ll lead you to the concep t of Justice, then to morality, on to religion, and fi nally, perhaps, even to God. So good luck to you, ladies and gentlemen. You have begun a long journey and a challenging hunt. You may have started by looking for Silver Bullets, but you may end by finding, even creating, a person of real value — yourself. Editor’s comment: For most worthwhile things, you must expand your personal power. We at Build Freedom don’t generally fi gure there are \"Silver Bullet\" solutions that will work all the time. But Mr. Adask’s comments are an excellent exposition of some of the thinking skills required for success in any use you might make of this manual, and for success in general. The conduit (rifle) is you! You are the one who needs to individually determine (in good faith of course) what statutes apply to you. You are the one who needs to apply information in a manner that applies to you in that particular situation. It is then, and only then, that you have knowledge about that subject.

The Respondents were previously no ticed and warned by the Affiant’s \"COMMERCIAL AFFIDAVIT, NOTICE OF NON-JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS, NOTICE AND WARNING OF COMMERCIAL GR ACE\" (see Exhibit A), to which the Respondents did not answ er/rebut, or answered wit hout addressing the demands made, (see Exhibits ..., [if any]). In said NOTICE AND WARNING the eternal principles of Commercial Law, the underp innings of all human law and civilization, were clearly and simply set forth and expl ained (clarification of contractual terms). The above referenced Respondent parties failed to avail themselves of the remedies and recourse under Commercial Law to resolve the dispute(s) with this Complainant Affiant in a civil, peaceful and honorable manner. All of the Affidavits, Notices, and filings, of this Complainant Affiant have been issued as the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, to the best of my experience, knowledge and belief. The Affida vits I have issued were sworn to as TRUE, CORRECT, and COMPLETE. Said Affi davits have never been formally rebutted by affidavits sworn to as TRUE, CORRECT, and COMPLETE by the respective Respondent Parties.

The Respondents have admitted to and acquiesced to the crimes which the Complainant Affiant complained about and sought to protect himself from further abuses.

In this matter, the Complainant Affiant is the victim, the Commercial Affidavit sets the complained issues and this Criminal Complaint defines the crimes verifies the actual damages, and the intent wa s established by proof that the Respondents/Defendants were Noticed and Warned of their wrongs and what was required to right them. Their failing to rebut the Affidavit or pr ove their own claims, the contractual requirement of this Complainant Affiant’s Commercial Affidavit of Notice and Warning, the Respondents/ Defendants acted willfully against this Complainant Affiant. The Complainant Affiant exercises his unalienable Sovereign Right against [respondents], a legislative entity, and its o fficers for a redress of grievances (fraud, extortion, theft, plus other noted wrongs ) by this verified Criminal Complaint (California Penal Code Sections 740, 806 and 948 et.seq .) pursuant the Commercial instrument of the people known as the Cons titution for the State of California, as stated in the Preamble, Arti cle I Sections 1, 3, 24; Article II Section 1; Article III Section 5, 6(d); California Civil Code Section 4, 5, 22.2; California Penal Code Section 9; California Government Code Section 100, 11120, and 54950 as a Sovereign and the parallel sections of th e Constitution for the United States, United States Codes Title 18, the United State Cr iminal Code and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Therefore, the Complainant Affiant, [name] , sets forth to the candid community the abuses of FELONY, HIGH CRIMES and MISDEMEANORS by the Respondents. The above named Respondents, in the instan t action have supported criminal actions by willfully and knowingly: — DENIED A RIGHT to due process of law. Such denials include but are not limited to the right to work, the right to receive just reward of labors, denying access to the multiple Constitutional rights and specifically acting against the Complainant Affiant under a color of official right . It is a \"taking action\" denying the right to personal property violative of the provisions of the state Constitutional provisions and under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution for the United States. The right of due process of law requires be fore any sort of judgment against an individual, that he has had opportunity to defend himself of any accusation or claim, that he has had an opportunity to state his case, he has had a proper and lawful judgement by a jury of his peers, or by a knowledgeable waiver of the right to answer. The [respondents] officials acted against th at due process by acting in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the Complainant Affi ant of his property, giving such property to the [state taxing authority] [and/ or] the IRS, WITHOUT ANY KIND OF LAWFUL JUDGEMENT, COMMERCIAL PAPERWORK, CONTRACTS OR PROOF OF CLAIMS. [respondents] are/ is therefore guilty of denying the COMPLAINANT AFFIANT [name], every C onstitutional protection afforded — an act of TREASON (defined below), an act of a MIXED DOMESTIC WAR. DOMESTIC MIXED WAR - A mixed war is one which is made on one side by public authority, and the other by mere priv ate persons. (Black’s Law Dictionary 5th"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Ed., page 1420). War does not exist merely because of an armed attack by military forces of another nation until it is a c ondition recognized or accepted by political authority of government which is attacked, ei ther through an actual declaration of war or OTHER ACTS DEMONSTRATING SU CH POSITION (emphasis added; Savage v. Sun Life Assur Co. of Canada , D.C. 57 F Supp 620, 621). — WAR is the disintegration of peace; Webste r’s states \"a state of hostility, conflict or antagonism, a struggle between opposi ng forces,\" not nece ssarily open violent armed confrontations, although a continued state of disrupted peace by any force could lead to open armed conflict. The defendants are hereby accused of the following crimes against, and violations of the rights of the people of this [state] REPUBLIC. Such rights or obligations are secured, preserved or defined by the Constitution to prevent such abuses by both employer and of government officials by thei r oaths to support said Constitution (67 CJS, Officers, Section 46, Oaths). — MALFEASANCE OF OFFICE. By such wr ongful action, these individuals have acted with malfeasance of office in conspi racy with Agents of the [state taxing authority] [and/or] [IRS], deliberately, knowi ngly and willfully violating said rights are guilty of misconduct in office, whether public or private. — SLAVERY. The civil relation in which one man has absolute power over the life, fortune, and liberty of another. The Responde nts have denied the right to \"fortunes\" earned by the labors of the Affiant. The unlawful conversion of such property and giving it to another without due process of law, forcing the Affiant to work for less than what was lawfully and contractually agreed upon, breaching interpersonal contracts and relationships, is criminal. The Respondents have absolutely refused to communicate in GOOD FAITH with the Affiant. They have refused to disclose the lawful authority by which they act, the cont ract in default or the damages which they claim created the so-called liability. There is no judgment of any kind that they can produce showing any liability. By such actions , these have destroyed the right to life, liberty and property by such taking of pers onal property without due process of law, reducing the Affiant to the condition of a slav e. As such, these are in fact in violation of the State and Federal Constitutions that abolished slavery. — TREASON. Treason is defined as the assa ult against the authority to whom one owes allegiance. It is one of three spec ific crimes named in the United States Constitution. It requires that one commit an act of war against the Constitution, or giving aid and comfort to an enemy. Such clearly defined actions by government officers and such private officers who have privileged authority in commerce by the Constitution, in specific connection to the above violation, malfeasance of office along with violating their oath of office and in the related connected activities herein as listed below is nothing short of TR EASON, see DOMESTIC MIXED WAR above, and there is no other term or set of term s that accurately define such activity. [respondents] have willfully violated the ba sic fundamental principles this Country was founded on, and therefore condoned the acts of TREASON by so-called governmental officials against the Undersi gned, making them liable for such acts of TREASON by refusing to stop such actions against the Complainant Affiant [name],"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"when they had the power and authority to do so after being noticed (criminally under Title 18, Section 4; civilly under Title 42, Section 1983, 1985, 1986). In addition to and along with the above cited crimes, the Respondents acting in concert with such so-called government officials to complete such acts as listed as follows: — FRAUD. Permitting shown and demonstrated acts of fraud and actively participated in a scheming conspiracy of untruths and misrepresentations to deceive those who entrusted themselves in dealing in good faith, while specifically acting in deliberate bad faith when such fraud was shown (Cal Penal Code Sec. 532; 18 USC 1001). — EXTORTION. By such actions of Fraud, said Respondents under assumed (usurped) official right and color of offi ce to demand, without any real lawful or proper authority, gave monies of the Comp lainant Affiant to the Internal Revenue Service and/or the [state taxing authority] as foreign agents (explained below) by use of such misrepresentations and untruths to steal monies under a color and cover of law to raise revenue (Cal Penal C ode Sec 518, 519; 18 USC 872, 873, 1951, 1962). — GRAND THEFT. By such act ions of fraud and extortion, the monies stolen, or damages sustained by such actions totalled over $400 under a guise of taxes, fines and/or penalties under a color of law for exercising one’s inalienable/unalienable rights (Cal Penal Code Sec 487; 18 USC 641 {>$100}, 2112). — ROBBERY. (Attempted robbery) Respondents, by such action of conspiracy under a color of law and official right, used in timidation, threats, and fear by force of imprisonment to extort revenues (Cal Pena l Code Sec. 211; 18 USC 2112).

This is further demons trated by the act of firing [name] for simply exposing the crimes be ing perpetrated against him within the Company.] — FALSE DOCUMENTS. Accepting false documen ts that are known not to be true or known to be false to falsely condemn th e Complainant Affiant under a color of law without benefit of a lawful trial, to raise revenue by stealing monies of the Complainant Affiant and giving it direc tly to a foreign agent by such false condemnations (Cal Penal Code Sec 134; 18 USC 1001). — CONSPIRACY.

Such cr imes and this Affidavit of Information is filed in the overall context of the Bankruptcy of the United States (i.e. District of Columbia, as per jurisdiction set forth in the U.S. Constitution Article I, Section 8, clause 17 and 18 and Article IV Section 3 clause 2). The Un ited States bankruptcy is a direct result of the Federal Reserve Act of December 23, 1913, in which the delegated authority of Congress to be responsible for the nati on’s currency was illicitly, unconstitutionally, and treasonously surrendered to the privately owned Federal Reserve Corporation (a foreign agent), whose class A stockholders are various international banks. In place of real money as legal tender (gold and silver coin U.S. Constitution Article I Section 10, Coinage Act April 2, 1792), the Federal Reserve issued private commercial paper, drawn on the credit of the United States, consisting of only bookkeeping entries of no substan ce or reality, on which a real compound interest was charged. The U.S. Treasury paid the ever-increasing interest in gold and was eventually depleted, with a higher de bt than ever. The planned inevitability occurred: BANKRUPTCY. This bankruptcy was clearly reiterated on March 17, 1993 on the floor of the House of Representatives by James Traficant, Jr. (Ohio) addressing the House. It is recorded in the United States Congressional Recor d, Wednesday, March 17, 1993, Volume #33, page H1303, should anyone doubt the claim. . . . \"Mister Speaker. We are here now in Chap ter 11.
