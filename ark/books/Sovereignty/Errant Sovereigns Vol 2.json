Many changes have occurred in our nation and in our world since that time. This volume of the handbook addresses some of the more important of those changes in the same simple, straight-forward writing style found in Volume I. Although Gus Blackstone and I are ofao age, it seems quite natural to think of him in the context of an \"uncle\" with the insightful wisdom of an ancient, liberally tempered with a youthful spirit of play. The only times I have ever seen the man get deadly serious is when something touched upon his personal honor and integrity. As one of his designated \"star pupils\" of many years, I consider it an honor and a privilege to be tasked with the writing of this preface. Contrary to what many seem to believe, Gus is a working man. He supports himself primarily by the sweat of his brow and has done so all of his life by free will choice. He says it helps him sleep better at night. (And you can take whatever meaning you like from that.) For many years Gus offered advice to family, friends and acquaintances on how to responsibly keep government bureaucracy at arm's length, particularly on the subjects ofI.RS., property taxes and traffic enforcement. Gus even dipped his oar into the waters of litigation to acquire the skills and the certainty iitherent in the experience as well as to \"map out the emotional geography and mental topography of the maggots (BAR attorneys and judges)\". And he does not use that term recklessly or disparagingly. He uses it for descriptive accuracy. We live on a symbiotic planet and maggots, the larva offlies, are a vital part of the process of decay, so that organic life might renew itself. BAR attorneys and judges (and professional politicians) serve a very similar function in the affairs of mankind. That particular mind-set is the principal architect of the decay and eventual downfall of every civilization in mankind's history on this planet. The founder of Christianity accurately pegged the profession over twenty centuries ago, but it seems there are very few who choose to believe even Him, let alone what's in plain view."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"2 As a result of ever increasing demands on his available time, with most questions and their answers 1;>ecoming an exercise in time consuming repetition, Gus wrote The Errant Sovereign's Handbook in 1996 in order to free-up more time for his own interests. Unfortunately for him, it had just the opposite effect. The resultant feedback correspondence was explosive and quickly reached overwhelming proportions, leaving Gus with even less free time. I can say this with a fair degree of certainty because I was a major contributor to the persistent pestering. In order to make the entire body of information more comfortably confrontable and affordable to a larger number of people, Gus was originally intending to deliver the information in \"instalments\" by writing four more volumes of the handbook over a period of two years. Between the need to support himself in his day-to-day work and the ever increasing mail load, Gus had no available time to write the other four volumes. And the release date for Volume IT kept getting pushed further and further forward. As a stop-gap measure, Gus would periodically send out an \"open letter\" the contents of which were drawn from his manuscript notes for future volumes. Most of that information appears again in this volume and will not be new to those who were sent copies of the various open letters .... which span over eight years of time. Also during that span of time The Final Solution To Property Tax was made available as a companion book to Volume I of the handbook for the benefit of those who's primary interest was in removing their real property from the tax rolls. The companion book provides the additional steps necessary to fully restore allodial character to and Lawfully up-date the original title (Land'Patent) to one's real property in one's own name. In the fall of 2001 all of Gus' worldly possessions (except for what he happened to wearing at the time) were completely destroyed by an arson caused (MJTF sponsored) fire. He had no conventional insurance, so he had to start rebuilding his life from zero ... not for the first time in his life and not easy to do when you no longer have tools, transportation, clothes or a roof over your head. And the older one gets, the more difficult recovery can be. Gus once said that the most reliable \"insurance\" one has is situated between the ears. Always one to lead by example, Gus is living proof of the truth of that belief and practice."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"3 The arson incident effectively put the actual production of subsequent volumes of the handbook very much in question. And it could be convincingly argued that was the purpose behind the arson. Gus had accumulated some documented evidence of treason in high places that cannot now be replaced. Then, in January of2005 7 Gus experienced a \"major\" heart attack. It was \"major\" only because he didn't recognize what it was and did not immediately attend to it. The delay greatly increased the damage done to the organ. This incident has had a profound effect on his ability to make a living in the ways to which he is accustomed. He has had to re-evaluate various priorities in light of un~ertainties his \"busted pump\" create with regard to downloading what's in his head before he \"graduates to the next level of existence\". He's not at all intimidated by the idea of bodily death, but admits that some of the methods of getting there could be daunting. Full commitment to have this second volume of the handbook ready for release as quickly as possible did no~ however 7 come about until Gus 7 postal service address of long . standing was arbitrarily \"discontinued\" on two days notice in June, 2005. One could say that Gus has had more than his fair share of life's challenges and frustrations. Always the optimist, he responded to that observation ~ \"One does not truly know his limits unless fully tested by adversity. No pain 7 no gain. Mankind has always survived best in a challenging environment. \" Volume I of the handbook was intentionally written from a non-adversarial, non- confrontational point of view. Partly because Gus was asked to do so and partly because it is the duty of a responsible sovereign to fix a system gone haywire with minimal disruption to that system, unless stronger measures are absolutely unavoidable. Gus is a compassionate, peace loving man. But he cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as a pacifist. I have yet to meet another man who can be half as ruthless when it comes to matters of honor 7 ethics, fidelity or personal integrity. This I say of a man who once confided that he cares so much for those of us willing to shoulder some of the responsibilities of sovereignty that he would rather see us dead than unable. His intent is to make us as able as we have the potential for and, if possible, more able than he is himself Then he capped it off with a bit of levity by saying, \"and if your personal lot in life is to be that of an"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"4 asshole, at least I will have the satisfaction of knowing that I made you a competent one.\" He has never asked anyone to do anything he wasn't prepared to do himself and never put others at risk to test out a new legal theory. Although it is not customary to write a preface as a sort of mini-biography on the author, it is my belief that knowing a little about the man himself might better facilitate a finner grasp of what it is that he has to teach the rest of us. He teaches by example so that others, for lack of anything better, might have a yardstick by which to measure their own individual progress. He's quite fond of the Aristotelian teaching method because it does not deprive the student of the joy of self-discovery. It's important to him that each individual achieve a common understanding of what's true and what's not truefrom their own point of view. Gus has had no formal teaching education. His tutorial skills come to him naturally and it is fitting that one who has had the many benefits of his immediate supervision provide some insights to his thinking. I distinctly recall a time earlier in our relationship when he said to me that the purpose of a teacher is to accurately convey to another or others useful information and to effectively stimulate an interest in fully understanding that infonnation. The purpose of a \"student\" is to intentionally gain an understanding of the information so s/he can confidently and effectively use it. That requires self-honesty and self-discipline. He told me th~t if I had to ask him what was essentially the same question more than twice, it was a clear indication that I was not interested in understanding the information, but rather in memorizing it. If his purpose was nothing more than to have his own words echoed back at him, he'd go to a pet store and buy a parrot. I believe, at the time, I was being chastised for lack of self-discipline in the (self-honest) use of dictionaries. With Gus, there is no grade curve. You either know it or you don't know it. And if you don't know it, you keep at it until you do understand it. If the intent to learn something is genuine, it is the responsibility of the student to remedy any ignorance of the information being provided and to test its veracity. These books are self-published and hand bound by Gus, the sales of which are little more than a break-even proposition for him. He maintains a file on each and every reader for correspondence and future advisement purposes. Regrettably, he lost contact with many of his pre-200l readers after the arson fire took out all of his files."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Although there is some repetition of certain fundamental precepts, this volume of the handbook is written on the presumption that the reader has already obtained and studied the first volume. This volume contains information that will enable you to get into much difficulty if you haven't studied Volume I. For that reason, Gus will not sell this book to anyone for whom he does not have a file. First time book orders will have to be for both volumes with a strong advisement to thoroughly study Volume I before proceeding with this Volume II. Unlike Volume I, this second volume contains infonnation that is, for reasons of practicality, much more adversariaVconfrontational with all the risks inherent therein. But the underlying theme remains the same: responsible stewardship and exercise of sovereign authority. As many of you have by now discovered, there is only one price for freedom. And that is the willingness to fight back. There is no other price. This volume is intended to provide you with some basic tools by which to do that. ... without destroying our country (or your own lives) in the process. Because of the sheer diversity of individual difficulties readers have experienced in trying to interface (as a s~vereign Elector) with the current system, Gus is using a \"shotgun\" approach in the arrangement and division of chapters in this handbook with a fair degree of conceptual overlapping between them. If you are going to be a responsible sovereign, yciu have to act like one. And if you want to credibly pull off the act, you have to think like a sovereign. That's what lies at the heart of the purpose of these handbooks. An inmate once wrote to Gus saying that he wanted to become a sovereign Elector so he could obtain release and exact legal revenge on those who put him in prison. This guy was serious I In astonishment, Gus wrote back and said that if this guy had in fact read the handbook (doubtful), he had missed the whole point and would probably be better off staying right where he was. In a few instances, Gus has been asked questions for which the only correct answer was plainly and exactly stated in the handbook. That sort of questioning makes evident that the reader has little or no intent to understand the data. Either that or they're being lazy in the self- honest use of dictionaries and perhaps both. Anyone who is so negligent with their own ~elf­ enhancement is not suitable sovereign material and probably should stay with the sheeple herd. 5 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ .~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ A'\\ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \"\" ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"r- ~ ~ ~ '\" \" ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ,.. ~ ~ f8' ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ (fr'A ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ (lilA ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 8 Individual Consent By-pass Author of the Universe (Holy Scripture) The Body Sovereign (''We The People\") Faculty of Contract (personal, social, commercial, etc.) Magna Charta/Common Law (basis for:) No \"Rights\" transfer below this point. \"Powers\" are handed downward, not up.

By definition, e mec amcs of how sovereign authority· (power to act Lawfully) is transferred or delegated to another or others by the source of that authority. The only way to overcome that kind of \"evidence\" is to obtain evidence of fraud; Le., forgery, misrepresented inducement, etc Let's say we want to build a new chicken coop. We are lead to believe that we must \"apply\" for a \"building permit\" before we can begin. The word \"apply\" means to put to use, to assign to a specific purpose, to put into effect. These definitions make it rather apparent that whoever is doing the applying is the source of causation over the action. Hence; a sovereign who is making an \"application\" is, by definition, causing and authorizing something to happen or to take effect with intent that it happen or take effect. Thus, an \"application\" is considered to be a deliberate and voluntary act or action. ~ ~ ~ '\" ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"10 A \"license\" 'or \"permit\" is, of course, a permission to do or not to do something.

The grant of sovereign power is a very \"valuable consideration\". That and the inher~-;;g;~;~ent (evidenced by the signature) to the transfer of power constitute the two most important of the four elements which define a valid contract. It's the same mechanics as will be found in private contracts. Govenunent administrators and civil servants have no Lawful power to compel you to do or not to do anything unless such authority was expressly delegated by our ancestors in a specific Article, Section and Clause of our Constitution or by you via a valid and binding individual contract. The legislature was specifically prohibited from making any law which impairs the obligation of contracts. If a civil servant presumes to the contrary, slbe presumes too far. Any \"power\" claimed or exercised by your servants must come directly from you or from our ancestors via the Constitution. And you have the Lawful authority to require them to produce written evidence showing either mode of transfer of sovereign authority. The sample formats provided in Volume I of the handbook were intended to show how to do that without being drawn into the bureaucratic meat grinder.

And if you want to prove the truth of that statement the hard way, be prepared to have your picture and your fingerprints taken ... as well as your watch, your wallet, your clothing and your dignity. The body politic is more than willing to help you come to a much more enlightened understanding of this, but there will be a \"tuition\" fee for the instruction. After all, you can't expect them to work for nothing! Today, it is not uncommon to see gross excesses and abuse of public trust. Often as not, it is the individual sovereign (patriot) who is the intended object of such abuse. When civil servants resort to the power of the gun, with utter and complete disregard of organic sovereign"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"auili:ority, they place themselves outside the protection(s) of the Law (\"outlaws\") and Justice requires they be dealt with in the same manner as bandits or pirates. By their own actions, they make themselves fair game to anyone willing to execute the Law of our forefathers. By their own actions, they are in open rebellion against their sworn duty to \" ... establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote (not provide) the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.\" 11 If those in positions of public trust abdicate their duty and obligation (by solemn Oath) to eradicate these \"official\" color of law acts of insurrection and rebellion against the body sovereign, then such power reverts, by Operation of Law, back to the Preamble body sovereign for its exercise. That is the full extent of responsibility you must be prepared to accept and act upon if you wish to be part of the body sovereign of our nation. It was said by one of the founders of our nation, \"Those who would exchange their Liberty for security deserve neither. \" That statement was aimed squarely at the \"Posterity\". It is historically proven then cowardice has its own reward. Meanwhile, back at the chicken coop project ....... while I'm having one marvelously good time disabling fingers and thumbs with a hammer, a man walks up and says, \"Excuse me, are you Mr. Blackstone?\" Being of an age and appearance where I can do a credible job of it, I look at him owlishly and say, \"Who's asking?\" He replies, \"I'm Joe Smith.\" Casting a frown at a mangled thumb, I ask, \"You just a nosey neighbor or are you on some kind of official business?\" Looking a bit apologetic, he says, \"Well, yes. I'm the building inspector for the county.\" ContinUing with the act, I say, \"You got some kind of badge or card I can see?\" Still looking a little nervous, he says, \"of course\" and hands me a business card. I squint my eyes a little as I'm looking at the card and move my lips like I don't read too good. About the time I've got him entertaining the idea that I'm not too bright, I ask him, \"What can I do for you, Joe?\" Not asking for the card back and, with a look that is a curious blend of fascination and horror, he points his chin toward my artistic masterpiece and says, \"What is this, this .... structure .... supposed to be?\" In innocent indignation I reply, \"It's a chicken coop.

I only said what it is.\" With a visible effort, he comes back to himselfwith a little tic and twitch, like he's just returned from a brief sojourn through Wonderland with Alice. Then, looking past me, he says, \"There's someone in the house looking at us with binoculars through the screen door.\" Without turning to look, I say, \"That's just the missus. She's a little stand-offish with strangers. Can't be binoculars she's holding though. We don't own anything like that.\" With an expression like he's wondering ifhis renewed grip on his immediate reality just slipped again, he looks back at me and says, \"We, ah .... don't seem to have an approved building permit on file for this .... ah .... chicken coop.\" Before he can continue, I say, \"Is that your job, to keep a file of building permits?\" Forgetting what he was about to ·say, he responds, \"It's .... part of my job, yes.\" Cutting him off again, I say, \"Well Joe, tell you what. I'll write one up and sign it this evening and get it down to your office fir~t thing in the morning. How's that sound?\" Somewhat startled, he says, \"Write what up?\" With a slight edge of annoyance in my voice, I say, \"A building permit. I just said that.\" In renewed startlement, he blurts, \"But you can't do that!\" Now, with a suspicious look, I say, \"Why not? You aren't challenging my authority are you?\" Taking a partial step back from me, he hurriedly says, \"No, but. ... \" Again I cut him off and say, \"Fine. I'll have one at your office in the morning to put in your file. Oh, and have a copy of your Oath and your Bond waiting for me when I get there too. I'll see you then.\" Whereupon I immediately tum back to my project with hammer in hand. Joe wanders off in a daze, wondering if he should believe what he just experienced. There are a multitude of ways to deal with this kind of scenario. I'm inclined to the foregoing type of affected drama for no better reason than it's fun. At no time does \"Mr. (Joe) Smith\" have time to realize that he never got an answer to his question: \"Are you Mr. Blackstone?\" He still won't be able to prove who he was talking to even when the building permit is delivered to his office the next morning (unless I take pity on him and tell him), at which time I will collect a copy of his official Oath and his (insurance) Bond."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The building permit is simple and straight-forward: Building Permit I, Augustus Blackstone, the undersigned Preamble sovereign man in sui juris capacity and in direct exercise of the powers of sovereignty guaranteed at Article N,.

This was a completely new concept which did not exist prior to that time. And it swept the western world like an epidemic. Thus was the political system of \"democracy\" born. Perhaps its staunchest advocate was Socrates (469?-399 BC) and, in the end, it was the primary cause of his own premature demise. His pupil, Plato (427-347 BC), whether from a sense of outrage or self-preservation or both, explored a different aspect of the same basic principle called \"republicanism\". Always bear in mind that democracy and republicanism both share the same root concept. Aristotle (384-322 BC), who was a pupil of Plato, tutored Alexander the Great. Alexander the Great, among many other innovations, was the first conqueror to use a money system as a passive control mechanism within newly occupied territories in lieu of garrisoning an occupation force (which he did not have to spare). These are but a few of the things reviewed and discussed by the founders of our nation as they considered an· optimum form of government. Democracy was considered and flat rejected as an historically proven failure. (Look what it got Socrates in the end.) The founders had to satisfy the popular expectations of self-governance in whatever form of government they might create for this country. There was simply too much popular and historical inertia to do it any other way. The organic (original) Constitution, at Article IV, Section 4, guarantees every State a _-:!\" ____ ....... -'\"\"\"'.:..,\"\"~~~'~a.- ...............

It does not guarantee a \"democratic\" form of government. r The h~s of m06 iUle(democracy) 8r~detai1ed ~v~ium; I ~fili~~db~;~;~ is wholesale treason going on in this country and it is being done in the name of \"democracy\" . Even the so-called republicans are effusive about spreading \"democracy\" throughout the rest of the world. It's high time to bring' this demopublican political monster back under control before it destroys our nation and the rest of the world along with it. The prevailing \"foreign"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"17 policy\" of this monster is actively making enemies, not friends. Hitler tried a similar \"foreign policy\" and look what it got him in the end .... and what it cost the rest of the world. The difference today is that there are now a variety of world destroying weapons at the disposal of too many would-be Napoleons in the world and in our own government! The U.S.S.R. had a constitution. The U.S.S.R tried a similar version of \"Home Land Security\". The U.S.S.R is now history in less than a century of existence! By definition, a republican form of government is \"one in which the powers of ---- --....~ _sovereignty (all of them) are v:sted ~.~e p~p~l:.:.e..:an=d=-=ar:.:e:..:e=x=e~=c=is=e=d:.:b~y.:.th=e:p~e::o~p=le:..e:i:th:e::.r~d:i.,~e:ct:ly:. or through representatives (elected officials? attorneys, etc.)\" but not both. Those who choose .. to exerci~e these sovereign powers directly are considered competent before the Law, while those who choose to do so through representatives are deemed to be incompetent before the Law. There are ~ great many more of the latter in this country than the former. The following proposed legislative Bill is, among other things, intended to flush out and expose those who have infiltrated our government for the purpose of incrementally destroying it and enslaving us. It squarely imposes accountability for any insurrection, rebellion, sedition and/or treason perpetrated by various individuals posing as civil servants, including the members of the legislature. These will either have to expose their true nature in opposing this Bill or go along with it. If they go along with it, they will no longer be able to· conduct their covert sabotage operations with the impunity they presently enjoy. Upon enactment of this Bill, a second Bill should be proposed which requires the legislature to review a specified number of existing statutes during each session for the purpose of confirming, modifying or repealing them on the basis of the test of sufficiency required by this' Sovereign Rights Protection Act. This Bill is a mob rule \"house cleaning\" measure and in no way has any bearing on proper restoration and maintenance of individual sovereign status, standing or capacity. The Bill will also keep the political parasites occupied while we attend to other, more pressing concerns. Since the government's legal machine (BAR Association) is the principal subversive \"tool\" being used, I expect it will be the BAR maggots and their lap-dogs (mainstream media) who scream the loudest when this Bill gets introduced. There will likely be protests that this"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"18 Bill ''violates n the legislative immunity clause of the Constitution. The response to that rubbish should be that the legislative immunity clause does not supercede the individual accountability imposed by the mandatory Article VI Oath of Fidelity. It does not supercede the Impeachment clause. It does not supercede the Treason clause. Make it clear that if these political parasites do not police themselves:. it will be done for them by whatever means they make necessary. There's not enough time left to be overly polite about it. The individual and collective sovereign body has a constitutional duty to \"instruct\" the legislature from time to time. One does not have to be a registered voter to put proposed Bills before the state and federal legislatures. This proposed Bill can easily be regarded as direct \"instruction\" to the politician who is selected to be the delivery boy and indirect \"instruction\" to the rest of that crowd. And if they fail to comply, the Declaration of Independence states, in no uncertain terms, that we have a Right and a Duty to resort to other more forceful means. Just put this proposed Bill in the hands of a legislator who professes to be a patriotic advocate and tell him or her, \"I want you to introduce and strenuously advocate this proposed Bill in the legislature.\" If slbe is in fact one who walks the talk, give all the support you can (without registering to vote). If slhe proves to be two-faced, you can always repeat the exercise with someone else while adding one name to the verified \"enemy\" list (see Treason clause of the Constitution for the United States of America, AD 1791).

This permanent expression of the will of the sovereign body of We the People clearly states that, \"We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men ... are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" The united States' Supreme Court has since removed all doubt that \"pursuit of Happiness\" fully encompasses the acquisition ot: dominion over and disposition of property. Said Organic Law then further states, \"That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\" (emphasis added) . Therefore, it is clearly manifest upon the highest Lawful authority in this nation that the only legitimate purpose and function of government administration in this union of republics is the preservation and protection of certain God-given, individual unalienable Rights, a few of which have been enumerated and expressly declared as inviolate, with the remainder being expressly reserved.

(4) A provision for cause of action and remedy only where a substantive injury, loss or damage can be 19 shown to exist by a corporeal claimant or prosecuting witness ~ (5) Verification by the proposed Bill's author(s) that it conforms to and is in complete hannony with both the Organic and the Supreme Law of this nation and of this State .. (6) Verification by the proposed Bill's author(s) that it does not extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over the inhabitants of this State or, in the alternative, the express Consent of the sovereign body to such proposed jurisdictional imposition must be attendant to the proposed Bill upon presentation to this legislative body."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"20 (7) Express waiver of \"official immunity\" against criminal prosecution with respect to the verifications required by this proposed Bill.

We can denounce and criticize these \"Acts\" to no end and it still does nothing to properly remove the assumed authority by which it was done. On that point, there has been only silence. The silence has in fact ratified/authorized the \"Acts\" under procuratorial power! In order to Lawfully void the acts of an agent, attorney, representative or procurator, one must disavow (under Oath or Affinnation) the authority to act (in that capacity), not the acts themselves! Remove the authority and the \"Acts\" are as void as if they never took place. Unlike an express or written Consent, acts done under the authority of tacit procuration rely entirely on a continuing implied or assumed authority which may be voided after the fact, particularly where there is fraud involved.

The foregoing affidavit should be kept in your sovereign evidence portfolio. There is another affidavit which is often needed to protect one's self and which should also be kept in your portfolio - to be used as needed in any active contest with the courts or other public offices. This second affidavit was developed some years ago when I was tutoring an individual on the common law lien process (which is why I mentioned the process at the beginning of this chapter). The connnon law lien process will be addressed in a subsequent handbook volume. The attorneys representing the \"target\" of the common law lien process tried every dirty, deceitful trick in the book to undermine the process. They even tried to get a judge (another BAR maggot) to trespass on the Judgment. When that failed, it came to my attention that these BAR maggots were intending to have my pupil arrested and \"criminally\" charged with \"simulating legal process\" as a desperate means of coercing my pupil into undoing the lien. In their desperation, they became a living example of a pure oxymoron. This affidavit was dropped in the pot before they moved. Their argument was thereby rendered a nullity before it was even made. This affidavit clearly states the Fundamental and superceding authority relied upon by the individual sovereign in the direct exercise of the powers of sovereignty. It ends all argument to the contrary and it effectively shuts the gate on BAR maggot meddling by imposing consequences upon them. This is yet another perfect example of the dueling field principle in the \"tar baby\" mode. These two affidavits, used in tandem, will more effectively frustrate and intimidate any BAR maggot than any other device I have yet discovered. Keep in mind that, while adaptable to other uses, this second affidavit was constructed and designed to support the legitimacy of a Lawful process. More than any other single reason, what makes these affidavits so effective in their use is accurate, simple, straight-forward and self-explanatory language. Remember that when you write your own."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"26 After recording, return to: John Howard Galt, sui juris c/o postal service address: 11606 N. Market Street Mead, Wash.

Today's postal service dates its origin to July 26, 1775, when the Second Continental Congress agreed \"that a Postmaster General be appointed for the United States\" and named Benjamin Franklin to the position. The Articles of Confederation gave Congress \"the sole and exclusive right and power ... (of) establishing and regulating post offices from one State to another,\" with postal laws and regulations revised and codified in the Ordinance of October 18, 1782. Following adoption of the Constitution, the Act of September 22, 1789, temporarily established a post office and created the Office of the Postmaster General. The Act ofF ebruary 20, 1792 (same year as the Coinage Act), made detailed provisions for the Post Office, and subsequent legislation enlarged the duties of the Post Office, developed its organization, and issued rules and regulations regarding postal operations. In 1829, upon the invitation of President Andrew Jackson, the postmaster general became a member of the president's cabinet. In its earliest days, the Postal Service was referred to as the Post Office, then, nationally, as the General Post Office. In the 1820's Postmaster General John McLean began referring to~\" theorgcUuzatiOn as the Post Office Department, but it was notspecifi;n=y ~~ab~hed as aD - execuliveaipartiiieiitby Co~ires~ until\" Jun~ 8, 1872.' ihl;Tsbut·~~;J mo=;;e~ple of=;- 1 ....... w = _QU'\" ta'D; Titi6' RF''FSiLt' ~04'A.\"\\IlJCIi1\"''''~AIb:O: ~~.-\" constitutionally designated legislative power and responsibility being transferred to the \"#I~~~~ .. \".~~~~n..n a::csJ'I .. !C;uo ~Ni!lc:aaad'Stt!f: ca ~~u;t-~~~~~~ -executive power following the war between the States and the Reconstruction Acts. \"....,~~tJt~~ .. \"'.QC: __ z;:;;;:::;ea.\"'Aa;;tJiJ:W4 ACJ ;:;W1JliLi-PGWiIIIOf. -; .\"'.,.\"....1; - ~~rrt:tfa??nt7\"T \"Nm=p:tIT It should be noted that early postmasters general usually were public figures who would, for example, go on to serve as secretary of war, Supreme Court justice, orU.S. senator. Today, the postmaster general is usually selected from the ranks of top corporate executives who have proven skills and business acumen. Not surprising when one considers that over 80 per cent of today's postal traffic is business mail. The years following 1872 saw a gradual compounding of neglect as well as financial and administrative ineptitude. By the mid-1960's the Post Office Department was in deep trouble.

The undersigned has no fixed postal service street address and, for the express purpose of establishing a domicile of record where service of legal notices, lawful process and commercial presentments might be reliably delivered to the undersigned, you are hereby authorized and directed to forward for delivery any and all postage prepaid mail items received at your Post Office which are addressed' to Robert Vernon Montgomery, or any orthographic variation thereof, clo General Delivery, Pendleton, Oregon, United States of America to the above d.esignated domicile address appearing at the head of this page. You are further directed to notify all other necessary postal personnel, including the Postmaster at Spokane, Washington (Metro Station), of this change in domicile address. The undersigned accepts full responsibility for notifying all other interested parties. This change in domicile address is permanent and takes effect sua sponte. You will please take further notice that the undersigned considers the military zone designations, commonly referred to as \"zip codes\", to be unconstitutional and constructive fraud and customarily uses the acronym designation of \"CF\" in close proximity thereto as a challenge and as an invitation for anyone to take issue on the matter so that a competent jury can be engage~ to factually settle the controversy on the basis of all available evidence.

The last paragraph of Montgomery's letter explains the significance of that. I am not entirely in agreement with his use of the term \"military zones\" (in reference to Reconstruction Acts origins), but the difference of opinion is moot since \"military zones\" would fall well within the meaning of \"federal enclave\" and, in either case, it is not something the federal people would want brought to light in the courts. For those who aren't quite so bold, but still want to disassociate themselves from the ZIP code without sacrificing efficiency of service, putting it in a box will contain and separate the ZIP code from the other address information without confusing the automated scanners, as do brackets, parenthesis, and such. Most of the older post offices are owned by and are built on ground that was in fact purchased by the federal government (in accordance with Constitutional requirements) and are in fact \"federal enclaves\" for which a ZIP code is entirely appropriate. Like Washington, D. C., all federal enclaves are under the absolute and exclusive authority of Congress ... (as is your address when the P. S. Form 3575 is filled out and signed). Thus, if one received mail through a box or even General Delivery at the main post office facility at Portland, Oregon, for example, the use of a ZIP code is appropriate. If you have already filled out and signed a P.S. Form 3575 for your present street address, it is difficult to advise you (without another change of address) how to undo that in light of the precept that we are presumed to know the Law as well as the extent of our sovereign status and authority. A claim of mistake or error evidences incompetency (as a sovereign), which only leaves a claim offraud (difficult to prove). As always, you will have to determine what is best for you in the use of this information.

Evidence, by definition, displays itself. What one thinks or may \"feel\" about the evidence has no legitimate effect on the truth of what it actually is. One of the many ways our language expresses that sort of basic understanding is that a rose by any other name is still a rose. By that same standard, one could just as easily say that a maggot by any other name is still a maggot. However agreeable or disagreeable one may find the evidence of the truth, it does not alter the reality of that truth. Argument, on the other hand, is, by definition, expressed disagreement with the truth of the evidence provided. Argument is a fonn of negotiation that is intended to compromise the evidence of the truth. Truth has nothing to gain through compromise, while argument has everything to gain through compromise. The often stubborn insistence on the exercise of one's right to be heard is usually little more than a demand to argue. The responsible sovereign commands a display of the evidence. That is the only reliable way in which actual truth might be discovered or \"heard\" . Sometimes it is impractical to determine what something actually is. It then becomes necessary to establish what that something is not. That is referred to as \"negative proof'. In either event, it is the evidence which makes the truth apparent to any disinterested observer. Argument is superfluous in the presence of evidence, be it positive or negative in character. It has been justly said, more than once, that argument is for fools and attorneys. Justice, by definition, seeks perfection ( of evidence) of truth and not the mere gratification of one's sense of right or wrong, or the vindication of one supposed moral code over another. The \"common law\" is a composite, of which moral codes are only one element. .. and not the controlling one. Not in any practical sense. For example; a \"belief' is not considered as valid evidence of truth unless that supposed belief can be or has been demonstrated by actual conduct. \"Ye shall know them by their fruits\" and \"actions speak louder than words\" are but two of the many expressions used to illustrate this concept."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"39 Attorneys in this countIy (and probably most others) are trained to be skilled practitioners of argument and negotiation. However, even the most skilled argument will not prevail over compelling evidence to the contrary. Likewise, hard evidence takes precedence over any and all unsubstantiated presumptions, assumptions, hypothications or fictions of law. One should never, as a sovereign, engage in argument with one's (civil) servants, but rather insist on production and display of all available evidence. This is especially true whenever there is a question of Lawful authority to act in a particular way (challenge to jurisdiction). Naked affidavits (unsupported by hard evidence) are technically a form of argument. They are considered'prima facie \"evidence\" only so long as they remain unrebutted with hard ........ *2 •. _TV \\MI2 • evidence to the contrary.

The example provided is modeled on a Washington seatbelt citation issued to a sovereign traveling companion (not a paying \"passenger'). Bear in mind that there was no other reason given as \"probable cause\" for the stop and the sovereign thus accosted said and did all the right things to criminally charge the \"officer' with not less than four felonies and three misdemeanors.

As to what that evidence should be and how to obtain it, I will detail elsewhere in this handbook. It is difficult for a sovereign (wo )man to act decisively and with confidence without the assurance of actual evidence in hand which proves who and what slhe is and is not. The FDQ is a \"boilerplate\" document and is purposefully structured to create a damned if they do and damned if they don't dilemma. As is usually the case, the prosecutor failed (he didn't dare) to fill out and return the FDQ within the time allowed. He also did not file into the case a retraxit of suit. Instead (as anticipated), the clerk tQok it upon himself to trespass the case by scheduling a \"contested hearing\", which made filing a \"set-up\" document necessary. It should be noted that the \"contested hearing\" was a routine ploy to trick one into arguing the citation instead of jurisdiction. Also to be noted is that there islwas no evidence by which to prove the \"defendant\" actually received notice of the said hearing. It was discovered through other channels. And that is \"hearsay\" only. With regard to the \"set-up\" letter to the court clerk, it is important to remember that the evidence of \"notice\" has to be created so one has the proof of intent to criminally exceed or abuse the authority vested in a public office. A criminal conviction cannot be obtained without proving culpability (intent) and motive (extortion of money). Those of you who do not know where this goes from here have no business starting this kind of set-up. Those of you who do think you know where to go with this and want the rest of this particular story will have to negotiate a Lawful Money exchange for the rest of the paperwork.

Have you ever considered what might happen if you simply ignored whatever \"the government\" might or might not be doing in its dark little closet and you, openly and brazenly, create your own idem sonans ens legis?

One may construct one's own foImS (or not) so long as the minimum information needed or required is provided. One may also load (scan) a \"government\" form into one's computer and make subtle modifications to the language used therein. This latter is especially useful when modifying the clerk's civil cover sheet in a federal court action. In this instance, however, it is recommended that one use the state's form to avoid raising red flags prematurely. The Addendum will \"gut\" the more dangerous aspects. In many instances, the Addendum isn't even read or considered .... until it's too late to effectively challenge. Once the business license issues, you now have what is called a chose in action (see glossary). As added insurance, one should always obtain a confirmation copy. . That kind of evidence is very much worth the extra fee in the event challenge is later attempted. Although the Addendum is \"attached\" (stapled) to the application form (as per instructions), the use of the word \"annexed\" in the text is of great importance. One should always use the word \"annexed\" and not \"attached\". The latter term signifies a separate ( severable) item, while the former term means it is an inseparable part of the primary document. This takes on added significance if your intent is to Apostille the notary public's jurat .... which would then put both the Application form and the Addendum under one Apostille. With regard to a jurat, always use present tense terms and not past tense terms; e.g., \"appears\", not \"appeared\". That finnly fixes the date of actual signing and witness by a state officer. When signing under penalty of petjury, always raise your right hand and say the words to the notary public. A notary is supposed to formally administer such Oath or Affinnation and most of them don't and cannot later testify that they did. Once all of this is in place, your dealings with any public office or agency thereafter are limited to one question: \"Which Article, Section and Clause of the Constitution (state or national) empowers you or your agency to tax, levy or otherwise impair (regulate) my exercise of secured Rights, Privileges, Immunities and Remedies, as was agreed to in accordance with the provisions of Addendum to Oregon Form lOl?\" There is no other \"issue n of senior merit.

Incorporated into your Notice & Praecipe should be a public disclosure request for the name and position of whoever gave the order or authorized the deviation from the long established Rules of English grammar governing the spelling, capital- ization and structuring of proper noun names, as well as the specific Article, Section and Clause of the Constitution which were relied upon for that supposed authority. You want copies of any and all documents which evidence the answers to those questions. If attempt is made to blame the computer programming (which is a customary excuse and which is a provable lie), ask for disclosure of who wrote the program and who authorized the non-conformity to Rules of English grammar in that program. It is difficult to predict, with any degree of exactitude, where this might lead, but it's bound to be as entertaining as it is educational. My bet it that such a line will ultimately trace back to the BAR maggot acting as \"Attorney General\", which is not a legitimate, constitutional \"office\". In the event you encounter what seems to be insurmountable obstruction with this, it may be necessary to quit this approach and \"capture\" the strawman name a different way. Just for the hell of it, you could use this approach to create a second \"professional\" name (as do many actors and actresses) to conduct all your \"official\" and commercial affairs under. It would be some name other than your own, like \"ADOLF HITLER\" or ''PETER PAN' or ''BETTY BOOP\". (That's called rubbing their noses in it.) Some application forms, such as the one for California, contain words and phrases not acceptable to sovereign use (even with the use of the Addendum). These will have to be loaded into a computer and altered subtly. There is no \"law\" preventing you from doing this, nor can there ever be. Why?

Don't you have a miscellaneous file for those sorts of things?\" The plain truth is that there is such a file and if you are told otherwise, it is a blatant lie. I recall an instance where the clerk acted surprised and said, \"Well yes, but hardly anyone ever looks at that file.\" I then (warmly) said, \"That file will do just fine. I'm only perfecting the public record as is my civic duty.\" Whereupon she recorded my document in the misc. file. This is the most likely scenario one will encounter, ifhandled in this manner. If you go in predisposed to hostility, that's likely what you're going to get. Everyone has a help \"button\". Push it. Try saying, ''Look, I really need your help with this. Is there any way we can get this recorded without getting anyone into trouble?\""},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"64 In another instance; the clerk was not initially hostile, but was very uncertain of herself and doggedly clung to the statutes to resist the recording. I then said, \"I am not challenging your duties under the statutes, but you are also under Oath to perform constitutional duties, which is what I'm engaging here. Are you refusing to perform those duties?\" Out of uncertainty and fear, she said, \"I'm not going to record your documents, if that' s what you mean.\" I then handed her a (notarized) Notice & Praecipe commanding performance (which I had prepared earlier that day). Whereupon I said to her, \"Then I'll need a certified true copy of your Oath and your Bond. You may regard this as a formal public disclosure request. I'll wait while you get them and I will pay you for the copies.\" All very calm, courteous and proper. There was no charge for the copies, but there was a fee for the certifications. As soon as I had the copies in hand, I said, \"I'll be placing a lien claim against your bond and , since you have a direct conflict of interest, can you tell me who the appropriate filing officer would be?\" She got her hackles up and said, \"Is that a threat?\" I said, ''No, I'm extending you a courtesy.\" That seemed to calm her down somewhat and she asked me to wait while· she checked with county counsel on the matter of the recording. When she came back, she smugly told me that the county attorney advised her that she was not required to record my document. When I asked if she would put that in writing, she refused. Although it would have been nice to get that kind of evidence, I wasn't overly concerned. As is my standard practice in all predicted verbal encounters, I had a witness standing next to me with a pocket recorder running throughout the entire episode. Later that evening, we both signed very detailed affidavits of what transpired that day. The recording was used to get exact statements into the affidavits. To make a long story short, I gathered a few other odds and ends of hard evidence on the county attorney and filed formal criminal charges against him for criminal obstruction and subornation of the office of County ClerklRecorder. This was not actively pursued because my intent was to set up a solid foundation for a common law lien process (which will be addressed in its entirety in Volume ill of this handbook). To put a little extra pressure on, I also filed complaint for Imp~chment of the clerk for incompetency, a declaration that her office was in fact vacant and that a special election to fill the office was warranted."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"65 I then initiated civil process to remove the clerk/recorder for incompetency to hold the office (proven by the need for \"counsel\" in its performance). The clerk/recorder took a \"leave of absence\" and a deputy clerk was appointed as pro tempore clerk/recorder for the rest of the term. Do not be sending me requests for copies of all this as it was among voluminous other paperwork destroyed by the 2001 arson fire. And if you attempt to get it from \"official\" sources, I can just about guarantee you'll get stonewalled.

All other a successful disciplinary action, the . results of that action did not include getting the document into the public record. In such an instance, there remains one last resort step that can be taken. You have the Sheriff \"serve\" notice on the public. The Sheriff's affidavit (return) of service is equivalent to the recorder's stamp, in terms of public record evidence, and is itself a recordable instrument (with your documents attached). Since the Sheriff is under certain confidentiality restrains and is only required (by statute) to keep records for a limited time (usually eight years), it is advisable to record the return of service affidavit (with your documents attached) in the County ClerklRecorder's Office. Then the record will be permanent. It should be noted that the Sheriff is given a color copy for service. You keep the original. This may sound like a lot of extra trouble and expense and it is. But its your Liberty that is the object of the exercise. What's that worth to you? The following three generic templates are provided so you have some idea of how to properly use the Office of the Sheriff for this purpose.

I've seen an awful lot of evidence which supports this theory, but none of it conclusive.

Be assured that the record will \"witness\" whatever may have caused you to feel upset. 'One goes into open court with an unshakable resolve to make a record no matter what may happen, or who says what. Always remember that an angry or fearful (wo )man' s faculty of reasoning is impaired by strong emotional reactions and can, by such provocation, be manipulated. Attorneys, many of whom become judges, are trained in this method of emotional manipulation. And that, to varying degrees, makes them susceptible to the same tactic. While it is sometimes useful to provoke a judge or an attorney or other party to anger or fear, with cold manipulative precision (in order to expose deceitful behavior), the senior purpose for doing so is to make a record of the truth (including emotionally motivated mistakes). Unless it can be discerned from the context itself, the record only contains what was actually said ( or done) and not the emotional motivation behind it. There are a great many things that BAR maggot attorneys and judges do not want openly debated on the record of the court, which makes the record of the court a useful \"weap?n\" in the hands of a patriot litigator who knows how to use it. It levels the playing field in the game of truth and can be used to constrain deceitful and unethical behavior. Such use of the record of the court fully engages what I call the dueling field principle and employs a high profile \"tar baby\" mode of delivery. It must be understood that the court system we inherited from our forebears was set up as a bloodless substitute for the duelingfield. Regardless of subsequent embellishments, de facto or de jure, the underlying rules of honorable dueling have not changed. One side gets the choice of weapons. The other side sets the conditions of the duel with equal application to both contestants; e.g., \"twenty paces, tum and fire\" or \"knives in right hand and left wrists bound together, to first blood\". At any stage of your dealings with civil servants, government agencies and courts, the moment you cite a body oflawslstatutes (UCC ,traffic code, administrative rules, etc.) or :file a form pursuant to same, you are publicly announcing your choice of \"weapon(s)\" for the dueling field (court). And, in so doing, you have given your opponent the option of setting the conditions of the duel (\"process\", procedure, rules of evidence, etc.)."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"82 Having watched this principle in play countless times over a span of many years, both as a spectator and as a participant, I can tell you with certainty that the \"duelist\" who sets the conditions of the duel has a nearly overwhelming advantage. Properly restoring and maintaining one's status and standing as one of the body sovereign (sovereign Elector) automatically sets several key conditions of battIe fOf the dueling field. And those conditions of battIe are of a nature so as to render present day de facto \"weapons\" ineffective. To illustrate this, let's say I'm to successfully challenge a closet-bully \"peace\" officer in a real duel. I would offer and even encourage him to make the choice of weapons, knowing full well that the most probable choice will be fireanns. Since he's had a lot more job related practice than I with those kinds of weapons, the odds are that he has me outmatched in skill. He knows it, and I know it. In order to shift the odds in my favof, I would set the conditions ofbattIe thus: muzzles in the mouth, toe-to-toe, on the count of ten. The ten-count is given him as a courtesy, so he has some time to determine what value he places on his honor. I already know what mine is worth. You will find that, when the stakes go that high, most adversarie~ of this type will forfeit the duel. When you set the price of honor that high, you ''win'' either way. As I said in Volume I of the handbook, a sovereign Elector's honor is more important that his or her immediate life. It's the honor which gives life value. Most of the components of a court directly correspond to the components of the dueling field. The role of a duel referee corresponds to the role of a judge. Each contestant may choose to have a \"second\" or not, which role corresponds to that of an attorney or counsel. The jury (and/or the court record) correspond to the dueling field witnesses, who are there to see and remember whether or not personal honor has been properly served (or forfeited) in truth and to convey that fact to any and all other interested parties. The \"tar baby\" mode of delivery is where aU of your verbal or written presentments to the court's record are clearly intended to structure it with selected truthful issues (usually pertaining to jurisdiction) that are ordinarily shunned by BAR maggots which, if \"touched\" (argued against) by the judge, an attorney or any adverse party, will more deeply entangle them in their own lies and deceit and will not turn loose of them until it has run its full course. And"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"83 the harder they struggle to be free ofi~ the tighter it will ensnare them. Truth has a way of doing that to deceitful people when there is a record by which to hold them accountable. It is thus one uses the court record as a weapon of truth, by structuring a visible \"trap\" which can only be sprung by deceitful argument. One never should construct this tar baby in such a way that can be interpreted as a license for the judge to rule on it (as a \"motion\" or question oflaw) .... which is the customary way a BARjudge will try to render harmless any trap you place into the record of the court. In the event such attempt be made in spite of such precautions, I would not hesitate to bluntly put the court onjudicial notice (speaking to the record) that I will most assuredly pauperize anyone attempting to subvert the Law or the official record of the court in the instant matter. The basic active function of a Lawful court, with all its components present, is to gather all available evidence, including sworn testimony of competent witnesses, evaluate that evidence and \"repair\" what's actually \"broken\" by rendering a verdict and/or remedial judgment best suited to resolve and put and end to the problem. Argument, which is what BAR attorneys are trained to do, will not overcome clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Thus, to prevail in today's courts, one must firmly insist on trutb, the evidence of that truth and an accurate record of both. The blind insistence to exercise one's \"right to be heard\" is typically little more than a solicitous demand to argue, no matter what the provable facts are. If one possesses such a dedicated propensity to argue, there's always law school and the BAR exam. Actual truth can be demonstrated and made self-evident through physical evidence. No argument is necessary. The evidence of the truth \"speaks\" fur itself"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"~ (F' r' ~ ('P' (P' ~.

Every State has their FOIA equivalent statutes and all it takes is a simple letter and a postage stamp to obtain your evidence. I have no difficulty, even with federal agencies, by sending a letter which identifies it as a public disclosure request for a certified true copy of any document in their custody which evidences (whatever I am seeking to prove or disprove) and stipulating that I stand ready, willing and able to recompense them for time and industry spent in the performance of the request. I always get an answer and have yet to get a request or demand for ·payment. More often than not I am seeking evidence to disprove something, so the responses are usually one or two-page letters (on official letterhead stationery) stating that no such record or document is in their custody. I never request a legal determination or opinion. I request the document (or statement of lack thereof) which makes that determination manifest. The \"vessel\" public disclosure request example provided clearly illustrates what I mean here. Another example would be to send a PDR to the Secretary of State and to the local County Clerk requesting a certified true copy of any document in their custody, bearing your signature, which evidences that you are a politically enfranchised (register~d voter) \"person\" or \"resident\" or \"citizen\" of the state and county. Likewise, you could send a PDR to the Dept. of Health and Human Se~ces and to Immigration and Naturalization Service requesting a certified true copy of any document in their custody which evidences that you are a \"person\" or a \"U.S. citizen\" within the meaning of the so-called \"14th Amendment\". As I said, there are a multitude of ways to go about this. Use your imagination and put pen to paper. Get your evidence, be it positive or negative in character. In most cases, it shouldn't cost more than the postage (and certified mail fee, if you use that service)."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"88 Chapter 12 The Anatomy of a Problem In this chapter 1'm going to share with you what may very well have more value to you than any other single item of informatio~ in this handbook. It is a piece of philosophy that is very broad in scope and has a multitude of applications in just about every aspect of one's life, including litigation. Perhaps the most reliable \"yardstick\" to use in determining the actual amount of truth in any given philosophy, be it political, religious or general, is that of practical application to a variety of real life situations and activities. That is the ''yardstick'' I expect you to use in evaluating the information in this chapter. The definition( s) of the word \"anatomy\" encompasses such concepts as pattern, logic, structure, spacial relationship, composite design, etc. More simply, the word means how something is put together, be it organic, mechanical, mental or spiritual. Thus, we are going to examine the anatomy of a \"problem\", any problem, its component parts and pieces and how they fit together. The word \"problem\" represents the root concept of sentient consideration(s) about things and events, real or imagined. Things don't have problems. Only people have problems. The sun exploding might be a problem (consideration) to the people living on Earth, but it would not necessarily be a \"problem\" to the planet itself It would simply be an event of things on a grand scale, a mere product of universal physics of which the planet is a part. Applying this concept to interactions between individuals and interactions between different groups of people, it is axiomatic that what you consider to be a problem may not be a problem to me, and what I consider to be a problem may not be a problem to you. What is considered a problem by one group of people may not be a problem to anyone else. Thus, it is made apparent that a \"problem\" is a created thing, created by sentient consideration (viewpoint) and intention (that a \"problem\" exist and be agreed to, pro or con, by another or others). It should be equally apparent that a created thing can likewise be un-created, if one has the \"blueprint\" of its anatomy or otherwise comprehends what it's made up of and how it is put together and/or how it operates."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"89 This is the underlying theme of such truisms as, \"the solution to a problem lies within the problem itself' and \"what may be a disaster for one, is an opportunity for another\" and \"one man's garbage is another man's treasure\" and on and on. Whether or not a problem exists or doesn't exist is entirely a matter ofindividuaI viewpoint. Earlier in my life I had someone who was very good at creating problems (mostly imagined) and bringing them to me (for my agreement/validation, pro or con). Finally, in exasperation, lone day said to this individual, \"The creation and solving of problems is truly a wonderful thing. It adds much diversity and interest to the game of ~e and can be very educational. But if you are bringing your problem to me to solve, be assured that I will solve it and you will live with and abide my solution.\" That incident put an end to my \"problem\" with the persistent pestering o~ that individual. The anatomy of a problem, any problem, is found within the definition of the word itself \"Problem\" is defined as: a force in direct opposition to a counter-force of equal or comparable magnitude. One may rest assured that overwhelming force on one side or the other means there is no \"problem\" ..... or there won't be for long. The term \"force\" includes such non- material things as belief, personality, character, emotion, ideas, intentions and the like. That is the sum total of the anatomy of a problem and how one is created and maintained. It should be readily obvious that the way to un-create a problem is to remove either the force, the opposing counter-force or both. Do that, and the problem ceases to exist. Since we are dealing with people and/or groups of people , all of whom are intending to prevail with their own point of view, neither side of the equation is willing to back-off and \"remove\" itselfas the simplest way to un-create the problem. That leaves us with a third alternative. The third alternative is to change the proximity of force/counter-force so they are no longer in direct opposition and both can maintain their point of view and/or direction of movement. This is called a lateral shift in position. In football it is referred to as lateral pass (or run). In military combat tactics it is called flanking the enemy position. BAR maggots and today's courts thrive (get rich) on problems (controversies). One should endeavor to \"out-flank\" them by changing the jurisdiction, changing the issue(s) and other lateral shifting. It works in the courts as well as it does in Judo and on the battlefields."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"90 Chapter 13 The Tacit Procuration: Confession by Proxy In Chapter 5 of this work, I promised to tell you about the tacit procuration and its use as a tactical \"weapon\" in litigation.

The corporate/political majority (mob) rule monster never goes away and never quits trying. It keeps nibbling away at your Life, Liberty and Property like rodents in the pantry. Laziness and procrastination are the worst character traits a sovereign can have and can only be held in check by self-discipline. It's your family's future hanging in the balance, and that should be motivation enough. It is far better to nip each invasive attempt in the bud before it grows beyond easy control. What follows is a typical example of how one does that. An acquaintance of mine who . owns a ranch in eastern Washington received an \"official\" letter from the WASHINGTON STATE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES (a corporate entity) which proposed: Dear Forest Landowner: All forest landowners in Washington State are required by law (Chapter 222-24 WAC) to submit a Road Maintenance and Abandonment Plan (RMAP) to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for all forest roads on their land. Initial RMAPs covering at least 20% of a large forest landowner's propertywere due no later than December 31, 2001. If you are a forest landowner of more than 500 acres and have not submitted an RMAP, please contact the DNR Northeast Region office within 30 days of receiving this letter. A variety of assistance is available in order to help forest landowners in completing and submitting a RMAP to meet the obligation. Forms of assistance offered include: phone assistance, in-person visits with RMAP Foresters - either in the office or on-site, map products, and RMAP templates. If you are a forest landowner and have not submitted a RMAP, and are interested in any of the above mentioned fonns of assistance, please contact the DNR Northeast Region office at (509) 684-7474. Thank you. Sincerely, The response prepared for this invasive exercise. in duplicity was: Greetings, Your letter dated Jan. 28, 2002 claims that I have some sort oflega1 4'obligation\" to meet. Being unaware of any such \"obligation\" that is binding upon me, 1 was (and still am) more than a little confused by such an assertion. Since I make every effort to conduct all of my affairs in a Lawful manner, I have, in good faith and with due diligence, conducted an exhaustive search of my files and records to ascertain the basis (if any) of the \"obligation\" you refer to in your letter. That is, in large part, why it has taken me so long to get back to you."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"105 My search bas failed to locate any documentation relating to the \"obligation\"c1aimed by your letter. In order for me to determine exactly what my \"obligation\" is, please mail to me a certified true copy of the Instrument or other document which Lawfully conveys to WASHINGTON STATE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES a proprietary interest in the Title (U.S. Land Patent) to my private property. In the alternative, please mail to me a certified true copy of the contractual Instrument, being my signature, by which I am bound to perform the \"obligation\" referred to in your letter of Jan. 28, 2002. In the event that no such Instrument of conveyance or ·contract can be produced, I would like you to tell me the specific Article, Section and Clause of the organic Constitution for The State of Washington (February 22, AD 1889) which authorizes enactment and enforcement of \"Chapter 222-24 WAC\" as well as the specific organic Law of said State which creates and imposes such \"obligation\" (or duty) upon me or otherwise mandates my compliance with a purely political code. After repeated readings of same, I have been unable to locate the specific provision(s) delegating any such authority. Since I have not been blessed with a photographic memory, I must rely on written communications to ascertain past dealings and agreements.

Someone told me many years ago, and I most recently heard it repeated by Brice McLeod of Texas, that when the gold and silver Coin (substance) went out of our Courts, the substance of our Fundamental Law went out with it. That's a plain statement of literal truth. It follows that if one wishes to·reverse that and bring the substance of the Law back into the courts, one must bond the action with Lawful Money specie. That forces the adversary to likewise bond in specie to even minimally come against you.

He said that the mark of true greatness is when a man continues to love his fellow man despite all the apparent reasons that he should not. That single statement beautifully summarizes one of the more important attributes of a true sovereign. Another relevant and simple statement made by a 20 th Century poet was that love is an attitude. What these statements make apparent is that actual \"love\" doesn't just unintentionally happen. It is a created thing and, like a \"problem\", has an anatomy of identifiable components. The physiological phenomena ordinarily associated with it (and upon which most of history's drama and artistic expressions are based) are by-products of and attempts to define or understand it or to define and understand its various attributes. In this instance, even most English dictionaries are of little help to this object. Like most people, it is something I have experienced every day of my life. Yet it has taken me half a century to arrive at a pragmatic understanding of what it actually is. This thing the word \"love\" is used to symbolically represent is composed of three interdependent and equally proportioned elements. These elements are: Affinity, Admiration and Respect (see glossary). All other perceivable attributes are by-products (consequences) of these three interactive elements. To recognize and understand the interdependency of these three elements, one need only acknowledge the truth of the fact that it's difficult to respect that for which one holds little or no affinity or admiration. Likewise, it is equally difficult to admire that for which one holds little or no affinity or respect. And it is difficult to have affinity for that which one cannot or will not admire or respect. To the degree you have one of these elements, you will have to the same or comparable degree the other two elements, in regard to something or someone in your environment or in your personal universe. What is the value of knowing this? How many lives, families and relationships have you seen destroyed for lack of understanding it? I've seen more of that than I care to remember. Knowing it's anatomy gives one command (control) over it, and not the other way around. Like playing a piano, the more command you have over it, the better you can create something truly beautiful and fulfilling with it."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"109 We are all engaged in the pursuit of happiness. But love alone, in its three components, is not nearly as satisfying or fulfilling as is love with understanding. It is interesting that the element of affinity is also an interdependent element in another triad which comprises the three elements of understanding, which are: Affinity, Reality and Communication (see glossary). Again I rely on the research and discoveries of L. Ron Hubbard as to what comprises true understanding. One could say that knowledge (lmowing) and understanding are very nearly synonymous terms. * * * * * * * * * * * In closing, I want to express my appreciation to readers from all across the nation who have written and shared their wins and successes with me.
