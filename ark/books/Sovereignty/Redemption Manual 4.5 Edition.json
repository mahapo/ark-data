We must seek out others who desire to be free as 'equal sovereigns,' to experience the benefits of Redemption and what has been created and established for them and their posterity.

One must read, study and test (apply) what one is becoming exposed to, in understanding the commercial scheme being operated against every man, woman and child today in this Country ... for the sole purpose to allow the 'government corporations' to survive and continue to serve 'themselves' under a socialistic bankrupt democracy. There is not one book that is going to answer all your questions and give you everything you need to know and understand as to Redemption. Much has been researched and written about Redemption. It has been both shocking, interesting, and yet exciting to see the process(es) and the successes in relation to what is dubbed Redemption. It is not the end, but the beginning! It is imperative that you move forward with the educational process, acquire other books and information (list contained herein) to understand and implement the transfer from being the 'Debtor/Slave' on the Plantation to becoming the Secured Party/Creditor and perfecting your sovereignty. If you do not have a computer and if you do not understand Redemption or are unwilling to learn all that might be necessary in regards to the commercial scheme, as the supposed 'Principal' (sovereign in a collective capacity) and take the responsibility, it is strongly suggested THAT YOU DO NOT GO FORWARD OR CONTINUE WITH WHAT IS CALLED REDEMPTION. From this point forward, you must decide which PILL to take. If you decide to take the Blue pill, you wake up in bed and believe whatever you want ... and you go back to the plantation and all remains the same ... you continue to be a debtor-slave on the plantation owning nothing, having no rights, only privileges. If you take the Red pill, you will be located and removed from the Matrix. You'll be exposed to all the rabbit trails (the reality, the truth) and soon, you'll be able to recognize the 'commercial program' and to operate within it in a system where there is no money, just commercial paper. You will come to understand all things as you go forward. You will learn to go to peace and not to war! Before you is a lot of responsibility. As you take the Red pill and go forward, there's no going back. YOU WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 6"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"PREFACE It would be useful at the outset for us to share with you our fundamental assumptions and motivation for writing this manual and the important results and benefits that we hope you will realize in your study of Redemption. The subject of Redemption is complex and involves the disciplines of history, government, commercial law, statutory procedure, banking and finance, real estate, and diplomacy. Each of these subjects is highly technical and has its own specialized language. To cover all of them in a single manual, at even a fundamental level, would of course be impractical. Therefore out of necessity, we have set as our goal in updating The Redemption Manual 4th Edition, to present a high level overview of core concepts that we hope will offer you a clear understanding of what Redemption is and how it might be useful to you. The war that is raging in the world is a war to influence what you think and ultimately how you act. You can control any group no matter how large, if you can shape their opinions, perceptions and belief system in such a way as to distract them from knowing or understanding the fundamental reality in which they are enmeshed; a prison without bars. This is the ultimate form of leverage. Here is a summary of what happened: A group of men (who wish to remain anonymous), through their agents (employees of Unites States, Inc., and their sub-corporations) began, under the Lincoln Administration, to quietly hi-jack the Constitution and the three branches of the Constitutional Republic. A quasi-governmental corporate takeover was then engineered to take control of the 50 states, the banking system, and the coining and printing of money. A civil war, a bankruptcy, and the confiscation of the wealth of the nation, were sponsored in order to create a context (read EMER GENCY) for the enslavement of the (formerly) sovereign people of the 50 (formerly) sovereign states under COLOR OF LAW. The icing on the cake: In 1938 the rulings of the Supreme Court were then partitioned to prevent the invocation of any law based on the Common Law, to be replace by the Uniform Commercial Code, and courts of International Contract Law (Admiralty). The coup 'd etat, is that most of you don't even realize that you have personally, aided and abetted by your own ignorance of history and the law, signed and acted yourself into this system of 'commercial' slavery. You do this every time you get a job, get married, give birth, register your car, take out a mortgage, use Federal Reserve Notes, or join the military. Welcome to the same-old-world order-We have seen the enemy, and the enemy is US! If this is news, congratulations, you are a successful mind control subject. If you think you are a landowner in America, take a close look at the warranty deed or fee title to your land. You will almost always find the words tenant or tenancy. The title or deed document establishing your right as a tenant, not a landowner, has been prepared for transfer by a licensed BAR Attorney, just as it was carried out within the original English feudal system that you may have presumed yourself to have escaped from in 1776. If your goal is to recover what has been stolen from you, it will be necessary to redeem yourself from living a life of false perceptions. Redemption is the path of waging peace with your adversary. It is the path of turning the fraud that has been perpetrated on you to your advantage, so that you can control your property and prevail in any venue involving agencies and employees of the state and federal government. This manual offers you the opportunity to move from the ranks of debtor/slave on the plantation to the elevated status of Secured Party Creditor. We wish you success in Redemption. REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION If you are new to 'Redemption,' then the information/process as presented in this book may be shocking and a little strange. We understand that it will be a leap of information that you have never been exposed to! Maybe you've experienced your \"government\" or were stomped on and railroaded in court or 'raped, pillaged or plundered' by an attorney, state agency or even the IRS! Maybe you believe Constitutional due process and fairness still exists \"in the law\"... in the courtroom. Maybe you believe that everything is the way it's supposed to be. They say, \"Jump,\" and you ask, \"How high?\" You look around and aside from the negative TV News at 6:00 pm, you just don't see anything wrong. Maybe you've not recognized the 'glitches' in the program ... yet. Well, better snap on your seat belt, Dorothy, because things have changed and where you're going, there's no turning back. This book was difficult to update from its past 3 r d edition format. Over six years have passed in regards to what has been dubbed 'REDEMP TION.' What has come forward since the first introduction of Redemption via seminars, articles, information etc., is voluminous. This book is not to be construed as legal advice. It is the cumulative work and effort of countless hundreds and maybe thousands of those who came before us and who at present have worked at great expense of time and energy to find the 'Truth' and 'Freedom,' if such exist at this time in this country and on this planet! Using the IRS as an example, we could all agree that based upon well over 25 years of research, all that research is now historical and cannot be rebutted. The facts of history are the facts of history. You cannot go back and change history. You can't, but rather, 'they' altered the 'facts' of history in the text books to hide certain things for certain agendas! You'll have to be the judge of that for yourself. We'll make an attempt to add commentary, explanation, and other such information in this 'update' to allow better understanding of the problem(s) and the issue(s) as it relates to Redemption. It will be incumbent upon the reader/student of Redemption to continue his/her educational experience to fully understand the basics, the fundamentals, and the concepts of Redemption to better deal with the problems and the commercial scheme implemented by government without your knowledge or consent. While at this time of our history, the 'fad' is ' ... to have FUN,' yet many do not see the reality that 'they are living in a fictional world.' While we want our children to have 'fun' and live safe, go to college, live the good life, we are often pricked into a jolt of commercial reality in regards to fines, fees, taxes, DEBTS and the like, having to go court, whether for traffic or for other matters. There we experience the pain of the 'economic needle' ... extracting our blood (your labor as converted into what you think is dollars) along with the message that ... 'Go forth and be a good citizen/subject, do what you are told, shut-up and be sure to vote!' Within this fictional world of make believe, the masses are subjected to playing a gigantic 'Monopoly Game' where there is no real money and the banker usually wins. REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"As such, and from time and time again, reliable sources (including attorneys) reveal that \"law\" has no bearing on what happens in court proceedings as much as the \"procedure\" of which is only known to BAR members (judges, prosecutors, attorneys, including the very defense attorney you were gullible enough to use, hire or who was compelled upon you) who carefully and methodically extract either/all your time (community service/slave labor), money (bail, liens, levy, garnishment, fine, restitution), property (child, home, car, bank account) or your liberty (detention, jail, prison, probation). No one told you that your 'Attorney' can ONLY represent your 'Debtor' (an artificial person-entity). No one told you that court proceedings are purely \"administrative\" and not \"judi cial\" as the \"organic\" Constitutions (State and Federal) mandate. In these \"administrative\" proceedings, why is it that these so-called courts do not explain the 'Nature and Cause' of the action, never prove 'Jurisdiction' and never allow you to have 'Counsel of your Choice' and never - never ever allow the jury to decide the law in a case/trial? Maybe those 'administrative' \"Tribunals\" are not Constitutional 'Judicial' Courts of Due Process . Welcome to America! Or maybe you turned on the radio or television and heard yet another politician praising the passage of a Bill of which neither the politician nor the other members of Congress ever read, let alone having ever brought it before the unbiased masses for scrutiny (which is not done because the Federal Constitution is not for the People). Nearly every Bill passed restricts more and more, in profound ways, freedom of speech, property rights, and freedom of travel, while at the same time, gives public servants more power and authority without having to be accountable to the \"people.\" Or maybe you received another tax bill (Federal, State, property), or a traffic ticket, or a child support payment bill ... or whatever. While looking at your bank balance or what's left in your wallet, you realize, \"Hey, I don't have the money to pay this!\" And due to the situation, you just might end up in jailor doing community service work to 'Pay Off' this ' d e bt t o s oc i ety! ' Wow, don't you get a 'Gold Star' for the day! What you will come to understand, learn and know, is that the United States (the Federal Corporation) went bankrupt in 1933 and as a result of further acts, removed the substance backing our Nation's money, replacing it with 'bankruptcy script' of a private corporation ... called the Federal Reserve Bank. Sometime in the 1960's, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) was adopted by most all States. The UCC is the federal common law of negotiable instruments and governs all transactions ... because there is no lawful money (substance backing the money being gold and silver) therefore you have not 'paid' your bills nor 'paid' for anything pursuant to the law of payment since 1933. All you have ever done is discharged the debt. .. until a future time, but you have not obt ai ned title ! The government, because of going bankrupt, had to finance its operation to survive and it needed to do so because it can only tax what it creates. It created artificial entities (' Ens legis,' being a 'corporation' or 'trust-corporation'), so that it could tax it and in doing so, sends you the 'tax bill' or other 'presentments' for fines, fees and taxes! In operating this scheme against you, you think the 'presentment' is in your name. The government has divested you of your 'rights, titles, interest, property and wealth' by and through an undisclosed and non-disclosed comm er cial program to RAPE, PILLAGE AND PLUNDER the American REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"people, to keep the 'private' government corporations functioning. In this book and others (the Redemption Companion, Cracking the Code 3 r d Edition, Redemption- The Cold Hard Facts and possibly other writings) you will learn, understand and know what the truth is, what the facts are and what the solution is to 'Re-capture' or REDEEM your 'rights, titles, interest, property and wealth' and put yourself in the position, with standing and capacity (status & knowledge) to ACCEPT FOR VALUE and discharge the debt(s) as a SECURED PARTY/CREDITOR ... (Not as a debtor/slave on the plantation as before). Keep in mind as you begin reading this manual, things within Redemption have evolved from the beginning and continue to do so, even now. You must make the effort to stay updated and currant to the best of your ability as to any 'new' aspects or matters dealing with Redemption. The historical concept is: that the American people are still the sovereign power. The Bible teaches that the Israelites (Ish= man, ra = ruling, el= God, = man ruling with God) are the \"Kings and Priests of Israel.\" When the Country was supposedly freed at the conclusion of the Revolutionary War, the concept was established that, \"A man is king in his own Castle.\" Last but not least, \"The people have succeeded to the rights of the King, the former sovereign of this State. They are not, therefore, bound by general words in a statute restrictive of prerogative, without being expressly named.\" Pray-tell, do 'kings' pay taxes? The people, due to the bankruptcy and commercial law in place that allows the people, as the sovereign power, in their Secured Party / Creditor capacity, to discharge ALL the fines, fees, taxes, judgments and debts, take control of all the property ... BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TODAY TO PAY THE DEBT(S) (AS THERE IS NO LAWFUL MONEY), YOUR STATUS WAS CHANGED TO DEBTOR/SLAVE ON THE PLANTATION FOR THE FINANCIAL BENEFIT OF CORPORATE GOVERNMENT. Before you is a path, like the yellow brick road to OZ. What you will learn will affect you from this day forward, one way or the other. Freedom and truth is like a two-edged sword and with Redemption comes a lot of responsibility to know and understand all that is necessary to become the Secured Party/Creditor (SPC) aka 'sovereign' (in the collective capacity) with other SPC's to understand the reality ... 'Of the people, by the people and for the people.' As the Creditor, you are the 'Banker,' therefore would you not agree that you have a lot to learn? Note: the Treasury indicated that around January of 2001 that there were \"over 11 million\" transactions/charge-backs sent in which equates to \"Over 11 million Secured Party/Creditors on Boar d!\" And around mid-year of 2002 the number was increased to 22 million and most recently (12-2006) 55 million ... but those numbers have in no way been verified. However, you now can become part of this growing base of informed, knowledgeable 'Secured Party/Creditors' - men and women who, as intended by our God and due to the reality of our 'day and time,' are moving forward as those, who being 'above the government corporations, are taking their rightful positions over the government/servant who operate those bankrupt corporations to understand the commercial scheme and discharge the debts.

With that, as in the movie Matrix, you are holding the Red pill. You want to know the truth and a whole lot more.

May God guide and bless you on this journey! REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"FORWARD This REDEMPTION MANUAL FIFTH EDITION is the continuation of an unusual work. Some portions from the third edition are left intact while others have been updated. Formatting, commentary, updates, and new information have been added. Where necessary, some information-documentation will be taken from THE REDEMPTION COMPANION to better present or document a particular point or matter. The writings of a man in prison, preserving his thoughts, his study notes, and his conclusions within letters to his family are maintained. This individual has chosen to reveal his understanding of why he was in prison and how he got there. How to keep the rest of us out of there, how to understand the commercial nature of all things, is the reason for the update of this FIFTH EDITION. In the following pages you will find history, definitions, Scripture, information, and best of all, what we Americans have been deprived of from the beginning: 'the total (as we best understand it today) of the undisclosed COMMERCIAL SCHEME that has been perpetuated upon every man, woman and child in America since 1933 ... and ... the solution. In the beginning of this manual are references to Scripture. Though some believe it to be a direct part of what we call REDEMPTION, it is also presented herein to show that: 'comm ercial law' has been in use since day one. Some believe that this Country, without the guidance and help of Almighty God, as a Nation, is doomed. That might be true, however, 'for evil to prevail, good men do nothing.' We, like so many other civilizations before us, may have left our first love. For it is said in Scripture: \"Thou shalt not have any other gods befo re Me!\" That's all well and fine, but when one is compelled to honor Caesar and his private corporate rules, regulations, and statutes to support his de-facto bankrupt corporation under democratic socialism (today called the Federal and State government(s)) it's a little difficult except in your private prayer room/closet to recognize by prayer or otherwise your Creator/God, when out in the federal fictional world, there are many gods to distract the people. It is said that the LOVE OF MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL. Again, that might be true in some cases. Obviously in today's society, people scramble for what they think is money to pay the bills and live in what they think, or hope, is a comfortable way of life ... for it is all they know. Our so-called leaders in their lust for power and money have sold our fathers, ourselves, and our children (our posterity to the 10th generation) into bondage. Today every man, woman and child owes $1000.00 to the national debt. This may be perceived as immoral and reprehensible! However, it is just BACKWARDS! The so-called government OWES YOU that amount and a whole lot more for their fraud, damage and dishonor: \"All that government does and provides legitimately is in pursuit of its duty to provide protection for private rights, which duty is a debt owed to its creator, WE THE PEOPLE.\" (Wynhammerv. People, NY 378) REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"So you see, they owe us! However, due to their unauthorized actions and corruptions, they have removed what was 'Constitutionally' established as real money, backed by something of value, i.e., gold and silver. Therefore, what you THINK you owe, what they THINK you owe, what you THINK they owe you ... is of no importance, when there is nothing in 'reality' to 'pay' with! And since a total different commercial system has been put into effect to allow what has been called this 'Commerce Game' to go on and on and on, it is only a matter of importance to fully understand it and utilize it, in and for your commercial transactions and in regards to what 'your' so-called government demands ... (example) in the nature of TAXES! Many remarkable discoveries lie ahead. Keep in mind, not everything in everyone's commercial life's situations can be addressed or covered herein, however the principles can be applied to almost every situation. If someone were to ask to you place a value on your freedom, you would undoubtedly say that it is one of your most prized possessions. If on the other hand, someone were to ask you to name in a single word that which most impinges on your freedom, how many of you would volunteer, \"why me, of course!\" Then name in a single word the commodity that you are most dependent on in forming your impressions, making decisions, and understanding your world. How many of you would say \"accurate information?\" Lastly, what word or phrase might you use to label a person who is proud to be oblivious to the underlying conditions of his or her life-\"ignoramus,\" \"fool,\" \"dupe,\" \"easily conned,\" \"asleep,\" \"doesn't care,\" \"pretender,\" \"happy idiot,\" \"insane,\" or \"delusional?\" And if this described your condition, would you be willing to take a deeper look within? In the experience of this author, this describes the majority of Americans today. So, it is for the reasons stated above, that Redemption is for everyone and few will be willing to pay the price-to learn, to take responsibility, and to act. These are the attributes that are required of any man or woman who would be free. \"I will not make any deals with you. I've resigned. I will not be pushed, filed, and stamped, indexed, debriefed or numbered. My life is my own . ... You won't hold me.\" To which Number 2 sardonically replies, \"Won't we?\" Thus begins \"The Arrival,\" the first of 17 television episodes originally broadcast in Britain in 1967. Subsequent shows seem to support that Number 2 (a role played by a different actor in each episode) is right--the Prisoner can be held. Indeed, each program ends with a set of jail bars closing over the Prisoner's face. But what they--whoever they are--can't do is defeat him. For the Prisoner manages to triumph despite his hopeless situation because of his unrepentant refusal to sacrifice his ideals and self-identity. So you can sit around and massage each other's hearts, whining and complaining about all the problems you see out there-the government, the economy, your neighbors, etc., or you can look within and realize that you can't control anything but yourself, and if you were to do that well, and join with others around you who are doing that well, you stand a chance, and without that, well, you have what you have. If you read this book, your perceptions and your belief system will be challenged. You will stand at the precipice and say to yourself, well, if everything that I have been taught is a clever lie and an illusion, then what is the truth? And if you make it to the other side you will understand the full meaning of the phrase \"truth is stranger than fiction.\" Which do you prefer, the RED PILL or the BLUE? REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Finally, understand a few important concepts right here in the beginning. You MUST cleanse your mind of the law!! The scripture refers to this as the \"renewing of your mind.\" You MUST cleanse your heart, your soul, and your mind of the 'conditioning,' or as some would call it, the brainwashing. Some would have you believe that you are both the 'Subject and Object' of government today. Not so. The people are to be the Principle, the sovereign power, but now in Secured Party/Creditor capacity.

REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 20"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"W e go to the movies for entertainment, maybe to get away from the reality of our world and just for a few moments we escape that reality and enter a 'Twilight Zone' if you will, of adventure, romance, and the like. But is it possible someone is trying to tell you something? Is there 'full disclosure' being made on the silver screen? Are you aware of the message or have you been oblivious? Following are movie reviews on the Wizard of Oz and the MATRIX movies. They are presented herein to allow you to understand 'really' what has happened and what to understand. The Wizard of OZ The 'Coded' Movie of What Really Happened to America By Robert Kelly Just as you can read between the gory lines in the newspaper on any given day in America, you can discover clues and truths slipped in by the Powers that be ... if you look hard enough as to what is actually going on. Such 'notice' can also be found in somewhat lighter fare ... the movies! As you well know, movies have become the national pastime of entertainment. Millions go to the movies, VHS tapes and DVDs fill in the rest of the gap. The story-line, topics, and time­ frames vary as to the manuscript and the vision of the Directors. Such a movie was 'The Wizard of Oz,' an allegory for the new state of affairs in America in the 1930s following the stock market crash and the factual bankruptcy of the United States Government immediately following. 'The Wizard of Oz' movie is not just a movie for children, though perceived today it is, and it has become a national icon of an historical nature, replayed every year on television ... just for the children. What is missed by most, is the symbolism in the movie, in almost every character and aspects of the 'set' and so-called 'special effects' and props back then. After reading this article and then seeing the movie again, it will never be the same to you ... or your children! The setting was Kansas: Heartland America, the geographical center of the USA. In comes the twister, the tornado, i. e. whirling confusion of the stock market crash that left everybody economically 'dizzy!' It signified the theft of America's gold, the coming US bankruptcy, the Great Depression. The tornado whisked Dorothy and Toto up into a new, artificial (dream-like) dimension somewhere above the solid ground of Kansas. When Dorothy awakes, she finds herself in the 'land of Oz.' Dorothy comments to her little companion, \"Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.\" REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"That's right. After the bankruptcy, Kansas was no longer just plain old \"Kansas,\" it was now \"KS,\" an artificial corporate venue of the bankrupt United States, newly established \"federal territory,\" part of the \"Federal Zone,\" and Dorothy and Toto were in \"this state\" now. On her journey in this unfamiliar land, Dorothy meets up with three unusual 'characters,' each having certainly a different problem or aspect as portrayed on the silver-screen, but their true identity has been de-coded and it follows! The first was the Scarecrow (a man of straw - a front) and 'he' identified his Straw-man persona for Dorothy; \"Some people without brains do an awful lot of talking. Of course, I'm not bright about doing things.\" And in his classic song, \"If I Only Had a Brain,\" the Scarecrow/Straw-man succinctly argued, \"I'd unravel every riddle, for every 'individdle,' (individual) in trouble or in pain.\" Today, in light of Redemption, we would translate it as: Once one discovers that his Straw­ man exists, all political and legal mysteries, complexities, and confusions are resolved or understood and once one takes legal title (control) to his 'Straw-man,' he becomes the 'authorized representative' of the 'Straw-man' to accept and discharge (settle) all commercial affairs, as in Oz (the new commercial world - aka the MATRIX) because the 'Straw-man' has no BRAINS, and no hands and fingers to grasp a pen to write the check, so to speak, to pay the fine, fee, tax or debt! The second character was the Tin Man, or \"T.I.N. man\" (also identified as; Tax payer Identification Number). The Tin Man was a hollow man of metal, a \"vessel,\" a \"vehicle,\" a newly created commercial code word for the Straw-man. Just like the Scarecrow, the Tin Man had no brain and had no heart. Both were \"artificial persons.\" One of the definitions of \"tin\" in Webster's is \"counterfeit.\" The Tin Man also represented the mechanical and heartless aspect of commerce and commercial law. Just like they say in the Mafia: \"Nothing personal, it's just business.\" And in another profession similar to the Mafia, the business of lawyering, they have the attitude that it's nothing personal, \"bidness is bidness.\" The heartless Tin Man also carried an ax, the traditional symbol for God, i.e., modem commercial law in earlier dominant civilizations, including fascist states. In the words of the Tin Man, expressing relief after Dorothy had oiled his rusty points and parts he said, \"I've held that ax up for ages.\" The word \"ace\" is etymologically related to the word \"ax,\" and in a deck of cards the only one above the King is the Ace, i.e. God. One of the \"Axis\" Powers of World War II, Italy, was a fascist state. The symbol for fascism is the \"fasces,\" a bundle of rods with an ax bound up in the middle and its blade projecting. The fasces may be found on the reverse of the American Mercury-head Dime (in Roman deity 'Mercury' was the God of Commerce). It can also be found on the wall behind, and on each side of, the speaker's podium in the US Senate (each gilded fasces is approximately six feet in height), and at the base of the seal of the US Senate are two crossed fasces. The third character that Dorothy met was the Cowardly Lion, or \"King of Beasts\" and as the most feared of all animals in the jungle, was lacking \"courage! \" The Lion is symbolic of the once fearless American people, who have since lost their courage. Yes, there are a lot of \"hot talkers\" out there, just listen to your local radio talk shows. American men love to talk, but none have the courage to \"DO\" a damn thing! The American people are scared of the corporate Federal System and local revenue collectors, i.e. cops and judges in their so-called courtrooms (tribunals) of justice (commerce). After your first few go-arounds with the 'Just-Us' system, believing there was 'justice' in the courts, you probably lost some of your courage too. And you REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 22"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"may have not known it, but the IRS has been dealing with only your 'Straw-man' (Debtor) strictly under the laws of Commerce and they are just like the Tin Man, heartless! After Dorothy and her three companions made their way to Oz, they had learned that they had to go see the 'Wizar d.' To find the Wizard, they had to just \"follow the yellow brick road,\" (gold is known as 'yellow bricks' and are melted into 'ingots!') All one has to do is follow the trail of America's stolen gold and you will find the thief who stole it. In the beginning of the movie the Wizard was represented by the traveling mystic, \"Professor Marvel,\" whom Dorothy encountered when she ran away with Toto. His macabre shingle touted that he was \"Acclaimed By The Crowned Heads of Europe, Past, Present, and Future.\" Boy, that Professor Marvel must have been a regular wizard to be acclaimed by the future crowned heads of Europe before they were even crowned! Before the bankers stole America, they had long since disempowered the Christian monarchies of Europe and looted their kingdoms. Maybe this \"Professor Marvel\" fellow knew something about the future that other folks didn't. With a human skull peering down from its painted perch above the door inside his wagon, the good professor lectured Dorothy of the priests of Isis and Osiris and the days of the pharaohs of Egypt! When Dorothy and her new friends emerged from the forest they were elated to see the Emerald City before them, only a short jaunt away. Then came the Wicked Witch of the West, desperate for the ruby slippers that Dorothy was wearing, as they held special powers. A significant point here is that in the original book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, published in 1900, (39 years earlier), the slippers were not red, but silver. In the first cut of the movie, the slippers were silver, but were changed to 'red' to be more colorful! At the time the book was written, America still had all its gold and silver. The value of one ounce of gold was set at 15 ounces of silver, with silver being the more plentiful of the two metals and generally known as 'poor man's gold!' Just as the silver slippers carried Dorothy, America's stockpile of silver and gold, backing the currency, carried the country to a position of preeminence throughout the world at that time. But, as mentioned, when the movie came out in 1939 the slippers were not silver, but red. Between 1916 and 1933, most of America's gold was rounded up by the 'privately owned' Federal Reserve Banks and shipped off to the Fed owners in England and Germany. The reason for this was that Federal Reserve Notes could be redeemed in gold and the use of Federal Reserve Notes carried an interest penalty that could only be paid in gold. The American people were defrauded into trading their gold for (worthless) paper with green ink on it. Our previous currency, United States Notes, carried no such interest requirements - but such was the bargain that came with the Federal Reserve Notes. The reason JFK was murdered was because he was re­ issuing United States Notes - interest free! [Go to any coin store and see or buy a 1963 U.S. (not Federal Reserve) Note]. When the bankruptcy was declared in 1933, Americans were required (misdirected) to tum in all gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates by May 1 st; known as \"May Day\" (the birthday of Communism in Bavaria in 1776, the birthday of the IRS, and celebrated worldwide as the \"International Workers Holiday,\" a holy day to the Wizard and his tribe). Talking to people who were alive at that time, you may find out that the general sentiment toward such thievery bordered on a second revolution. Maybe it was just too much of a clue, or too much salt in the wound for Dorothy to be skipping down the \"Yellow Brick Road\" in a pair of \"silver slippers,\" so that, for whatever reason, a color less likely to annoy or provoke was selected (i.e., red!). REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"With regard to the choice of \"ruby,\" or red-colored, slippers: Red's primary significance, at least on documents and the like, is that it is the color of blood, as in flesh-and-blood, and symbolizes a living, breathing man or woman, i. e., non-corporate/non-artifici al. The color 'Red' could also have been chosen for the related tie to the International Banking Federal Reserve founder, the Rothchilds, [aka Red Shield] family. It does signify \"private,\" as opposed to \"public.\" Your new Social Security Card has a red serial number on the reverse, signifying the private­ side 'bond/account' attached to the public side of your \"Straw-man's\" Social Security Account . For postal employees, red-sticker Registered Mail means \"personal accountability\" (private), all other mail carries \"limited liability\" (public). It is likely that the ruby slippers symbolized the American people with blood in their veins as opposed to \"citizens of the United States,\" Straw­ men with the counterfeit \"corporate blood\" of bluelblack ink on a birth certificate. No matter their color in the movie, the Wicked Witch of the West wanted those slippers at any cost and had to move fast before Dorothy and her crew could make it to the Emerald City. The Witch's tactic was to cover the countryside with poppy flowers, or \"poppies,\" the source of heroin, opium, and morphine, symbolically drugging them (the American people) into unconsciousness, and then just waltz in and snatch the slippers. In other words, the best way to subjugate the American people and boost the goods was to dull their senses by getting them hooked on drugs (Note: LSD was created the same year, 1939, by Dr. Albert Hoffman). The poppies/drugs worked on Dorothy, the Lion and Toto, our flesh-and-blood friends, but had no effect on the Scarecrow or the Tin Man, the artificial entities. The two of them cried out for help and Glenda, the Good Witch of the North, answered their prayers with a blanket of snow, aka cocaine, a stimulant nullifying the narcotic effect of the poppies/opium on Dorothy, the Lion and Toto. At this writing, aside from marijuana, the two most available drugs on the streets of America are heroin and cocaine in their various forms. As they all scampered toward Emerald City, the city of green (Federal Reserve Notes, the new fiat \"money,\" or \"money by decree\"), we heard the Munchkins singing on the glory of the Wizard's creation: \"You're out of the woods, You're out of the dark, You're out of the night, Step into the sun, step into the light, Keep straight ahead, for the most glorious place on the face of the Earth or the stars !\" The foregoing jingle abounds with llluminist-Luciferian symbols and metaphors re: darkness and light. The Wicked Witch of the West made her home in a round, medieval watchtower, ancient symbol of the Knights Templar of Freemasonry, who are given to practicing witchcraft and also credited as the originators of modem banking, circa 1099 A.D. The Wicked Witch of the West was also dressed in black, the color symbolizing the planet Saturn, sacred icon of the Knights Templar, and the color of choice of judges and priests for their robes. Who was the Wicked Witch of the West ? Remember, in the first part of the film her counterpart was \"Almira Gulch,\" who, according to Aunt Em, \"owned half the county.\" Miss Gulch alleged that Dorothy's dog, Toto, had bitten her. She came to the farm with an \"Order from the Sheriff' demanding that they surrender Toto to her custody. Aunt Em was not immediately cooperative, and answered Miss Gulch's allegations that Toto had bitten her with: \"He's really gentle. With gentle people, that is.\" Could \"gentle\" really mean \"Gentile ?\" When Miss Gulch defied them to withhold Toto and \"go against the law,\" dear old Aunt Em was relegated to \"pushing the Party line\" for Big REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 24"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Brother. She dutifully succumbed to the pressure and counseled Dorothy reluctantly. [Does this sound like most American people? ] \"We can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.\" When Dorothy refused to surrender Toto, Miss Gulch lashed out, \"If you don't hand over that dog, I'll bring a damned suit that'll take your whole farm!\" Today, 70% of all attorneys in the world reside in the West - America, to be exact, and 95% of all lawsuits in the world are filed under US jurisdiction. The Wicked Witch of the West and Miss Gulch, dear friends, represent judges and attorneys, i.e., the American legal system (including the attorney-run US Congress). They are the executioners and primary henchman for transferring all wealth in America from the people over to the banks and the government. The Wicked Witch of the West wanted the silver slippers, the precious metals, and her counterpart, Miss Gulch, wanted to take Toto. What does the word \"toto\" mean ... in \"attorney language,\" i.e. Latin? \"Everything! \" Dorothy and her three companions finally made their way to the Emerald City. They sought an audience before the Wizard, were taken inside and brought before the Wizard; a gigantic image speaking in a loud voice behind glass, similar to 'smoke and mirrors!' Dorothy and the gang fell for the Wizard's illusion, power and commands in the beginning. But it was little Toto who, by his instinct, pulled the curtain back to expose the fraud of the Wizard; a 'front-man' for the Wizard ... an 'agent' for the FICTION ... this Wizard the people feared. The Wizard, this gigantic image speaking in a loud voice behind glass, could very well symbolize, with the advent of television, the power of government speaking lies before the people via TV. 'Cause if the people saw it on TV, it must be true! And, of course, the people will believe their government. .. won't they? Remember the drugs? But Dorothy and the others soon wised up and revealed the Wizard for what he was: a confidence man. Then, when asking the 'agent' (administrative agencies) about helping the Scarecrow/Straw-man, about \"getting a brain,\" he gave the Straw-man a piece of paper and a diploma from a \"university.\" The Wizard also cited \"the land of .E Pluribus Unum, \" which is Latin for 'one out of many,' i.e., converting the many into one New World Order, or Novus Ordo Seclorum, a Latin phrase placed on the American One Dollar Bill shortly after the bankruptcy. He also proudly revealed/confessed that he was: \"Born and bred in the heart of the Western wilderness, an old Kansas man myself! \" He gave the TIN man a 'ticker' (clock) to sound like a heart (but it was not!) and to the Lion, he gave a 'Medal' to signify that the Lion had courage. These all, of course, were mere trinkets in the Land of Oz - a fictional world of course! The bankers did pretty well in Europe, but as the Wizard pointed out, they made a killing in the \"Western wilderness,\" i.e. America, with the theft of American gold, labor, and property. Quoting John D. Rockefeller : \" ... grateful and responsive rural folk\" who populated the country at that time. When Dorothy asked Glenda, the Good Witch of the North (representing honesty, good-faith and Christianity), for help in getting back to Kansas, Glenda replied: \"You don't need to be helped. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.\"Just click your heels together three times (three days - Truth in Lending) and say, \"There's no place like home! \"\" Translation: You've always had the right and power to reclaim your sovereignty, you just forgot or were never taught that you or the American people have such power. The Oregon Bill of Rights says the people have \"all powe r!\" Since the people are the true sovereign power , then it is only necessary to wake from the dumbed-down, drugged-like effect the 'Powers-that-Be' have over you and the American people as to that power and position, and then exercise it. REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 25"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The actual reclaiming of your sovereignty, the remedy in today's bankrupt commercial world, is a process including a UCC- l Form to the Secretary of State, and a Charge Back Invoice with Bill of Exchange to the Secretary of the Treasury U.S ., wherein you can take commercial control of your Straw-man (with a T.I.N. number) and charge up your UCC Contract Trust Account so that you can discharge the debt(s) of your debtor. Americans have intimate, firsthand knowledge of the heartless mechanics of the laws of commerce, religiously applied by the example of the unregistered foreign agents of the Internal Revenue Services. The IRS (accounting firm and collection agency for the private Federal Reserve Bank) was constituted under the UCC at its inception in 1954 and has been operating strictly in that realm ever since. And, as a side note, how was the wicked Witch destroyed? By accident, a bucket of 'water' (the true substance of all things, good and healthy - simple water [H20 ] destroyed the 'evil' just like the '0' in Ozone destroys virus and bacteria (cancer) did the oxygen in the water destroy the evil Witch! You may have wondered what the meaning is behind the words in the title \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Look them up in a dictionary. Like almost everything else, it's right out there in the open for you to see if you will just look closely enough. One definition of \"wizard\" is: \"a very clever or skillful person.\" \"OZ\" is an abbreviation of \"onza,\" o-n-z-a, the Italian word for \"ounce,\" or \"ounces,\" the unit of measurement of gold, silver, and other precious metals. No matter how large the quantity of gold or silver being discussed, the amount is always expressed in ounces , e.g., rather than \"hundreds of tons\" of gold, it's \"so many million ounces\" of gold. As attested by the factual history of this country, the \"Wizard of Oz\" was the Wizard of Ounces. And who took the gold that backed the America's money? Why the Bankers and the lawyers working for the foreign principals, the private federal reserve (constituting the 20 Class A Stockholders - being mostly private bankers!) all orchestrated and greased by POLITICIANS then and still today . Only because it is not the mind set of politicians today to correct the matter and put full and absolute power over the control, creation, minting and putting into circulation of \"United States Money\" backed by gold (substance/value! ). What everyone has to understand is that as things are today, the commercial system as in place is better for everyone ... just as long as everyone understands the 'program!' Maybe \"The Wizard of Oz\" back then was the 'introduction to the program as to the monetary condition and changes in American.' It just appears that no one told (gave full disclosure) to the American people not only of the change, but how to operate in this new commercial world where all the real value was removed and all that was put in its place was comm ercial paper! Everything worked out for Dorothy, i.e., the American people. In the end she \"made it home.\" Meaning: there is remedy in law. It's there, it was just encoded and disguised and camouflaged . Fortunately, the code has been cracked, and there is a way home, just like in the movie. Like Dorothy said, \"There's no place like home\" and there isn't! There's nothing like sovereignty fo r a sovereign people! We have commercial remedy in the Redemption Process. Will you continue to be conned by the confidence men and believe the Wizard's words coming out from that box of 'smoke and mirrors' called the TV, or will you wise up like Dorothy did and \"look behind the scenes\" to recognize the scheme? Will you rise above the occasion and obtain the knowledge to become a Secured Party Creditor, private banker and Sovereign to take your place among others who are above the government, instead of being that 'debtor-slave on the plantation' living your life in debt and servitude?

The Fi rst Movie FROM: ZION GROUP - RIGHT WAY l.a.w. [Jack Smith] TO: ALL PERSONS STILL LODGED IN THE MATRIX! SUBJECT: EMERG ENCY! THE TIME IS NOW TO EXTRACT YOURSELF FROM THE MATRIX - YOUR SAVIOR HAS COME FOR YOU! C are must be taken when describing and decoding the information for the uninformed that is coming from within the MATRIX by way of the Communication . The uninformed cannot be told about the MATRIX, they must experience it. The Communication rightly explains to them that \"The MATRIX is the world pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. It makes you a slave. A prison for your mind .\" If you attempt to expose the uninformed to too much \"light,\" you will blind them . The Communication is the story of the Gospel of the Scripture, but it is set within the framework of a Greek-science-fiction-dr ama . The leading character is named Neo . He is played by Keanu Reeves . The word Neo in Greek means new . Neo is the new man or the new Adam come to save the people of ZION . But first, he must die and be resurrected by the Trini ty. Once resurrected, he will save the world by taking people out of the MATRIX and into the land of ZION . The problem is that in the beginning, Neo does not know who he is or where he is. He first must be brought out of the land of the MATRIX and learn who he is. He is extracted by a team of Zionists led by their leader, Morpheus, who is played by Laurence Fishbu rne . The woman Trinity, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, is one the principal person from the Zion group that communicates with people in the MATRIX . Together, Morpheus represents God the Father ; Trinity represents God the Holy Spirit (who breathes life back into Neo and brings the message to the MAT RIX) ; and Neo represents God the Son . Their team of helpers is called the people of Zion . They consult the ORACLE, which represents the Holy Scripture . The ORACLE does not judge good from evil, but is a guide to show the path upon which the people of Zion must go. The people of Zion use a vessel named the NEBUCHADNEZZAR as a means of travel within the MATRIX . Allied against the Zionists is the MATR IX. The MATRIX is the world which has deceived all the people therein to fall into a dreamlike sleep. In this condition, the people are warehoused in large storage facilities . The people are physically hooked up to the cells in this warehouse by tubes that both feed them and extract electrical and heat energy from them to run the machines of the world who have taken over control. The tubes also feed the people in the MATRIX REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 28"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"computer generated thoughts programmed into MATRIX computers. Therefore, life in the MATRIX is nothing more than an incredibly-complex computer program created by the MATRIX to conceal the real intent of raising and harvesting human beings to provide electrical energy to run the machines which control the MATRIX. These electronic thoughts fed to the people in the MATRIX create a substitute for real thinking and real thoughts and real experience. Instead, the people in the MATRIX only believe that they are alive and experiencing their lives. Their bodies never physically leave the cells in which they are kept. But to their minds, they appear to be living a normal existence with a job, personal relationships, hobbies, and the like. In the MATRIX, everyone is united as in \"AI\", artificial intelligence. Your world is a computer program that appears real to you. There is a group that works for the MATRIX called the Agents. These Agents are not real people, but sentient computer programs which give the Agents supernatural powers. Their job is to locate and destroy people who have either physically disconnected from the MATRIX or who are within the MATRIX but are receiving unauthorized communications from people outside the MATRIX. The name of the leading Agent is SMITH, who represents SATAN, a totally evil entity out to destroy any living being who would attempt to physically leave the MATRIX. All communications with people within the MATRIX are done through the MATRIX computers. The communication can be made by way of a phone connection (or modem connection) to the MATRIX computer which in tum communicates with the person in the MATRIX over the direct computer link to the person's mind. Once a person is physically removed from the MATRIX, that person never again physically goes into the MATRIX, but is mentally projected into the MATRIX computer. Before Neo comes out of the MATRIX and learns who he is, Neo is captured by the Agents and taken to an interrogation. Agent Smith says: \"O.K. Mr. Anderson. I see a man sitting before me who has two lives [one in the law forum of the MATRIX and one in the law forum of Zion]. Your first life is as a man named Thomas A. Anderson. In this life you have an SSN, you pay your taxes. You work as a computer programmer for a software development company. Your second life is as a man named Neo. Neo has committed almost every computer crime in the book [in our law forum]. Only one of these lives has a future. Which life is that going to be?\" The leader of the resistance movement is named Morpheus. This, like Neo, is also a Greek name. You might not be familiar with this name. I wasn't. The name means \"he who forms, or molds.\" Morpheus was the Greek god of dreams. The Encyclopedia Mythica says: \"He lies on an ebony bed in a dim-lit cave. He appears to humans in their dreams in the shape of man. He is responsible for shaping dreams, or giving shape to the beings which inhabit dreams. Morpheus ... Is mentioned as the son Hypnos, the god of sleep.\" Morpheus is the man who, with the help of others, extracts Neo from the Matrix and leads him to resolve who he is and how Neo can save the people from the Matrix. The name MORPHEUS is also a computer game by Piranha Interactive Publishing, Inc. \"Imagine a world where you died but your dreams lived on. The adventure begins with you as an explorer, separated from your party, aboard the ship Herculania [in the movie, the ship's name is the NEBUCHADNE ZZAR]. You are looking to resolve the legacy of your father who has disappeared in the region 30 years earlier. You become despondent, certain of your impending death, drifting between strange and foreboding dreams.\" This game could well be a semi-outline for the movie MATRIX. What led Neo to question his life in the MATRIX? At one time, Morpheus asks him : \"You REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 29"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"don't like the idea of not being in control of your own life, do you? \" And Neo answers in the affirmative. Neo's name is an anagram for the \"ONE\" or the savior. In a discussion with the Agent SMITH, Neo was told : \"Once we started thinking for you, it [the MATRIX] became our [not your] world.\" Neo asked what would happen if you die in the MATRIX. The answer is that you also die in the real world since the body cannot live without the mind. Neo also asked what would happen if one tries to take on the Agents in the MATRIX. The answer is: \"They are all powerful in the MATRIX. You cannot take them on \"in this [meaning the artificial world they created without rules] place.\" The only way to prevail is to run from them and get out of the MATRIX. That is because there are no rules [or law] in the MATRIX. The rules and the law in the MATRIX are whatever the MATRIX computer programs say that they are. The law is a fiction. The MATRIX is run on a public policy of containment of the living beings in the MATRIX. Nothing more and nothing less. There are many symbols in the Communication. Neo, when mentally extracted from the MATRIX, is given the opportunity by the people of Zion to decide whether or not he wants to be physically extracted, also. He is warned that after being physically extracted, it will be very difficult to return to the MATRIX if he changes his mind. Neo is offered a blue pill to take if he wants to mentally go back into the MATRIX and be mentally sedated, never again to question the MATRIX. He is offered a red pill if he wants to physically come out. The red pill is symbolic of the blood of Christ sacrificed to set man free from the things of this world. The pills are also symbolic of the story of Alice in Wonderland and the song sung by Gracie Slick- \"One pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small.\" Neo first meets the Zionists at a meeting spot called the \"Adam Street Bridge.\" This is symbolically where Thomas A. Anderson, the first Adam in sin, crosses over into the hands of the Zionists to become the makings of the second Adam. Thomas A. Anderson, when he was still within the MATRIX, was wakened by his alarm clock which read \"9:18 A.M.\" The number 9 stands for the fruits of the spirit [or the coming of blessing or judgment], while 18 represents bondage [the condition Thomas A. Anderson was in]. Thomas A. Anderson lives in room number 101 in a hotel named \"The Heart of the City\" during his existence in the MATRIX. The \"heart\" is the metaphor for the physical life of the person or entity. It represents that Thomas A. Anderson was destined to be that life which is to come out of the MATRIX and give life to the people in the MATRIX. Room number \"101\" deals with the numbers 10 = Fullness of law and responsibility and teaching, and 1 = Unity, primacy. Thomas A. Anderson is the one that will apply the natural law to defeat the law of the MATRIX. Trinity carries on her activities within the MATRIX out of room \"303.\" Room number \"303\" deals with the numbers 30 = blood of Christ, and 3 = division, perfection, and completeness. Neo's physical removal from the matrix is a birthing cycle in which the \"cord\" was cut, the birthing fluids were present, and the escape afterwards from the pod where the birthing took place was through a pool of water (a baptism) into a new life. There are several other washings [or baptisms] represented by the waters falling at the Adam Street Bridge, etc. Look up the term \"Matrix\" in Black's 4th Law Dictionary. You may be amazed. It means : \"In civil law, the protocol or first draft of a legal instrument, from which all copies must be taken.\" Does this refer to the fact that \"all copies\" or all people within the MATRIX must follow the \"prime directive\" of the MATRIX to work and slave for the MATRIX?

This term was anciently applied to a cathedral, in relation to the other churches in the same see, or to a parochial church, in relation to the chapels or minor churches attached to it or depending on it.\" The Communication is trying to tell you that the MATRIX [or the world] is a mother church preaching a religion. A religion based upon an illusion and false sense of being. Did you ever get the impression that life as we know it is backwards. That what we perceive as reality is the illusion and what we perceive as illusion is the reality? In the Communication, you get the picture from both sides of the mirror where the MATRIX is on the illusion side of the mirror and Zion is on the real side of the mirror. The end of the Communication is nothing short of jubilant and heroic. Neo makes a \"phone call\" to the people of the MATRIX. He is feeding a direct communication into their mind by way of the computer hookup. Neo tells them, \"There are no rules. You can do anything that you want to.\" The law is done away with in their law forum. Their Constitution is dead. (as long as you do not harm the life, liberty or property of another). Neo invites them to join the Zionists. As proof that there is no law in their law forum, Neo flies away into the sky as a superman. [After all, if there is no law, there is no gravity in their law forum]. May the force of Zion be your calling. IT'S TIME TO COM E OUT OF THE DAR K!

The Second Movie T hink of a movie as though it were a parable. A parable is a story which parallels real life issues. But it is told in such a manner that the average person will not understand the meaning of the story as it relates to real life. The story or parable itself discusses facts and answers the WHO, WHAT, WHERE and WHEN questions . The true meaning of the parable is in the answer to the WHY question that most people do not ask or answer. This Article is addressed to the WHY people. If you are one of the WHAT people, take the blue pill and go back into your position in the Matrix. Are you still in the Matrix or are you one of the people of Zion? If you answered that question by determining that you are out of the Matrix and you are one of the people of Zion, then you still might have a serious problem in understanding what your relationship is to the controllers of the Matrix. You are not as independent as you might think. This is the true value of the message being given in the movie The Matrix 2. The Movie, The Matrix 2, introduces us to a much higher concept of liberty and responsibility, and especially the concept of being at war or at peace with the system. It answers the question of \"Do you have a choice when you are out of the Matrix?\" The answer is yes! But you might be surprised that the ability to have choice does not give you freedom and independence from the controllers of the Matrix. In the Movie The Matrix 2, we are introduced to the people who live in a city called Zion. The first movie did not describe Zion at all. It only dealt with several people from Zion that were aboard the vessel the Nebuchadnezzar. Zion is a city deep in the core of the earth away from the Matrix. It is inhabited by people who have been physically removed from the Matrix. The Matrix warehouses the remaining 99% of the humans in a condition similar to a coma in which the humans are fed nutrients and the illusion of a normal life by machines run by computers. The Matrix harvests the bodily heat and chemical energy from the human bodies to power the machine world. When a physical body dies in the Matrix, it is removed from the Matrix by the machines and ground up and fed to the remaining inhabitants as a food source. The underground city of Zion appears to be a mirror of the Matrix. Whereas in the Matrix, the machines appear to control the humans therein living off of their energy, in the City of Zion, the people control the machines which serve them and keep them alive. The Matrix appears to be on the surface of the earth where humans ordinarily live and survive. The City of Zion is deep in the earth as though it were a burial ground for the dead. The people on the surface living in the Matrix are, for all intents and purposes, dead (or living in a dream or a coma), but mentally have perceived themselves to be very much alive by their mental stimulation through the Matrix's computers. The people in Zion are buried deep in the earth (where ordinarily the corpses are REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 32"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"buried, but they are men tally awake and very much physically at liberty from the physical and mental constraints of the Matrix's computers and warehouses) . There are several interesting issues that are raised with the Movie The Matrix 2. The first movie was mostly about Neo, personally . It was about waking him up from his naivety and the placing of him into a position in which he could be aware of, and deal with, larger issues than his own condition and future . Since the Movie is only a parable to teach us, the first movie also was about waking us up to the reality of the world . Now, in the second movie, we are ready for larger issues. This is what we are getting . There are three major conversations in the Movie The Matrix Two which serve to introduce us to the more important aspects of our relationship as people who have come out of the Matrix to the issue of the Matrix still being there as a \"neighbor .\" What should be our relationship? Should we fight the Matrix? Should we destroy the Matrix? Should we be at peace with it? In the first movie, Neo was extracted from the Matr ix. Who accomplished this extraction? Was it Neo himself? Was it Morpheus? Was it Trinity? No ! Neo was offered a blue pill or a red pill. The blue pill represents admiralty . If Neo took the blue pill, he would be put back into a condition of delusion to conform to the public policies and would have no interest in learning any of the private conditions of reality . If Neo took the red pill, it would be \"the blood of the Messiah\" and Neo would be aware of the private things in the world (as opposed to this world) and would become a servant to help others learn the truth . The red pill, Neo was told by the members of Zion, was a locator progr am . The purpose of Neo swallowing the red pill was to be a transponder or beacon so that his physical body could be located in the store house of the Matrix. It was a machine in the Matrix that was responsible for extracting Neo from the Matrix. It wasn't Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, or any other human who got Neo out of the Matrix. Since it was a machine who extracted him, why would the Matrix extract him if it wasn't a policy of the Matrix to let anyone out that wanted to be let out? The answer is simple . The Matrix only survives because adhesion to the Matrix is volunta ry. Is it not possible to unvolunteer from the \"Matrix\" of this world by expatriating the physical membership? Will the governments of this world (the Matrix) not let one expatriate voluntarily if one does so in a proper manner? The answer is yes . Likewise, the red pill can be viewed as a form of expatriation reques t. It appears that Neo's separation from the Matrix in a physical fashion in the first movie was not a guarantee of the fact that Neo's future would not be influenced in some manner by the Matrix. And, in fact, in the Movie The Matrix 2, there is a significant interplay between the Matrix and Neo's lives and also with those of his friends in Zion . The second movie deals with the issues of the interaction between Zion and the Matrix . Neo has a discussion with the Oracle that enlightens us as to the reason why the people of Zion and the Matrix are linked together . The following conversation takes place between Neo and the Orac le. Interspersed in this conversation, I will add some comments in parenthesis . 0: Well . Come on. I'm not going to bite you . Come around here and let me have a look at you. My goodness . Look at you . You turned out all right, didn't you? How do you feel? You are not sleeping. We will get to that. Why don't you come and have a sit. [An invitation to sit is a form of a commercial process called a draf t. The Oracle was the drawer of the draft. As such, the drawer is the debtor. The drawee, in this case Neo, REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 33"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"is the creditor. If the drawee does not fulfill the draft request, a dishonor occurs and the drawee becomes the debtor. You do not want to be the debtor by dishonoring the draft.] N: Maybe I will stand. [A dishonor] 0: Suit yourself. [Acceptance of Neo's dishonor without going to war.] [Neo sits down voluntarily.] N: I felt like sitting. [Now Neo is in honor, so the conversation continues .] 0: I know. So, let's get the obvious stuff out of the way . N: You're not human. Are you? 0: It's tough to get any more obvious than that. N: If I had to guess, I would say you are a program from the machine world. So is he. [Referring to the Oracle's body guard.] 0: So far so good. N: But if that is true, it can mean that you are a part of the system. Another kind of control. 0: Keep going. N: I suppose the most obvious question is: How can I trust you? 0: Bingo! It is a riddle. No doubt about it. The bad news is there is no way that you can really know if I am here to help you or not. So it is really up to you! Just have to make up your own damn mind to either accept what I am going to tell you or reject it. [Isn't this the real issue with the people of Zion today in their relationship to the Matrix. The issue is: How can we trust the judge or the law enforcement officer, or the lawyer, or the prosecutor, etc., if they are in the public system? ] [The Oracle reaches into her purse to get some candy.] Candy? N: Do you already know if I am going to take it? 0: I wouldn't be much of an Oracle if I didn't. N: But if you already know, how can I make the choice? 0: Because you didn't come here to make the choice. You already made it. You're here to try to understand why you made the choice. I thought you would have figured that out by now. [Notice how the issue is going from \"what\" questions to \"why\" questions!] N: Why are you here? 0: Same reason. I love candy! [Joke] N: Why help us? 0: We're all here to do what we are all here to do. I'm interested in one thing Neo. The future. And believe me, I know the only way to get there is together. [There is a parable in the New Testament. It talks about a field (which is this world) where an enemy came one night and sowed weeds in the wheat filed. The wheat is the Zion people and the weeds are the people of the Matrix. The servants asked the master whether the servants should pull out the weeds when they started growing. The master told the servants to allow the weeds and the wheat to grow together because the wheat would be destroyed by the pulling up of the weeds. This is what Neo is being told here . The people of the Matrix and the people of Zion must exist side by side for a period of time, lest the warfare between both cause both parties annihilation.] N: Are there other programs like you?

This conversation was incredible . It is the first of three conversations that link the fact that the people of Zion, or those who would free themselves from the boundaries of the physical matrix, are not at liberty to: 1) Make war against the Matrix and its leaders or people, or 2) Operate independently from the leaders and people of the Matrix. In today's world, this is equivalent to saying: 1) Do not fight the world government system to destroy it. 2) Do not make war against the courts, the judges, the prosecutors, the law enforcement, and the United Nations or the Federal Reserve. That system (the Matrix) is linked to you and your survival. The second conversation was even more interesting . It involved a discussion between Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and the man called Merovingian. In the movie plot, in the attempt by Morpheus, Trinity, and Neo to \"bring down the Matrix\" by destroying the mainframe computer terminal, the location of that mainframe and the ability to get to it was why it was important to learn the location of the Key Maker.

[Morpheus understands honor and acceptance.] [The Elevator door opens on another floor as the trio is going down to reveal Persephone. She intercedes and promises to deliver what they want.] Twice now, Neo has been told by entities in the Matrix that the answer to the question WHY is the only important issue that he needs to deal with. The Oracle told him that the WHAT has already been decided in his life. The Oracle told him if he does not understand the why, he will not be able to \"see\" beyond the WHAT issue that he does not know the WHY about. Now Merovingian also tells them that without knowing WHY events occur, there is no hope to be in CONTROL. But being in CONTROL means that commercially you are a creditor. So not knowing WHY makes one a debtor in commercial affairs. As a debtor, one cannot be in control and cannot \"win\" (if that is what one is hoping to achieve in terms of a commercial or military (democracy) victory). Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity wrongly thought that the issue was \"choice.\" Doesn't Babylon tell us that we should be fighting for \"women's choice\" or rights? The Merovingian rightly told Neo that CHOICE is an act of a debtor in reacting to the possible consequences of being the debtor. It is an illusion. A person with a mortgage on his house has a choice. He can either pay his monthly mortgage payment to the bank or he can choose not to pay the monthly mortgage payment. He will also be subject to the duties or obligations that that choice he mak es saddles him with. The issue is never in achieving the ability to make a CHOICE in life. The issue is being in CONTROL of one's options as a creditor of the commercial agreements so that one's duties are established by one's own desire to voluntarily serve your fellow man instead of being a slave to your fellow man. Neo finally gets the information from the Key Maker so that he can reach the main frame computer to shut it down and save this world. When he arrives at the room outside the main frame shut off switch, he meets another character in the Matrix called the Architect. The third quotation from the second Movie follows between the Architect and Neo. It is the most revealing of all the discussions. A: Hello, Neo. N: Who are you? A: I am the Architect. I created the Matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions. And though the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo- some of my answers you will understand and some you will not. Accordingly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, it is also the most irrelevant. N: Why am I here? [Notice how Neo has learned to ask the important WHY questions now.] A: Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent in the programming of the Matrix.

[The Matrix, like any military de facto government predicated on some continuous warfare, needs to have a protagonist and an antagonist to survive. i.e., - there needs to be enemies in the Matrix syst em . And Neo was one of the \"enemies\" set up in the system, along with the other inhabitants of Zion, to structure the system to make it possible to have continuous warfare so the system works in its de facto capacity . His rebellion is a programming \"anomaly .\" In other words, it does not appear to be the norm established for the bulk of the system . But his rebellion is not outside the ultimate control of the Matrix master programming . Why this is necessary to the de facto structure of the current Matrix design, it seems to escape the master designer as to why a de jure system would not suffice . Notice, also, that the Architect uses sophisticated Greek style rhetoric to attempt to confuse Neo and intimidate him so that the Architect will not have to answer Neo's question .] N: You have not answered my question! A: Quite right. Interesti ng. That was quicker than the others . N: Others? How many? A: The Matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly [one rebellion in history] to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version . N: Two possible explan ations. Why has no one told me? Or no one knows? A: Precise ly. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic . Creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations .

The problem is choice. [Again Neo has not learned that CHOICE does not hold the answer .

Even if they were only aware of the choice at an unconscious level. [i.e.- an opportunity to presume they could elect or vote or choose in an action.] While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed [what about the 1 % of the subjects who did not receive the programming], thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo- Those that refused the program [apparent CONTROL], while a minority, if unchecked, would constitute an escalating probability of disaster [a rebellion that would destroy the ultimate control of the Matrix by the machines.]. N: This is about Zion! A: You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. [Zion is the people who have come out of the Matrix, but they have not left commerce. They still are not about service.

But rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it. And we have become exceedingly efficient at it. [Note: In the book of Daniel, there is a discussion about a dream that Nebuchadnezzar is having involving a Beast. The Beast represents empires established on earth. In one of the dreams, there were six worldly empires represented. Some that were, some that are, and some that will be. Since these empires are time dependent, they are commercial empires. The six empires represent: Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, the Medes and Persians, Greece, and Rome. Each new empire was established and overthrown in history in order to perfect commerce. Each succeeding empire became more efficient in its quest for commercial profits, earnings, taxation, and control. Slaves overthrew masters, not to serve their brothers, but to themselves become the new masters. It was all about getting more of the \"choices\" for themselves.

[Love is an emotion that, when properly invoked, results in serving mankind and not in commercial actions that are warlike and killing your brother such as Cain's actions in Genesis 4. So the Architect is noting that Neo's \"rebellion\" or \"protest\" is significantly oriented on a diff erent plane than the rebellion or protest of the previous six empires. This is an omen of things to come in possibly resolving the \"war\" in the third Matrix movie.] N: Trinity? A: Apropos. She entered the Matrix to save your life at the cost of her own. [Neo had gotten Trinity to promise not to enter the Matrix. It was too dangerous for her according to a dream where Neo had prophesied the possible death of Trinity, if she entered the Matrix. Trinity chose to enter the Matrix when she had knowledge that Neo's and Morpheus' lives were in danger.] N: No! A: Which brings me at last to the moment of truth where the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the anomaly revealed as both beginning and end.

Matrix- Revolution ends with the proposed Constitution of the United States of America in 1787. Matrix- the first movie, begins in present times. The story is a cycle of history repeated over and over again by a people who do not get it right. All communication is based upon symbolism. Every war is won by communication. If you are not enjoying the war (everyday life in a democracy), you are not understanding or getting the code and are not receiving the true message sent in everyday communications by code. There is a war going on out there. There has always been a war going on out there. The object of war is to restore honor to commercial dealings between foreign entities so there can be a lasting peace. But where there is no honor, there can be no peace. The Matrix In the Movie the Matrix 1, Neo learned that there was a secret war going on between the Machine world of the Matrix and a number of people who called themselves Zion who believed themselves to be separate and apart from the Machine world of the Matrix. The Matrix was a system that warehoused living beings in a coma like state. It harvested their thermal, chemical, and biological energy to supply power to run the Machine world. The living beings in the Matrix were fed neurological impulses to their brains that gave these beings the simulation of a normal life of a living man. By these computer generated memories, these living beings perceived themselves to exist in a life involving family, neighborhoods, nations, work environments, and personal relationships. At no time did the living beings in the \"coma like state\" have a clue that they were not leading a \"real\" life of choice. The people of Zion, however, believed that they had been disconnected from the Matrix. They dwelled in a city called Zion buried deep in the core of the earth to protect the inhabitants from the attacks of the Machine world of the Matrix. These people of Zion believed that they were free of the control of the Matrix, while understanding that they were at war with the machines from that world. There were a few people of Zion that sprung Neo from the control of the Matrix in the first movie. They believed that Neo might be a living being who would have extraordinary powers to bring freedom and peace to the people of Zion, and to those souls in the Matrix still trapped by the machines. REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 43"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Matrix Reloaded In the second movie the Matrix- Reloaded, Neo learns that the fate of the people of Zion is not independent of the persons in the Matrix or the Machine world that controls the Matrix. To the contrary, Neo learns that the controllers of the Matrix have dealt with previous rebellions by people who had separated themselves from the Matrix (like the people of Zion) and had attempted to defeat the Matrix. The current attempt by Neo and the people of Zion to defeat the machines from the Matrix is chronicled as the 6th rebellion against the Matrix. All previous rebellions had resulted in defeat and annihilation of the people outside the Matrix by the machines from the Matrix. After defeat, the Matrix restarts the outside world, or the so called enemies of the Matrix. The people of Zion are controlled by the controllers of the Matrix and allowed only so much latitude at freedom before they are reigned in. At the end of the second movie, the Machines of the Matrix are starting an attack on the people of Zion by burrowing with tunneling machines into the core of the earth to reach the city of Zion with the intent of destroying the people of Zion. The people of Zion are attempting to prepare defenses against the impending machine attack. Into this plot of warfare between the people of Zion and the machines of the Matrix is tossed a man named Neo. Some believe that Neo is a special soul that might possess the capacity to resolve the conflict between the Machine world and mankind by bringing peace. Those who held this belief were a select minority and included Morpheus (from the people of Zion) and an important computer program named the Oracle from the Machine world of the Matrix. In Matrix- Reloaded, two important entities from the Matrix, the Architect and the Oracle, had informed Neo that the people of Zion and the Matrix were a symbiotic society where one entity could not exist without the other at the present time. Their futures were indelibly intertwined with each other. They would either go into the future together or there would be no future. Symbolism in Communication All Hollywood movies are parables. They describe the current reality in this world and code it in terms of mythical persons, places, events, and things. In Scripture, the Messiah also taught about His kingdom- the World (in contradistinction to this World) in terms of parables. Once the Messiah was asked why He taught in parables. His response was so that the common man would not know what He was teaching. Only the elect would understand (or the special few). Hollywood movies are parables which teach the truth and reality in such a way that the common man will not understand the lessons and the information that is being given. By understanding the Scripture, or the Hollywood movies, you will understand what is going on in the law of this World, and will begin to understand your remedy to get free of the slavery and tyranny that you have entrapped yourself into. But in the Scripture, the Messiah went on to say that the elect will understand the meaning of the parables because, for them, they will understand the code and will understand the meaning of the communication and lesson being taught. I humbly beseech you, brethren, those of you who have eyes to see, ears to hear, and are members of the elect, to listen up. The story of the parable in the three Matrix movies is a plan of salvation and redemption from the ravages of the Matrix wars (or how to resolve your personal problems in this world). REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 44"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"In every parable it is first reasonable to understand who the characters represent. It is also necessary to understand how the characters actions have created a cause/effect relationship to the events of the story. As to relationships, the Matrix is this world (or an artificial world in contradistinction to the world which is real and a creation of nature and nature's God. The artificial world is de facto or colorable, while the real world is de jure or black and white). The Matrix is the system of \"Babylonian\" government, commerce, politics, and military that operates in the background and superimposes itself over the living people to control the energy given off by the living people, presumably for the personal benefit of the powers behind the \"Babylonian\" government. The system operates off the commercial energy of the living people who are harnessed by way of alter ego corporations, called Straw-men. These Straw-men are created by the Babylonian government upon the birth of each living soul and named after the living soul. The only distinction is that the living soul's name is spelled according to the proper English rules in upper and lower case letters. The Straw-men corporation names are spelled in all capital letters, like other artificial and dead things. All commercial enterprise by living souls are performed through their corporate entities, or Straw-men, as front-men. Since the government has the highest legal title to these Straw-men, all commercial activity is presumed to be controlled by Babylon and hence taxed to Babylon. It is by this mechanism that the \"Babylonian\" system draws out the commercial energy of every living soul. Therefore, the people tied up in the Matrix are representative of the Straw-men, who politically are known as Fourteenth Amendment persons - or fictions - created by government to replace living souls in the government political body. In a proper world, or the world, mankind or living people are in control. This fundamental law is based upon the laws of nature or the law of the land. In this world, the foundational basis for who is in control is the law of the sea or admiralty. It is a system constructed of \"trusts,\" instead of principals, who are acting in their own self interest. A nation in the world whose laws are based upon the law of the land can be ruled as a republic. A nation in this world whose laws are based upon the law of the sea is usually ruled as a democracy (demon-ocracy). The story in the Matrix trilogy deals with a system which progresses from a democracy to a repUblic. This is a mirror image to the history of the United States which has progressed from a republic in 1787 to a democracy in 2003 when this movie came out. A democracy is also a nation which is led by the military under emergency rules, behind a front of civilian rule, to confuse the populace as to the true nature of what is happening. In a democracy, the rights and needs of the individual must be subjugated to the needs and wants of the whole. There is no individual liberty, per se. The military, political, commercial system is operated under the admiralty/maritime rules of \"contribution\" and the presumption of joint tort-feasors. In the Matrix trilogy, the lives of the people are not paramount. They have been warehoused in facilities where liberty, freedom, and independent action are nonexistent for the average inhabitant who does not even understand that his life is an illusion; that he is programmed to feed the war machine. At the same time, the average inhabitant is mentally deluded into believing his whole life is one of a normal free and independent inhabitant of a modem society, exercising free will. This is done by instilling mental unawareness into the being or else controlled rebellion into others. In modem society, it is done chemically by drugs (or alcohol), or it is done commercially by withdrawing the desire or means of successful fulfillment (exporting productive jobs from the society), or it is done politically by providing controlled candidates which offer no change in the makeup of the system, or it is done psychologically by instilling cognitive dissonance into the population.

[Have you been deceived into feeding the war machin e?] Occasionally one inhabitant of the Matrix breaks free of his programming and sees a larger picture. These people are the ones who \"take the red pill\" and are presumably physically independent of the social programming of the Matrix. These people have collected together in a society called the People of Zion. Today, in the present world, we might call these people \"Patriots.\" Symbolism in the Matrix Trilogy It is not a coincidence that Zion is the name of a mountain in the Old Testament of Scripture representing the Children of Israel. The Children of Israel gathered to become a nation and receive their law from the Creator when the Children of Israel were led out of slavery in Egypt . So, the Matrix is a metaphor for \"Egyptian slavery.\" The People of Zion in the movie were a metaphor for ex-slaves led to their freedom by the Creator to create and start a Republic nation of their own. A republic is a form of government, based upon liberty and freedom, which requires knowledge and wisdom of the inhabitants to self-rule under concepts of honor and responsibility. This is in direct opp OSItI on to rule by the dictates of a commercial/military/industrial complex, based upon policies and police regulations, which assume inhabitants are incapable of treating one another with honor and respect without supervision and discipline. It is also not a coincidence that the symbols used in the Matrix parable are mirror images, or backwards to reality in meaning and time. The People of Zion, who are supposed to be alive and free, are buried deep in the ground in the City of Zion as though they were dead corpses. The \"dead\" people living in the Matrix in a condition of a coma are warehoused on the surface of the planet as though they were alive and mobile. The surface of the planet is smoky, dreary. The sun never shines, but appears dead. The City of Zion is alive with activity but lit by artificial light. The people in the Matrix are programmed to be happy and without a care in the world, but they have no independent thought or ability to effect change on their commercial/political system. The People of Zion are always apprehensive about the war and struggling to survi ve. They have the capacity to effect change and also must exercise discretion and elect responsibility. In today's world, the people of the Matrix are the 99.99% of the people who live with their heads in the sand and have no clue as to what is going on. They are programmed by the \"talking heads,\" the boob tube, and other public sources of information (including the public fool system). They can carry on an allegedly articulate conversation about persons, places, and events while never knowing or explaining any cause/effect relationships that exists in the world or this world. In the words of the Merovingian from Matrix- Reloaded, \"They do not understand the why.\" Therefore, they are slaves. The People of Zion in today's world are, for the most part, the patriots, rebels, and yes - in some cases - terrorists. Or, at least they may shortly be prosecuted politically for being terrorists . These people are outside the Matrix (so to speak even though the Matrix still exercises control over them). These patriots are mostly at war with the Matrix and falsely believe that their involvement in this war will bring about change that will correct the problems with the Matrix and the Matrix's relationship with them.

Those who do not notice that a democracy is in fact a controlled war zone of combatants, are all the more deceived by this world. Looks can be deceiving to those who do not see or do not hear. We learned in Matrix- Reloaded that the Matrix is not out to completely destroy the People of Zion. In fact, the Matrix is charged with restarting the People of Zion every time Zion is destroyed. Think of this program as a social urban renewal program where an \"old,\" socially archaic \"People of Zion\" must be upgraded to a new, more commercially competitive \"People of Zion.\" After all, the Matrix sees the People of Zion as a manufactured enemy to the Matrix, used to instill commercial competition into the Matrix to maximize the commercial benefits to the Matrix. So every now and then, the Matrix exterminates the old society of \"independents\" (who think they are free) and restarts the new urban renewal society with better stock and blood to give the appearance of a better enemy which instills more competition into the Matrix world. This world is just like the Matrix model. It is just like the United States of America which cannot continue as a \"democracy\" without having some permanent \"enemy\" at which the democracy is always at war. The Matrix is a symbiotic society. The Matrix cannot survive without an alter ego in the People of Zion. Likewise, the People of Zion have never had the ability to destroy the Matrix. Scripture states this same theme that the People of Zion and the Matrix are joined together in a short-term, common future. Scripture says that for a time the wheat and the tares must grow together in the field and not be separated. To pull up the tares (the Machine world of the Matrix) would cause death to many \"wheat\" people (People of Zion and the sleeping people in the Matrix). So they should exist together. The only two reasons that the Matrix has to destroy the People of Zion is: to prevent the People of Zion from getting too strong so that they would physically threaten to overthrow the control exerted on them by the Matrix; and 2) the Matrix restarts the society with better genetic stock from time to time to create better competition with the Matrix to help maximize or perfect commerce. The six restarted systems of Zion could well refer to the servants under the international world governments represented by: 1) the Egyptians, 2) the Syrians, 3) the Babylonians, 4) the Medusa and Persians, 5) the Greeks, and 6) the Romans (of which our current system of one world government is merely an extension of the Roman world government- i.e. Roman civil law, Roman calendar, and Roman universal church). [Nothing new under the sun!] The Remedy Lies Outside of Zion or the Matrix It is a fact. There were good entities existing as programs in the Matrix and there were evil entities existing as programs in the Matrix. There were also good, living souls amongst the People of Zion and there were very bad, living souls amongst the People of Zion. A condition of being \"good\" did not necessarily provide any remedy to mankind from the war which existed between the Matrix and the People of Zion. There was no remedy in fighting a continuous war. One's remedy is always in the peace that ensues after the war. Getting to this peace and making the condition of peace productive by one's actions is the issue. [Go to peace rather than going to war!] There are four types of living souls . 1) Ostriches with their heads in the sand (or their bodies in the Matrix) not knowing what is going on or why it is happening.

(How about the \"Family Planners\" in modem society, as an example, who use abortion to spread \"life?\") The People of Zion in the Matrix trilogy are firmly in this group two. They believe that the only solution to the perceived problem that the Matrix is screwed up and doing everything backwards for the benefit of living souls is war to the death of everyone in the Matrix. Group two's classic remedy is to destroy their enemies- the ones who are doing this are thinking backwards. Group two believes that when they defeat everyone else who is wrong, then things will work well for the people in group two. \"When the whole world changes to my way, then things will be better and I can be happy.\" This is their motto. But is it realistic that the whole world will change- or must change- in order for one to become \"happy?\" The third type of people are those who realize that one's happiness and well being is not derived from changing the whole world to one's way of thinking. Happiness is derived by changing your way of thinking so that it creates a better world for you to live in. This is realistic. You can change yourself. You cannot change anyone else who does not see the light and want to change themselves. There were a few characters in the Matrix movie series that could be classified as group 3 thinkers.

[Do you believe in a remedy other than war? ] Resolving a War in Matrix Revolution It is not rational to structure your society on habitual warfare. But this is exactly what a \"democracy\" is. The ultimate cause/effect riddle or question that one can pose is: \"How do you bring a society that is at constant warfare to peace?\" The ultimate underlying cause is commercial debt. Commercial debt causes all war. To end war , one must either make arrangements to end the debt liability of the debtor side of the war by discharge, forgiveness, or as an operation of law. Or else, the creditor must be offered some concession which would end the war by offering something that is more desirable than the collection of the debt. In the story of Matrix- Revolu tion, the age-old war between the Matrix and the People of Zion is ended by one of these causes. The cause of the war that plagued the People of Zion and the Matrix is not set forth in the story of any of the trilogy movies. The cause of the war was studied in an extra set of stories set forth artistically in the DVD The Animatrix. The Animatrix tells nine short stories dealing with collateral issues involving the Matrix and the People of Zion. In the story- The Second Renaissance Part 2, the events which led up to the war between the People and the Machines are told. The war started when machines wanted representation in government. The machines felt that they contributed to commerce and needed representation. Most of the people believed that the machines should not have political representation. People started to rebel against machines by destroying them. The machines defended themselves and attacked the people for self protection. As the machines got the upper hand, they subdued the people and placed them into servitude. The cause of the war was the dishonor of the people in not \"accepting\" the machines' draft request to have representation in commercial government. The non-acceptance REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 48"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"by the people made the people the commercial debtors to the machines who became the commercial creditors. In commerce, a debtor cannot win. A creditor cannot loose. In today's world, the Patriots are upset at the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. This Amendment changed the representation of the \"citizenry\" of the political and commercial government. Under the 14th Amendment, \"artificial things\" are now citizens of the government instead of real people. An \"artificial thing\" (a machine- if you will) could well be defined to be a \"machine\" or an entity that performs without civil or commercial life. The 14th Amendment person is a perfect definition of a machine. So when the Patriots fight the 14th Amendment and its definition of an artificial entity as a citizen, the patriots are dishonoring the One World Government's draft request for commercial representation for fictions. This makes the One World Government (or the Matrix) the creditor and the Patriot the commercial debtor by dishonor. This creates a commercial warfare, which is exactly what we have in today's society. This is why the people who act as persons are described as the commercial enemies in the Trading with the Enemy Act that was passed in the First World War as a protection from enemies, and updated in 1933 under the new Deal when the United States government had to call upon the States to help defray the debt and the \"persons- citizens of the United States\" became the enemies of the UNITED STATES government by decree of President Roosevelt. If one followed the character of Neo in the Matrix trilogy, Neo evolves from group 1 to group 2, and finally to group 3. Neo starts out as an ostrich with his head in the sand. In the first movie he is awakened by Morpheus and becomes a Patriot rebel in group 2. In the second movie, Neo learns that it might not be possible to obtain a military victory over the Matrix. By the time Neo is seen in the third Matrix movie, he is convinced that he must change his perspective in order to provide a remedy to go to peace. He is now in group 3. [Are you? Will you want to go to peace?] Notice Neo's character in Matrix-Reloaded. He does not get involved in fighting an offensive war against the Matrix. In fact, the only time Neo uses force at all is to defend himself against physical attack by Agent Smith or from characters in the Matrix which attack him. He protects his life and the lives of others without going on the offensive. The public critics of the Matrix trilogy complain that Neo's character shows little or no emotion. Why should his character? Neo is seeking knowledge and wisdom as to cause and effect of relationships. In the immortal words of the Merovingian, Neo truly wants to understand the \"WHY.\" Neo wants to serve the People of Zion and Trinity, whom he loves. Neo is not seeking self-gratification by fulfilling emotional needs. Nor does Neo act as a direct and proximate result of purely emotional pressure. In Matrix-Reloaded, we learn that both Neo and Agent Smith have been decoupled from the control of the Matrix. Agent Smith is no longer a program executing within the mainframe of the Matrix. Both Agent Smith and Neo are gaining personal energy and ability now that they are not feeding energy to the Matrix. There is a vast difference in the characters of these two entities. Neo has learned love and service above self. Neo does not work for consideration from the other party. Agent Smith is a \"Satan\" to Neo. A \"Satan\" is defined as an adversary or one who opposes you. Agent Smith is applying all his energy toward destroying Neo and all that is good. Since they are both decoupled from the Matrix, they both possess free will to lead their lives as they choose, unbridled by the constraints of the Matrix controllers and its social programming. Neo seeks life. Agent Smith seeks death. [Peace and War] In Matrix-Revo lution, the People of Zion are fighting a war against the superior force of the machines. In this war, the People of Zion can only hope to survive, but by all odds they will REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 49"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"lose. The Zion military comma nd puts their faith in implements of war and their manpower to use them. No military strategy is based upon using outside plans or programs to stop the war. Only a few living souls within the People of Zion have any outside faith in the belief that Morpheus has; that the road to peace is somehow dependent upon Neo and what he might be able to accompl ish in some way outside the scope of the military. Symbolism in the City of Zion The ultimate stronghold of the People of Zion was their city, deep in the earth. It had an outer receiving dock, an inner city, and finally, a temple where the People of Zion worshipped. The military plan was to first protect the dock. If it was breached, they would fight in the city. If the city was lost, the last defense would be the temple. The approach to the temple was a narrow passage where the machines could not overpower the people with their might because of the close confines of the passage. Isn't it just like these People of Zion to get it backwar ds. Instead of using the \"temple\" as their last defense against their enemy, should they not have relied upon their Creator and their spiritual temple as a first defen se to help defend them? Should not the temple have been the origin of their first efforts instead of their last? Also, if the People of Zion believed that the temple was a physica l place where their Creator would gather with them, they were wrong. The true temple is a place within us where the Creator dwell s in our hearts. Without the understanding that the Creator dwell s in you, they were seeking an ultimate place of refuge external to their being, which is only a de facto fiction. Neo realized that the way to peace was not to run away from or fight with one's \"enemy,\" but to go to one's \"enemy\" and make of him a friend by writing a peace treaty that will end the war and give each party a new beginni ng. In a world at war, one does not create peace by fighting one's enemy, but by negotiating a peace treaty in which both parties receive just consid eration and an overwhelming logical reason to offer concessi ons that will end the war. After all, isn't the purpose of all warfare to end disho nor, adjust the wro ngs, and bring back a condition of peace? Isn't that what the movie - Saving Private Ryan was all about? It was about Ryan being sent home to the 'private' world of civilia n peace and prosperity. Not the military man 'Private Ryan ' continuing into an ongoing war which would bring death and not life. In the case of Matrix- Revo lution , Neo and Agent Smith are alter egos. Neo and Agent Smith are the same coin- two different sides. Agent Smith is the bad \"Adam.\" Neo is the good \"Adam.\" In the language of Paul in the New Testament: Neo is the spiritual man. Agent Smith is the fleshly man. Scripture says that to live, the spiritual man must kill the fleshly man. If you do not give up your life, you cannot save your life. Post Matrix- Reloaded, Agent Smith and Neo have become joined in their DNA and become alter egos of the same entity. The Oracle, in one of her discussion with Neo in Matrix- Revolution, has alluded to this. She tells Neo that both personas cannot continue to exist . Agent Smith has become a problem for the People of Zion . He is as formidable an enemy as the Machines. Worse yet, Agent Smith is a threat to the Matrix since he is gaining power and is no longer controlled by the Matrix. Although Neo only exists for love and service, Agent Smith would destroy Neo, Trinity, the People of Zion, and then would tum to the Matrix. His hatred knew no bounds. Notice that the Matrix had control over the People of Zion, notwit hstanding the fact that the People of Zion were not physically in the Matrix. The Matrix computers could track all the People of Zion. It was only Neo and Agent Smith that became invisible to the Matrix computer. REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 50"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Even the monitors on the vessels belonging to the People of Zion that could tap into the Matrix computers could not pickup and locate Neo or Agent Smith any more , even when Neo was aboard the vessel. Neo's dedication to, and desire to ser ve, the People convince d him that he had an opportunity to bring about a negotiated peace treaty with the Matr ix. Agent Smith was converting programs from the Matrix into Smith clones. Agent Smith was even converting some of the People of Zion into Smith clones. Smith was creating a replicant army (a private independent army) from both the Matrix and the People of Zion that were not loyal to anyone except Agent Smith. If Smith was not stopped soon, his private army might take over this world. Neo realized that he could not defeat Agent Smith in a one-on-one battle. They both posses sed equal levels of powe r and energ y. Howev er, Neo devised a strategy guaranteed to defeat Agent Smith based upon Agent Smith's ego and hatred. Neo went to his enemy- the Machine City in the Matrix to negotiate a peace treaty between the People of Zion and the Matr ix. Neo did not have the approval of the People of Zion , nor its governing counsel, to carry out the peace mission. Neo was not invited by the Machines to come to a peace treaty negotia tion. What Neo did have was honor, logic, and consideration that could not be ref used by either the Machines or the People of Zion . Neo did not ask the Machine world to give up anything. Neo took on all liability and responsi bility in the plan to end the war by settling and closing the matter between the Machines and the People of Zion. There was no risk to the Machi nes, only the potential for gain. In any peace treaty, consideration must be offered as a means of persuasion to both parties to adopt concessions necessary for peace. The People of Zion were being physically defeated. No concessi on was offered to them except their own lives by ending the conflict. The Machine world, or the world of commerc e, had a problem offering persuasive consid eration that could not be refused. Neither Neo nor Agent Smith was under the control of Zion . In today's world, this would be equivalent to a \"patriot\" who would learn how to be \"outside the system\" and not be under the legal control of the One World Government . Knowledge to achieve this goal could be conceive d to be a direct threat to the One World Government 's system of universa l control if the one who possessed this knowledge did not possess the character trait of honor. What if a person outside the control of gove rnment was a terrori st bent on destruction, such as Agent Smith? Would an all powerful \"Agent Smith\" outside the control of government worry the system? You bet! [What if such 'men ' were not terrori sts or at war - would there be need to worry? NO!] Neo proposed to the Machine world that if Neo would neutralize Agent Smith so that Agent Smith could pose no threat to the Matrix, would the Matrix in return stop the war against the People of Zion and allow the People of Zion to exist in harmony with the Matr ix? It was further proposed that those within the Matrix who wanted to leave and join the People of Zion, be allowed to exit the Matrix peacef ully. Isn't the proposed peace treaty between the People of Zion and the Matrix an embellishment of the (seco nd) 13th Article in Amendment to the Constitution of the United States? There shall be no involuntary servitude ! Aren 't the people lodged in the Matrix the artificial 14th Amendment persons who are not living souls? If the people want to come out of the Matrix so that they do not have to serve as slaves, will they not gain the capacity of living people again? Can you see how the Matrix movie trilogy is a restatement of the history of the United States? Wasn 't the peace treaty with England in the 1780's (after the Revolutionary War) a grant of ability of living souls to emerge from the \"Matrix\" government style system England had superimposed on the living souls of the colonie s?

Neo was incapable of physic ally defeating Agent Smith in a battle. You and Your Enemy An enemy is an alter ego. When one fights a fiction (or alter ego), it makes the fiction stronger. The way to defeat a fiction is to stop warring against it. Become one with your enemy or the fiction . Let your enemy possess you and take you over. Since he is a fiction, he cannot defeat you when you do not give him energy by fighting him. The Oracle tells Neo that Agent Smith is Neo. He is Neo's opposite. The Oracle tells Neo that within 24 hours , in one way or another, the problems would be resolved. Neo is to Agent Smith as the People of Zion were to the Matrix Machin es. Neo seeks life. Agent Smith seeks death. The People of Zion are living. The Machines are dead. If Neo resolves the conflict with Agent Smith, peace will prevail and the Machine world will end their conflict with the People of Zion . If on the other hand, Agent Smith prevails against Neo, the People of Zion will be exterminated by their alter ego- the dead Machine s. The choice every living soul has in this world is: Do you choose to side with that which gives life or do you choose death? Man Wrestles Not With Himself, But With God Who Is In Us In Scripture, the most famous Old Testament fight was the battle between Jacob and his adversary at Peniel . Jacob wrestled with him all night. Jacob was physically defeated. It was only when Jacob stopped wrestling with his adversary that he realized that he could win. In fact, Jacob learned that he was wrestling with the Creator who appeared to Jacob as Jacob's enem y. When Jacob stopped wrestling, the Creator praised him and renamed him Israel. This name means \"God rules.\" The Creator always tests us by bringing us an enemy to see if we will allow our enemy to give us a remedy by being at peace with him or whether we will war aga inst our enemy and be denied our remedy. One's enemies are always sent to you by the Creator as a test. The name \"ISRAEL\" is not a name that belongs to a nation or to a race or a religion. It is a name of honor that is bestowed upon those who learn the lesson of serving and remaining at peace with those who might appear to be your enemy. Neo's remedy to neutralize Agent Smith's possible threat against the Matrix, the People of Zion and the Machine world, was to allow the Machine world to plug Neo back into the Matr ix. By this act, the Machine world and the Matrix would again have control over Neo. Neo devised a very simple strategy to defeat Agent Smith. He would fight Agent Smith as though Neo was trying to win. Then Neo would allow Agent Smith to defeat Neo and possess his body. When they would become one with each other in Agent Smith's victory, the Machine world would shut down the \"Neo\" program running in the Matr ix. This would also shut down Agent Smith whose DNA, being joined with Neo's, would perish. Remember, die in the Matrix and you die in the real world. Think of the metaphor that Hollywood is describing here. Neo is a form of the Mes siah. He came into th is (not th e) world (the Matrix) free and independent of the const raints and control of th is world (the Matr ix). However, the Messiah, as did Neo, allowed Himself to be placed under the control of th is world (as a man of flesh instead of a man of spirit) . As a man of flesh, the Messia h died in the flesh. Neo was deleted as a program in the Matrix while voluntarily REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 52"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"subjecting himself to the world of the Matr ix. In the real world, the Messia h destroyed the man of sin or the man of the flesh that is at war with the man of the true spirit. As such, the Mess iah conquered death. Remember, to live, one must first die and be reborn in the spirit. In the movie, Neo placed himself in the flesh (back into the Matrix)- or he became united as one with his adversary (a \"Satan\" is an adversary) Agent Smith . Agent Smith was indeed a Satan in that he was interested in being the king over the dead instead of the king over the living. [Public government today is a kingship over the dead just like the Matrix was a system of political rule over the civilly dead.] Neo defeated Agent Smith by \"acceptance\" of Agen t's Smith war against Neo to defeat him. It was in this act of allowing Neo's enemy to defeat him that allowed Neo to win by not resisting. Likewi se, neither Neo nor the Messia h died to save themselve s. They allowed the enemy, death, to take them so that they would be set free as well as securing the freedom of their brothers from the adversary. Also, neither in the movie nor in real life did the People of Zion ask Neo or the Messia h to carry out their acts of redemption in their behalf. The acts of Neo and the Messia h were both free acts of love and totally noncom mercial. In Scripture it is said that by one man (the first Adam) sin entered into the world and death by sin. In a mirror image to this, Paul, in the New Testament, said that by one man (the Messia h or the second Adam) the remedy to obtain redemption and salvation from sin also entered into the world. In the first Matrix movie, Neo first met the agents of the People of Zion at a place called the Adam Street Bridge. This bridge was a link from the first Adam to the second Adam . There is a double witne ss to the redemption by Neo of the People of Zion and the Matrix . When Neo is possessed by Agent Smith and they are being \"de-rezzed\" by the Matrix, Neo makes a statement. He says : \"It is done !\" One gets the second witne ss by the Machine world when the head Machine states: \"It is done .\" Is this anything like the words that came from the cross in John 19:30, \"It is finished ?\" You see, a milita ry society is also an ecclesi astica l society. In order to stop the democracy and tum it back into a republic, it takes a sacrifice or a redempti on. [Is there any wonder why th is world is not too happy with those people who speak of the process of Redemption today?] The End is a Grand Beginning In the closing scene of Matrix- Revoluti on, we have four entities in the scene. The number 4 represents the things of the world. There is one animal, two persons from the Matr ix, and one living soul. The scene opens by looking out on a city street on the surface of the planet. A young girl wakes up from a sleep on the sidewalk as though she were a \"bag\" person or homele ss individual . A cat walks the street toward her. As the cat moves toward her, there is a ripple vertically that moves through the visual scene. The ripple starts in the location of the cat and moves, line by line, rapidly from left screen to right screen. As the visua l scene ripples, the green hue of the old world takes on the true colors of a real world. It is a sign that the old world controlled by the Matrix and the machines has transitioned into a real world where the surface of the planet again belongs to the living. The sky is blue again instead of darkened with smoke and pollut ion. The sun is rising in the east. The scene shifts to a park in the city where the Oracle is seated on a park bench with the figure of the Architect of the Matrix walking toward her. The cat repre sents nature. By the ripple starting through the cat, the cat has just been reborn into one of its \"nine\" lives. In other words, the cycle starts over again . The girl is the last exile from the old Matr ix. She represents the true church (or overcomer, or the first fruits of the harvest) who has been redeemed by the acts of the Messia h (Neo) into a new life.

The Architect of the Matrix repre sents the executive character of the Matrix which carries out the plan of the Matrix. He is reactive and not proactive. The final scene of Matrix- Revolution is not an ending. It is a beginning. It presents an opportunity. The Architect makes a snide remark to the Oracle about whether she is happy that she got her way in helping Neo bring about a peace between the Matrix and the People of Zion. The Oracle replies that she is happy. The Architect then asks if she was not afraid of the consequenc es of her actions. She replies that all acts taken to secure honor face great risks. The Architect then asks the Oracle how long she believes that the peace will last. She replies, \"As long as they can keep the peace.\" I am reminded about this nation in 1787. When the founding fathers came out of the Const itutional Convention after propo sing the Constitution of the United States as a foundational document of government, a woma n asked them : \"What kind of government have you given us?\" The response was: \"A republic, if you can keep it!\" The Const itutional Convention was not an end. It was a beginn ing. A republic is built on a noncommercial foundation where the people remain in honor and pay their debts at law. A democracy is when the people are in dishonor and the debts cannot be paid. A democrac y is a milita ry gove rnment constantly at war. [Like the civil war, the war in Viet Nam, the war on poverty, the war on drugs, the Desert Storm, the Bosnian war, the war on terrori sts, the Iraq War, etc. Wars that never end. When the People of Zion came out of the Matrix after Neo's redempti on, the question was: \"How long could the world remain at peace?\" The question might as well have been : \"How long can the People of Zion live in a newly created republic that was provided for them ?\" The answer was, as long as they could keep it. Do they understand what was provided for them? Do they understand that if they break the peace and go back to war that their republic will be destroyed? Do they understand that if they do not pay their debts, they cannot live in a Repu blic? Probably not. It didn't take the American colonies very long to destroy their republic and be placed under a democrac y- or the rule of the Matrix. The trilogy of the Matrix is basica lly a history of the United States of America told backwar ds. The people of the United States were redeemed in 1787. They were given a repub lic, if they could keep it. Today they are ensla ved in a democracy without commercial liberties. The end of the Matrix trilogy existed in 1787. The beginning of the Matrix trilogy exists today. The story is told backwards. To unwind the destruction of the acts of the people requires a redemption from the acts that got them here. The end is in sorts a beginning. For all of hist ory repeats itself and man is usually destined to repeat the mistakes of history over and over again. If you were one of the critics that sugge sted that the specia l effects in the movie and the action was superb, but the stupid and mindle ss verbal gymn astics of the philos ophical discussions between the leading characters was nonsense and unint elligible, then please take the blue pill and go back to sleep. You are just getting in the way of reality and you are preventing the solution. On the other hand, if you believe that the resolution of the problem came as a result of military victory, and not as a result of noncommercial ser vice by one who loved his brother, then you probably believe that the title for the third movie- Revolut ion, deals with war and prote st, instead of dea ling with a revolving (revolution) or a turning over of your mental concept to go to peace as a means of acceptance and working with the enemy to end the war, instead of working against or rebelling against the enemy and continuing the war.

Your enemy is the other side of you, your alter ego, your man of flesh who consumes and does not serve. Zion should be the private side, or the man of good. The man of flesh is the public side. You do not kill the man of flesh by warring against him. The man of flesh dies when the man of the spirit takes over by service. See the pattern set forth in Gene sis 32. Some misce llaneou s notes on The Matr ix: The Merovingian is the equivalent of the Secretary of State in today 's governmental society. He has all authority over foreigners who interface with this world. Neo did not seek a fight with anyone in the Matr ix, especia lly the Merovingia n. Neo had peace with the Matrix (Babylon ). Neo had adversaries in his own camp of the People of Zion and in Agent Smith. Neo served for love, not for remuneration. Smith (the name), means a commercial tradesman who sells himself for money in a profession. Neo redeemed the People of Zion: Not with money to buy their liberty. Out of love, service, and duty. Not even at the request of the People of Zion (No one asked him to do it). Smith's purpose was to kill everything living . He was the king over a realm of death. Smith would first kill all the people in the City of Zion . Then Smith would kill all the people lodged in the cocoons in the Matr ix. This would destroy the Machine world, which could not exist without the people 's energy. Morpheus sensed the tum in the tide of the battle with the Machines in the City of Zion before the war was officially over. He physically threw down his weapons and emerged from his protective surrou ndings when he saw the Sentinels hesit ate in their attack. He sensed that Neo had brought about the peace that had been hoped for. The Trainman was the commercial transportation link between this world and the world. The Trainman was controlled by the Merovingian - the Secretary of State - that approved all foreign commerce (or the movement of property and persons from the realm of the Matrix to the world of the People of Zion). The Train Station was des cribed as nowher e. It was between two worlds. Neo travels to the Machine City to confront the Machine leaders for a remedy in a vesse l called the Logo s- or the Word.

OBEDI ENCE TO GOD ACTS 5: 34-39 -Then stood there up one in the council, a Phari see named Gama liel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; and he said unto them, \"Ye men of Israel, take heed what ye intend to do as touching these men. For before these days rose up Theudas, boast ing himself to be some body ; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themse lves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to naught. After thi s man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.

COMMON LAW vs. PRIVA TE LAW To understand common law in its usage and applicat ions, we first need to realize that it is law by execution, or the law that was called the Mosa ic Law, that has evolved into the Roman Civil Law. The Roman Civil law is the base for our present statute law that exists today. Therefore: the common law is the statute law by execut ion (needs a public agreement) that is in common/public use today, that carries a public liability (a tax collect ion) for its usage. In our nation, we have both common stock/employ ees and preferred stock/inalienable rights. In order for the government to regulate its common stock (cons umers ), it has taken an assumed tax exemption/priority of the individual s, which are using the industrial goods and services of the nation. By partaking of the industrial products there is a tax that must be collected in order to kee p record and track of all the industrial ener gy usage, and all common stock/ public fu nds have a public liabi lity, as these funds re pr esen t the ener gy (money is the evidence of trans fe r of ener gy) that must be regulated. We volunteer to pay the taxes just by our use of industrial goods and ser vices , which is why it is a volunt ary tax system. If you do not use any of the industrial goods, then there are no taxes. In order to use the industrial goods and ser vices wi thout the re quir ement of taxes, we must accept the charges and direct them back to the gov ernm ent , all 10 0%, and thereby we lend our tax exemption/priority to the go vernment to disc har ge the public liabil ity. Th is exchange gives us an employer status, or inalienable rights (the preferred stock), which then al lows us to enjoy all the goods and ser vices at our will. The common law evolves from the Old Testament and our Private lawlinalienable rights come from the New Testament, as the New Testament is the fulfillment of the law, by operation. All public law is execution of law (or Old Testament) and the New Testament is international law, but an individual can only fulfill it voluntarily, by operation. The operation of law can only operate when no malice or vindictive harm is intended and is based upon the CONS CIENCE of those charged to uphold it. It is purely spiritual !! To sum it up, then, with common law rights (Const itutional rights), we are considered by the IRS to be employees of the Federal Zone or non-r esident alien s. With our un-alie n-able rights, we volunteered into the Federal Zone with our priority exchange for the tax exemption and therefore we are now the employer ! Therefore, common law is unto death and it cannot give eternal life, as it operates only by execution (death) to transfer the energy through the principal.

As computers go, the human brain is without parallel or parity, when compared to even the most sophistica ted man-made computer. Nevert heless, it is a computer and like all computers, it can be programmed. There is a theory known as the Theory of Co gnitive Disso nance (TDC) which holds that the mind involuntarily rejects information not in line with previous thoughts and/or actions. V. Leon Festinger may have been the first person to document the Law of Cognitive Dissonance, but he was certainly not the first to observe it. Since the most ancient time s, mind­ controllers have been enticing free people into servitude (piping them on board, so to speak) by taking advantage of man's tendenc y to generate cognitive di ssonance. In his book, A THEORY OF COGNI TIVE DISSONANCE, (Stanford University Press, 1957), Festinger says that new events or new information create an unpleas antness, a dissonance with existing knowledge, opinion, or cognition concerning behavior. When this happen s, pressures naturally arise within the person to reduce the dissonance. Not reconc iling the new information with the old, but reducing the dissonance. V. L. Festinger further stated that the strength of the pressures to reduce the dissonance is a function of the magnitude of the dissonance. Dissonance acts in the same way as a state of drive, need or tension. The greater the dis sonance, the greater will be the intensity of the action to reduce the dissonance and the greater the avoidance of situat ions that would increase the dissonance. A person can deal with the pressure generated by the dissonance by changing the old behavior to harmonize with information. But if the person is too committed to the old behavior and way of thinking, he simply rejects the new information. A simple \"I don't believe it\" thought or word is the easy cop out. For if you are unawa re, you are unaware of being unaware.

It no longer had the debt free industrial bonds (man/men) to operate for all of societ y's benefit. Then the indust rial bonds were , or are now based upon, debt funds or municipal bonds and therefore they are consum ing all the energy (funds) needed to keep our socie ty operat ing. In Genesis 6, which is about the energy that was taken from the public government, it was to hold-it and use it to run the industrial society. The flood of public funds has again covered the earth and it is time to 'CHARGE BACK' the debt (energy) money by use of the public policy H1R- 192. The Ark is the private government treasury (Federal Reserve) that will act as the mediator to Re­ public the public debt funds, by private assignment or accepta nce. Thereby once again the public government will hold the energy (money) for the indust rial uses. After the true energy was perverted, the perverted funds were only for personal gain of a select few and were immoral funds. Therefore, they cannot heal, but only destroy whoever took part of their use. Men - Industrial Bonds (privately held and assigned to the Public Governme nt's or Republ ic's use).

When the individual is held in prison, the charges are used by the public for public needs and public expansion, but the individual who holds the charge is held on account, with no personal use. Once a Corporation manufactures a product that is consumed by the public (i.e., public goods and servi ces) that it has paid for, the public debt must be discharged via HJR- 192, and an equal exchange must take place. The individual must hold charg es from an offense before he/she can exchange this for public goods and services. Without the charges from an offense, an individual must (or can only) exchange public debt (unredeemed public funds) for public debt, which is against the Public Policy HJR- 192. The individual , then, can someday be held accountable for this offense, which will give himlher the charges required to discha rge the public obligation within a limited scope, but only for the benefit of the public Corporations need to take care of their inventory/stock (peop le). This accountability can come in the form of either illness or legal redress. This occurs when a Corporation either allows a person to hold and consume the public liability, which prevents it from passing through to the Government (which causes the Passover), or by holding the charges/energy back for the use and consumption of the Industrial complex. We can be the holder- in-due-course, which means: someone (Gove rnment) is holding the charges/energy for our benefit. In fact, this is what HJR- 192 is all about ! We are to pass our debt to the Government, instead of to another individ ual. When an individual does experience either medica l or legal problem s, the modern practices of either these professions , with their latest VOODOO and Chromium-plated theology practic es, can only treat the symptom and not the root cause. If they were to treat the root cause, they would either bury or imprison their client. Because of their limited license, they are not allowed to attend to this primal concern, lest they obtain a charge that must be addre ssed and create a repetitive cycle that can never end. This is one reason why there is no remedy in the public system, though we need it, as it is the one that must regulate the commercial transactions between individu als (men) and Governme nts. GENER AL INFORMATION Attorneys are \"limited ,\" that is to say, they must stay within their industrial license because they cannot make commercial claims, as commercial claims are commerci al/retail amounts covered by the truth-in-I ending requirements that hold persons personally responsi ble. The admi nistrative license of an attorney in Bar has no accountability, is thereby limited, and has no authority to convey title to anything. The only way that an Attorney can enter the commercial zone is by the assumed tax exemption of some individual or if hired by some individual (man) . Your UCC Contract Trust (Treasury) Account is the insurance for the full retail amount, because it is the \"principal\" and the \"source.\" A sufficient amount is your acceptance of whatever the \"Bill\" happens to be, since whoever tells you how much the Bill is becomes the witne ss to the fact (the forbearer), who carries the burden of testimony by licens e.

THE MONETARY SYSTEM Allot is being requested of the young individu als that are coming from our primary education system. They (children) are being taught that they should go on to obtain a college educati on. Public education is just what is says; you are educated for use in the public system and thereby you become accountable for the public liability (debt) that the public money carries. It is sold with the idea that with better public educat ion, individuals will be better able to lead profitable lives by giving them the tools that they need to make greater amounts of money. In tum, they will be able to obtain the commercial products required to create a more comfortable life. First, we must take a look at how public money affects, or what it does, to an individ ual. Money is the evidence of the transfer of energy in commerc e, after the fact. So, the commercial cause for the transf er has taken place before the actual event has happ ened. In other words, the public offer was made first, then the actual acceptance or need was exchang ed. Because of this being the case, the individual who made the public offering thereby carried the public energy (negative) within them selves (speculation upon and acceptance) which may cause other problems that can be medical, legal or personal in nature. This suggests that the more available the public funds are for our use, the more likely we are to have other problems in our lives. We must remember that the true creation of money is by our endorsement (signature !). Money created in any other method is by the acceptance of someone else's debt. Such a debt carries with it a negative charge and this negative charge must be decayed in our bodies, which causes us to age, etc. The negative side is the public liability. It can only be discharged by our acceptance and charging back or (re-public /re-venue) the public money back to the public for the public to use. If this is done , there is no longer a public liability and it will not carry the negative charge as before. It states in the Scriptures to: \"Seek ye first the Kingdo m,\" which is to find your own inheritance that was created at your birth and thereby all other needs shall be taken care of. There is a maxim of law that says; \"The money of the sovereign is his credit, he is the wealth for which no substance on earth can est ablish a value for.\" You first must obtain your sovereignty. Not very many people are going to find their true sovereign right s, as they must learn to hold the criminal charge and this is not publi cly acceptable as the public system cannot teach this. You must seek and do your own searching and not follow the govemme nt/leader, as the system wants us to go along with their debt program of REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 67"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"servitude and not to venture out on our own. This will label you as undes irable, but it is people like yours elves who lead and keep the public system in check. The public system is a necessa ry evil, and once an individual learns how to harne ss it for his/her benefit, the public liability shall no longer affect him or her. The public system is the system that we must live in and it will provide us with all our needs. We must learn how to stop its uncontrollable liability, by our acceptance and re-venue done very simply. When you have a need to know, you will search it out. Seek and ye shall find! Thereby, when we accept more public education it becomes a greater liability (debt) and it becomes harder to obtain our true liberty. It is a built-in factor that when we accept public degrees we become liable for the public's benefit. Should we obtain a public educat ion? We need to keep private values that allow us to use the public education to enhance our ability to benef it the public and ourse lves. Once we have learned to read, write, use math, research and investigate, we can educate ourselv es. But there are certain parts of the public educational system that can be used to benefit us beyond such basic, instructional need s, such as vocational-technical schoo ls. Here , we must be very careful not to obtain the education to serve the public master, but to harness it - not only for our own good, but for the good of the general public, too. Public education is used to attempt to help people fill their needs, but in doing so, most want a fast FIX and do not attempt to figure out what the real roots of the probl ems are. This is why the legal and medical fields are so volatile and keep individuals from searching for the truth (and true healing !). In Matthew, Chapter 23 and Luke 11 it states that people in these fields will be held accountable from Able to Zechariah, or from A to Z. A lot of well-meaning people don't understand the 'private to public ' conce pt and encourage individual s to get a good educat ion. Maybe we need to really get a good educ ation on the Private vs. Public accountability, and this can only be done by private study and experie nce. A public education looks good on paper, but it's the after- results that may get you and hold you accountable (as in debt for the rest of your life) for the public liability. RE-PUBLIC RE-PUB LIC: What does it mean to re-public or to have a republican form of government? The republic is referred to in the scriptures as Heaven or where the private held commercial stock is held by agents . It states in the Scriptures that only your agent/angel (nowhere in the Scriptures does it state that you are going to be in heaven; all references are to angel s/agents in Heaven [Matt. 18: 10, Mark 12: 25] ), a government agent, who by Oathlbond, must do your private commercial busin ess, as requested in writing. The spoken word is only hearsay and as Christ said on the cross, \"It is finished\" (Hearsay) (John 19: 30). We have to keep in mind that the government has only one function and that is to regulate the commercial transactions (busine ss) between people and/or states, in light of the U.S. Bankruptcy, aka National Emergency (March 9, 1933). The only way that the government has to measur e these affairs is by the commercial paper passed between the individua ls, which are valued by the tax value on the paper transaction . In order (after the Order of the Melchi zedek, Hebr ews) for there to be no taxes due, there must be a tax filing or registration, as they are one and the same. In order for the registration to take place, REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 68"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"it must be ordered by an individual which, after registration, the immoral criminal usage is hereby defused and the funds have been re-pub lic-ed. In the above reference to registration by an individual, the question could be asked why the government agent doesn 't just register the commercial transaction s. Then the funds would be defused/r edeemed, right? This would be Beelzebub casting out Beelzebub (Matt. 12: 24) or, to put it in plain words, you cannot use a negative (a minu s symbol -) to reduce a negative (-). In the relationship with the government, the government is a negative (infidel-debtor) . This leaves only one who can be the other side of the bond and that would be the sovereign/secured partylcreditor, who can be the only one to order the registration of the funds.

LICENSE Study the similarities and differ ences between taking an oath vs. purch asing a LICENSE and how they are viewed in the public liability. An OATH is our acceptance of our public offer to serve the public by the discha rge of our duty and obligat ions, either by discha rge (doing) or by dishonor (failure/ref usal). We have bound our subconscious to act upon true, natural agreements that have been accepted and charged (acceptance is charge) by an individ ual. Failure of the individual to honor his oath (who has bound his conscious to an act or uphold the laws of natur e), such as the promi se to pay to correct the damages by his wrongdo ing, creates dishonor. This action only takes place under moral undertaki ngs and with no malice involved. A LICE NSE carries about the same conviction s, but the public is selling the right of its liability, thereby limiting the account (field) to those who are regulated to duties requested under a limited obligation to perform. The study of the immorality of public license can be found in Acts, Chapter 8 and Chapter 22: 28. Licenses are necessa ry as the different public responsibilities carry a very narrow path/ac t. Only those trained in that narrow path/act know the proper connect ion. This goes ba ck to public educat ion, which most people believe broadens your knowledge, but it's only knowledge based upon a narrow point or subject. In order to control the application of this narrow view, it must be licensed, so as to protect the innocent from its misapplication, which is considered malice or immorally taking advantage of the innocent. Once we purchase (accept) the license we then become accountable in the same manner as an oath. When the individual holding the license is requested to act upon his duties and obligations, and he/she refuses/fails/ dishonors, he/she then has accepted the commercial dishonor that goes with his/her action and is charged accordingly. Gee, like a Driver 's License for example - you accepted the license and you became bond to the Motor Vehicle Code and accountable to the State ! You speed ... you pay the fine! REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 69"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"MONEY CREATION a nd BANKS Some individua ls, with their endorsement (their signatur es), creates all money. When it is created in the public form/f orum, it carries a public liability, which must be taxed to the Government. Whenever an individual signs a note at a bank, this creates the funds that he/she is borrowing. Even the wages or funds that a person accepts from working or selling products that they grew or made are public funds that have been borrowed into existence by someone else. The Federal Reserve Act allowed the banking system to set up the way that a person could redeem these funds that they are handling. Again, the Federal Reserve Act has two sides, the public , which the Federal Reserve Bank uses in the public form and which most people are familiar with; and the private side, which only those who hold the preferred stock of the United States are going to be able to use. Whenever a Federal Reserve Bank buys United States Bonds, Bills, or Notes it must issue a negotiable instrument (draft) for the purchase of the public offeri ngs. This instrument requires some individual 's signa ture, but it must circulate back to the bank (where it is placed on the ledger as colla teral) to be held as the collateral for the original issue. These funds were created by a public acceptance and therefore they carry a public liability and they must be taxed as they pass through the system. When a NON-N EGOTIAB LE instrument (draft) is received by a bank, it is placed upon the bank's ledger as collateral for the bank and the bank charges the account of the Principal who endorsed the instrument. These funds were created by a private tax exemption and are NON- NEGOTIABLE, which means they do not carry a public liability that must be taxed. NON- NEGOTIAB LE funds can only come from the individual (Secured Party/Creditor­ soverei gn) who accepts a criminal charge and thereby is the holder of the priority tax exemption to pass the charge through . OUR MIRROR IMAGE The mir ro r image is referred to in the public system as a \"STRAW -MAN.\" This is what was created by the regist ration or filing of an individual 's birth certificate. This is a necessary evil - in that the Government needed to provide for our needs by the creation of an industrial bond to provide the goods and services for our lives. This was done in a public form and it carries a public liability and it must have an execution (death) in order for it to be paid off in the public system. Should the individua l accept this bond for value, it then loses its public liability as the individual has used his tax exemption to allow it to pass through himlher and not carry this public liability. When the public laws are passe d, these laws are to regulate the industrial society and its commercial activities they affect. Public law, which has been done away with by the United States Governments bankruptcy, and thereby comm erce, is regulated by public policy now.

The people in the Colonies of North America were flourishing by using their own \"fiat money\" system based only on their production - not a gold based system that could be manipulated by the King. The King could not \"control\" the fiat money system and therefore passed a law requiring the subjects of the Crown to pay taxes in gold only. The King had most of the gold - the people of the colonies had little (scarcity/valu e), unemployment ensued - and embittered souls cried for redress . This fell on deaf ears, which lead to the natural powers of the peopl e, from which all political power is inherent, they declared their separation, causing the REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 84"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Crown to declare an unjust war on the exercise of the principals of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness , as the peoples of the colonies of North America had so aptly declared and laid before a candid world, for the causes which impelled them to their separation. The Representatives of the United States in Congr ess Assembled did win the Revolutionary war with England. There was a malfunction, however, in the plans for The United States of America. Money powers were waiting at the gate from the very beginn ing. Although the British Empire, as a recognized government in the world, lost the American Revoluti on, the powe r (finance) structure behind it did not lose the war. The most visible of the power structure identities was the East India Company, owned by the Bankers and the Crown in London, England. This was an entirely private enterpri se whose flag was adopted by Queen Elizabeth in 1600. This flag had thirteen red and white horizontal stripes with a blue rectangle in its upper left-hand comer. The British government became hostile by oppre ssive legisla tion and eventually decla red war from 1774-1782. The East India Compa ny's owners const ituted a portion of the invisible, (sovereign) Power structure (banks) behind the British government. They kept control of its holdings in the New World and moved right into the new economy created by New Order through the social compact, known as The United States of America. Together, and in close association with, the colonia l repre sentatives of the United States in Cong ress Asse mbled and their most powerful landowners still maintained control of the New World for the British Crown. The United States Const itution created a new socia l contract structure of government that was established on a much higher plane than the parliamentary system of the Confederation of The United States of America. It was a socia l compact known as \"Constitutional republic ,\" wherein a certain amount of powe r was delegated to the States (Corp orations) enfra nchised by the New Order of the Social Compact. A certain amount was delegated to the agency federal government with the residua l power reserved to the signatory parties respectfully (The Real Party In Interest, \"We (The) People of the United States\" who either signed the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the new Constitution of the \"United States\" for \"The United States of America\" or were related as a member posterity of such People having been signatory thereto). To no other people, did such social compact guarantee any Standing of Rights or otherwise under the new Social Compact. The Repre sentatives of \"We the People of the United States,\" by way of their agency representatives of the \"United States in Congress Assembled,\" had certain enumerated powe rs delegated by the social compact known as the Const itution of the United States. So far as the several States party to the U.S. Const itution are directly concerned, the Representatives of the United States in Congr ess Asse mbled, may not exercise any power not so delegated by the social compact known as the U.S. Const itution. All powe r not delegated to the Repr esentatives of the United States in Congress Assembled, by the socia l contract is reserved to the several States within their respective territorial borders -- or, to the signatory people thereto, or their posterity thereof (Article of Amendment, the IX and X of the U.S. Const .).

The First National Bank in the United States Define 'Ba nk ' in Blacks Law 4 t h . - Please read the entire definition (which consists of one full column) . This has reference to law and judges and particularly to water, i.e. maritime, before you arrive at what you think a bank might be. Read it carefully because this will become more and more important later in these course s). One of the first acts that the so-ca lled President, Mr. George Washington, did within two years of his appointment was to declare an emerge ncy. Willia m Morris with the help of Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of Treasury, heavily promoted the first national bank (Bank of England) to legislation in order to create a private bank. In 1781, Cong ress chartered the first national bank for a term of 20 years , with the same European bankers that were holding the debts before the war. The bankers loaned worthle ss, un-ba cked, non-secu red printed money to each other to charter this first bank. After thousands of lives were lost fighting a war to get control of the wealth of the people and their medium of money, why did cong ress contract with the same bankers that STARTED the revolutionary war in the first place? Very simple. Since the Crown and members of the Rothschild family [as they where commonly known] were the secured party creditors, they demanded a private bank to hold the securities (the assets) of the United States as the pledged assets to the Crown of England in order to secure the debt to which the United States had defaulted. The holders (Fiscal Agent of the Crown) of the securit ies were the private bankers operating the newly chartered bank. So, under public international law, the creditor nation forced the United States to establish a private bank to hold the securities as the colla teral for the loan. As throughout history, Money leads wherever we let it go unrestrained. European Bankers Expand 1785 AD - It had been rumored that the youngest Roth schild, Nathan, expanded his wealth to 20,000 pounds within a 15 year period by using other people 's money, an increase of 2500%. 1787 AD - Amshel (de Mayer) Rothschild made the famous statement: \"Let me issue and control a Nation's money and I care not who write s the laws.\" REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 88"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"It has been alleged that Thomas Jefferson stated, \"If the American people ever allow the previous banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation then by deflat ion, [then] the banks and the corporations which grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake home less on the Continent their fathers conquer ed. \" 1798 AD - The five Rothschild brothers expanded by opening banks in each of the major cities of Europe.

The War of 1812 and the Second National Bank The charter for the private bank was for 20 years -- or until around 1811. What happened in 1812? The War of 1812 . What did England attack? Wash ington, D.C., within the ten miles square. Here the British burned the White House, Library of Cong ress, and other buildi ngs. Was the attack by England within the assumed ten miles square an act of war? No, it was not. Under public international law, what was an act of war was the United States not extending the first national bank into the second national bank to continue to maintain the securiti es on the unpaid debt. So, when the United States acted in dishonor, by not giving the lawful creditor his securities in a peaceful manner, the only remedy available under international (Public Order) recourse to the creditor was to come in on letters of Marques and seize the assets to protect his loan. Did the second national bank get approved? Absolute ly. After England attacked the nation that was in default, they saw the light and enacted the second national bank. This was for another 20 years , which was to expire around 1836.

The original 13 t h Amendment prohibited Attorneys and anyone with a title of nobility to hold any public office in America. All the states had ratified this 13 t h Amendment, except for Virgi nia. You'll note that the War of 1812 was waged mostly in Wash ington, D.C. The British burned all the repository build ings, attempting to destroy all records of the new symbols of the social compact known as The United States of America, repre sented in Washington , D.C. by the United States in Cong ress Assembled . Thus, the War of 1812 was partly waged to prevent the passage and enforcement of the new Thirteenth Amendmen t. Most book repositories throughout the states were burned to the ground and all records destroyed . There 's a famous painting in Washington D.C. depicting the British boarding a ship after they \"surrendered .\" The painting shows the British carrying their rifles as they mounted the gangplank. One must ask, \"What army is allowed to keep their weapons after they surrender ?\" One must also ask, \"Who really won that war?\" As a result of the accumula ted debt of waging that war, a new Bank Charter was issued for another 20 years . Andrew Jackson and the Bank President Andrew Jackson put an end to this second Charter in 1836. Jackson's reasoning was simple: The Constitution does not delegate authority for Cong ress to establish a national bank. Jackson's rationale has never been seriou sly challenged, and the Const itution has never been amended to authorize Cong ress to establish a national bank. Nor, for that matter, does the Const itution delegate authority for the United States to establish corporat ions, particularly private corporati ons. There was not a national bank established in America for more than 75 years, unti1 1913 with the Federal Reserve Bank. Andrew Jackson did an excellent job. What did Congress do with Andrew Jackson? They impeached him. Is that because Congr ess is made up mostly of attorn eys? Who do the attorneys have a title of nobility to? The Crown of Engla nd. So Cong ress is populated by attorneys who are Esquires or titles of nobility to the Crown of Engla nd. So, who does our Cong ress represent? The Bankers (the Fiscal Agents of the Crown) .

Andrew Jackson vi olated public international law because he denied the creditor his just lien rights on the debtor. However, the bankers did not lend value (substance), so in actuality they had an unperfected lien, and therefore the law actually did not apply. Andrew Jackson stated, \"Controlling our currency, receiving our public money, and holding thousands of our citizens in dependence . . . would be more formidable and dangerous than a military power of the enem y.\" The Civil War In 1860-6 1, the Southern states (Representatives of the Original Signatories of the Social Compact) walked out of Congr ess. This created sine die. Abraham Lincoln was elected President. The South walked out and declared their states' rights pursu ant to the Social Compact known as the U.S. Const itution . Slavery was only window dressing for the Civil War. The war had nothing to do with slavery. It has to do with States (the Right of the present living Posterity of the Original Signa tories to the Social Compact to alter or abolish the forms of government which their Forefathers established for them selves and their Posterity) Rights and the National debt to the Creditor 's Fiscal Agent (the bankers ). The South wanted to be redeemed from the Crown in Engla nd. The North wanted to remain under their dominion and their debt. When the Posterity of the Member States of the South ordered their Representatives to walk out of Congr ess, this ended the public side of the bifurcated Const itution as far as the Republican form of government was concerned . What remained of the government was the private side, the democracy (the remaining Mob of illegitimate members of the cong ressional body of agents who had breached the organic social compact known as the U.S, Const itution which the beneficiaries of the Original Signatories of the Trust so established for their Posterity) foisted upon them under the rule of the (Fiscal Agents of the Crown) bankers . During and after the Civil War, the original 13 t h Amendment was replaced and a new 13 t h Amendment was issued first by Executive Order, and then enacted under Martial Law on December 18, 1865; the 14 t h Amendment was enacted simila rly on July 28, 1868; The 15 t h Amendment enacted simila rly on March 30, 1870. President Lincoln, by Executive Order proclaimed the first Trading With the Enemy Act. President Lincoln stated, \"The government should create, issue, and circulate all currency and credit needed to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers .\" Further, he quoted, \"The privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of government, but it is the government 's greatest opportunity .\" Afterward s, he was murdered because he defied the bankers by printing interest free money to pay for the war effort s.

This was the year of the stock market crash and the beginning of The Great Depr ession. The Great Depression : The stock market crash moved billions of dollars from the people to the banke r's ware houses (Banks). This also removed various forms of cash and/or certif icates, backed by lawful coinage (Gold and Silver) of the United States then in circulation for the peop les' use. Those who still possessed any cash invest ed in high interest yielding Treasury Bonds, driven higher by increased dema nd. As a result, even more cash was removed from circulation for the general public use. There was not enough cash left in circulation to buy the goods being produced.

In Europe, in 1930, the International Bankers decla red several nations bankrupt, including the United States. Then in 1933, President Roosevelt was elected and took office.

This title to our bodie s, all of our property and all of our future labor, was pledged to the International Bankers as security for the money owed in bankruptcy by the corporate United States (Title 28 U.S.c. 3002(15)(A)).

It was specifically relative to no other People or Social Compact, which was not a party to such or did not go along with the socia l scheme at the time, so-to- speak. In the years following the independence of the several colonies in the North of the Western Hemisphere, a close busin ess relationship had develo ped between the cotton growing aristocracy in the South and the cotton manufacturers in Engla nd. The European bankers decided that this busin ess connection was the Unio n's and/or Socia l Compact 's Achilles Heel, the door through which the you ng Republican form of Government could be succes sfully attacked and overcome. The lllust rated University History, 1878, p. 504, tells us that the southern states swarmed with British agents . These cons pired with local politicians to work against the best interests of the Social Compact known as the United States. Their caref ully sown and nurtured propaganda developed into open rebellion and resulted in the secession of the people of the Com pact Party State known as South Carolina on December 29, 1860. Within weeks , the people (beneficiaries as the posterity of the original signatories to the social compact) of six compact party states joined the conspi racy against the Union and broke away to form the new social compact construct known as the Confederate States of Amer ica, with Jefferson Davis as President. The plotters raided armies, seized forts, arsena ls, mints and other Union property. Even members of President Buchana n's Cabinet conspired to destroy the Union by damaging the so-ca lled public credit and working to bankrupt the socia l compact Union . President Buchanan claimed to deplore secession but took no steps to check it, even when a U.S. ship was fired upon by South Carolina shore batter ies. Shortly thereafter, Abraham Lincoln became President, being inaugurated on March 4, 1861.

The 'official' date for the start of the Civil War is given as April 12, 1861 when Fort Sumter in South Carolina was bombarded by the Conf ederate s, but it obviou sly began at a much earlier date. In December, 1861, large numbers of European Troops (Briti sh, French and Spanish) poured into Mexico in defiance of the Monroe Doct rine. This, together with widespread European aid to the Confederacy, strongly indicated that the Crown was preparing to enter the war. The outlook for the North, and the future of the Union, was bleak indeed. In this hour of extreme crisis, it has been said by those who remain anony mous, that President Abraham Lincoln appealed to the Crow n's perennial enemy, Russia, for assist ance.

History, if it can be found in truth, may reveal, if the truth ever comes to light, that the Rothschild family was heavily involved in financing both sides of the Civil War. Lincoln put a damper on their activities when , in 1862 and 1863, he refused to pay the exorbitant rates of interest demanded by the Roth schild family. Mr. Lincoln issued by Executive Order, via the new military socia l const ruct, a presumed Const itutionally-authorized interest free United States Notes.

INTERNATION AL BANKERS PURSUE THEIR GOAL Undaunted by their initial failures to destroy the Social Compact United States, the international bankers pursued their objective with relent less zeal. Between the end of the Civil War and 1914, their main agents in the United States were Kuhn, Loeb and Co. and the J. P. Morgan Co. A brief history of Kuhn , Loeb and Co. appeared in News week magazine on February 1, 1936: \"Abraham Kuhn and Solomon Loeb were general merchandise merchants in Lafayette, Indiana, in 1850. As usual in newly settled regions, most transactions were on credit. They soon found out that th ey were banke rs. In 1867, they established Kuhn, Loeb and Co., bankers , in New York City, and took in a young German immigrant, Jacob Schiff, as partner. Young Schiff had important financial connections in Europ e.

At the turn of the 20th century the Rothschilds, not satisfied with the progr ess being made by their American operat ions, sent one of their top experts, Paul Moritz Warburg, over to New York to take direct charge of their assault upon the only true champion of individua l liberty and prosperity -- the United States. At a hearing of the House Committee on Banking and Currency in 1913 , Warburg revealed that he was \"a member of the banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb and Co. I came to this country in 1902, having been born and educated in the banking business in Hamburg, Germany, and studied banking in London and Paris, and have gone all around the world .... \" (In the late 1800s, people didn't study banking in London and \"all around the world\" unless they had a specia l mission to perform !) Early in 1907, Ja cob Schiff, the Rothschild-owned boss of Kuhn, Loeb and Co., in a speech to the New York Chamber of Commer ce, warned that \"unless we have a Central Bank with adequate control of credit resources, this country is going to undergo the most severe and far reaching money panic in its history.\" Shortly thereafter, the United States plunged into a well orchestrated monetary crisis that had all the earmarks of a skillfully planned Rothschild 'job.' The ensuing panic financially mined tens of thousands of innoc ent people acr oss the country -- and made billions for the banking elite . The purpose for the 'crisis' was two-f old: (1) To make a financial 'killing' for the Insiders, and (2) To impre ss on all people the 'great need' for a central bank. Paul Warburg told the Banking and Currency Committ ee: \"In the Panic of 1907, the first sugge stion I made was, 'let us have a national clearing house' [Central Bank]. The Aldrich Plan [for a Central Bank] contains many things that are simply fundamental rules of bank ing. Your aim must be the same ... . \" Digging deep into their bag of decei tful pract ices, the international bankers pulled off their greatest coup to date -- the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve System, which placed control of the finances of the United States securely in the hands of the power-crazed money monopol ists. Paul Warburg became the 'Fed's' first chairman ! It has been alleged that Congressman Charles Lindbergh put his finger firmly on the truth when it is proffered that he presumably stated, just after the 'Federal' Rese rve Act was passed by a depleted Congress on December 23, 1913: \"The Act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth.

These were the Articles of Confederati on. These Articles were ratified but were never truly perfected because there were factions between the wealthy of the new nation who still had economic and political ties with previous counterparts of the Crown in Britain. Some people wanted to be aligned with England. Their wealth and continued wealth were locked with Engli sh rule and commer ce. Others wanted to be completely separate from England. Those who favored England found that there was too much opposition to be bound with Engla nd. As a result, those in favor of England, with the aid of Engli sh Bankers, did the next best thing for themselve s. They pushed for a Constitution governed by Treaty instead of the Articles of Confederation to control the new Social Compa ct.

It took another two years for the Bill of Rights to be added to the Social Compact known as the U.S. Const itution. This was to protect those People signatory to the Social Compact from their agency representations in government, the assumed ten miles square and the empl oyees of that government.

THE UNITED STATES as a corporation, created in England, came under the jurisdiction of England. This entitled England to create laws as England saw fit to do, establish those laws in THE UNITED STATES and everyone who at that time was a 14th Amendment Citizen were subject to obey those laws. This also placed the Congress of THE UNITED STATES above that portion of what we think is the Constitution, not under the authority of the Constitution. Copyrighted, remember? The only Bill of Rights left at this point in 2009, is four Amendments -- 13th, 14th 15th, and 16th.

The 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression that followed placed the so-called American people in desperation, homelessness, poverty and even starvation.

Then, in 1976, Congress removed any semblance of justice in their court system with Senate bill 94-201 and 94-381. From this point forward, the 'officers of the court' can construe and construct the laws to mean anything they choose them to mean. (See: Dyett v. Turner, 439 P. Rptrs. 266 [1968]; and Utah v.

In reality, the IMF was the Creditor of the UNITED STATES, a corporation, but NEVER you, lawfully or legally. The Creditor of the UNITED STATES designed invisible contracts to ensnare the sovereign people of Planet Earth as subjects. The Creditor of the UNITED STATES implemented the invisible contracts through apparent 'color of law' and the sovereigns irresponsibly agreed by way of the education received under misrepresentations. We, as the Sovereign Peoples of Earth, through the invisible contracts and our irresponsibility to reject the Creditors' (IMF) ideas, have been duped into voluntarily giving up our substance and energy to the private order of a few well orchestrated men by way of the mythical creations of corporations effecting our condition and present situation. You'll find that there is a common thread woven throughout our entire history. That thread is commerce, the merchant, the money-changer (banks), the law merchant (i.e., the law of commerce), civil law and maritime law. This is not to say that commerce is bad. It does, however, say that commerce brings with it the laws of commerce. Wherever commerce goes, it brings laws that can bind people into slavery. This can happen only if the people agree with it, depending upon their condition of mind, either willingly, through misrepresentations or by mistake.

With this Act, the states became, essentially, 14 t h Amendment Citizens as well. This completed the destruction of the corporate states having any power to protect against usurpation by the U.S. Government. The corporate states now were under the jurisdiction of Washington, D.C..

The Bankers were waiting in the wings when the founding forefathers established a new social compact for themselves. It was only two years after the Constitution was enacted that the bankers threw them into bankruptcy. The newly founded government of the social compact moved over to the side under the assumed ten square mile jurisdiction their congress controlled. In 1860, the Southern states walked out of Congress as stated earlier. This officially ended the lawful side of the Constitution under a Republican form of Government. Due to on-going breaches of the social compact by several of the beneficiaries, within several of the individual compact party member states constructs, and their abuse of the federal branches of the social compact designed to forbid such breaches, but instead, uphold the breaches to the social compact until the Union was reduced to chaos and eventually destroyed and replaced by a new form of Republic (see the Gettysburg address by the attorney, President Lincoln) not unlike the continued revamping of the 4 or 5 French Republics, historically, until the bankers had complete control of the social compact to their liking. In 1871, the assumed ten square miles and its territories that congress controlled was incorporated in England. The Constitution was adopted as the by-laws of their corporation. This ended, completely, their previous Constitutional standing. The beneficiaries of the Original Signatories (You know, their BLOOD posterity) to the Social Compact no longer had a Constitution within the framework which their forefather's had created for their benefit by and through such agencies in Offices of Trust, Honor or Profit, could or would be bound or controlled to the beneficiaries' sole and express benefit. THE UNITED STATES as a corporation, created in England by and through treaty, now came under the jurisdiction of England. This entitled England to create laws as England saw fit to do. England established those laws in THE UNITED STATES and everyone who at that time or would be by such misrepresentations as could be foisted upon the unsuspecting people, were and are 14 t h Amendment £itizens.

Then, in 1976, Congress removed any semblance of justice in our court system with Senate bill 94-201 and 94-381 as stated on page 25. From this point forward, the 'officers of the court' can construe and construct the laws to mean anything they choose them to mean. As 14 t h Amendment £itizens, we the people are not £itizens of their social compact like we have always been taught to think. We are actually, each and every one of us, a Sovereign of Planet Earth, through the Unalienable Birthrights to which the laws Nature and Nature's Creator entitled us. Today, as in ancient Babylon, various walks of life have idols of worship, of which money, i.e. Federal Reserve Notes, represent such as graven images created by people. Both represent a fiction of construed value, for whatever reason any market would bear, based upon conditions of supply and demand. The value established is whatever is given accordingly, relative to anyone's particular inordinate affection of such idols. Today law has become a fiction of corporate copyrighted statutes, to be interpreted by 'judges' who construe and construct whatever they choose to have those statutes mean.

Now, The Rest of the Story Of the Term \"Titles of Nobility\" The Hierarchy of Authority, from the Sovereign man/woman, to their family, has ever existed on any other presumed authority relative to any particular one or another outside of contract, to anyone in the family with respect to any neighborhood, or in any townships, or in any counties, or in any states, or in any country, and finally to any other type of social construct purporting to exist upon this planet or otherwise. Because all such constructs are fictions of the mind in relationship to the flesh and blood, the True Sovereigns of Authority, existing on Planet Earth. Therefore, the divine \"Structure of the Family,\" is the only true source of Sovereignty outside of the Supreme Creator of all Creation. Now that you know the hierarchy of authority that is mapped out as above, is everything running like the above line of command in today's multiple societies or constructs by which the various forms of social compacts exist anywhere? Not quite! You see, the foreign bankers knew they could not control Sovereign's with THIS system. So they decided to design a fictional system, which \"looks\" like the real thing - but really is not. The first thing that was done was to make an entity which looked and sounded like the forms of government to which the people of earth were familiar with such as the federal republic entitled \"united States of America.\" Notice that the \"u\" in united is a small u - that's because it is an adjective, describing the States (noun) of America. What if one capitalized the \"U\", as in United States? This would be a name, a \"title\" wouldn't it? So, now we have a \"title\" for the republic which was incorporated in England in 1871 as an English corporation. So does this mean we are being ruled by a private, foreign operated corporation - NOT a government? Has this happened to most other such governments on Planet Earth? You Bet! In 1944, the Buck Act (Title 4, U.S.C. 104-116) took the sovereignty away from the compact party states so that the enfranchised states could also have a \"title\" as in \"The State of Arizona.\" Next came the counties and municipalities - each had their own corporations, which usurped the organic government of the Trust organically established. What the beneficiaries had then become were an inverse relationship to the original organic republican form of government as handed to them by their forefathers. All right, let's go back to history. Let's assume and presume what most people in the year 1788 (January 1) did about the United States as a government - that it was in default to the Crown of England to the tune of 18 million Lira, plus interest. Then, as a direct and proximate result, the U.S. corporate government was bankrupt in their private capacity from the start of the Constitution. Now, the debt had to be paid for a period of 70 years. After a period of 70 years, if the Bible is res judicata and stare decisis, the Creator said the people and their social constructs can come out of bankruptcy with their Creditors (England) on December 31, 1858. And let's say, as an operation of law, at that time some notice was given to the nation that may have gone something like this: \"Excuse me, do you people really want to leave Babylon and have your liberty back now, or would you prefe r to maintain the Crown of England as your master and serve him faithfully?\" Or something along those lines. Look at Leviticus 3:17, which says that REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 107"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"\"If you love your master and your period of service is up, you can go to the judges, recite the fact that you love your master and you don't want to leave him.\" You can choose to serve him for the rest of your life by placing yourself into voluntary servitude. After December 31, 1858, did the Crown of England, through its attorney agents, give notice to the country, \"Hey, you guys want to leave (Britain) Babylon and go back to the original jurisdiction which your forefathers established for your benefit? Or, do you want to have your government remain under us?\" Now, remember, this could have only pertained to the posterity of the Original signatories to the social compact. The rest of the people walking around have never emerged into any form of social compact to establish their political status according to International Public Order. Thereby, they are considered subjects of the jurisdiction for which they are either found in or reside in or otherwise. Apparently, the Southern States did not wish to remain under slavery and walked out of Representative United States in Congress Assembled. Evidently what happened is, the other people to which the social compact applied, failed to give Notice of Lawful Protest. This was their acquiescent divine right to vote to remain in Britain (Babylon) under the Crown of England with continuing debt, plus a reorganization of government. Thus, having failed to do so, they remained under the new law forum because the old law forum to which they were entitled to, i.e., liberty and freedom, was abdicated. The Southern members of the social compact party states walked out, ending the public side of the Constitution. They wanted nothing to do with continued servitude and so noticed the representative agency Congress of the Union and the other various governments concerned (Britain). The people did not want foreign ownership or intrigue in their local politics to over­ ride their own governmental structures of self-government. The compact party members of the Northern states did not protest in any manner because they were busy fighting the Civil War, which was foisted upon them through misrepresentation and intrigue by these same foreign agents. Therefore, at the end of such conflict, they were handed a new law forum to which all northern people volunteered into. This was to go on for another 70 years of captivity and subjected their fellow southern brethren to the social compact in like kind to perpetual slavery and/or involuntary servitude without their freewill consent, into the new forum by force of arms. Nothing settled by force is ever settled at all. Free will is the true test of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness and any time force is used to hold any condition or Union together, other than to cast such condition out to keep the peace, for breach of contract is illegal and immoral. Any other form of choice is no choice at all. It is an affront against the Divine Creator's Will of Liberty granted to each and every living Man and Women. Original Jurisdiction You may use several law dictionaries to look up meanings for law and legal terms. It depends on the author and publisher as to which law forum they publish. If you read \"Black's Law Dicti onary\" you're going to get one opinion of one point of view. If you're reading Bou vier's or Ballentine's you might be getting another point of view. This is inserted here because Black's Law Dictionary came out shortly after this new Constitution was formed in 1887. REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 108"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Black's Law Dictionary was first published in 1891. That was 20 years, a time of prescription, after the corporate United States came into full force and effect by the Act of February 21, 1871. What does Black's Law Dictionary define? It defines the terms, the legal meanings of words, as they apply to the bifurcated United States Corporation. Roughly every 20 years there has been a new edition of Black's because every 20 year period in use -- is in the bifurcation --. If anyone failed to give a Notice of Lawful Protest, they would go on to the next stage and say, \"Let's change it again to see if we can go a little further, and we'll see if anybody protests this.\" So as you go through any such 20 year segments, 1871,1891, 1911, 1931, 1951, 1971, 1991, you get different definitions within Black's Law Dictionary. Remember, bifurcated means separated. The newly incorporated United States is separated from the original jurisdiction (even separated entirely from the Constitution) of the Republican form of Government as established by the U.S. Constitution. Remember that the original Constitution came in with the fact that it contains both the private side and public side, appertaining to the residual sovereignty of the original Signatories. This was passed by hereditary birthrights by way of such reservations, limitations, and restrictions (i.e., Article VI and the attendant Articles of Amendment) within the compact over their creation to which their posterity received (beneficiaries) by contract through the Trust Indenture (Constitution) creating the Social Compact (see Preamble to the Constitution). The private side of government can never be changed. The private side of government is based upon the Laws of Nature and Nature's Creator, and those laws never change. So the Public side of government, which we call General Jurisdiction, is different from Original Jurisdiction. Their Original Jurisdiction is based on the Laws of Nature and Nature's Creator which are the powers assumed by peoples acquiring by such declarations, their separate and equal station, and establishing the forms of original jurisdictions of government by social compact to secure the peace, safety and happiness for themselves and their posterity. The Laws of Nature that Nature's Creator entitles them to can never change. Only the forms which people use to implement the reasons for which they create any society (i.e., for their benefit), to secure the peace, safety, and the pursuit of happiness according to the dictates of their beliefs, customs, and practices of such, not only for themselves but for their posterity, can change. Could you amend the Original Jurisdiction? Why would you amend the social compact to change that which never changes? Unless you intend to change the very structure of society of the social compact as a whole, to which the original jurisdiction was created, to protect and pass such protections by birthright to the posterity by the Will of the Creators through their Testament (Constitution) thereto, there is no reason to do so. To do so, would be diametrically opposed to the dialectical Will and Testament (lex scripta) of the Creators of such social compact, leading to a rebellious war with the Laws of Nature and Nature's Creator's established Pillars of Universal Law via which any and all such social compacts was justly created. To ignore the intent and purposes of the Creators of such social compacts would bring about utter Chaos. A breach of the Peace of the International Public Order to which any other Original Jurisdictions have come to rely upon to maintain the General Order of the Public Arena between them in relation to their intercourse, to which such treaties are established, to secure the blessings of the variety of such societies in creation, as those so created and governed by the Pillars of Universal Law is a treason against REDEMP TION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 109"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"each and every Walk of Life on Planet Earth. Such actions, which tend to create chaos, tend to arise from the disrespect of one's ancestors and their refusal to learn the lessons of their predecessors. So Original Jurisdiction is and always remains exactly what it is. It never changes! Only from time to time does the situation arise out of necessity to ordain new constructs for the purposes so delineated ut supra. What is the law? The law never changes, it is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow. CONTRACT[.] Contract is governed by the Doctrine of Four Corners or that which is expressed in terms on some form of medium as to be an accepted custom and practice as lex scripta and, in vary rare circumstances with exacting evidence to support such, is by such custom and practices recognized as a Maxim of Law so well known for it to be unnecessary to put it in written formality, thus becoming known as lex non scripta by such general acceptance or general acquiescence. This definition of contract is derived from the principles of the \"Doctrines of the Maxims of Law\" that have been developed down through the millennium of jurisprudence of Mankind guided by the \"Divine Spirit of Truth\" as recognized by not just one society, but which each and every one of these societies are founded upon. These are the same Maxims, which we have referred to as the Supreme Creator's \"Pillars of Universal Laws.\" Now, we move to the public side of any social compact. What is this side, the side that is amended from time to time but does not change in respect to intent? That is the public administration side of the various social compacts and/or their respective agency side of these governing compacts. Is the public government law? Yes. This Law affects and controls anyone who is a signatory to some over-lying (above the Constitutional compact) contract conditioned upon the ability to create such agency relationship, arising from the social compacts respective thereto, and to whom such agencies are to be bound within any administrative manner, relative thereto, and further, in relationship to their consideration given for performance of certain conditions governed thereby, concerning any such over-lying (treaty) contract. Furthermore, it is contract which establishes and governs any means to create internal and external management, policies and procedures (such as venues, forums and/or jurisdictions), rules and/or regulations thereby which to inform parties to whom such concerns or however their Law is known as it may apply or not and to whomever, to help determine their use and their procedure applying to their assets and their property belonging to their private and any corporate side of their public side of government, created to give Order within their Social Compact, relative to any foreign exchange from the public side of government to the private side of government. Just think for a minute. Does a private owner of a business or property have any political right to make his own rules, regulations and \"law\" for use of his own property? Yes, he does. That is exactly what their statutes, regulations and rules are. They are internal management, policies, and procedures. They deal with their property and assets of their private side of their government in relationship to any agency public side of their government. In 1871, did \"All Walks of Life\" not signatory to any other such social compact fall under their incorporated jurisdiction of their private government?

The particular conflict known as the Civil War between the Several States of the Union did not touch upon \"All Walks of Life.\" What All Walks of Life within any locale of that, or any other conflict, continually educates others to believe is that those of the Social Compact (those who formed and/or presently administer any such Social Compact) are serving all interests. In fact, such compact party members thereof are simply carrying out their design of action for their own private reasons and gain. By controlling their centers of education relative from childhood throughout adulthood, members of such social compacts continue to teach others outside of such compact that there was/is some duty owed or allegiance given on the part of those of the various Walks of Life. But, for all intents and purposes, in realty such Walks of Life do not owe either - bearing in mind that they are neither a party signatory to such social compact or directly related by blood as one of their posterity thereof. Therefore, such Walks of Life have little or nothing whatsoever to do with a Social Compact known as the Several States of the Union, commonly referred to as the United States of America, not unlike so many others before them who had been so enticed, appertaining to others outside such social compacts (those not signatory or related by blood to those signatory to the compact) and drawn into conflicts then at hand or otherwise. This type of education upon all Walks of Life help firm up positions from either side of any conflict for the particular parties' own private reasons, whether or not those reasons were just in any eyes of those foreign or otherwise to their compact or not. Through such misrepresentations and conditioning of the minds of those foreign to their social compact, were their members to their compact successful at controlling the outcome of that particular conflict or otherwise from the outset. From an assumed and definite presumed authority, that those outside their compact believed as educated by member agencies of the various social compacts truly had or have any rightful authority to do so upon a vast populous. This same type of educational program continues to perpetrate the same mindset to keep all Walks of Life under various forms of control to this very day. They will continue to do so with their same tools of misrepresentations and false education. Whenever any such conflict arises, in respect to the needs of their members of their Social Compacts, all the Sovereign Peoples of Earth shall remain fodder for these compacts until these Sovereign People become aware of the Supreme Law (Treaty) and how to use Private International Law within the International Public Order (for which all social compacts are founded upon) for their benefit for those who choose or wish to emerge into any other political status for whatever various reasons, into a social compact for their own safety, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.

What if on every anniversary since the founding of McDonalds, they gathered together to have a barbecue and shoot off fireworks because they thought that Big Macs set them free; or took special days off during the year to celebrate Ronald McDonald's birthday and carved busts of Ronald at Mount Rushmore to honor him? They would fly the McDonalds corporate flag outside their homes and paste stickers of the flag on their vehicles. What if every time Executives for McDonalds ran for office, and sent in campaign contributions for their favorite candidate? Periodically they might even call on the officers of the corporation to solve problems that they were experiencing in their daily lives.

In fact, if it weren't for certain unrevealed contracts, and a whole lot of brain washing , United States Inc., would have no more influence, power, or jurisdiction over you than McDonalds, IBM, General Motors, or for that matter, any other corporation. America has been under an evolving military occupation since 1871. The flag that is flown around the so-called nation in public places, and by people who celebrate the occupation, is the war flag of United States.

The so-called United States is but a tool-a Trojan horse, if you will (and you are the subject of those who control it), for the Money Kings (the Ancient Money-Changers of Modem-day Money Mechanics). As a backdrop to the so-called American Revolution, here is a brief overview of the economic forces that were being unleashed in Britain around the time of the revolution. It provides important background and insight for you to understand that the Money Kings use everyone and everything as pawns, including governments, in a world game of Monopoly. They never operate out in the light of day. They prefer anonymity-you can only know them through their agents and their state apparatus of their countries they control[.] The following nine paragraphs examine their methods of operation (modus operandi) and the strategies behind them. The economic juggernaut these Money Kings set in motion toppled everything in its wake, including the fledgling new republic. Ask yourself while you read them, do you see evidence of these same practices operating in your world today? The Money Power of the World entered upon a new and grander era of development when steam was applied to manufactures. In 1774, Mr. Watt perfected the steam engine. This new servant of man, mightier than the Genii of oriental fable, was at once set to work propelling manufactures. The power loom, the spinning Jenny and the cotton gin were soon afterward invented, giving a great impulse to the steam manufacturing industry. The conditions of the time threw steam manufactures entirely into the hands of the London Money Power. Great Britain was the only country in Europe which had coal and iron for steam purposes. The capitalists of the East India Company were the only people in the world with capital to engage in the new industry. The great trading companies of other countries had been broken down by British conquests. Enriched by the trade of the Orient and the Tropics, these London capitalists at once seized the opportunity events offered them (chance serves a prepared mind) and embarked energetically in steam manufactures. The East India Company, as such, did not engage in these manufactures. All the stockholders REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 115"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"would not wish to invest in them: so large a corporation would be unwieldy; the immensity of the monopoly might excite alarm and provoke opposition. It would serve them better to operate through smaller corporations. A few capitalists might hold the stock of a great number of them without exciting jealousy and their management would be quiet and easy. The different corporations were like the regiments of an army: it was easy to form them into brigades, and divisions, and army corps, in order to give them the compact solidity of a grand military organization. It had the flexibility of individual enterprise, and the solidity of despotism. The Money Kings adopted the policy of single corporate companies for each special enterprise. They built manufactories of all kinds: they started iron mills, woolen mills and cotton mills. Manufactures of all kinds sprung up everywhere. The Money Kings organized new joint stock corporations, which built mills and manufactories. New companies operated mines of coal and iron, as Commerce energetically expanded through manufactures wrought by steam power. They organized new companies, which built vessels to plow the waters of every ocean, and built new warehouses. They established new trading stations all over the earth. Commerce had languished in previous ages because the Earth's Temperate zone did not have sufficiently cheap products suited to tropical demand to offer in exchange for tropical productions. Steam manufactures opened up a new commercial era. They greatly stimulated tropical production, by offering manufactures in those markets. They also greatly stimulated industry in the Temperate zone. In all the countries of the Temperate zone, the demand for the manufactures of Britain was far beyond the ability to pay for them with exports. The first effect of this state of things was a wave of excitement that swept over Great Britain. An industrial boom was started. Everybody had money invested in the stock of manufacturing companies, shipping companies, trading companies. The Money Kings took care to have the majority of stock: outside companies for steam manufactures they knew they could devour at their leisure. The grand Money Kings had such advantages in their immense capital and in their perfect organization, that in commercial crises, often originated and always manipulated by them, they managed systematically to break down rival companies and buy them out. They robbed and plundered the minority stockholders. In the end, these organized capitalists got into their own hands, and for a pittance of the true value, all, or the greater part of, the stock of the various companies, manufacturing, mercantile and shipping, that originated in steam manufactures. They thus reduced to a system and a science the art of crushing rival companies and freezing out minority stockholders. Their whole career was a systematic course of treachery, fraud and plunder, without a parallel in history. They advanced step by step, always causing a boom in every new enterprise that enlisted much outside capital, always managing to operate within seasons of business disaster. They lost a few hundred thousand by falling prices, a loss which they were abundantly able to stand, while making many millions by obtaining cheaply the stock of broken corporations and the stock sold by minority stockholders. Dealing in futures in Boards of Trade, was then started on a grand scale. This system originated for the purpose of enabling large capitalists to force stocks up or down as they chose, by dint of capital, without any regard to the actual value-the most satanic engine of trickery, fraud and oppression ever devised to enable the strong to plunder the weak. It is the drag net with which the Money Kings destroy multitudes of men of small means. Like the fisherman takes fish in his REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 116"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"sea, they are fisher men and the rest of mankind is their prey. They are always seeking after spoil. They are always dragging their net for the destruction of the unwary. But aside from this plunder of the weak and the trusting, the regular profits of the new age of industry were very large . In every socia l const ruct or compact of the Temperate zone, the ongoing demand for British manufactures was much greater than could be paid for by expor ts. The difference in the balance of trade was always systematically arranged by lending money on mortgage for that amount, or by spending the amount of the deficit in starting some busin ess enterpri se in that locale of so-ca lled country . In this way, the adverse balance of trade was not felt by the economic community of the locality falling behind. It bought all it wanted, and the adverse balance of trade actually made times better; for it caused the profits of the Money Kings to be invest ed in the so-called country, stimulating busin ess into activity. The disadvantage was the busin ess invest ment did not belong to the so-ca lled nation, but to the Money Kings: and the prosperity it caused was not national prosperity, but was the bloated gains of the Money Kings. The regular method of the Money Kings for the last hundred years has been to start new manufact ures, new shipping compan ies, new trading compan ies; gather in all the outside capital possible; freeze out minority stockholde rs; and throttle outsid e corporat ions. This effectiv ely indebted all nations to them. First, they would make parasitic investments equal to the amount of the deficit of the balance of trade. This was done by putting in the profits derived from the East India Company. Then, after invest ing these profits, they would continua lly reinvest any future profits of all their enterpri ses in each and every count ry until their invest ments accumulated like rolling balls of snow, to at last become an avalanche under which to bury the prosperity of the world. Rise of the Money Kings THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE Approximately 3 percent of the confederate population participated in one of the bloodiest wars in history and allegedly won their independenc e. They understood the historical roots of war, injustice and oppre ssion beca use they experie nced it first-ha nd-kn owledge , which has since been lost to posterity. The victo r's history books do indeed leave out much truth and lied about much of the rest to justify the outcome and to control the future labor pool to the victo r's wants and needs within such conquered areas. The primary re ason for the War for Independence was not \"taxation without representat ion,\" but the fo rced payment of taxes to the King in gold instead of paper money. America was flour ishing by using her own \"fiat money\" system based only on production, not a gold-based system that could be manipulated by the King. The King could not \"control\" the fiat money system and therefore passe d a law requiring that tax es be paid in gold only. The King had most of the gold­ the colonies had little, so unemployment ensued. The embittered colonists cried for war. Benjamin Franklin put it this way, \"The colonies would have gladly born the little tax on tea, and other matters, had it not been that England took away from the colonies their money .\" Prior to the Revolutionary War (1774), The Times of London said this regarding fiat money in Amer ica: REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 117"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"\"If this mischievous financial policy, which has its origins in North America, shall become endurrated down to a fixture, then that government will furnish its own money without cost.

The brains and the wealth of all the countries will go to North America. That country must be destroyed or it will destroy every Monarchy on the globe.\" The truth is that the Revolution failed. You might say that we won a military victory over the most powerful military force on the planet at the time. However, reading the Treaty of Paris (signed the Winter of 1782) it becomes clear that we were not exactly negotiating as equals. We had won the recall of British troops but not the bankers . Even though we are taught that we won our independenc e from England, we actua lly were able to remain free from the international bankers for only a few years at the close of the presidenc y of Andrew Jacks on. The most visible of the power structure was the East India Com pany owned by the bankers and the Crown in London, England. This was an entirely private enterpri se whose flag was adopted by Queen Elizabeth in 1600-thirteen red and white horizontal stripes with a blue rectangle in its upper left-hand comer. All debts owed before the war were to be collected by the foreign credito rs, (i.e., trading companies) by and through the Customhou ses run by these trading companies. The practice goes on to this very day throughout the planet. Various Customhouses of the many so­ called countr ies fall directly under the control of foreign agents to ensure the payment and service of the past and present debts. WHO WAS BEHIND THE CONSTITUTION When the creditors of the new social compact of the so-ca lled \"The United States of America\" as a nation/state found the Articles of Confederation to be inadequate to exact payment from their young debtor, the Const itution was written. This document put into operation the Treaty of Paris and tho se on-going amendments thereto . It was supported by the bankers through their associates, to increase their control over the socia l compact known as \"The United States of Amer ica.\" Had the Articles of Confederation been completed and adopted, instead of the Const itution, the bankers would have had far less control over the signatories to the socia l compact or to their posterity in the future. Any Constitution must have some prior reference to establish its foundati on. The authority for the so-ca lled American Const itution is alleged to be based upon the Bible; the Magna Charta, signed in 1215 by King John ; the Petition of Righ ts, granted by King Charles I in 1628; the Engli sh Bill of Righ ts, granted by William and Mary in 1689; the right of habeas corpu s, granted by King Char les II, and the Articles of Confederation, 1781. And accordingly, any and every Const itution thereafter must have an enabling clause. From this point onward, no Const itution may dimini sh, in any manner, those rights already established in the above six documents relative to the socia l compact to which it referred and to whom such was created by or for, other than by such powers , as enumerated for such causes, as might be demonstrated.

The Declaration of Independence decla red universally to a candid world that all people were sovereign under the Creator 's Natural Law when they took upon them selves the Mantle of Sovereignty, singula rly, jointly, and severally, and assumed among the powers of Earth their separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and Nature 's Creator entitle them . These Sovereign People of the various E'States of Planet Earth, created their separate and equal State body corporate gove rnments for the protection of their rights in a Union (Marriage) of the Several States, to better serve these ends for themselves and their posterity. These endeavors in Union, sought foreign Alliance to better firm up their collective relationship to the various social compacts of the time in the interest of good will and peace within the International Public Order of the day. They delegated certain authority from the people 's powers (those signatory to the founding documents creating the socia l compa ct) by and through the several State Const itutions in order that the three branches of agency government could properly carry out the dictates outlined in the State Const itutions to protect their rights in relation to foreign exchange that might arise from time to time by the formality of treaty. The so-ca lled American Const itution created a new structure of central agency government that was established on a much higher plane than either the parliamentary system or the confederation of states when delegating agenc y powers for foreign purpo ses as delineated by the social compact to govern such agenc y power. It was a people's \"Constitutional republic ,\" where a certain amount of power was reserved to the states and a certain amount was delegated to the federal agency government. The so-ca lled agency United States, by way of the United States in Congress Asse mbled, has certain powe rs delegated by the Const itution. So far as the several States party to the Const itution are concerned, the United States may not exercise power that is not delegated by the Const itution. All power not delegated to the United States by the Const itution is reserved to the several States within their respective territorial borders-or, to the (signatory and/or their posterity currently living) people. BRITISH SUBVERSION, BANKS , AND TREASON Even though the Treaty of Paris allegedly ended the open Revolutionary War in 1783, it did not covertly stop the Crown and their Money Kings from subverting the newly found politica l structure by whatever means possible . Simply put, the fact of the continuing existence of the social compact as it was designed threatened the Monarchies and Money Kings where it hurt most: financially, by a collective of Sovereign People by and through their State body corporate governments and central agency government. It effectively severed the nexu s third party attachment, if properly attended with respect to the Sovereign People behind the Veil of the Corporation so established. But, where in history have any people kept eternal vigila nce, either of themselves or for their posterity or their posterity when times are easy, after the sacrifice and success of their forefath ers? The Sovereign Peop le (forefathers of the social compact) had paid REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 119"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"close attention to how the Crown and Money Kings had used corporations to plunder the people and hidden itself behind this veil to limit the Money Kings' and Crow n's liability arising via tort. This was because of the Money Kings and Crowns avarice desire to rule all walks of life, whether such people fell within the moral jurisdiction of the Crowns or not. The forefath ers who created the social compact known as \"The United States of America\" in turn reversed the use of corporations to protect themselves and their posterity from the Crown to their benefit. The so­ called United States stood as a heroic role model for a short time, for other weaker socia l compacts around the planet, which inspired them to also struggle against oppre ssive Money Kings and Monarch ies, etc. The French Revolution (1789-1799) and the Polish Uprising (1794) were, in part, encouraged by the so-ca lled American Revolut ion. Loca lly speak ing, we the people stood like a beacon of hope for most of the world. The Money Kings and Monarchies regarded the so-ca lled United States as a politica l infection, the principle source of radical republican democracy that was destroying the Money Kings and Mona rchies (more importantly the Money Kings, the power behind the Crow ns) around the world. The Money Kings and Monarchies realized that if the principle source of that infection could be destroyed, the rest of the world might avoid the contagion and the Monarchies would be saved. Knowing they couldn't destroy us militarily, they resorted to more covert methods of political and financial subve rsion, employing spies and secret agents (Attorne ys) skilled in bribery and legal decept ion. This was perhaps the first \"cold war.\" In the 1794 Jay Treaty, the United States agreed to pay £600,000 sterling to King George III, as reparati ons for the so-ca lled American Revolution which came about not from any one people of the so-ca lled Americas damagi ng the Crown, but because the Crown and Money Kings had sought to invade the private lives of all walks of life without real representat ion. The US Senate ratified the treaty in secret session and ordered that it not be publi shed. When Benj amin Frank lin's grand son published it anyway (perhaps our first whistleblower) , the expos ure and resulting public up-roar so angered the Cong ress that it passe d the Alien and Sedition Acts (1798) so that federal judges could prosecute editors and publish ers for reporting the truth about the government. So much for the so-ca lled people 's rights of freedom of speech who were not signatory to the socia l compact. And who are these people who claim a right under a contract to which they them selves were not signatory? Are they related to the actual signatories by blood, as one of their posterity to which the contractual nexus could pos sibly extend to state a Claim of Action concerning such speech from which such posterity of the signatories could be granted relief? No. Not ONE of them had any true credibility, especially concerning any member of the State Compact Party States of the Union (Marriage) of the Several States. That would be like someone coming to your bed and claiming a right of prima noctae (the right of first night-the right of the nobleman of ancient times in England, and various other jurisdiction s, to take to them selves the brides within their domain during the first night after the wedding of the peasants for their own pleas ure and to be returned the following day after the young bride had been deflowered by the noblema n). Not something that we would likely stand fo r now, is it?! So, how is it one can presume to claim a right under a social compact, i.e., Constitution, to which you are not signat ory to, nor related in some fo rm or another as their posterity, to be able to state a claim fo r which relief could possibl y be grant ed by any provable underlying contractual nexus fo r their agents to be able to recognize a liability on their part to petjorm in some fiduciary manner, on your behalf, fo r any assumed breach of contract concern ing any alleged claim of right arising thereunder, as stated or claimed by you, in a fo rum to which, fo r all intents and purposes, is fo reign to you and looked REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 120"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"upon in the same mann er by such a one, relative to you and your standing, to state a claim fo r which relief can be grant ed in such fo rum.

Since they supposedly had won the Revolutiona ry War, why would their Senators agree to pay reparati ons to the loser? Why would they agree to pay £600,0 00 sterling, eleven years after the war ended? It doesn't make sense, especially in light of the Senate's secrecy and later fury over being exposed ... unless we assume their Sena tors (Atto rneys) had been bribed (or were already in the service thereof) to serve the Money Kings and British monarchy to betray the so-ca lled American people ! That is treason only in regards to the intents and purposes of the original creators of the socia l compact and the then and after living posterity thereof! From the beginnin g, the United States Bank had been op posed by the Democrat ic-Repub licans lead by Thomas Jefferson, but the Federalists (the pro-monarchy party) won the vote (1796). The initial capitalization was $ 10,000,000 -- 80% of which would be owned by foreign bankers . Since the bank was authorized to lend up to $20,0 00,000 (double its paid capita l), it was a profitable deal for both government and the bankers , since they could lend and collect interest on $10,000,000 that did not exist. However, the European bankers outfoxed the agency U.S. gove rnment. By 1796, the agency U.S. government owed the bank $ 6,200,000 and was forced to sell most of its shares. By 1802, our government owned no stock in the United States Bank! Thomas Jefferson had warned (1802): \"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currenc y, first by infla tion, then by defla tion, the banks ... will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-u p hom eless on the continent their fa thers conqu ered....

(In German, the name is spelled Roth schild and is pronounced Rote-shilld). In 1787, Amshel (Bauer) Rothschild made the famous statement: \"Let me issue and cont rol a Nati on 's mone y, and I care not who writes the laws. \" He had five Sons Amshel May er, Solomon, Jacob, Nathan, and Carl. In 1798, the five Rothschild brothers expanded by opening banks in Germany, Vienna, Paris, London, and Naples. The objective behind these bankers was to establish a clearinghouse/warehouse (bank) which REDEM PTION MANUA L - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 121"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"was to receive specia l privilege and immunity to use the unjust fractional reserve banking in order to print money and loan it to the agency government and corporate industry charter via the corporate agency government . No beneficial intere st could accrue from any beneficial use from any circula tion of any note generated via the charter. This was established by the agency United States for the purpose of servi cing the debt of the corporate United States and for the purpose of transferring the liability of the accrued debt, which had never been extingu ished since the 1770's, forward without interest being paid to the (fiscal agents of the Crown) bankers . Through these scheme s, the corporate agency government contrived to pass the liability through adhesion contracts to other walks of life under various new deals to discharge thereon debts to the Crown. One of the very simple schemes foisted upon the people at large was fractional reserve bankin g. It is simply a specia l privilege given to a man or group of men to create credit out of thin air. The schemes are executed by extending this credit/debt to any and everyone else in or found about a loosely associa ted people closely associa ted with a particular society or social compa ct. By, and through, such misrepresentations perpetrated upon such Walks of Life. which do not have the same access to the same privileges or immunities that the creator of the social compact or their posterity have, and thereby are burdened with paying the collecting fees from servicing the alleged debt of the socia l compact, the assumed value of money and the attached- plus interest - for the cost of the use of the units created to discharge in tender of debt thereof. Due to the beneficial interest created by the use of such instruments created by fractional reserve bank ing, the Crown and Money Kings become very rich and the agency government is allowed to continue to legally discharge its debt and service their liability without ha ving to produce anything of value other than to 'attorn' such property (by and through such Attorneys of the Crown) from the unaware populous not familiar with the principals of discha rge, contractually speak ing, which is only a viable option to those which exercise credibility to expatriate from such as sumed nexus with such socia l compact and its liability and repatriate according to the principa ls of International Public Order into such society to which they become a creative signatory member thereof to such social compact, thereby creating a nexus for their safety, liberty, and pursuit of happine ss by creating a hereditary birthright and standing to which their posterity may acquire by birth as well. The basic mathematics behind the fractional banking system is very clear. If this system is left in place long enough, the man or group who controls this system of debt creation will own all the gold available in the social compact however known as a nation/ state, kingdom or otherwise. Once the supply of real portable specie money (gold/silver or whatever the medium of excha nge, whether money of account or money of exchange (species) is in his or their hands, this man or group of men becomes the mast er of the entire economic field of endeavor of such social compact. Why? Because this man or group of men contr ols the only source of operating medium (money, however defined) available through which the socia l compact functions to discharge debt. Only the man who has the privilege of printing and/or minting the money and loaning or extending such as interest can determine who gets specia l (drawing rights) funding-his friends and allies. Everyone else is limited to how much money (of account or exchange) they have access to; therefore, after two or three generat ions, the friends and allies of this \"banker\" will own all of the energy of such socia l compact. This present condition is being played out in the so-ca lled American society and is now owned by a small cadre of very wealthy men throughout the planet. This same scheme of fractional reserve manipulation is being played out, throughout REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 122"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"all of the various political social const ructs globally with ONE aim, world domination of each and every resource to which the Planet Earth can produce for their selfish benefit, including the absolute control of each and every living soul upon the planet to be forced economica lly into serving solely the private intere sts and gain of the Money Kings. How long the fractional banking process takes to work its way through the wealth of any socia l compact depends upon how successful the \"banker\" is in forcing, through bribery and corruption, the restriction of the formal agency government 's issuance of real money backed by gold or silver or such other medium of accou nt or excha nge. Species currency is put into circulation to honestly and truly lli!Y debt or discha rge whatever liability is acquired which may or may not arise when one increases one's E'State through the benefit of their efforts and labor as most people evidentially wished to. Was this not the American Dream ? Furthermore, as the supply of real money shrin ks, the people of any social compact are forced to rely on the creation of a fictitious debt by the privileged few to a greater and greater extent, until finally, the only thing left is a massive amount of \"un-pa yable deb t,\" with no way to lawfully discharge their acquired debt, which was created from nothing and consists only of the interest charged upon the fictitious debt, while collecting interest for every moment of its existence. All this for the benefit of the privileged, who become the de facto (illegally usurped) agency government because of the \"money power\" they allow to be wielded by and through the social compact . Few are ever aware of the true damages done to their E'States or that of such E'State to which may or may not be possi ble to pass by hereditary right so-to- speak and the debt which if not lawfully discharged back to the Original source or Creator of the debt, passes on to future generations of their posterity, creating a continuous debtor class people (subjects now of the Money King s) to the whims of a foreign despotic tyrannical power. THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK Through the Bank of England, the Rothschild s/the Money Kings demanded (did you ever wonder how they could make such a demand of the Crown) a private bank in the so-ca lled United States to hold the securities of the United States as the pledged assets to the Crown of England in order to secure the debt to which the signatories of the social compact by and through their agency government had defaulted. As one of his first acts, President Washington declared a financial emergen cy. William Morris with the help of Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of Treasury, hea vily promoted the creation of a private banker 's clearingho use (customhou se) to service the debt to the international bankers . In 1791, Congr ess chartered the first national bank (banker 's clearinghou se) for a term of 20 years, to hold the securities of the same European bankers who had been holding the debts before the war. The bankers loaned worthless, un­ backed, non-s ecured printed money of acc ount to each other to charter this first bank. On December 12, 1791, the Bank of the United States opened its doors in Philadelphia. The holders of the securities were the private banke rs. So under Public International Law, the Creditor (Crown of England) forced the so-ca lled United States to establi sh a private banke r's clear inghouse (warehou se) to hold the securities as the colla teral for the (social compact) so­ called national debt.

Their relationship deteriorated sharply with the outbreak of war in Europe in 1803. Britain imposed a blockade on neutral (social compact) countr ies such as the United States. In addit ion, the British took people acting under an agenc y status as American sailors from their ships and forced them to serve in the British Navy. Concerned about the many English spies and troublemake rs, the United States in Congr ess Asse mbled, passed an amendment to prevent those who had English titles and connect ions from obtaining any seat in government . Called the Titles of Nobility Act (TONA, 1810-11) , it reads as follows: \"If any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim, receive, or retain any title of nobility or honor, or shall without the consent of Congress, accept and retain any present, pension, office, or emolument of any kind whatever, from any emperor, king, prince, or foreign power, such person shall cease to be a citizen of the United States, and shall be incapable of holding any office of trust or profit under them, or either of them. \" This congr essional act (TONA) was later to amend the U.S. Cons titution as the Original XIII Amendment, which led to the War of 1812 with Great Brita in. Furthermore, it took the Civil War to officially force the gradual replacement of this amendment to be taken from all reference from every state published record with what is now known as the Slavery Amendment or the Amendment created as an act against Involuntary Servitude (1863), a War-time Act passed under Martial Law. All \"titles of nobility\" were prohibited in both Article VI of the Articles of Confederation of \"The United States of America\" (1777) and in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution of the \"United States\" (1778), but there was no penalty. Although already prohibited by the Const itution, an additional \"title of nobility\" amendment was deemed necessary and was proposed in 1789, again in 1810, and finally ratified in 1819. But the notice of ratification delivered to the Secretary of State, an attorney with the tit le, \"Esquire,\" disappeared. As a result, there still is no penalty for accepting titles or emoluments from foreign rulers today, just the prohibiti on. Clearly, the founding fathers saw such a seriou s threat in \"titles of nobility\" and \"honors,\" that anyone receiving them would be required to forfeit their citizen ship. Obviou sly the Amendment carried much more signif icance for their founding fathers than is readily apparent today. The forefa thers knew that their freedom and that of their posterity could be subverted from inside their agency government and had sought to prevent such a bitter betrayal . Today, most Senators , Congressmen, all Federal Judge s, and most of their Presidents are attorneys who carry the title REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 124"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"\"Esq uire,\" often abbreviated as \"Esq .\" Neverthe less, the U.S. Cons titution still forbids this. In Colo nial Amer ica, attorneys trained attorn eys, but most held no \"title of nobility \" or \"hono r.\" There was no requirement that one be a lawyer to hold the position of district attorney, attorney general, or judge; a citizen 's \"counsel of choice\" was not restricted to a lawyer and there was no state or national bar associations. The only organization that certified lawy ers was the International Bar Association (IBA), chartered by the King of England (known as the British Accreditation Regist ry), headquartered in London and recognized everywhere as the BAR. Lawyers admitted to the IBA, or otherwise BAR, as it is most readily known everywhere, receive the rank \"Esquire\" - a \"title of British nobility.\" \"Esquire\" was the principle title of nobility which the 13th Amendment sought to prohibit from exercising any office within the United States. Why? Because the loyalty of \"Esquire \" lawyers was suspect ! Lawyers with an \"Esquire\" behind their name s were agents of the Money Changers and the Monarchy, and members of an organization whose principle purposes were political and regarded with the same wariness that some people today reserve for members of the KGB or the CIA. The archaic definition of \"honor\" (as used when the 13th Amendment was ratified) meant anyone \"obtaining or having an advantage or privilege over another.\" A contemporary example of an \"honor\" granted to only a few Americans is the privilege of being a judge: lawyers can be judges and exercise the attendant privileges and powers, non-la wyers generally cannot. We addre ss the judge as, \"your Honor.\" By prohibiting \"honors,\" the missing, but now found, original 13th amendment prohibits any advantage or privilege that would grant some citizens an equal opportunity to achieve or exercise political power. Therefore, the second meaning (intent) of the original 13th Amendment was to ensure politica l equality among all citizens of the United States, by prohibiting anyone, even government officials, from claiming or exer cising a specia l privilege or power (an \"honor \") over other citize ns. Now, what would happen if this amendment were enforc ed? It would cause an immediate chaos in all three branches of the agency federal government and the same in each and every State of the Union because these same Attorneys sit in every seat of power throughout every level of the socia l compact for the sole purpose of enforc ing the mandates of the Money Kings and the Crown of England, even upon those people to whom the alleged original debt was incurred by, that has absolutely nothing to do with either said people or through any nexus of the socia l compact to which their forefathers had accepted the liability of such debt in the 1770s, nor does any people not signa tory or evidencing any hereditary pr ivileges as their posterity incur any liability for such debt by any stretch of the imaginings of such perfidious Attorneys who practice their pedifoggery upon all walks of life by and through such frauds perpetrated upon them by these leeches of the ancient Money Changers living upon the economic well-being of any and all societies known as Attorneys. Both \"esquire\" and \"honor\" would be key targets of the 13th Amendment even today. Because, while \"titles of nobility\" no longe r apply now precisely as they did back in the early 1800's, it is clear that an \"esquire \" or BAR attorney receives far better treatment than a layman, in and by their courts, as well as by the public at large , in general . Wher eas, if you represent REDEMP TION MANUA L - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 125"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"yourself pro per , in se, or spea k as a So vereign in pro prius per sonam , you are treated as though you were rab bl e.

Si nce the Original 13 th Amendment has never been re pealed, all acts of their government since 1819 are technicall y null and void. Most so-ca lled lawmakers, are attorneys and are prohibited from participation in any office of government by the true amended socia l compact contract known as U.S. Constituti on. Thereby, every attorney should be stripped of his or her appearance of right to hold any office as an agent representing any so-ca lled citizen of the United States under TONA aforementioned, who have continued to interject them selves into the political process solely for their benefit of gainful pillaging and plunder. When people discove red that European banking interests owned most of the United States Bank where they deposited their hard earned savings, they saw the sheer power of the banks and their ability to influence representative government by economic manipulation and outright bribery. On February 20, 1811, Cong ress therefore refused to renew the Banker's charter on the grounds that the Bank was unconst itutional . This led to the withdrawal of $7,000,000 in specie (money in coin) by European invest ors, which in tum, precipitated an econo mic recession, and the War of 1812. This \"war\" was punishment for the United States in Congress Assembled, refusing under the pressure of people becoming aware of this manipulat ion, to do busin ess on the terms of the International Banking families of the House of Rothschild, through the first Bank of the United States. Cong ress refused to let the National Bank renew its Charter, fearing for their safety. Except for Gen. Andrew Jackson's victory in the Battle of New Orleans, the War of 1812 produced a string of American military disasters. The most shocking of these was the British Army 's burning of the Capitol, the President 's house, the Library of Congr ess and other public buildings in Washington on August 24 and 25, 1814. (Americans had previou sly burned public buildings in Canada.) During the War of 1812 , so-ca lled national archi ves of the United States and many libraries and document repositories were burned and some of the evidence of the TONA previously mentioned disappear ed. Neverthe less, the legisla ture of Virginia ratified the amendment and it was subsequently printed in many official publications as the 13th Amendment, even in States which had NOT ratified, such as Connecticut and several States that came into the Union later in history. Beginning in 1832, it began to disappear from texts, although official state publications continued to publish it as late as 1876. There are undoubtedly other examples of the Money King's and the Mona rchy's efforts to subvert or destroy the so-ca lled socia l compact known as the United States.

Yet this image of docum entary disarray appropriately describes our situation today : we are inundated with useless information while we are misdirected from information that we have not had the time or interest to sort throu gh. As a result we have lost a precious treasure in the chaos and turmoil of daily life: our sovereignty. One amazing aspect of the War of 1812 was the existence of a depression during wartime. War always brings a short-term prosperity, except in the case of this war. To understand this, it is vital for you to know that all depressions and recessions are artificially created through the restriction of a medium of accounting or exchange -money. This restriction keep s so-ca lled money OUT of circula tion, which means fewer funds available to facilitate production and distribution. Furthermore, this means poverty and starvation for all walks of life not privy to such plunder. The precariou sness of agency government finance during the war and the post war recession convinced the Republican agency government under James Madison to re-establish a so-ca lled national bank. Thus was created the Second Bank of the United States in 1816. THE SECOND NATIONAL BANK In January 9, 1832, The Second National Bank applied for a charter renewal 4 years early. This time, President Andrew Jackson vetoed the Bank's recharter on the grounds that the Bank was unconst itutional and he successf ully paid off the national debt leaving the U.S. with a surplus of $5,000. He said, \"If congress has the right under the Constitution to issue paper money, it was given them to use themselves, not to be delegated to individuals or corporations.\" On January 30, 1835, President Andrew Jackson attended a cong ress ional funeral in the Capitol building . As he exited, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed house painter, pointed a pistol at Jackson and fired. The percussion cap exploded, but the bullet did not discharge . The enraged Jackson raised his cane to strike his attacker, who fired again . The seco nd weapon also misfired and the sixty- seven-y ear-old president escaped assassination at close range. Jackson was convinced that Lawrence was hired by his political enem ies, the Whig s, to stop his plan to destroy the Bank of the United States. Andrew Jackson viola ted Public International Law because he denied the Creditor his just lien/settlement rights on/from the debtor. However, the bankers did not lend value (substanc e), so in actuality they had an unperfected lien. Therefore the law actually did not apply.

This created sine die, a situation in which not enough representatives were pr esent to carry on legisla tive busin ess. This was a Const itutional crisis that the newly elected president, Abraham Lincoln, had to resolve. The Introduction to Senate Report 93-549 (93rd Cong ress, 1st Session, 1973) summar izes the situation as best as possible: \"A majority of the people of the United States have lived all of their lives under emer gency rule. . . And, in the United States, actions taken by the Govern ment in times of great crises have -from, at least, the Civil War-in important ways, shaped the present phenomenon of a permanent state of national emer gency. \" From the U.S. Congressional research information available, it can be reasonably proven that when the Representatives of the Southern Com pact Party Members of the States of the Union walked out of United States in Congress Assembled on March 27, 1861, the quorum to conduct business under the social compact contract known as the United States Constitution for \"The United States of America\" was lost. Thus, the only votes that the remaining representatives of the United States in Congress Asse mbled could lawfully take, under parliamentary law, were those to set the time to recon vene, take a vote to get a quorum, and vote to adjourn and set a date, time, and place to reconvene at a later time. Instead, the remaining representatives of the United States in Cong ress Ass embled apparently abandoned the representative House and Senate of the United States without setting a date to reconve ne. Under the parliamentary procedures of said Congr ess, when this happened, Congress became sine die (pron ounced see-na dee-a; literally \"without day\") and thus, when Congress adjourned sine die, it ceased to exist as a lawful deliberative body, and thus the only lawful, Const itutional power that could declare war was no longer lawful, or in session. It can also be reasonably proven that the Representative Southern Members of the Several States of the Union, by virtue of their secession from the Union, also ceased to exist sine die, and that some state legisla tures in the Northern bloc also adjourned sine die, and thu s, all the states which were parties to creating the socia l compact contract known as the United States Const itution for \"The United States of America\" apparently ceased to exist. On April 15, 1861, so-called President, Mr. Abraham Lincoln executed an execut ive order as Commander-in-Chief, Lincoln Executive Proclamation 1, and it can also be reasonably proven that \"The United States of America\" have been ruled ever since by these same Military Executive Powers denoted as Executive Orders .

Wher eas, lawfully, no such Constitutional provisions were, or are, in place which afforded power to any of the actions which were taken which presumed to place the Union under the new form of control or desig nation as a Democra cy. The so-ca lled President, Mr. Abraham Lincoln, apparently knew that his executive orders no longer had any force under contractual Constitutional Law. So he commis sioned General Orders No. 100 (April 24, 1863), apparently as a specia l code to govern his actions under martial law and to justify the seizure of power. This further extended the laws of the District of Columbia and also fictionally implemented the provisions of Article I, Section 8, Clauses 17- 18 of the defunct contract known as the Constitution, beyond the boundaries of Washington, D.C., and illegitimately into the several States no longer united under the central agency government of the United States. General Orders No. 100, also called the Lieber Instructions and the Lieber Code, have apparently extended the laws of war and private international law into the so-ca lled Several States of the Union. The defunct agency United States gove rnment assumed power and become the presumed military conqueror of all the people to which it could bend its will by misrepresentation over the land of the former Several States of the Union. Martial rule has apparently been kept secret and has never really ended . Lincoln was assas sinated before he could complete the implementation of his plan to const itutionally, and not militarily, reform the Southern agency governments and restore the United States in Congress Assembled. Ever since, the so-ca lled socia l compact known as \"The United States of America\" has been ruled under military law under the assumed and illegitimate Commander- In-Chief -the President -and his assumed executive powers according to the policies of Executive Orders of a non-ex istent socia l compact via a military dictator type of functionary for the Money Kings and the Crown of England under the Law of Neces sity according to the princ ipals of International Public Order. Const itutional law under the original Social Compact for the Seve ral States of the Union is apparently enforced only as a matter of keeping the public peace under the provisions of General Orders No. 100 under martial (law) rule. This \"peace\" is further evidenced in the Preamble of the so-ca lled Expatriation Act of 1868. Under martial law, title is a mere ficti on, since all property belongs to the military except for that property which the Commander­ in-Chief may, in his benevolence, exempt from taxation and seizure and upon which he allows the \"enemy\" to reside. In proclaiming the first Trading with the Enemy Act by Executive Order, the illegitimate so­ called President, Mr. Abraham Lincoln (an Attorney) set in place the mean s by which the federal new agency military gove rnment could interact with all walks of life who were not 14th Amendment citizens (those non registered voters per the 15 t h Amendment of the altered status of resident alien).

Let them beware of surrendering a political power which they alread y poss ess, and which if surrendered , will surel y be used to close the door of advancement against such as they, and to fIX new disabilities and burdens upon them, till all of liberty shall be lost. \" In 1865, just before the close of the Civil War, the military dictator (and illegitimately known as the President) , Mr. Abraham Lincoln declared his new monetary policy: \"The Government should create, issue, and circulate all the currency and credits needed to satisfy the spending power of the Government and the buying power of consumers. By the adoption of these principles, the taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest. Money will cease to be master and become the servant of humanity .... The privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of government, but it is the governments' greatest opportunit y.\" Had this been implemented, it would have ushered in a worldwide economic renewal . Unfortu nately, a few weeks after its introdu ction, Mr. Abraham Lincoln was assass inated because he defied the bankers in proposing to print interest free money to pay the war debt. Thus, the government continued to operate fully under the authority of private international law dictated by the Creditor. Since the Commander-in-Chief, Mr. Abraham Lincoln, was assass inated before he could complete plans for reinstating Cons titutional agency gove rnment in the Southern States of the Union and end the martial rule by executive order, the 14th Amendment to the Const itution has further created a \"new citizenship \" or \"status\" for their expanded jurisdiction . Laws for the District of Columbia were proposed and passed by the military agency Cong ress in 1871, the District of Columbia being incorpo rated as a private, foreign corporation by The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871, and all member States of the Union were apparently reformed as franchisees or political subdivisions (see Dyet t v.

What remained of the former agency government of the repUblican form of the social compact was the private side under the rule of the banke r's, solely for their absolute and express benefit. The first attempt by the military Cong ress under the new military socia l const ruct to define citizenship was in 1866 in the passa ge of the Civil Rights Act (Revised Statutes section 1992, 8 REDEM PTION MANUA L - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 130"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"United States Code Annotated section 1). The act provided that: \"A ll persons born in the United States and not subject to any fo reign powe r are declared to be citizens of the United State s. \" And this in tum was followed in 1868 by the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, United States Code Annotated. Said Article of Amendment, the XIV, declarin g: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" At this period of time, the only people in the United States who were under the jurisdiction of the private bifurcated government of the assumed ten miles square of Washington, D.C., were the government employe es, those within the territories owned by the United States and now the former slaves. The former Citizens of the Several Southern States of the Union, now \"capture d,\" became 14th Amendment United States £itizens, the only remainder of people operating within the military socia l const ruct or the alleged Creditors who could still invoke the power over agency government through the original jurisdiction of the Republican form of government, as established by the socia l compact of the United States Constitution as the holders in due course of each and every private right, privilege and immunity, if the need became necessa ry, concerning any possi ble attempt by the new military socia l const ruct to act arbitrar ily, in any way concerning the servicing of the alleged debt du e. A new 13th Amendment was enacted December 18, 1865. The 14th Amendment was enacted July 28, 1868. Bo th Amendments were illicitly ratified by non-ele cted Representatives and Senators under Martial Law in each and every military enforced Southern State legislature, put into place by the U.S. Military by direct order of the Commander-In-Chief, through force, over the conquered territory and under Martial Law. No such State could ever obtain its freedom from the new federal socia l military rule by ratifying these new amendments as misrepresented to the people by the federal system. They were told that the troops of aggression would be removed from such territories and cessa tion of hostilities would occur once these amendments were ratified. Any contract entered under threat, duress, or coercion is null and void. According to the Rule of War (Martial Law), once Martial Law is lifted all laws, rules, regulations created or promulgated during the hostilities are null and void and the parties return to the \"status quo\" before such hostilities broke out between the parties. But then, the Constitution was not even in effect following sine die and the proclamation of martial law. It is apparent that due to the fact that the national emerg ency has never been lifted or proclaimed to be over, that the so-ca lled military social const ruct known as the United States is still in powe r under the rules of Martial Law by and through Exec utive Orders of the Commander-In-Chief, caused of necessity by sine die.

The 14th Amendment is a good example of the \"give-a- little, take a lot\" strategy that is often used, a sugar coating to a bitter pill. Sovereign People, who had assumed themselves to be among the powers of Earth, had created a social compact (a government) to guarantee them selves their right s. They secured these rights under this social compact as birthrights for their posterity (Citizens). In contr ast, the federal government created fourteenth amendment £itizenship to guarantee its power over the former Citizens by reducing them to the standing of its newly created £itizens. It seems to be taking £itizens under its protection, but at the price of servitude . Sovereigns may choose to become subjects; free men and women to become vassals. This amendment has always been contr oversia l. Many people over the years have questioned the amount of power it vests in the federal government. Some have even questioned its validity. On one occasion Judge Ellett of the Utah Supreme Court as above refer enced, remark ed: \"I cannot believe that any court, in full possession of its faculties, could honestly hold that the amendment was properly approved and adopted.\" State v. Phillips, Pacific Reporter, 2nd Series, Vol. 540, Page 941, 942 (1975) However, the most important fact about this amendment is that, although it created a new class of £itizen, it did not have any effect on Sovereign People. Both classes still exist: When the Const itution was adopted, the People of the United States were the Citizens of the several States for whom and for whose posterity the gove rnment was establi shed. Each of them was a Citizen by birthright in the State of Birth to which United States was created to protect from foreign powers at the adoption of the Constitution by the Several States of the Union and to make Uniform such protection among the States, and all free people thereafter born within one of the several States became by birth Citizens of the compact party State of The United States of Amer ica. But we know that this is not true from research in the law of contract. Anyone not signatory to the social compact or directly related as the posterity thereto, is an alien to the compact and is only allowed to assume whatever right out of neces sity to the compact to keep the peace until all power is vested in order to secure to the members such blessings unto them selves or their posterity as are necessary or opport unist ic as the need may arise from time to time ... to preserve their Freedom! Both classes of Citizenl£i tizen no longer exist except by the need of necessity, as may or may not be claimed by any particular member of the current military social const ruct. It's your right of expatriation and repatriation to emerge into a social compact to which you become signatory to, to become a Sovereign People, while it's a privilege to be a fourteenth amendment £itizen, and most importantly, it's up to you to determine which one you are, or which one you choose to be. Just remember that you \"pay\" for a privilege, whereas a right carries no obliga tion. This is at the heart of your public Declaration of Independence to a candid world by and through such social compact created to recognize your Sovereign birthright, to assume among the powers of Earth, recognized by the laws of Nature and Natur e's Creator to which you are entitled, to emerge into the Sove reign People you were created to be and which are recognized and protected within the Universal and/or International Public Order.

The private Military copyrighted UNITED STATES CODE, Title 28, 3002(15)(A), basica lly reiterates that the UNITED STATES is a corporat ion.

No - the private , corporate bottom line is profit. The municipal , public bottom line is servi ce. To replace the former service- oriented form of government with a profit-oriented form of military gove rnment, without any public knowledge or consent of the facts foisted upon the people, can only be described as treason, not only against the former social compact, but in respect to International Law, as well.

A few superficial changes by attorneys were made to the original Const itution and it was no longer the real thing. The Military Cong ress did not change the name of the document so they could claim to be reading from the Const itution.

One of the con dit ions was that the United St ates to permit the creditors to es tabl ish a new national ba nk. The bankers moved deeper into the new military socia l const ruct by the establishment of the Federal Reserve Bank in 1913 and the IRS to co llect the interest on their loans made to the UNITED STATES . The 17th Amendment, enacted May 31, 1913, was the condition for the exten sion of time which took away the States' rights to appoint members directly from its legisla tures to serve in the Senate of the United States, thereby destroying the last vestige of repUblican so-ca lled government. The 16th and 17th Amendment further reduced the States' power. The UNITED STATES adopted the mercantile system of ancient Babyloni a. With the passage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , the UNITED STATES was firmly lashed to the yoke, so that a small number of very rich men have been able to put upon all people a yoke little better than involun tary slavery itself. That yoke inevitably grows heavier with ever­ compounding intere st, and totals over $20 trillion of debt allegedly owed by all walks of life today ($80,000 per man/woman/chil d). This vast accumulation of wealth concentrates immense power and despotic economic domination in the hands of the few central bankers \"who are able to govern credit and its allotment, for this reason supplying, so to speak, the life-blood to the entire economic body, and grasping, as it were, in their hands the very soul of the economy so that no one dare breathe against their will.\" A worldwide tyranny is gradually being imposed, hidden to most, by the Money Kings. THE FIRST WORLD WAR In 1917, the people were drafted into the First World War. President Woodrow Wilson had to find a way to persua de the people to go along with an intervention in another of Europe 's wars. Although restrained to be neutral in the deadly conflict by the Neutrality Act, he sent the Navy to shepherd British convo ys across the Atlant ic. German U-boa t commanders did not take the bait and avoided contact with the U.S. destroye rs. To force the issue, a U.S. naval ship deliberately sailed into the midst of a battle between British and German naval fleets and was sunk. But when the truth was learned, Wilson had to find another way. The Lusitania was a speedy warship refitted by the British as a passe nger liner.

To ensure a successf ul provoc ation, the Lusitania was ordered to sail at 75% speed using only three of its four power ful engines. Then the naval escort was ordered away, leaving the Lusit ania vulnerable as it entered the war zone. The first torpedo hit the explosive cargo and blew the bottom out of the Lusitania. It sank in only 18 minut es. 126 innocent civilians died. Wilson now had his provocation to rally people ignorant of the true facts behind the \"War to End All Wars\" (WWI) . Deception person ified. The U.S. participation in WWI exacerbated the national debt so that it became impo ssible for us to pay it off in 1929. Wasn 't that a nice coin cidence? It also enhanced the War Powers Act that the illegitimate President, Mr. Abraham Linco ln, by Executive Order (as Commander- In-Chie f) put in place during his Presidency. This War Powers Act was re-enforced and the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 was passed to define, regulate, and punish those who were trading with enemie s, and were then required by that act to be licensed by the government to do busin ess, any busines s. (This will become more important later on.) THE GREAT DEPR ESSION : FROM SOVEREIGNTY TO SERVITUDE We all know what happened in 1929. This was the year of the stock market crash and the beginning of The Great Depr ession. The stock market crash moved billions of dolla rs from the people to the banks . This also removed cash from circulation for the people 's use. Those who still possesse d any cash, invested in high interest yielding Treasury Bonds driven higher by increased dema nd. As a result, even more cash was removed from circula tion in the general public for private use to the point where there was not enough cash left in circulation to buy the goods being produced even for the neces sities of life. Production came to a halt as excess inventory overwhelmed the market. There were more products on the market than there was cash to buy them. Prices plummeted and industries plunged into bankruptcy, throwing millions of people out of work. For eclos ures on homes, factor ies, busin esses and farms rose to the highest level in history under the so-ca lled new Milit ary Social Construct of the UNITED STATES. A mere dime was literally salvation to many families now living on the street. Millions of people lost everything they had, keeping only the clothes on their backs. In Europe, the International Bankers in 1930 decla red several social compact so-ca lled nations bankrupt, including the United States. In 1933, immediately after Franklin Delano Roose velt took office, his first act as the illegitimate Preside nt, was to publicly declare the United States bank holiday by Executive Order (as Com mander-In-Chief of the present Military Const ruct). He further went on to issue his so-ca lled Presidential Exec utive Order on March 5th, 1933 that all United States Citizens must turn in all their gold in return for Federal Rese rve Notes. This Law was passed by Congr ess on June 5, 1933. All Walks of Life turned in all their gold at that time.

No. We were still a sovereign people until that time. We just thought that we were required to turn in all our gold. Only those people living in Washington, D.C., and the 14th Amendment £itizens were so required. As soverei gns, we were not under the jurisdiction of the United States of America, which incorporated in 1871- 1872. When we turned in our gold, we just volunteered to be citizens of the jurisdiction and all their laws of the assumed ten miles square of the City of Washingt on, District of Colum bia, UNITED STATES, and/or THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, whichever you prefer to recognize as the true desig nation of such Military Social Construct then or now. The people became captured by the misrepresentation of the status of the 14th Amendment as £itize ns. Our birth records become certificate s, and thereby the title to our bodie s. They were registered at the Department of Commercial within their Bureau of Cen sus. This title to our bodies, all of our property and all of our future labor, was pledged to the International Bankers as security for the alleged money owed in bankruptcy by the original signatories to the social compact known as the Several States of the Union, \"The United States of Amer ica.\" This was done under the authority of commercial law (Babylonian law) by and through the beneficia l use of Title and/or evidence of Title. The People were not in bankrup tcy. Only the Corporate UNITED STATES was in bankruptc y, which had taken upon itself the debts of the prior socia l compact for certain power, pr ivileges and immunitie s. But with the U.S. Corporation holding the title (by and through the transfer of ownership via the definition of fungible goods) to your body and life, you are now used for colla teral to secure their national debt through birth certif icates (given by parents ignorantly and voluntarily through condition of Mind and misrepresentations of Regi stered Agents) to be entered into the Commercial Registry and pledged to the wants and needs of the Milita ry Social Const ruct's duty to service the debt owed by others at your expense.

You may still exercise your unalienable birthrig hts, an assumed among the powers of Earth, for your separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and Nature 's Creator entitle you.

By and through an adhesion contract via a newborn identification fo rm with and attached ident-a-tag number fo r commercial registration purposes, the government then made you, the real man or woman, responsible fo r that fictional entity, a fiduciary and surety fo r an artificial entity. Your artificial entity secured the National debt by and through your future performance of labor in exchange for the beneficial interest units (FRNs) which would arise from the beneficial use of the notes issued to you in excha nge for your labor perfor med.

This is the Act which formally declared the bankruptcy of the UNITED STATES. F.D.R., by Executive Order as the Commander- In-Chief of the military socia l construct, declared all people outside the militarily federa lized territories to be the enemy by illega lly altering the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1861, revised 1918. The creation of Federal Zone £itizenship was strengthened when you were told to apply for a Social Security number after 1935. The so-ca lled benefits offered by this contract were hurriedly and voluntarily entered into when the Social Security Act was signed into law because, once again, the true facts regarding the outcome of accepting such benefits were withheld due to misrepresentation and the lack of full disclosure. Further, contracts were to be entered into and license to be applied for-all voluntary actio ns. We, unknowingly, were entering into lifelong servitude to receive the benefits of the Lord of the Manor, the so-ca lled Military Social Construct Act, for and under the Order of the Money Kings and the Crown of England as the Exchequer of the Vatican Treasury. We had desce nded into feudal vassalage not seen since before the signing of the Magna Charta (1215 ) without even recognizing it. The so-ca lled President, Mr. Franklin Delano Roose velt, then called all the Governors into Washington D. e. for a conference. This was the beginning of the States losing the remainder of any semblance of their former Sovereignty. It was not until 1944 that the Corporate States lost all of their power over the Corporate United States with the Buck Act. With this Act, the states became, essentially, 14th Amendment £itizens as well. This Buck Act completed the destruction of the corporate states having any power to protect them selves against usurpation by the Military Social Const ruct known as the United States Government . The corporate states now fell under the jurisdiction of Wash ington, D.C., as mere super vised units under the so-ca lled federal system. Strangely enough, on October 28, 1977, H.J.R.-192 was quietly repealed by public law 95- 147. 91 Stat. 1227. \"The joint resolution entitled 'Joint resolution to assure uniform value to the coins and currencies of the United States' approved June 5, 1933 (31 U.S.C. 463), shall not apply to obligations issued on or after the date of enactment of this section.\" The reason for the repeal of HJR-192 is somewhat obscu re. After 44 years of uncha llenged implementation, this public policy was clearly established by custom, usage and participation in the credit system by the so-ca lled American public. Those of us operating on the privilege of limited liability, via the public credit, are still bound unless such liability is discha rged back to the original source of the debt generated by the issua nce of money of account under the copyrighted military script known as Federal Reserve Notes. The adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.e.e.) by all entities allowed them to use the desig nated copyrighted name of each and every State in 1964, along with a number of other like laws and Acts, were incorporated within the military social const ruct of the sub-multi­ jurisdictional franchised venues in the military socia l const ruct known as the United States.

COURTS SHIFT FROM COMMON LAW TO EQUTY AND ADMIRALTY COUR TS Under the social contract known as the Constitution, based on Common Law (com mon between those signa tory, their posterity and their Agents of Trust, Profit and Honor) , the Republican form of Government of the Continental United States provides for legal cases : at Law, in Equity, and in Admiralty. (1) Law is the collective organization of the individual right to lawful defense as it operates over the creators of such social compact. It is the will of the majority, which created such compact, the organization of the natural right of lawful defense. It is the subst itution of a common force for individual forces in a reality were such individual powe r is limited by Unity, to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do but in harmony with each member of the whole to secure the benefits of the one and at the same time for all signa tory thereto : to protect themselves, their posterity, their libert ies, and propert ies; to maintain the right of each, and to cause justice to reign over all willing to declare to each such pledge as necessary to accept and carry out the obligations of such compact. Since people, singularly, cannot lawfully use force against any people s, liberty, or property of another people in most cases due to circumsta nces naturally lacking any contractual foundational societal nexus so-to-speak, the common force-for the same reason-cannot lawfully be used to destroy the people, liberty, or property of any people or groups of people s. Law allows you to do anything you want to, as long as you don't infringe upon the life, liberty or property of anyone else. Law does not compel performance with a remedy for breach of the International Public Order, whether locally or other wise. Toda y's so-ca lled laws (ordinan ces, statute s, acts, regulat ions, orders, precep ts, etc.) are often erroneou sly perceived as law, but just because something is called a \"law\" does not necessa rily make it law. [There is a difference between \"legal\" and \"lawful.\" Anything government does is assumed legal , but it may not be expressly lawful.] (2) Equity is the jurisdiction of compelled performance (for any contract you are a party to) and is based on what is fair in a particular situat ion. The term \"equity\" denotes the spirit and habit of fairness, justness, and right dealing which would regulate the interc ourse of men with men.

Equity has no REDEM PTION MANUA L - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 142"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"criminal aspects to it. (3) Admiralty is compelled performance plus a criminal penalty, a civil contract with a criminal penalty outside of any social compact guaranteeing any pr ivileges or immunities from such application of Admiralty jurisdiction. By 1938 the gradual procedural merger between law and equity actions (i.e., the same so-ca lled courts had jurisdiction over legal, equitable, and admiralty matters) was recognized and accepted. The military social const ruct was bankrupt. It now was owned by its creditors (the international bankers) who controlled everything-the Congres s, the Executive, the courts, all the States and their legislatures and execut ives, all the land, and all people through misrepresentation and an absolute fraud perpetrated from condition of mind. This was brought about by those exercising an unjust persuasion over all Walks of Life not only locally but upon a planetary scale as well. Everything was mortgaged in support to the so-ca lled national debt. They had gone from being sovereigns over government to subjects under government, through the use of negotiable instruments to discha rge people 's debts with limited liability, instead of paying people 's debts at common law with gold or silver coin according to the original mandate of the now non-existent Constitution of the social compact formally known as \"The united States of Amer ica.\" A change in their sy stem of law fr om public law to private commercial law was recognized by the Supreme Court of the United St ates in the Erie Railroad vs. Thompkins case of 19 38. In the sa me year, the procedures of Law were off icially blended with the procedures of Eq uity . Prior to 1938, all U.S. Supreme Court decisions were based upon public law-or that system of law that was allegedly controlled by the social compact's Const itutional limitation. Since 1938, all U.S. Supreme Court decisions are based upon what is termed public policy. Public policy concerns commercial transactions made under the Negotiable Instrument's Law, which is a branch of the International Law Merchant. This has been codified into what is now known as the Uniform Com mercial Code. This system of law was made uniform throughout the fifty franchise sub-st ates by the cunning of the Military Social Const ruct of the UNITED STATES in Cong ress Asse mbled. In offering grants of negotiable paper (Federal Reserve Notes), which the Milita ry Congress gave to the fifty sub-states of the former Union for educa tion, highwa ys, health, and other purpo ses, Congr ess bound all the former States of the Union into a commercial agreement with the Federal Military United States (as distinguished from the Continental United States). The fifty States accepted the \"benefits\" offered by the Federal Military United States as the consid eration of a commercial agreement between the Federal United States and each of the corporate States. The corporate States were then obligated to obey the Congress of the Federal United States. They became super vised units of the military federal system and had to assume their portion of the equitable debts of the Federal United States to the international banking houses, for the credit loaned . The credit which each sub-st ate received, in the form of federal block grants, was predicated upon equitable paper.

In 1976, the Military Social Const ruct's \"United States in Congress Assembled\" took away any semblance of law or justice left within their court system. All law today is now construed, constructed and made up by the judge as it happens before your very eyes. Common law has almo st disappeared from the courts. They took away any control or authority anyone, whos oever, might, or could, have had over the court system. This has been well hidden from all of Walks of Life. Many of the people entering into such courts often wonder why and how the courts can simply override the laws that are paraded before them as extant and used by them in their paperwork to seek remedy to state a just claim of action for governmental abuse. It's very simple now that we know how they do it. They operate on the words 'construe and construct ,' with unrestricted liberty per Senate bill 94-201 and 94-381. A simple word such as 'in' changed to 'at' as in 'at law' or 'in law' has a totally separate mean ing. For exampl e: If you are in the river, you are wet, you can swim, etc., but if you are at the river, you might enjoy a refre shing picnic , play base ball or run races. See the difference a simple word can make ? The attorneys often change this word when they answe r your motions ­ in addition to many others to direct the crossing over of their duty 'at law' in attornment owed to the Chamberlains of the Exchequer of the Treasury of the Vatican. It will pay you in dividends to read the answers of attorneys to your so-ca lled paperwork. Compare what they say the case law says to the actual case law itself . You'll discover that they have actually changed the words therein. You might say this would appear to be unlawf ul. No, not, according to the U.S. Code. As you see, they can now const rue and const ruct any law or statute to mean whatever they decide it means for their benefit. You don't know any of this. You think they are railroading you in a kangaroo court . No, they are 'legal' in what they do . They usually follow the law to the letter; Their law, private law, the law of contract, which you know nothing about. This law is called contract law.

Many who read H.J.R. 192 (on page 160) fail to comprehend its extraordinary significance, so a bit of introduction is in order. Its six paragraphs have done more to change the legal and financial landscape of Amer ica than perhaps any six paragraphs written prior to, or since, June 5 th 1933. It repre sents no less than the whol esale confis cation of the wealth of the people -the biggest theft in history (see Executive Order June 5, 1933 ). All property and labor into perpetuity was pledged to the International Banking Cartel. Note that the word manipulators are in top form here-the word \"bankruptcy\" is never ment ioned. The Military Congr ess spent all of 38 minutes 'debating' this bill. Evidently it would have been far more painf ul for those who are called Americans to accept the second offer that was being extended by the bankers . Cons idering the ease of obtaining incontrovertible evidence about the bankruptc y, it is shocking to learn that the majority of Americans are completely unaware that the bankruptcy ever occurred, how they were drawn into it, or how it has become embedded in their lives.

Let's now examine the events that led up to the emer gency of 1933. In 1929, the Milita ry Social Const ruct known as the United States entered the Great Depr ession. At that time, most of the Major Economic and Military Powers in the world were also in a depression. You may recall that those who call themselves Americans were permitted to own gold and that their currency was backed by gold and silver. People could deposit their gold in Federal Rese rve banks . Then the bank would give them a note that they could use to withdraw their gold. Due to the panic in the economic markets after the crash of 1929, people were trying to withdraw the funds from the banks in the currency form of silver and gold. The so-ca lled President, Mr. Herbert Hoover asked the Federal Reserve Board of New York for a recommendation on how to deal with the situation. One might wonder why their President, Mr. Herbert Hoover, would ask the Federal Reserve Board for advice. But, a review of the \"Federal Reserve\" article will show that the Federal Reserve System was in control of the Military Social Construct known as the United States as its Fiscal Agent over the Monetary Policies of the United States then. We are still under the same power. The Federal Reserve Board adopted a re solution to respond to their President, Mr. Herbert Hoover's, request. \"Whereas, in the opinion of the Board of Directors of the Federal Bank of New York, the cont inued and increasing withdra wal of currenc y and gold from the banks of the count ry has now created a national emergency ... \" [Herbert Hoover private papers of March 3, 1933] The Federal Reserve board is stating that the run on banks is causing a \"national emergency.\" Since their currency was backed by gold, why would it cause a national emer gency for people to REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 149"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"hold the gold rather than the banks?

Since the banks didn't have the gold the people were demand ing, the banks needed protection. So, the Federal Reserve Board went on to propose their President, Mr. Herbert Hoover, issue an Executive Order based upon the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 as follows: \"Whereas, it is provided in Section 5(b) of the Act of October 6, 1917, as amend ed, that 'the Preside nt may investigate, regulate, or prohib it, under such rules and regulatio ns as he may prescribe by means of licensur e or otherwi se, any transaction in fo reign exchange and the ex port, hoarding, melting, or ear markings of gold or silver coin or bullion or curren cy, ***\"' . [Herb ert Hoover private papers of March 3, 1933, emphasis added] Their President, Mr. Herbert Hoover, declined to issue the order, but then Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was inaugurated as their President, on March 4, 1933. In his inauguration speech, he requested that Congr ess grant him emergency powers equal to those he might have in times of war to allow him to deal with the crisis. On March 5, 1933, he issued Proclamation 2038 requesting a Special Session of Congress beginning on March 9, 1933, to deal with the banking emer gency. Then, on March 16, 1933, the illegitimate President, Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, issued Proclamation 2039 to indicate to the Congr ess what kind of emergency powers he was asking for. This proclamation had exactly the same wording as that propo sed by the Federal Reserve Board. But the Proclamation had no authority until Congress met to give him the required authority. One might well ask how the Federal Reserve Board could have such influence over their acting President. Some researchers specu late that the depression was engineered by the Federal Reserve System and the International Bankers that it represents [see the essay \"Secrets of the Federal Reserve\" for information about the link between the Federal Reserve System and International Bankers]. The bankers ' motive was to further conso lidate their power. They already controlled the monetary policy of the UNITED STATES. It is also specula tion that the military socia l const ruct known as the U.S. government was told that it had no choice in cooperating with the Federal Reserve Board, (international bankers) or the depression would remain indefinitely. Under such political black mail, their President, Congr ess, and Courts were willing to acquiesce to the demands of the (Money Kings) banke rs.

The significance of this change will soon become apparent. Since the bankers didn't have gold to pay out, the alleged President, Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt used Proclamation 2039 and 2040 along with the provisions of 12 USC § 95b to create a banking holiday. This can be verified if we read the definition for \"Banking Holiday of 1933.\" \"Bank holiday of 1933.

A license is something that grants authority to do something that would otherwise be illegal. Trading (or conducting busines s) with the enemy (so-ca lled Americans on assumed American soil) was made an illegal activity unless licensed. Their President, Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's, papers revealed that the government will grant the license. \"The Secretary of the Trea sury will issue licenses to banks which are memb ers of the Federal Reserve System whether national bank or state, located in each of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank cities, to open Monday morning. \" [President Roosevelt's papers] Another provision passed on March 9, 1933 giving Federal Reserve Agents the authority to act as Agents of the U.S. Department of Treasury.

The bankers didn't have the money the people were demanding, so the bankers sought protection. In order to do this, the people had to be declared the enemy.

Since all money was gold and silver certificates and all of this money had to be turned in, the people were left without any money of exchange in Law. \"During this banking holiday it was at first believed that some fo rm of script or emergency currency woul d be necessary fo r the conduct of ordinary business. We knew that it would be essential when the banks reopene d to have an adequate supply of currenc y to meet all possible demands of deposi tors. Consid eration was given by govern ment officials and vario us local agencies to the advisability of issuing clearing house certificates or some similar fo rm of local emergency currencies. On March 7, 1933, the Secretary of the Trea sury issued a regulation authori zing clearing houses to issue demand certificates against sound assets of the banking institu tions. But this authority was not to become effe ctive until March 10th. In many cities, the printing of these certificates was actuall y begun. But after the passage of the Emergenc y Banking Act of March 9, 1933, (48 Stat. 1) it becam e evident that they woul d not be nee ded because the act made possible the issue of the nece ssary amount of emergency currenc y in the fo rm of Federal Reserve Bank Notes which could be based on any sound assets owne d by the bank s.\" [Roosevelt 's papers, bold emphasis added] So we see that their President, Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevel t's papers admit that the Emergency Banking Act made it possi ble to issue emergency currency that was based upon the Assets of the banks rather than upon gold or silver (remove the U.S. from the gold standar d). The \"emergency currency\" was \"Federal Reserve Bank Notes.\" Federal Reserve Notes are still used today. Next we will see what was to be used to back up the \"Federal Reserve Bank Notes.\" \"Upon the deposit with the Treasurer of the United States, (a) of any direct obligatio ns of the United States, or (b) of any notes, drafts, bills of exchange or bankers acceptance s acqui red under the provisions of this Act, any Federal Reserve bank making such deposit in the manne r prescribe by the Secretary of the Treasury shall be entitled to receive from the Comptro ller of the currency circulating notes in blank, duly REDEMP TION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 153"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"registered and count ersigned. \" [Emergency Banking Act of March 9, 1933, section 4, Public Law 89-719] Later in 1933, the House of Representatives passed a joint resolution to \"Suspend The Gold Standard and Abrogate The Gold Clause\" which says in part: \"That (a) every provision cont ained in or made with respect to any obligation which purpor ts to give the obligee a right to require payment in gold or parti cular kind of coin or curr ency, or in as amount of mone y of the United States measured thereby is declared to be against publ ic policy; and no such provision shall be cont ained in or made with respect to any obligation herea fter incur red. \" [House Joint Resolution 192, June 5, 1933, emphasis added] Since this measure was passed as a joint resolution, it does not have the force of law. You will notice that the resolution uses the term \"public policy.\" We frequently hear the term \"public policy\" used. But what does it mean ? \"policy. The general principles by which a government is guided in its management of public affairs. \" [Black's Law Dictionary, 7th Editio n] ''publ ic policy. Broadly, principles and standa rds regarded by the legislatu re or by the courts as being of fundamental concern to the state and the whole of society. \" [Black 's Law Dictionary, 7th Edition] Public policy is not the same thing as public law! \"public law. The body of law dealing with the relations between private individuals and the government , and with the structure and operation of the government itself; ... A statute affecting the general public ... \" [Black 's Law Dictionary, 7th Edition] This is a rather startling admi ssion on the part of Congress. They are saying that what they are doing by refusing to pay the federal debt in gold is not according to the law but rather a public policy. So, we see that the currency was no longer backed by gold (even if it is only a public policy) . The new currency was Federal Reserve Bank Notes. These notes were, and still are, backed by \"direct obligations of the United States\" which are Treasury notes. They are also backed by bank \"notes, drafts, bills of exchange, and bank acceptances.\" This last group is notes (loans) that Federal Reserve member banks were holding on loans they had made to people and institutions. So the public or private debt instruments of the banks were considered Assets to be deposited in the Treasury in excha nge for \"circulating notes.\" Excerpts can further prove this from the Congressional Record during the debate over the Emergency Banking Act of 1933.

Is that true?\" [Mr. Stiggle] \"Insofa r as the provisions of this section are concern ed, yes. \" \"[Mr. Britain] \"From my observations of the bill as it was read to the House, it woul d appear that the amount of bank notes that might be issued by the Federal Reserve System is not limited. That will depend entirel y upon the amount of collateral that is presented from time to time from exchange fo r bank notes. Is that not correct ?\" [McPhadin] \"Yes, I think that is correct. \" It should be clear that the currency was no longer backed by gold but by a promise to pay on various debt instruments (loans to private individuals or businesses and the governme nt). So, there were no Hard Assets backing up the currency, only promises. In the case of government loans, the colla teral would be the ''full faith and credit of the United States.\" This is very strong evidence that the federal government was bankrupt at that time. If it weren 't, the federal government would still be willing to pay its obligations in gold and the currency would still be backed by gold. Who did the federal government owe money too? The obvious answer is the Federal Reserve Bankers, who were holding the \"direct obligations of the United States.\" The Federal Reserve is a private bank. It is not part of the gove rnment. The logica l conclusion is that the government is bankrupt and the Federal Reserve is the Creditor. The transition from a gold backed currency to one that was not backed by any hard asset was very swift. The Federal Reserve Board proposed it to their President, Mr. Herbert Hoover, but it took until a more acceptable agent resided within their presidency of the military socia l const ruct on March 3, 1933 before it was implemented into law on March 9, 1933. This is very swift action indeed. How can we account for such a rapid change in circums tances? We have not uncovered (at least thus far) direct evidence of undue influence by the Federal Reserve (international bankers ). However, their position as Creditor to the UNITED STATES does provide a plausible explanation as to why things changed so rapidl y. The final topic to explore ... the impact of this on so-ca lled American £itizens. REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 155"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Impact of Bankruptcy So, let's clarify the difference between real money of exchange (backed by a hard asset) and a paper money of account as a subst itute. Federal Reserve Notes (FRNs) are nothing more than promissory notes backed by UNITED STATES Treasury securities (T-Bills) - a promise to pay the debt to the Federal Reserve Bank (FR B). The FRB allows the military federal government const ructs to create debt that causes inflation through devaluation of the so-ca lled curren cy. Inflation occurs whenever there is an increase of the supply of a so-ca lled fiat money supply in the economy without a corre sponding increase in the money of exchange (gold and silver or some other specie s) backing. Inflation is an invisible form of taxation that irrespons ible gove rnments inflict on their subjects known as citize ns. The Federal Reserve Bank has access to an unlimited supply of FRNs. The Federal Reserve Bank only pays for the printing costs of new FRNs. We also need to understand that there is a fundamental difference between \"paying\" and \"discharging\" a debt. To pay a debt, you must pay with value or substance (i.e. gold, silver, barter or a commodi ty). With FRNs, you can only discharge a debt. You cannot pay a debt with a debt currency system. You cannot service a debt with a curre ncy that has no backing in value or substance. No contract in common law is valid unless it involves an exchange of \"good and valuable consideration.\" What does the federal military government const ruct have to offer the Federal Rese rve III payment of its debts? The next quote answers this quest ion. [Patton] \"The money will be worth 100 cents on the dollar because it is backed by the credit of the Nation. It will represent a mortgage on all the homes and other property of all the people in the Nation.\" [Congressional Record, March 9, 1933, emphasis added] We now see that the federal gove rnment has offered all of the private property in the people to its Creditor, the Federal Reserve. The gove rnment can also offer the labor of the people of the nation [see the article on the \"Federal Reserve\" system to see how the IRS is used to collect money for the Federal Reserve]. This quote is evidence that the military social government const ruct, \"hypothecated\" all of the present and future properties, assets, and labor of their \"subjects\" to the Federal Reserve System. \"Hypothecate. To pled ge property as security or collateral fo r a debt. Gener ally, there is no physical trans fe r of the pledged property to the lender; nor is the lender given title to the property; though he has a right to sell the pledged property upon default. \" [Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Editio n] So, the military social gove rnment const ruct has pledged (mortgaged) our property as collateral to their Creditor, the Federal Reserve.

Prior to 1913, when the Federal Reserve Act was passed, most so-ca lled Americans owned property and had Allodial titles. There are !!Q property taxes in this situat ion. When we buy property now, we are not given an Allodial title. Instead we are given a title deed, which is not fee simple absolute. To better understand, let's look at the definitions of these terms. \"Allodial.

A fee simple absolute is an estate limited absolutely to a man and his heirs and assignees forever without limitation or condition.

Like any other debtor, their federal military government const ruct had to assign colla teral and security to their Creditors as a condition of the loan. Since their federal milita ry government const ruct didn't have any assets, they assigned the private property of their \"economic slaves,\" the so-called UNITED STATES £itizens, as colla teral against the un-p ayable federal military debt. They also pledged the unincorporated federal military territor ies, national parks and forests, as colla teral against the federal military debt (for evidence of this see the United Nations plaques in most of major so-ca lled national parks).

If you don't believe it, find a canceled check that you have written to the I.R.S. Turn it over and on the back you will see that the check was endorsed for deposit in a Federal Reserve account. So, your check to pay your \"income tax\" was deposit ed into the Federal Reserve, a private bank, who is the acting fiscal Agent of the Creditor for the Crown of England as the Exchequer of the Vatican to service the federal military gove rnment const ruct's !!!!-payable debt. In summary, the Federal Military Gove rnment Const ruct is bankrupt. The Federal Rese rve Bankers are the Fiscal Agent for the Creditor to the Federal Military Government Construct. All of your property and labor have been pledged to lillY the debts of the Federal Military Government Const ruct. As a UNITED STATES £itizen, you are held liable for the so-ca lled (military) public debt, and the service agent of the Fiscal Agent (Federal Rese rve System) known as the Internal Revenue Service (I.R.S.) is the collection agency for the Federal Rese rve System.

It allowed the so-called president to \"prohibit, restrict, license or regulate\" any transactions by £itizens or corporations of the enemy countries operating within the U.S. during WWI. Conv eniently, it was not revoked, even though the war and emergencies ended. On 24 March 1918, the Act was amended and its scope greatly expanded by adding \"hoarding, melting\" to the description of foreign exchange and by deleting the word 'such' from two places in \" ... and he may require any [such] person engaged in any [such] transactions ... \" In the early 1920's, the Federal Reser ve's loose money policy encouraged a lot of people, especially farmers , to over-extend themselve s. When the Federal Rese rve contracted the money supply during the late '20s, it initiated an economic colla pse that was sustained and deepened by the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, which raised rates as high as 49%, purportedly to act as a price support for Amer ica's farmers . Their Presiden t's, Mr. Herbert Hoover's, interventions [helped to] create a world-wide recession. On 6 March 1933 their President, Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, issued Proclamation 2039: under the authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act -- \"[T]he President. .. may prohibit .. , by means of licenses, or otherwise .. , the export [or] hoarding of gold or silver coin\" and ceased redeeming the legal tender (Bills of Credit) for gold coin (lawful money).

Through their deliberati ons, the Federal Reserve was conceived. Its purpose would be to protect its members from competition and ensure their monopoly of the money suppl y. Together, these money giants developed the strate gies needed to convince both Congress and the public that this privatized cartel was actually an agency of the United States government, operating in its best interest. The men, themselv es, already had vast powe r of their own. It's not surprising that their ploy for even more was successful. Note the players and their credenti als: I. Nelson W. Aldrich, Republican \"whip\" in the Senate, Chairman of the National Monetary Commission, business associa te of J.P. Morgan , father-in-law to John D. Rockefeller, Jr.; 2. Abraham Piatt Andrew, Assist ant Secretary of the United States Treasury; 3. Frank A. Vanderlip, president of the National City Bank of New York, the most power ful of the banks at that time, repre senting William Rockefeller and the international invest ment banking house of Kuhn, Loeb & Compa ny; 4. Henry P. Davison, senior partner of the J.P Morgan Company ; 5. Charles D. Norton, president of J.P. Morga n's First National Bank of New York; 6. Benjamin Strong, head of J.P.

Warburg, a partner in Kuhn, Loeb & Company, a representative of the Rothschild banking dynast y in Engla nd and France, and brother to Max Warburg who was head of the Warburg banking consortium in Germany and the Nether lands. In the February 9, 1935, issue of the Saturday Evening Post, an article appeared written by Frank Vanderl ip. In it he said: \"Despite my views about the value to society of greater publicity for the affairs of corporat ions, there was an occasion, near the close of 1910, when I was as secretive - indeed, as furtive - as any conspirator. ..

The servants and train crew may have known the identities of one or two of us, but they did not know all, and it was the names of all printed together that would have made our myst erious journey signif icant in Washington, in Wall Street, even in London. Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else all our time and effort would be wasted. If it were to be exposed publicly that our particular group had got together and written a banking bill, that bill would have no chance whatever of passa ge by Cong ress.-- As with all cartels, it had to be created by legis lation and sustained by the power of government under the deception of protecting the consumer.\" As John Kenneth Galbraith explained it: \"It was his [Senator Aldrich's] thought to outflank the oppo sition by having not one central bank but many. And the word bank would itself be avoided. \"--Galbraith says \" ... Warburg has, with some justice, been called the father of the system.\" Professor Edwin Seligman, a member of the international banking family of J. & W. Seligman, and head of the Department of Econom ics at Columbia University, writes that \" ... in its fundamental features, the Federal Reserve Act is the work of Mr. Warburg more than any other man in the country.\" Another brother, Max Warburg, was the financial adviser of the Kaiser and became Director of the Reichsbank in Germany. This was, of course, a central bank, and it was one of the cartel models used in the construction of the Federal Reserve System. The Reichsbank, incidenta lly, a few years later would create the massive hyperinflation that occurred in Germany, wiping out the middle class and the entire German economy as well. A. Barton Hepburn of Chase National Bank was even more candid. He said: \"The measure recognizes and adopts the principles of a central bank. Indeed, if all works out as the sponsors of the law hope, it will make all incorporated banks together joint owners of a central dominating power.\" And that is about as good a definition of a cartel as one is likely to find. Anthony Sutton, former Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution for War, Revolution and Peace, and also Professor of Econom ics at California State University, Los Ange les, provides a somewhat deeper analysis. He write s: \"Warburg's revolutionary plan to get American Society to go to work for Wall REDEMP TION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 165"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Street was astonishingly simple. Even today, ••• academic theoreticians cover their blackboards with meaningless equations, and the general public struggles in bewildered confusion with inflation and the coming credit collapse, while the quite simple explanation of the problem goes unacknowledged and almost completely not understood. The Federal Reserve System is a legal private monopoly of the money supply operated for the benefit of the few under the guise of protecting and promoting the public interest. \" The real significance of the journey to Jekyll Island and the creature that was hatched there was inadvertently summarized by the words of Paul Warburg 's admiring biographer, Harold Kellock: \"Paul M. Warburg is probably the mildest-mannered man that ever personally conducted a revolution. It was a bloodless revolution: he did not attempt to rouse the populace to arms. He stepped forth armed simply with an idea. And he conquered. That's the amazing thing. A shy, sensitive man, he imposed his idea on a nation of a hundred million people.\" The attendees to Jekyll Island, however, were comparatively speaking, mere choir boys to the grand family of International banking, Amchel Meyer Rothschild and his 5 sons. The Rothschild family built a banking empire throughout Europe by staging wars and manipulating econom ies. \"The fe w who can understand the system (check mone y and credits) will either be so interested in its profits, or so dependent on its fa vors, that there will be no opposi tion fr om that class, while on the other hand , the great body of the people mentally incapable of comprehending the tremendous advantage that capital derives from the system, will bear its burdens without complaint , and perhaps without even suspecting that the system is inimical to their interests. \" Rothschild Brothers of London In this essay we will see how the Federal Reserve System was created, why the so-ca lled governments would want a central bank, and the effects it has had on many so-called nation s. We will begin our discus sion with an overview of money. We would define money as anything which is accepted as a medium of excha nge or accountin g. Money can be classi fied into the following four forms: commod ity mone y, recei pt mone y,fiat mone y and fractional mone y. We will describe each of these in tum. Before money existed, people used barter to get what they wanted from others . Barter can be defined as a system in which one thing is exchanged fo r somet hing else of like valu e. A barter exchange is not monetary in nature since each item has value rather than being recognized as a medium of exchange to be used later for something else. The items being bartered have intrinsic value. This conc ept of intrinsic value is a key to understanding the various forms of money. REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 166"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"COMMODITY MONEY Commodity money is the oldest form and has its roots in the barter system. As each ancient society evolved, there were always been a few items that were more commonly used in barter than other commodities. This is because they had certain characteri stics, which made them attrac tive to almo st everyo ne. Eventuall y, these items were traded in large measure because they represented a storehouse of value, which could be exchanged at a later time for something else. At this point, they ceased being barter and became money. They had become a medium of exchange. Since the medium of exchange was a commodity with intrinsic value, it is called commodity money. Common examples of commod ity mone y include ornaments, colored seashells, unusual stones, cattle, sheep, corn, wheat or other foods. Eventually, when man learned how to refine metals and craft them into tools, the metals themselves becam e valuable. Initially these metals were traded as commodity money due to their intrinsic value. But they had some additional characteristic that made them very desirable as money: it was not perishable, it was portable, and it could be precisel y measur ed. Money, in its fundamental form and function, needs to be a storehouse and measure of value. In this way, it is the measure by which all other things of value can be compared. The ability to precisely assay metal s in purity and weight makes them ideally suited for this function. Men on every continent and throughout history have chosen metal s for the ideal storehouse and measure of value. Gold is the one metal that has been selected by centuries of trial and error to represent this storehouse and measure of value. Silver has run a close second to gold throughout history. There seems to be enough gold in the world to keep its value high enough for useful coinage. Gold is less abundant than silver but more abundant than platinum. It is a commodity in great demand for purpo ses other than money. It is sought for both industry and ornamental purposes, which assures its intrinsic value. The purity and weight of gold can be precisely measured. So, gold meets each of the equipments for money. Some might argue that gold is inappropriate as money because there is too little of it in the world to sati sfy all the needs of modem commer ce. We would suggest that this is not the case. It is estimated that approximately 45% of all the gold mined since the discove ry of so-ca lled America is in various vaults of the many social const ructs known as government[Money and Man: A Survey of Monetary Experience, Elgin Groseclose, p. 259]. It would be reasonable to estimate that 30 % can be found in jewelry, ornaments and private hoards. So it would be hard to argue that if 75% of the gold found since Mr. Christopher Columbu s is available, that it is too rare to serve as money. We would also suggest that the amount of gold in the world does not affect its ability to serve as money, it only affects the quant ity used to measure any given transactio n. Governments could easily mint gold coins in almost any size to create smaller value . Using gold (or any other metal) to serve as money virtually guarantees the stability of a commodity money system. This is true because there is a fixed amount of it in existence. When the quantity of so-ca lled money expands without a corresponding increase in goods, the effect is REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 167"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"a reduction in the purchasing power of each monetary unit. In other words, the quoted price and the price as expressed in terms of monetary units of good incr ease. The real price, in terms of its relationship to all other goods, remains the same. This is what we call inflation. The price of goods does not go up but rather the value of the money goes down . To illust rate this point, let's look at some price and wage statist ics. In 1913, the year the Federal Reserve Act was passed, the average annual wage in so-ca lled America was $633. The average exchange value for gold that year was $20.67 per ounce. This meant the average worker earned the equivalent of 30.6 ounces of gold per year. In 1990, the average annual wage was $20,468. But the average exchange rate for gold had gone up to $386.90 per ounce. The average worker therefore earned the equivalent of 50.9 ounces of gold per year. That is an increase in wages as measured in gold of only 73% while the increase in dollars was 3,233%. The 73% increase repre sents less than 1 % per year over the period. While this has happened, there has also been a steady increase in purchasing power (about 1 % per year) that has resulted in gradual improvements due to technology. This improvement in techn ology is the real reason for the improvement in the standard of living over the last 100 years . RECEIPT MONEY The development of receipt (paper) money came as a result of necessity. When a man accumul ated more coins than he required for daily purchas es, he needed a safe place to store (warehou se) them . Golds miths filled this need since they usually had vaults to store (warehou se) the gold they used to create or repair jewelry for their customers . When customers stored their gold coins, they were given a receipt that entitled the owner to withdraw their gold at any time. Eventu ally, it became common for owners to endors e his receipt to a third party who, upon presenting the receipt, could withdraw the gold. These endorsed receipts where the fo reru nners to our modern checks. The final development stage occurred when several smaller receipts were issued rather than one large one with each imprinted pay to bearer upon demand. It became increasingly common for these paper receipts to be used as money of account. So you see that receipt as money of account was fully backed up by a commodity (gold coins) that had intrinsic value in money of exchange . FIAT MONEY Fiat money is money which is declared legal tend but is not backed up by anything such as gold or silver. Its two characteri stics are that it is not backed up by anything of intrinsic value and it is decreed legal tender. Legal tender means that the so-ca lled gove rnment issues a law requiring everyone to accept the currenc y in commerce. Since the money really is worthless, the only way the so-ca lled government can get it accepted is by forcing the people to do so, often under criminal penalties. Their own Federal Reserve Notes are fiat money. If you read the article What Banks Don 't Want You To Know, you will see how we got to this condition in so-ca lled Amer ica. Intere stingly enough, the Massachuse tts colony was only the second gover nment in the history REDEMP TION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 168"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"of the world to issue fiat money (China being the first) . Shortly after the currency was re leased, the state experienced 1000% inflation . Other colonies quickly followed the Massa chusetts example with similar resul ts. Connecticut had inflation of 800% and the Carolinas had 900% inflat ion. At the beginning of the Revolutionary War the total (fiat) money supply was $12 mi ll ion. In 5 years time, an additional $425 million had been printed. This means the money supply had expanded by 3500% and the original Continental dollar was trading at less than a pennies worth of its original valu e. There is a typical pattern that emerges when fiat money is used. The government artificially expands the money supply through the issua nce of more fiat currency. This is followed with legal tender laws to force the acceptance of the fiat money. Next, all the gold and silver disappears into private hordes or it is paid to foreign traders who insist on real money of exchange for their wares. Often, when the inflation is high, the government will have to issue new bills valued at multiples of the old bills. This usually leads to discontent and civil disobedience (through barter). The last stage of each cycle is rampant inflation and economic chaos. Fiat money is used by so-ca lled governments to obtain instant purchasing powe r for them without increasing taxes. But it is not without cost. Some complain that we should not burden anyo ne's children with anyone 's future public debt. It is true that all children will have the burden of the interest payments on the debt. But there is also a very real initial cost that all pay. The cost is paid by all of people in the present through a decline in our purchasing power. It is exactly the same as a tax, but one that is hidden from our general cognitive view si mply because the purchasing power g enera lly is not affected in any great dramatic decrease to raise any perceptible cognitive aware ness to the dilemma that we collect ively face by the use of fiat money. FRACTIONAL MONEY The fourth kind of so-ca lled money, fractional money, also came as a result of people storing their gold coins with goldsm iths. The goldsmiths observed that very few of their depositors ever wanted to remove their gold coins at the same time. Withdrawals seldom exceeded 10% to 15% of their stock piles of precious metal s. They hated (coveted -10 t h Commandment Viola tion) to see all that gold just sitting there and not being used. So, they began to lend (steal) some of the gold out by issuing more receipts. It seemed perfectly safe to lend between 80% or 85% out, which meant they would still have reserves to pay any demand for withdrawal . In the beginn ing, the gold's owner was not even aware that their gold had been loaned. As the owners became aware of the pract ice, the goldsm iths began to offer to share the interest they earned on the loans wi th the go ld' s owner . But the entire practice didn' t make such sense . The gold wa s not rea lly available to be loaned. The gold was providing the value behind the receipts. One might sa y that the receipt was a proxy for the gold. Si nce the gold owner and the one who borrowed the gold both had receipts, they bot h had proxies for the same gold. If you give someone your proxy vote at a stock hol ders meeting, you ca n't al so show up and vote . The sa me principle ap plies to the receipts (proxies) for the gold coins. REDEMP TION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 169"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"So here is how fractional-reserves work. You deposi t your gold and get a receipt that you use as money of account. The gold smith (banker) issues loans in the amount of 85% of the amount you deposit. The borrower is also given receipts for the amount he borrowed. That means there are 85 % more receipts than there is gold to back it up. Thus, the gold smith (banker acting as a Bank) created 85 % more money of account and placed it into circulation through the borrowers. They issued phony receipts and artificially expanded the so-ca lled money supply. So, at this point the certificates are no longer 100% backed by gold. So, they only represent a fraction of their face value. Thus, the receipts become what are called fractional money (of account) and the process that created them is called fractional-reserve banking. This same process causes inflation of pr ices, or said another way, deflation of the value of that which is assumed to be money of exchange, but in reality, only money of account created by a ledger entry from which a receipt is given on a note for a future promise to pay in lawful money of exchange or whatever is due according to the note. One might say that the gold smiths (bankers) created so-ca lled money out of nothing by a ledger entry. But this is not quite true. What they really did was created money of account out of debt (note). That's a neat trick that I bet you wish you could do. The old saying goes that money (of exchange) doesn 't grow on trees. Well, the bankers have done one even better, mone y (of acco unt) grows out of debt. This is money (of account) that it cost the bankers absolutely nothing to create and they earn all that interest (the financial portf olio [ledger] creating by instruments of accounts receivable from notes [shetar] created by loaning a percentage of the true value of species in exchange for accounting of a greater portion in return without any risk on the principal, which eventually was replaced solely on such collateral to secure the note so that the principal was removed as the true value of the exchange which in tum made the true Creditor the borrower (since he/she is the only party to the agreement which secured the note from making the so-ca lled loan). We can look at the fractional money and see that it is a transitional form that exists between receipt money and fiat money. It has som e of the characteri stics of both. As the fraction becomes smaller, the less it resembles receipt money and the more closely it resembles fiat money. When the fraction reaches zero, the transition is complete. There is no example in history where men, once they had accepted the concept of fractional money, didn't reduce the fraction lower and lower until it eventually became zero. The transition from fractional money to fiat money cannot occur without the participation of the so-called government through a mechanism that is called a centr al bank. This happened in the military social const ruct known as the UNITED STATES between 1913, when the Federal Reserve Act was passed, and 1933 when Military Cong ress adopted the Commander-In-Chiefs Executive Orders and went off the gold standard. This fractional-reserve banking system is in part how their Federal Reserve System operate s. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors create s money of account by loaning it to the so­ called federal military government const ruct (fractional money) by purchasing government military (bonds) securities (debt). In so doing, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors becomes the Creditor of the federal military government const ruct.

But that is an outright empty statement and a misrepresentation of the true facts backing the ''full faith and credit of the United States,\" unless they mean the blind acceptance by all Walks of Life to accept as Constitutors to pay the debts of and belonging to another like a co-signer for a debt which was incurred with no right of use established, concerning the goods or power conveyed by the agreement.

So their military socia l government const ruct has pledged our labor and our property to pay their debt through misrepresentation by and through their Public Institutions of Learning. The Federal Reserve Cartel is very candid in their publica tions that we have a fiat money system. Their own publications tell the story ! Currency cannot be redeemed, or exchanged, for Treasury gold or any other Asset used as bank ing. The quest ion of just what Assets back Federal Reserve Notes has little but bookkeeping (Ledger Entry) signifi cance. [I Bet You Thought, by Federal Reserve Bank of New York, p. 11, emph asis added] Banks (bankers) are creating money (of account) based on a borrower 's promi se to pay (the IOU). Bankers then create more money of account by monetizing so-to-speak, the private debts of busin ess and individuals based on their future perform ance (labor) of servicing the so-ca lled loan (Note). [I Bet You Thought, by Federal Reserve Bank of New York, p.19, emphasis added] In the so-ca lled Military Social Construct known as the United States, neither paper currency (money of account) nor the ledgering of paper depo sits, have true value as commodities. Intrinsically, a dollar bill is just a piece of paper. Deposits are merely book (Ledger) entries. Coins do have some intrin sic value as metal , but generally far less than their face amount due to diver's weig hts and measures being used to adulterate the species for profit or hoarding. What, then, makes these instrume nts, checks, paper money, and coins acceptable at face value in payment of all debts and for other monetary uses. Mainl y, it is the confidence of the people (their full faith and Credit) that they will be able to exchange such money (of account) for other financial Assets and real goods and service whenever they choo se to do so. This partly is a matter of law; currency has been desig nated legal tender by the military socia l gove rnment const ruct, that is, it must be accepted. [Modern Money Mechanics, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, revised October 1982, p. 3.] Modem monetary systems have a fiat base, literally money by decrees, with depos itory institutions, acting as fiducia ries, creating obligation against themselv es, with the fiat base acting in part as reser ves.

Howev er, a forceful explanation as to why money (of account) is accepted is that the federal government requ ires it as payment fo r tax liabilities . Anticipation of the need to clear this debt creates a demand for the pure dollar. [Money, Credit and Velocity, Review, May, 1982, Vol. 64, No.5, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, P.25.] The last two sentenc es from the above quote alludes to the military socia l federal const ruct's debt and the fact that all so-called U.S. £itizens have been obligated to pay that debt. If one thinks about the debt based money system, you will come to realize that their total so­ called money supply is backed by nothing but debt. This is hard enoug h to fathom, but it's even harder to grasp that if everyone paid off his or her debt, there would be no mone y left in exist ence. Something else to consider is that the trillions of dolla rs in circulation appears to repre sent a tremendous amount of assets, but someone owes every bit of this money in lawful form of species currency. If all the bank loans were paid , no one could have a bank deposit, and there woul d not be a dollar of coin or currenc y in circulatio n. This is a staggering thought. People are completely dependent on the commercial (bankers) banks. Someone has to borrow every so-ca lled dollar (money of acc ount) people have in circulat ion, cash, or credit. If the bankers create ample synthetic money, people are prosperou s; if not, people starve. People are absolutely without a permanent (species) money system . When one gets a complete grasp of the picture, the tragic absurdity of the peop les' hopele ss situation is almost incredible, but there it is. [100% Money, Irving Fisher, p. xxii. This quote appears in the forward to the book. The author is quoting Robert Hemphill who was the Credit Manager of the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta.] Given this system , it's not hard to imagine that the Federal Reserve Banks is not interested in all these loans being paid off as the following quotes show . A large and growing number of analysts, on the other hand, now regard the national debt as something useful, if not an actual blessing. [They believe] the national debt need not be reduced at all. [The National Debt, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, pp.2, 11] Debts , public and private, are here to stay. It plays an essential role in economic processes . What is required in not the abolition of debt, but it's prudent use and intelligent management. [Two Faces of Debt, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, p. 33] The reason the Federal Reserve Cartel is not interested in paying off the debt is because they make huge profits from the intere st payment. But let's consider the morality of earning interest on these loans. If you were to rent an asset from someone, you would see the logic of paying him or her a rental fee. The rental fee reimburses them for the potential income they could have made through other opportu nities they missed while you were using the asset. Interest payments on a loan are nothing more than fees for renting the money. But in the case of a debt based money system, the money was created when the loan was approved and it was credited to your account. In th is situat ion, you are not usi ng the lende r' s asset. He created the asset with the stroke of a pen or an §lliY on a computer or within a ledger acc ounting book REDEM PTIO N MANUA L - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 172"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"�. Why should anyone collect a rental fee (interest) on that stroke or entry? While this system may be lega l (because the so-ca lled military socia l government const ruct has granted them the sole authority to create so-ca lled money on whim), it is certainly not moral. This leads to the next question, which is where does the so-ca lled money come from to allegedly pay the interest on the debt that created the so-ca lled money? One might think that the so-ca lled money would have to be borrowed since it would appear that all so-ca lled money is created by debt. But this position does not take into consideration the exchange of value (borrowed money) for labor. If you took out a loan of $10,000 with payments of $900 per month, about $80 of each payment is interest. You earn the so-called money to allegedly pay the interest with your labor. That's why people say that about the only thing the military social government const ruct has to offer in exchange for the public debt is peopl es' labor. They collect the benefit of peop les' labor in the form of income taxes. Bank of England To adequately understand our Federal Reserve System, we must look at the Bank of England, which was founded in 1694. The bank was the brainchild of a Scotsma n named William Paterson. His idea was to charter an artificial person (a corporation) that would loan the Crown government money, but instead of being repaid at a fixed future date, it would receive perpetual (never ending, as in the loan is never paid off) interest. The plan for the Bank of England contained the following Z points. • The Crown government would grant a charter to form a bank • The bank would be given a monopoly to issue bank notes that would circulate as England's paper currency • The bank would create so-ca lled money of account out of nothing with only a fraction of its total curre ncy backed by gold coins (fractional money) • The bank would then loan the so-ca lled government all the money of account it needed • The money of account created for so-ca lled government loans would be backed by bonded government IOUs (future promi se to pay) Although the so-ca lled money of account would be created out of nothing and would cost nothing to create, the so-ca lled government would pay interest on the so-ca lled money of account. Simply put, payment was based solely on the full faith and credit of the people to accept the medium of exchange for services and goods, which in turn was based upon the ability of the so-called government to enforce the so-ca lled beneficial use of such accou nting, as well as their ability to enforce the control of the money supply by a Private Cartel, not subject to the control of the government, because the so-called government had given up its Creditor status in exchange for a debtor position on the promise of unlimited discharge of its debt, if the new Cartel (Money Kings) were allowed to collect interest on the so-ca lled money of account circulating backed by the peop le's labor colle cted through the beneficia l use of such accounting REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 173"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"on each and every people required to keep records as the account of the use thereof. This scheme effectively made each people the Crown 's account ant and debtor at the same time. This same scheme is perpetuated by the so-ca lled military socia l const ruct known as the United States upon all walks of life through the same fraudulent misrepresentations of the so-ca lled government. Plus, the so-ca lled government IOUs (Bonds) would also be considered as reserves for creating additional loans of money (of account) or marketable debt notes for private commerce. These loans also would earn interest. So, the bankers would earn double interest on the same scheme of creating fictiona l nothing based upon ledger entries backed by marketable debt and the willingne ss of the so-ca lled gove rnment to back the scheme up with the force of law and the people 's lack of cognizance regarding the true outcome of such economic control over all walks of life. This ignorance is the result of the Science of Right Reasoning, exercised with the same governmental controls that exist over money, that are perpetuated in the centers of educ ation from womb to tomb, over all the peopl e, to keep them from seeing the true picture or fully understanding the position in which the government had placed all people. We have become DEB TOR SLAVES on the Plantation Called Earth. The so-ca lled gove rnment IOUs (BON DS) were called annuities. These annuities, along with the notes and bills of the banke rs, were expressly exempted from all commo n-law restrictions upon the exchange of persona l property. These annuities, notes and bills represented public debt. The initial holdings of the bankers consi sted of £1,200,000 in annuities. By 1714, the total debt held by the bankers had grown to £36 million. By 1719, the public debt had grown to £50 million. That meant a perpetual tax burden of interest payments on the backs of the people. But it also meant that £50 million of absolutely liquid property had been created. Prior to these events , all property had been tangible real property that was not liquid. [Novus Ordo Seclorum: The Intellectual Origins of the Constitution, Forrest McDonald, p.117 -118] The model of the Bank of England influenced the founders of the so-ca lled socia l compact known as The United States of Amer ica. Mr. Alex ander Hamilton, in particular, believed that public debts should be funded in a manner simila r to the Bank of England. The system Mr. Alexander Hamilton envis ioned departed from the British system in only two significa nt ways. The first � was designed to overcome what many saw as a fatal flaw in the British system, namely the inherent tendency to expand the debt endlessly. The last several decades have proven that we have failed miserably in this respect. The second one was desig ned to use financial means for achieving political, economic and social ends. [McDonald, p.139] This second change seems to be one of the guiding principles behind what their so-ca lled military social government const ruct does today . If you look at most of the so-ca lled monetary policies of military United States, you can see this principle evident everywhere in its accounting of marketable debt IOUs (Bonds). Mr. Alexander Hamilton 's plan called for the creation of a so-ca lled national (central) bank. Most of the capital of this bank would be in the form of certificates of public debt (Bonds) (today we have many forms of public debt) . He felt that it would be safe to base most of such capital on so-ca lled government debt, since the bank was expected to be immen sely profita ble. Therefore, the so-ca lled government paper money of account would be good as gold. He felt the national (central) bank was important for two reasons. First, it would be a ready source of short- REDEMP TION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 174"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"term loans to the so-ca lled government. This is the primary attraction for a national (central) bank in the modem world. Second, real money (species currency) and liquid capital were in short supply in the colonies and it would take too long to accumulate an adequate supply by being frugal. The essences of this second benefit is that money of account is created in the present, not based upon past savings, but out of the expectation of future earnings to pay the debt. Another part of Mr. Alexander Hamilt on's plan was that the national (central) bankers would be privately owned. He saw this as a restraining measure, since the stockholders would act cautiou sly in order to protect their own intere sts. [McDonald, p.140] The current Federal Reserve Banks are privately owned. but it does not provide any such const raint. There is some evidence to indicate that Mr. Alexander Hamilton 's plan was back by James Rothschild [The Secrets of the Federal Reserve, Eustace Mullins, p.5]. In 1791, Mr. Thomas Jefferson came out again st Mr. Alexander Hamilton 's plan for a central bank. He objected on the following grounds : the subscribers would form a corporation whose stock could be held by aliens; that this stock would be transmitted to a certain line of successor; that it would be placed beyond forfeiture and escheat; that they would receive a monopoly on banking, which was again st the laws of monopoly; and that they would have the power to make laws, paramount to the laws of the government. We shall see that Mr. Thomas Jefferson's fears were well founded because this is exactly what happened. TAXES ARE OBSOLETE Most of the so-ca lled money that the federal military government const ruct spends comes from fiat money (of account) created by the Federal Reserve Bankers, in the form of receipts of paper monetized (marketable) debt under the guise known as Federal Reserve Notes illicitly referred to as dollars or dolla r bills. This being the case, one might well ask why people still have taxes . That's an excellent quest ion. There are several reasons that come to mind. First, if the so­ called government stopped taxing us, people would begin to wonder where the alleged money came from, eventually realizing that it was just created from nothing. Then it would dawn on them that inflation was really a form of taxation. Second, taxes are a tool used by the elitist social planners to control many aspects of the peopl es' lives. This is evident by the complexity introduced into the tax code as a means to carry out social engineering by the military socia l government const ruct. To confirm these assertions, we can tum to an article written by Mr. Beards ley Ruml , the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The article appeared in the January 1946 issue of American Affa irs magazin e. Mr. Beardsley Ruml suggest ed that taxes were obsolete. At the beginning of the article, the magazine editor summarized his position. His thesis is that, given control of a central banking system and an inconvertible currency [a currency not backed by gold], a sovereign national government is finally free of money worries and need no longer levy taxes for the purpose of providing itself with reven ue. All taxation, therefore, should be regarded from the point of view of social and economic conse quences. [Taxes for revenue Are Obsolete, by Beardsley Ruml, American Affairs, January, 1946, p. 35] REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 175"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Mr. Beardsley Rum l's article suggests that there are only two reasons to have taxes. First, it combats a rise in the general level of prices. He suggests that if the money is left in the hands of the people, they will spend it and cause a rise in price s. Taxation removes the money from the hands of the people so that this does not occur. He says it this way: The dollars the governm ent spends become purchasing power in the hands of the people who have received them. The dollars the government takes by taxes cannot be spent by the peopl e, and therefore, these dollars can no longer be used to acquire the things which are available for sale. Taxation is, therefore, an instrument of the first importance in the administration of any fiscal and monetary policy. [Ibid., p. 36] The other purpose for taxation, according to Mr. Beardsley Ruml , is to redistribute wealth from one class of people to another. This may be done in the name of social justice or equality, but this puts the so-ca lled government in the position of trying to control (theft by illicit force) the economy as master planners. The second principle purpose of so-ca lled federal taxes is to attain more equality of wealth and of income than would result from economic forces working alone. The taxes which are effective for this purpose are the progressive individual income tax, the progressive estate tax, and the gift tax. What these taxes should be depends on public (law?) policy with respect to the redistribution of wealth and of income . These taxes should be defended and attacked in terms of their effect on the character of all Walks of Life, not as revenue measures. There is an additional reason for income taxes that was not mentioned by Mr. Beardsley Ruml . The income tax paid by any U.S. £itizens is depos ited directly into the Federal Reserve System. If you thought your alleged money was used to fund the operation of the so-called government, you were wron g. Most people feel an obligation to pay their fair share due to indoctrination via public educational centers. But the IRS is nothing more than the collection agency for the Federal Reserve System. Your taxes go directly to help pay the interest on the so-ca lled national debt and directly enrich the shareholders of the Federal Reserve System. Your labor is converted into money for their benefi t. Remember that interest is being charged on money that is being created out of thin air that cost them absolutely nothing to create . HOW IT WAS CREATED Now let's tum our attention to how the Federal Reserve System came into being. In 1907, an event occurred which became known as the Money Panic of 1907. The panic was caused because there was not enough money in circulation for everyone to pay their bills and employers to pay wages. It resulted in large -scale lay-of fs because there was not enoug h money to pay the employees. A study of the panics of 1873, 1893, and 1907 found that these panics were the result of the international bankers. The panic resulted in a public outcry for the military socia l government const ruct's monetary system to be stabilized . The so-ca lled President, Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, signed a bill in 1908 that created the agenc y known as the National Monetary Commission. The so-ca lled Senator, Mr. Nelson Aldrich, was appointed to the head of the Commission that was charged with finding a solution to the problem [Mullins, p.1]. By 1910, REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 176"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Mr. Nelson Aldrich had not released a report to the government. On November 22, 1910, a group of men met at the Hoboken , New Jersey train station. These men boarded a private car that was bound for Brunswick, Georgia. Their eventual destination was a private hunting lodge on Jekyll Island, off the coast of Georgi a. Eight men were in this group. They included Senator, Mr. Nelson Aldrich and his private secretary, Shelton ; Mr. Abraham Piatt Andr ew; Frank Vanderlip, Henry P. Davison, Charles D. Norton, Benjamin Strong, and Paul M. Warburg [Mullins, p.1]. Abraham Andrew was the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury and Special Assistant to the National Monetary Commission. Frank Vanderlip was President of the National City Bank of New York, the most powerful banker at that time. Frank Vanderlip represented Willia m Rockefeller and the International banking house of Kuhn, Loeb and Company. Henry P. Davi son was a Senior Partner of J.P. Morgan Company . Charles D. Norton was the President of the First National Bank of New York that was owned by J.P. Morgan. Benjamin Strong was head of J.P. Morgan Bankers Trust Company. Paul Warburg was a Partner in Kuhn, Loeb and Company of New York and was representing the Rothschild banking dynasty. These men repre sented what was known as the Money (Kings) trust. The group also represented the two most powerful banking cartels in Amer ica: the Morgan Group and the Rockefeller Group and they also represented the two most powerful banking cartels in Europ e: the Rothschild Group and the Warburg Group. When all of these are combined, they represented an estimated one-fourth of the world 's wealth [The Creature from Jekyll Island, G. Edward Griffin, p. 6.] The Money (Kings) Group had journeyed over a thousand miles, cloaked in secrecy, to draft banking and currency legisla tion which the National Monetary Commission had been ordered to prepare in public. Why the secrecy? Because the public would have been outraged to think that this Money (King s) Group was drafting the very legisla tion which was supposed to protect the public from privatized Money (Kings) Trusts. What were the main points of the plan that the Private Cartel Group, which represented one­ fourth of the wealth of the world, created on Jekyll Island? • The plan would create a central bank that would fulfill the typical functions of a central bank, among them creating fractional and fiat money • The Federal Reserve Bankers would consist of a system of 12 banks. The creation of 12 regional banks would disguise the fact that the Federal Reserve System is a central bank • Private Individuals who would profit from the ownership of shares would own the central bank • The bankers would be allegedly controlled by Cong ress and would be answerable to the government, but the majority of the directors were to be chosen, directly or indirectly, by the bankers in the association of banks REDEMP TION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 177"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"• The President of the United States would appoint The Governors of the Federal Reserve Board.

There were a few stories run about the meeting, but it was largely covered up. When those who were involved were asked about it, they would deny that it had taken place or they would say it was a duck hunting trip. Much later, after the Federal Reserve Act was passed, some of the members were a little more forth-coming with information, but for the most part they were still fairly quiet. The reason for the cover-up was obvio us. It was clearly understood that if the public found out who drafted the legisla tion, such legisla tion would never become law. After the plan was drafted on Jekyll Island, an all-out effort was put forth to get the proposed legisla tion passed in so-ca lled Military Congr ess. A group of bankers contributed $5 million to fund a favorable public relations campaign to sell so-ca lled Americans on the plan. The so-ca lled President, Mr. Woodrow Wilson was also enlisted to support the plan. Three of the top universit ies, Princeton, Harvard, and the University of Chicago, came out in support of the plan. Two of the leading campaigners for the plan were Professor from the University of Chicago. This university had been endowed by John D. Rockefeller (one of the forces behind the plan) with nearly $50 million. [Mullins, p.l0-ll]. When the plan had been introduced to the Military Cong ress, so-ca lled Congressman, Charles Lindbergh (father of the famous aviator), had this to say in testimony before the Committee on Rules on December 15,1911: \"Our financial system is a fa lse one and a huge burden on the people.

He said that a lot of opposit ion had developed in the ABA to the plan by this point and that the supporters of the plan never asked for another endorsement. Congressman, Carter Glass, summarized the reasons for opposmg the Senator Nelson Aldrich's, Plan. • The plan lacked adequate government or public control of the bank ing mechani sms it would set up • The plan gave most of the voting control to the large banks in the system. These were the banks that were controlled by the Money (Kings) Trust • The plan had an extreme inherent danger of causing inflation of the currency • The bond-funding portion of the plan gave the false impression that the system would cost the government nothing • The plan contained great danger of a banking monopoly • The plan would, in fact, set up a central bank that would fulfill all the typical functions of a central bank.

Both parties included a monetary reform bill in their platform. The Repub licans had the Senator Nelson Aldrich's Plan that had been denounced as a Wall Street Plan. The Democrats had the Federal Reserve Act. Neither party told the public that the plans were almo st ident ical. William Taft seemed a shoe-in for re-election. But then Theodore Roosevelt threw his hat in the ring under the Bull Moose Party. Theodore Roosevelt was well financed and had enormous press coverage, more than the other two candidates combined . As a former so-ca lled Republican President, it was obvious that Theodore Roosevelt would cut into votes that would have gone to William Taft. The bankers were financing all three candidate s, so they would win no matter who was elected. Later Congressional testimony showed that Kuhn, Loeb Company ; Felix Warburg (not a U.S. resident but Paul Warburg 's brother) supported Willia m Taft; Paul Warburg and Jacob Schiff supported Woodrow Wilson; and Otto Kahn supported Theodore Roosevelt [Mullins, p.19]. It seems likely that the identification of the Senator Nelson Aldrich's, Plan as a Wall Street Plan would make it difficult to pass in Democratically (Party) controlled Military Cong ress, whereas a successf ul Democrat candidate, supported by a Democrat Congr ess, would be able to pass a central banking plan. Theodore Roosevelt was used to split the William Taft vote because the bankers doubted William Taft could get the Senator Nelson Aldrich's Plan passed. The final electoral vote in the 1912 race was Woodrow Wilson 409, Theodore Roosevelt 167 and William Taft 15. In 1912, after the Democrats had taken control, they held their own hearing on banking reform. They were held under the House Banking and Currency Committee, which was now chaired by Arsene Pujo of Loui siana. A Special Coun cilman, Samuel Untermyer, appointed by Chairman, Arsene Pujo, conducted the hearin gs. The hearings drug on for five months and produced over 6000 pages of testimony. Samuel Untermyer refused to allow either so-ca lled Senator LaFollette or Congressman Lindbergh to testify, even though it was the pressure that they had exerted which caused the hearings to be held. Both men strongly opposed a central bank. Samuel Untermyer was a specialist in banking issues, but he refused to ask any of the bankers who testified any tough questions. He didn't ask about the system of interlocking directorates through which the banking industry was already contro lled. He didn't ask about international gold movements which were known to be a major factor in the money panics of 1873, 1893, and 1907. He also didn't ask about relationships between so-ca lled American bankers and those who controlled the central banks of Europe. Samuel Untermyer did not seem concerned that many major international banking houses had branches on Wall Street and already controlled substantial portions of Wall Street activity, even though this fact was well­ known on Wall Street. The sham hearing ended without a single, well-kn own opponent to a central banking plan testif ying. The two most influential men involved in the passage of the Federal Reserve Act were Paul Warburg and so-ca lled Colonel, Edward Mandel House. Paul Warburg was the Chief Architect of the plan that was developed at the Jekyll Island retreat. Here is a quote from Paul Warburg when he testified before the House Banking and Currency Committee in 1913: \"1 am membe r of the banking house of Kuhn, Loeb Com pany. 1 came over to this count ry in 1902, having been born and educated in the banking business in Hambur g, Germany, and studied banking in London and Paris, and have gone all over the world.

The Aldrich Plan cont ains some things which are simpl y fu ndamental rules of banking. Your aim in this plan [the Federal Reserve Act] must be the same centralizing of reserves, mob ilizing comm ercial credit, and getting an elastic note issue. \" [Mullins, p.21] The so-ca lled Colonel Edward Mandel House, was in agreement with Paul Warburg on plans for a central bank, including provisions that would severely limit control by the government . Here's a quote from him illustrating this point : \"I am also suggesting that the Central Board be increased from fo ur members to five and their terms length ened fr om eight to ten years. This woul d give stability and woul d take away the power of a Preside nt to change the personnel of the board during a single term of office. \" [Roosevelt, Wilson and the Federal Reserve Law, Col. Elisha Ely Garrison, p. 337, emphasis added] The so-ca lled Colonel Edward Mandel House 's phrase, \"Take away the powe r of a Preside nt,\" is significa nt. Later on, these so-ca lled Presidents would find themselves helple ss to change the direction of the military socia l government const ruct because they did not have the power to change the composition of the Federal Reserve Board by attaining a majority of like­ minded people during their term of office. Colonel Garrisons' book also revealed the role that Paul Warburg and the International banking family of Rothschild played in the central banking plan. Paul Warburg is the man who got the Federal Reserve Act together after so-ca lled Senator Nelson Aldrich's Plan aroused such nationwide resentment and opposit ion. The mastermind of both plans was no other than Baron Alfred Rothschild of London. To further understand Colonel Edward Mandel House's view, one must look no further than a book he authored in 1911, entitled, \"Mr. Phili p Dru, Administ rator.\" B.W. Huebsch of New York publi shed the book anonymou sly. It is suppose to be a fictional work, but is actually a detailed plan of the future condition of the so-ca lled military socia l government const ruct of the United States. It predicted the passa ge of graduated income tax, excess profits tax, unemployment insurance, social security and a flexible currency system. In short, it outlines the plans that were followed by both the administrations of the so-ca lled Presidents, Mr. Woodrow Wilson and Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In 1955, Westbook Pegler, a colum nist for the Hearst Publications, wrote an article about Colonel Edward Mandel House and his book. One of the institutions outlined in the book entitled, \"Mr. Philip Dru, Admin istrator, \" is the Federal Reserve System.

He was able to get many of the socialist ideas outlined in his book implemented into law. Among them were an old-age pension, laborer 's insurance compensation, cooperative marke ts, a federal reserve system, cooperative loans, and national employment burea us. The relationship between Colonel Edward Mandel House and the acting President, Woodrow Wilson was chronicled in the book entitled \"The Strangest Friend ship in History, Woodro w Wils on and Col. House\" by George Sylvester Viereck. The author asked Colonel Edward Mandel House about the purpose of Wilson and House. Colonel Edward Mandel House responded, \"To translate into legis lation certain liberal and progr essive ideas.\" From this quote, it should be evident that Paul Warburg, an Agent of the International bankers as Kuhn, Loeb Company, is one of the most influential of this group. It is obvious from this quote that there is little difference between the Senator Nelson Aldrich's Plan and the Federal Reserve Act. It is also obvious that Paul Warburg is lobbying for a central bank that has the power to issue currency, known as elastic notes. Paul Warburg did a lot of work behind the scenes to get the plan passed. We have already seen evidence that the International bankers will go to extraordinary measures to get what they want. There is some evidence to indicate that the power ful International bankers who gave us the Federal Reserve System will stop at nothing to have the power of a central bank solely in their hands alone . Three acting American Presidents have expressed concern over central banks issuing currenc y. Each of these acting Presidents have been assassinated. The so-ca lled President Abraham Lincoln planned to issue non-in terest bearing notes he called Greenbacks. The so-ca lled President, James A. Garfield made a pronouncement on currency problems just before he was killed. And the acting President, John Fitzgerald Kennedy planned to issue Federal (United States) Notes without using the Federal Reserve Notes or involving intere st just before he was killed. It would be difficult to prove that the International bankers were involved in these assassinations, but it is a very strange coincidence that presents more than a shadow of reasonable doubt that the assassi nations could not have been done by any other Group of People than the International Bankers . Who else would have had the power and influence, both outside and inside of the military social government const ruct, to successfully cover-up events as well as has been done? On September 18, 1913 the Colonel Edward Mandel House's version of the Federal Reserve Act passed by a vote of 287 to 85. On December 19, 1913, the so-ca lled Senate version of the bill passed by a vote of 54-34. But there were over 40 differences between the bills. The opponents to the bill in both houses were lead to believe that there would be no further action until after the Christmas break. So they did not organi ze. As the so-ca lled Congressmen prepared to leave Washington, supporters of the bill quickly took advantage of the situat ion. In a single day, all of the disputes about the bill were ironed out in conference committee and the bill was brought to a vote. The bill was passed on December 22, 1913 in the so-ca lled House of Representatives by 282-60 and the alleged Senate by 43-23. Some of the bill's most vocal critics had already left Washington.

The acting President appoints acting Secretary of the Treasury, William McAdoo (the President 's son-in-la w), actin g Secretary of Agriculture, David F.

The selection of New York was a foregone conclu sion, since it was the center of finance in the so-ca lled United States. The City of Richmond, Virginia was also selected, evidentl y as a payof f to so-ca lled Congressman Carter Glass for his role in the passa ge of the bill.

This decision, which is legally sound, has the effect of declaring all private mort gages on real and personal property, and all U. S. and State bond s held by the Federal Reserve, Natio nal and State Bank s, to be null and void. This amounts to an emancipation of this so-called Nation from persona l, national and state debt purportedly owed to this banking system. Every so-ca lled American owes it to himself, his so-ca lled country, and to the people of the world, for that matter, to study this decision very caref ully and to understand it, for upon it hangs the question of freedom or slavery. On May 8, 1964, Mr. Jerome Daly executed a Note and Mortgage to the First National Bank of Montgomery, Minnesota, which is a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneap olis. Both Banks are privately owned and are a part of the Federal Reserve Banking System. In the spring of 1967, Mr. Jerome Daly was in arrears $476.00 in the payments on this Note and Mortgage. The Note was secured by a Mortgage on real property in Spring Lake Township in Scott County, Minnesota. The Banker foreclosed by advertisement and boug ht the property at a Sheriff's Sale held on June 26, 1967. Mr. Jerome Daly made no further payments after June 26, 1967 and did not redeem within the 12 month period of time allotted by law after the Sheriff's Sale. The Bank brought an action to recove r the posses sion of the property to the Justice of the Peace Court at Savage, Minne sota. The first 2 Justices were disqualified by Affidavit of Prejudice; the first by Mr. Daly, the second by the bank, and a third judge refused to handle the case. It was then sent, pursuant to law, to Martin V. Mahon ey, Justice of the Peace, Credit River Township , Scott County, Minnesota, who presided at a Jury trial on December 7, 1968. The Jury found the Note and Mortgage to be void for failure of a lawful consideration and refused to give any validity to the Sheriffs Sale. Verdict was for Mr. Daly with costs in the amount of $75.00. The acting President of the Ba nk, Mr. Lawrence V. Morgan, admitted that the Ba nker created the money and credit upon its bo oks by which it acquired or gave as consideration for the Note: that this was standard banking practice, that the credit first came into exist ence when they created it; that he knew of no United States Statutes which gave them the right to do thi s. This is the universal practice of these banks . Mr. Lawrence V. Morgan appeared at the trial on December 7, 1968 and was perceived to be candid, open, dir ect, experienc ed and truthf ul. He testified to 20 years of exper ience with the Ba nk of America in Los Angeles, the Marquette National Ba nk of Minneapolis and the Plaintiff in th is case. He seemed to be familiar with the operations of the Federal Reserve System. He freely admitted that his Bank created all of the Money or Credit upon its books with which it acquired the Note and Mortgage of May 8, 1964. The credit first came into existence when the Bank created it upon its books by ledger entry. Further, he freely admitted that no United REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 185"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"States Law gave the bank the authority to do this.

The admission of Bills of Credit upon the books of these private corporations, for the purposes of private gain is not warranted by the Constitution of the United States and is unlawful. No compla int was made by the banker that the bank did not receive a fair trial. From the admi ssions made by Mr. Lawrence V.

The following pages present the rulings for the original plead ing, the appeal, and the testimony given at Mr. Jerome Daly's disba rment proceedings brought by the Minnesota State Board of Law. Justice Martin V. Mahoney, who heard the case, handed down the two opini ons attached and included herein. The appeals determinations are by far the most stunning. Its reasoning is sound. It will withstand the test of time. This is the first time the question has been passed upon in the United States. I predict that this decision will go into the history books as one of the great documents of so-ca lled American history. It is a huge cornerstone wrenched from the temple of Imperialism (Money Kings) and planted as one of the solid foundation stones of Liberty. FORWARD BY ASSO CIATE JUSTICE BILL DREXLER The \"Credit River Decision\" handed down by a jury of 12 on a cold day in December, in the Credit River Township Hall, was an experience that I'll never forget. The Chief Justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court had phoned me a week before the trial and asked me if I would be an associa te justice in assist ing Justice Martin V. Mahoney since he had never handled a jury trial before. I accepted, and it took me two hours to get my car running in the 22 below zero weather. I got to the court room about 30 minutes before trial, and helped get the wood stove going, since the trial was being held in an unheated store room of a general store . This was the first time I met Justice Martin V. Mahoney, and I was impressed with his no nonsense manner of handling matters before him. My job was to help pick the jury, and to keep Mr. Jerome Daly and the Attorney representing the Bank of Montgomery from enga ging in a fist fight. The court room was highly charged, and the Jury was all business. The banker testified about the mortgage loan given to Mr. Jerome Daly, but then Mr. Jerome Daly cross examined the banker about the creating of money \"out of thin air.\" Mr. Jerome Daly asked the Bank President, \"If you were just opening up your bank and no REDEM PTION MANUA L - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 186"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"one had yet made a deposit, and I came into your bank, and wanted to take out a loan of $18,000.00, could you loan me that money? When the Bank President said, \"Yes\" I thought the jury would faint. Mr. Jerome Daly than said, \"Does this mean that you can create money out of thin air?\" And the Bank President said, \"Yes, we can create money out of thin air.\" Justice Martin V. Mahoney then said \"IT SOUNDS LIKE FRAUD TO ME\" and everybody in the court room nodded their heads indicating that they agreed with Justice Martin V. Mahoney. I must admit that up until that point, I really didn't believe Mr. Jerome Daly's theory, and thought he was making this up. After I heard the testimony of the banker, my mouth had dropped open in shock, and I was in complete disbeli ef. There was no doubt in my mind that the Jury would find for Mr. Jerome Daly. Mr. Jerome Daly had taken on the bankers, the Federal Reserve Banking System, and the money (Kings) lenders , and had won. It is now twenty eight years since this \"Landmark Decision,\" and Justice Martin V. Mahoney is quoted more often than any Supreme Court justice ever was. The money (Kings) boys that run the \"private Federal Reserve Bank\" soon got back at Justice Martin V. Mahoney by poisoning him in what appeared to have been a fishing boat accident (but with his body pumped full of poison) in June of 1969, less than §. months later. Both Mr. Jerome Daly and Justice Martin V. Mahoney are truly the greatest men that I have ever had the pleasur e to meet. The Credit River Decision, as it is known, was and still is the most important legal decision ever decided by a J!!!:y. Bill Drexler.

After waiting for one hour for the Bank or its representative to appear the Court received the testimony of Defendant bearing upon the issue of the validity of the Federal Rese rve Notes. Now, Theref ore based upon all the files, records and proceedings herein and the evidence offered, this Court makes the following Findings of Fact, Conclu sions of Law, Judgment and Determination with reference to the allowance of an appeal. FINDINGS OF FA CT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, JUDGMENT AND DETERMINA TION. 1. That the Federal Reserve Banking Corporation, is a United States Corporation with twelve (12) banks throughout the United States, including New York, Minnea polis and San Francisco. That the First National Bank of Montgomery is also a United States Corporation incorporated and existing under the laws of the United States and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, and more specif ically, of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapo lis. 2. That because of the interlocking control activities, transactions and practic es, the Federal Rese rve Banks and the National Banks are for all practical purpo ses, in the law, one and the same bank . 3. As is evidenced from the book: \"The Federal Reserve System; Its Purposes and Functions, \"; (lst Ed.) pages 74 to 78 and 177 and 180, put out by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C., 1963, and from other evidence adduced herein, the said Federal Reserve Banks and National Banks create money and credit upon their books and exercise the ultimate prerogative of expanding and reducing the supply of money or credit in the United States. See especia lly page 75 of the Manual. This creation of money or credit upon the Books of the Banks const itutes the creation of fiat money by bookkeeping entry. Ninety per cent or more of the credit never leaves the books of the Banks as the Banks produ ce no specie as backing. When the Federal Rese rve Banks and National Banks acqUIre United States Bonds and Securitie s, State Bonds and Securitie s, State Subdivi sion Bonds and Securitie s, mortgages on private Real property and mortgages on private personal property, the said banks create the money and credit upon their books by bookkeeping entry. The first time that the money comes into existence is when they create it on their bank books by bookkeeping entry. The banks create it out of nothin g. No substantial fund of gold or silver is back of it, or any fund at all. The mechani cs followed in the acqui sition of United States Bonds are as follow s: The Federal Rese rve Bank places its name on a United States Bond and goes to its banking books and credits the United States Government for an equal amount of the face value of the bonds. The money or credit first comes into exist ence when they create it on the books of the bank. National Banks do the same except they must have One ($1 .00) Dolla r in Credit on hand for every Four ($4.00) Dolla rs they create .

The Federal Rese rve Bank must deposit with the Treasurer of the United States a like amount of Bonds for the Notes it receives. The Bonds are without lawful consid eration, as the Federal Reserve Bank created the money and credit upon their books by which they acquired the Bond. With their bookkeeping created credit, National Banks obtain these notes from the Federal Reserve banks. The net effect of the entire transaction is that the Federal Reserve Bank and the National Banks obtain Federal Rese rve Notes compa rable to the ones they placed on file with the Clerk of Di:strict Court, and a spcciITlcn of which is abov e, for the cost of printing only . Title 31 U.S.C., Section 462 (392) attempts to make Federal Reserve Notes a legal tender for all debts , public and private. See page 72. From 1913 down to date, the Federal Rese rve Banks and the National Banks are privately owned. As of March 18, 1968, all gold backing is removed from the said Federal Reserve Notes. No gold or silver backs up these notes. The Federal Reserve Notes in question in this case are unlawf ul and void upon the following ground s. 1. Said Notes are fiat money, not redeemable in gold or silver coin upon their face, not backed by gold or silver, and the notes are in want of some real or substantial fund being provided for their payment in redempti on. There is no mode provided for enforc ing the payment of the same. There is no mode provided for the enforcement of the payment of the Notes in anything of value. 2. The Notes are obviously not gold or silver coin. 3. The sole consideration paid for the One Dollar Federal Rese rve Notes is in the neighborhood of nine-tenths of one cent, and therefore, there is no lawful consideration behind said Notes. 4. That said Federal Reserve Notes do not conform to Title 12, United States Code, Sections 411 and 418. Title 31 USC, Section 462 (392), insof ar as it attempts to make Federal Reserve Notes and circulating Notes of Federal Reserve Banks and National Banking Asso ciations a legal tender for all debts , public and private, it is uncons titutional and void, being contrary to Article I, Section 10, of the Constitution of the United States, which prohibits any State from making anything but gold and silver coin a tender, or impairing the obligation of contra cts. Now, therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me pursuant to the Declaration of Independence , the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, the Constitution of the United States of America and the Constitution of the State of Minnesota, It is hereby DETERMINED, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED, that the Appeals Statutes of the State of Minne sota for Civil Appeal s from the Court to the District Court is not complied with within 10 days after entry of Judgment. Therefore the Appeal is not allowed by this Court and my docket so shows.

MAHONEY JUSTICE OF THE PEACE CREDIT RIVER TOWN SHIP SCO TT COU NTY MINN ESOTA MEMORANDUM The division and separation of the three great powers of government, the Execut ive, the Legislative and the Judicia l and the principle that these powers should be forever kept separate and distinct as of vital importance to the maintenance and establishment of a free government, without which this Republic cannot possibly survive. The particular wording of the Declaration of Independence which set up an obsolete cut off with the British form of Government is contained in the first two paragraphs thereof. Thereafter the Const itution was ordained and established as a law for the government by the People of the United States. All legisla tive powers granted are vested in the Congr ess of the United States consi sting of a House of Representatives and a Senate elected as representatives of all the people. \"Judicial Power\" is defined in Black 's Law Dictionary as the authority vested by Courts and Judge s, as distinguished from the Executive and Legisla tive power. \"Cases and Controver sies\" is defined in Blacks' Law Dictionary - \"This term as used in the Constitution of the United States embraces claims or contentions of litigants brought befo re the Court fo r adjudication by regular proceedings fo r the protection of wrongs; and whenever the claim or contention of a party takes such a fo rm that the Judicial Power is capable of acting upon it, it has become a case or controver sy. \" See Interstate Commerce Commission vs. Brimson, 154 U.S. 447, 14 Sup. Crt. 1125, 38 Law Ed. 1047; Smith vs. Adams, 130 U.S. 1679, 32 L.Ed .. 895. Under our form of government every Amer ican, individually or by representation, is the high and supreme sovereign authority. The authority at each of the three departments of gove rnment is defined and established. It is entirely fitting and proper to observe that in all instanc es between the states and the United States, and the people, there is no such thing as the idea of a compact between the people on one REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 196"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"side and the government on the other. The compact is that of the people with each other to produce and const itute a government . To suppo se that any government can be a party to a compact with the whole people, is supposing it to have an existence before it can have a right to exist. The only instance in which a compact can take place between the people and those who exercise the government, is that the people shall pay them while they choose to employ them . A Constitution is the property of the nation and more specifically of the individual, and not those who exercise the government. All the Const itutions of America are decla red to be established in the authority of the people. The authority of the Const itution is grounded upon the absolute, God- given free agency of each individual , and this is the basis of all powers granted, reserved or withheld in the authorization of every word, phrase, clause or paragraph of the Const itution. Any attempt by Congr ess, the President or the Courts to limit, change or enlarge even the most claimed insignificant provisio n is therefore ultra vires and void ab initio . When considering the United States Const itution, one must absolutely and completely clear his mind of all British, monar chica l, papal, clergical, continental, financial, or other alien influenc es or conceptions of government the rights of the individual and what is Const itutional . Our Const itution stands absolute and alone. It must be read in the light of all enga gements entered into before its adoption including the Declaration of Independence and the privilege s and immunities secured by Common Law confirmed by Magna Charta and other English Charters, excepting there from all clerical, papal and monarchical nonse nse. No one applying the Constitution to any situation has any busin ess, right or duty to look in any direction for sovereignty but toward the people. Any attempt or inclination to do so is a violation of one's oath and continuing duty to uphold, maintain and support the Cons titution of the United States of Amer ica. See Waring vs. Mayor of Savannah, 60 Georgia, Page 93, where it is quoted as follows: \"In this State as well as in all republics, it is not the Legislature, however transc endent its powers, who are supreme - but the people - and to suppose that they may violat e the fundamental law, is, as has been most eloquen tly expressed, to affi rm that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the servant is above hi s master , that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of delegated power may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they fo rbid. \" The law is made by the Legislature, but applied by the Cour ts.

For authority to support the propo sition that an Act of Congr ess in violation of the Const itution confers no rights or privileges see 16 Am. Jur. 2d \"Constitutional Law,\"; Sections 177 thru 179 Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution provides that no State shall make any Thing but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts. The act of the Clerk of the District Court is the act of the State. The Clerk of the District Court is the agent of the Judicia l Branch of the Gove rnment of the State of Minnes ota. See Briscoe et al vs. The Bank of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, 11 Peters Reports at Page 319, \"A State can act only through its agents; and it would be absur d to say that any act was not done by a State which was done by its authori zed agents. \" For the Justice Fees the bank deposited with the Clerk of District Court the two Federal Rese rve Notes. The Clerk tendered the Notes to me. My sworn duty compelled me to refuse the tender. This is contrary to the Constitution of the United States. The States have no power to make bank notes a legal tender. See 35 Amer. Jur. on Money, Section 13. Only gold and silver coin is a lawful tender. See also 36 Am. Jur. on Money, Section 9. Bank Notes are a good tender on money unless specifica lly objected to. Their conse nt and usage is based upon the convertibility of such notes to coin at the pleasure of the holder upon presentation to the bank for redem ption . When the inability of a bank to redeem its notes is openly avowed they instantly lose their character as money and their circulation as currency ceases. There is also no lawful consid eration for these notes to circulate as money. The banks actually obtained these notes for the cost of the print ing. There is no lawful consideration for said Not es. A lawful consid eration must exist for these Notes to circulate as money. The banks actually obtained these notes for the cost of the print ing. There is no lawful consideration for said Not es. A lawful consid eration must exist for a Note . See 17 Amer. Jur. 2d on Contracts, Section 85 and also Sections 215, 216 and 217 of 11 Amer. Jur. 2nd on Bills and Notes. As a matter of fact, the \"Notes\" are not Notes at all as they contain no promi se to pay. The activity of the Federal Reserve Banks of Minneapoli s, San Francisco and the First National Bank of Montgomery is contrary to public policy and the Const itution of the United States and constitute s an unlawf ul creation of money and credit is not warranted by the Const itution of the United States. REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 198"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"The Federal Rese rve and National Banks exercise an exclusive monopoly and privilege of creating credit and issuing their Notes at the expense of the public, which does not receive a fair equivalent. This scheme is obliquely designed for the benefit of an idle monopoly to rob, blackmail and oppress the producers of wealth . The Federal Reserve Act and the National Bank Act is in its operation and effect contrary to the whole letter and spirit of the Constitution of the United States, confers an unlawf ul and unnecessa ry power on private partie s; holds all of our fellow citizens in depende nce; is subversive to the rights and liberties of the people . It has defied the lawfully const ituted Government of the United States. The Federal Reserve and National Banking Acts and Sec. 462 (392) of Title 31, U.S.C. are not necessa ry and proper for carrying into execut ion the legisla tive powers granted to Congr ess or any other powers vested in the Government of the United States, but, on the contrary, are subversive to the rights of the People in their rights to life, liberty and Property. The aforementioned acts of Congress are unconstitutional and void and I so hold. The meaning of the Const itutional prov ision \"No State Shall make any Th ing but Gold and Silver Coin a tender in paym ent of debts \" is direct, clear, unam biguous and without any qualificat ion. Thi s Court is without authority to interpolate any exce ption . My duty is si mply to ex ecute it, as written, and to pronounce the legal re sult. From an examination of the case of Edwards v. Kearzev, 96 U.S. 595, the Federal Res erve Notes (fiat money) , which are attempted to be made a lega l tender, are exa ctly what the authors of the Const itution of the United St ates intended to prohibit. No State ca n make the se Notes a le gal tender. Congr ess is incompetent to authorize a State to make the Notes a legal tender. For the effect of binding Const itutional provisions see Cooke v. Iverson, 108 M. 388 and State v. Sutton, 63 M. 147. This fraudulent Federal Reserve System and National Banking System has impaired the obligation of Contract, promoted disrespect for the Const itution and Law and has shaken society to its foundati ons. The Court is at a loss, becau se of the non-appearance of Plaintif f to determine upon what legal theory Plaintif f could possibly claim that the Note s in quest ion are a legal tender. If they have any validity it must come from the Const itution of the United States and laws passed pursua nt thereto. Inquiry was made of Mr. Daly as to what laws these Notes could be possibly based upon to sustain their validity . To aid the Court he presented the following: Section 411, 412, 417, 418, 420 of USC Title 12 and Title 31, USC Sec. 462 (392). On the one hand Section 411 holds and states that the Notes are to be used for the purpose of making advances to Federal Rese rve Banks through Federal Reserve Agents and for no other purpo ses. Then Title 31, Section 462 (392) states: \"All Federal Reserve Notes and circulating Notes of Federal Reserve Banks and National Banking Asso ciations hereto fo re or herea fter issued, shall be legal tender fo r all debts public and private. \" The Cons titution states, \"No State shall make any Thing but Gold and Silver Coin a legal tender in paym ent of debts. \" The above referred to enactments of Congress state that the Notes are a legal tender. There is a direct conflict between the Constitution and the Acts of Congress. If the Constitution is not controlling then Congress is above and has superior REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 199"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"authority from the Constitution and the People who ordained and established it. Title 31 USC, Section 462 (392) is in direct conflict with the Constitution insof ar at least, that it attempts to make Federal Reserve Notes a Legal Tender, the Const itution is the Supreme Law of the Land. Sec. 462 (392) is not a law which is made in pursuance of the U.S. Const itution. It is uncon stitutional and void and I so hold. Therefore, the two Federal Reserve Notes are null and void for any lawful purpose so far as this case is concerned and are not a valid deposit of $ 2.00 with the Clerk of the District Court. I hold that the case has not been lawfully removed from the Court and jurisdiction thereof is still vested in the Court. However; there is a second ground of invalidity of these Federal Reserve Notes previously discu ssed and that is the Notes are invalid because on no theory are they based upon a valid, adequate or lawful considerati on. At the hearing scheduled for January 22, 1969 at 7:00 p.m., Mr. Morgan, nor anyone else from or representing the Bank, attended to aid the Court in making a correct determination. Mr. Morgan appeared at the trial on December 7, 1969 and appeared as a witness to be candid, open, direct, experien ced and truthf ul. He testified to 20 years of exper ience with the Bank of America in Los Angeles, the Marquette National Bank of Minnea polis and the Plaintif f in this case. He seemed to be familiar with the operati ons of the Federal Reserve System. He freely admitted that his Bank created all of the money or credit upon its books with which it acquired the Note and Mortgage of May 8, 1964. The credit first came into existence when the Bank created it upon its books . Further he freely admitted that no United States Law gave the bank the authority to do this. There was obviou sly no lawful consid eration for the Note . The Bank parted with absolutely nothing except a little ink. In this case the evidence was on January 22, 1969 that the Federal Reserve Banks obtain the Notes for the cost of the printing only. This seems to be confirmed by Title 12 USC, Section 420. The cost is about 9110ths of a cent per Note, regardl ess of the amount of the Note . The Federal Rese rve Banks create all of the Money and Credit upon their books by bookkeep ing entry by which they acquire United States and State Securitie s. The colla teral required to obtain the Notes is, by Section 412, USC, Title 12, a deposit of a like amount of Bonds, Bonds which the Banks acquired by creating money and credit by bookkeeping entry . No rights can be acquired by fraud. The Federal Reserve Notes are acquired through the use of unconst itutional statutes and fraud. The Com mon Law requires a lawful consideration for any Contract or Note . These Notes are void for failure of a lawful consideration at Common Law, entirely apart from any Const itutional Cons iderations upon this ground the Notes are ineffectual for any purpo se. This seems to be the principal objection to paper fiat money and the cause of its depreciation and failure down through the ages. If allowed to continue, Federal Rese rve Notes will meet the same fate. From the evidence introduced on January 22, 1969, this Court finds that as of March 18, 1968 all Gold and Silver backing is removed from Federal Reserve Notes. The law leaves wrongdoers where it finds them. See 1 Amer. Jur. 2nd on Actions, Sections 50, REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 200"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"51 and 52. This Court further observes that the jurisdiction of the Court is conferred by Article 6, Sec. 1 of the Minnesota Constitut ion. \"Sec. 1. The judicial power of the state is hereby vested in a Supreme Court, a District Court, a Probate Court and such other Courts, minor judicial offi cers and commiss ioner s with jurisdiction inferior to the District Court as the legislative may establish. \" Pursuant thereto an Act of the legislature credited this Court. Nothing on the Constitution or laws of the United States limits the jurisdiction of this Cour t. The Const itution of Minnesota does not limit the jurisdiction of this Court. It therefore has complete Jurisdiction to render justice in this cause in accordance with and agreeable to the Supreme Law of the Land. See 16 Am.

If its Jurisdiction is to be limited it must be limited by the Constitution. \" See Minn, Const. \"Bill of Right s. \" In any event, the Bank has not raised any question as to the jurisdiction of this Court. Slavery and all its incidents including Peonage thralldom and debt created by fraud is univers ally prohibited in the United States. This case represents but another refined form of Slavery by the Bankers. Their position is not supported by the Const itution of the United States. The People have spoken their will in terms which cannot be misun derst ood. It is indispensa ble to the preservation of the Union and independence and liberties of the people that his Court adhere only to the mandates of the Const itution and administer it as written.

The Federal Rese rve stock, owned by member banks of the Federal Reserve System, repre sent the capitalization they put into the system required by law and it gives them certain limited rights as to the election of directors on the Board of the reserve banks.

The commercial banks as a whole can create money only if additional reserves are made available to them. The Federal Reserve System is the only instrumentality endowed by law with discretiona ry power to create (or extingui sh) the money that serves as bank reserves or as public's pocket cash. Thus, the ultimate capability of expending or reducing the econo my's supply of money rests with the Federal Reserve . New Federal Rese rve money, when it is not wanted by the public for hand-t o-hand circulation, becomes the reserves of member banks . After it leaves the hands of the first bank acquiring it, as explained above, the new reserve money continues to expand into deposit money as it passes from bank to bank until deposits stand in some established multiple of the additional reserve funds that Federal Reserve action has supplied. Q. Now, the mecha nics, can you explain the mecha nics by which the Federal Rese rve bank runs its open market committee. A. Runs its open market committee? Q. Yes. A. The open market comm ittee is not a committee of the Federal Reserve Banks, Mr. Daly.

The Open Market Committee, which consists of five of the twelve presidents of the Federal Reserve banks and the seven members of the Board of Governors , directs policy with reference to the sales or purchase of the government securit ies on the open market, which expands or contracts the ability of commercial banks to make loans and invest ments. Q. And this has a direct bearing upon the amount of money that is available to the public ? A. It would have a direct bearing on the amount of money and supply of credit availabl e. Q. Now, the Federal Reserve Bank actually creates credit on its books, does it not? A. The only way in which it creates credit is by its discount policy, in which it may credit, by making a temporary loa n and credit the reserve account of that individual bank. Q. It can credit the account of the individual bank by making a loan to the bank? A. Yes, sir, this is a loan that is repaid. Q.

Does that bank, the commercial banks can also create credit on their books ? A. To the extent that the reserve or equity at the position permits them to make a loan in accordance with their policy.

I guess I don't follow your quest ion. Q. Is there a limit upon them? Is there a limit to the extent that they can do that? A. The ultimate limit to which they would be restricted would be determined by the amount of reserves they are required to hold back, dependent upon what the reserve requireme nts, as established by the Board of Gove rnors of the Federal Reserve System, are.

However, in 1775, when the Revoluti onary War became inevitable, the Continental Congress authorized the issuance of currency to finance the conflict. Paul Revere made the first plates for this \"Continental Currency .\" Those notes were redeemable in Spanish Milled Dollars. The depreciation of this currency gave rise to the phrase \"not worth a Contine ntal.\" After the so-ca lled U.S. Const itution was ratified, the alleged 'United States in Congr ess Assemble d,' passed the \"Mint Act\" of April 2, 1792, which established the coinage system of the social compa ct known as the United States and the dollar, as their principal unit of species currency. By this Act, we became the first country in the world to adopt the decimal system for currency. The first U.S. coins were struck in 1793 at the Philadelphia Mint and presented to Martha Washington. The so-calle d Government did not issue paper money as we know it today until 1861. In the interim years, however, the new social compact Govern ment did issue \"Treasury Notes\" intermittently during periods of financial stress, such as the War of 1812, the Mexican War of 1846, and the Panic of 1857. During this same period (1793 - 1861), approximately 1,600 private banks were permitted to print and circul ate their own paper currency under State Charters.

The last series of Silver Certificates was issued in 1923. However, the last series of modem Silver Certificates produced were the series 1957BI1935H one dollar notes, series 1953C five dollar notes, and 1953B ten dollar notes. During the period from 1863 to 1929, the Military Social Government Construct again permitted thousands of banks to issue their own notes under their National Banks Acts of 1863 and 1864. These were called \"National Bank Notes,\" but unlike the earlier \"State Bank Notes,\" they were produced on paper authorized by the Military Social Government Construct known as the United States and carried the same basic design . In 1913, Military Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act, establishing this so-ca lled nation's Federal Reserve System. This Act authorized the Federal Reserve Banks to issue Federal Reserve Bank Notes.

Unless you are a dedicated student of life, with lots of time on your hand to read, travel, and do resear ch, by default and/or general acquiescence, all you probably have time for are the \"sound bites\" of established and very controlled (Money Kings) print and entertainment \"news\" sources. What is your level of assurance that these popular indoctrination sources of information are trustworthy? Is it possible that the larger truth is so far from obvio us, that you would n't know it if it bit you ? I suggest that this is much closer to reality than you might expect. In the Movie \"A Few Good Men,\" Keffe, the character played by Tom Cruise screa ms, \"I want the truth!\" and Jesse p, the character played by Jack Nicholson fires back \"You can't handle the truth!\" Nine out of ten people, when interviewed, will insist that they want the truth . They really believe that they do. However, if you qualify this quest ion when you ask it with \"even if it were painful,\" the number drops to 4 in 10. Run the experiment, you'll see what I mean . This tendency to re ject new information when the chose n response is one of discomfort or pain is descr ibed in Dissonance Theory-a scien tific theory of attitude change which proposes that awaren ess of inconsi stencies among individual s' beliefs , attitu des, and behaviors , produces an aversive state of tension or discom fort. Furthermore, dissonance increases with important decisions and dissimila rity between alternat ives. Resistance to change is descr ibed in terms of effo rt justi fication-a tendency to believe, once a considerable amount of effort is exerted to achieve a goal, that the goal is important and worthwhile. This principle is at the heart of hazing rituals by sports teams, fraternit ies, and sororit ies. When dissonance occurs the individual will attempt to reduce it through a number of coping mechani sms. If the perceived level of pain overwhelms other coping skills, the individual will chose denial . Others will attempt to reduce dissonance by justifying one's behavior when external inducements are \"insufficient\" to fully justify it. This occurs when the individual has high trust with self, i.e., behavior is congruent with principles, and has paid a high price in the past to seek out and adapt their lives to their evolving understanding of the truth. A struggle will play out within the individual in which they will do whatever is necessa ry to test the new information, until a determination can be made as to its validity. The new information is not constrained by what is already known.

If you are asking the quest ion- \"You mean my mortgage?\" No-I mean your trust!!! If you are an assum ed \"homeowner,\" go to your files now and get what you think is your mortg age. We will introduce definitions at the point were they are used to facilitate your understanding-all definitions are taken from Black's Law Dictio nary 4 th and 6 th edition s. So what is a deed of trust? Before we answer that, let's first see what a trust is. We will only go into enough depth to give you a feel for what you have probably been overlooking. A trust is a legal construct for holding property for so me use as determined by the terms of the trust. The formal application of trusts us ually involves three part ies, although technically only one is required. The creator of the trust is ca lled the TR USTOR and/or GRANTOR or SETTLOR (hereafter: trustor). The trustor is the original holder in due course of the property and sets the contract for the benefit of a BEN EFI CI ARY. The property and the terms of the contract are usually managed by a third party, the TRUSTEE, also called fiduciary (one in a position of trust). Did you know that when you signed your Deed of Trust that you were giving benef it and advantage to the banker? Who created the Deed of Trust? Answer: The banker did, so why wouldn 't the banker draw up the contract to his own advantage if you didn't say anything again st it? Deed of Trust. An instrument in use in many states, taking the place and serving the uses of a common-law-m ortgage, by which legal title to real property is placed in one or more trustees, to secure the payment of a sum of money or the performance of other condition s. Now le t's begin the process of attaching parties to this definition, and defining some more terms, so you can see where you stand. You may have assumed that you are the Trustor. While it is true that your signature \"payed\" for the house (yes, you read it correct ly), this was not the agreement you signed last. If you signed your Deed of Trust \"Joint Tenancy,\" what did you do? Did you actually sign a lease agreement with the landlord that call themselves bank? Here is a quote from a Deed of Trust: \"WITNESSETH: That Trustor hereby irrevocably grant s, conveys, transfers and assigns to the Trustee in Trust, with Power of Sale, the above described real property, together with leases, issues, profit s, or income there from: SUBJECT, however to the right, power and authority hereinafter given to and conferred upon Beneficiary to collect and apply such property income .\" What did you do when you signed the Deed of Trust at the title company?

What were you think ing? As said earlier, the truth is far from obvious, and we can only give you the highlights in this essay. There are many more pieces to this story . See \"Un ited States Bankruptcy : What Banks Don 't Want You to Know\", \"Secrets of the Federal Reserve\", \"What is United States \", \"Are You Sure You Want to Hire an Attorne y, \" and \"Befo re the Judg e.\" How did the deed of trust become a lease anyway? While you were busy not paying attention to all that legalese, a second document was slipped in front of you after you signed the note, thus turning you from an \"owner\" in to a renter (\"homeownership\" is a very short lived experience for most peopl e). Assignment of lease. Such occu rs where lessee transfers entire unexpired remainder of term created by lease. Title. The evidence of right which a person has to the posses sion of property. The definition for Deed of Trust above, uses the term legal title. Exactly what does this mean ? The term legal is the tip off. Law is another fiction. Since the so-ca lled U.S. Bankruptcy and HJR 192 (Public Law 73), there is no way to exting uish a debt and consequently no way to execute a law. We went from the gold standard to the promise to pay standard, and all demands for payment const itute an issue of public currency. A promi se to pay (signature or federal reserve note) creates \"money,\" and is what funds your mortgage, auto loan, credit card purchases, and every other kind of 'loan' you take out, including traffic tickets . The other tipoff is the word evidence in the definition for title. Title in trust is a quasi -title, not title in fact. You can have right to posses sion, but you can never own anything outright-all property and labor being pledged in the so-ca lled bankruptc y. It is for this reason that \"legal title\" can never be defined in term of the Res, or real thing. It can only represent a fiction. Instead of the land being the security, the bankers have replaced this with \"legal title to real property\"-a \"legal description\"-a fiction . Can the \"legal description\" ever be the \"land or house property ?\" Answer: No, not under the current system. \"Legal title\" is based on \"legal description.\" Black's law doesn 't define this phrase, but a summary of words (in physica l terms) would be: A written enumeration of items composing as estate created by law. But since law itself is a fiction, so must a \"legal description,\" and in tum \"legal title.\" In 1803, their President, Mr. Thomas .Jefferson, appointed Mr. Lewis and Mr. Clark to explore and map out the newly acquire Louisiana Purchase from France --nearly one­ third the total area purchased by the United States for their socia l compact known as The United States of Amer ica.

This is usually the case even when there is no written, signed contract. For example, when eating at a resta urant-If you place an order for food, then proceed to consume the food upon receipt, the cu stom is, you're liable for the bill. However, there is a whole class of contracts of a far more sinister nature; they are called, adhesion cont racts . These are contracts made wholly for the benefit of a single party. They corne into existence whenever you exercise a benef it offered by the corporate state such as welfare (Social Security, Medicaid, food stamps, postal delivery, etc.), sign an application (uh, affidavit) for a passport, use so­ called federal highwa ys, sign your private property name to obtain a license (marriage, automobile, aviation, CPA, etc.), or register what you perceive as your private property (babies, automobiles, etc.).

It owes its suc cess to the interlocking connection of three fundamental ploys: 1. Build a system based on appearanc es (fiction). 2. Create subtle ways of getting people to contract with the fiction in order to make them accommodation parties. 3. Induce people to give this fiction substance by arguing and testifying in statutory courts. Corporate entities, Federal Reserve notes, property descriptions, and statutory laws are all fictions. There is nothing of substance to them. A corporate entity such as your Straw-man­ debtor, is not the flesh and blood you. Federal Reserve notes do not corne into existence through their assig nment to something of value such as gold or silver, but by taking out a loan. A title deed identifies a horne in terms of an artificial system of meets and bounds called a property description-a description of property that is NOT; if you read it, you won't find anything that descr ibes any attribute of the real house.

You have believed all of your life that money is valuable and have therefore struggled for its attainment in order to \"purchase\" the material necessities of life like a home. You have also believed that you have been \"paying\" your debts . Now you are learning that you have been deceived in these most basic and fundamental tenants and assumpt ions. I rather doubt a greater dissimila rity of alternati ves could exist-the information that you have been absorbing from the culture, either by osmosis or governmental schooling, with what is presented here in this essay is extremely HIGH, meaning HIGH dissonance. In addition, the information presented here invites you to make some major decisions in regards to the interpretation you give to your percept ions. This also contributes to HIGH dissonance. And finally, the effort justification is also very HIGH-the daily commute , the job, etc. According to our definition then, dissonance should be OFF THE CHARTS.

The complexity of a social order is proportional to the degree of specia lization required of its members to carry out its agreed function s-as complexity increas es, members tend to know more and more about less and less. In times past, physicians performed essentially the same servi ces. They could carry everything they used in the treatment of their patients between their ears and in a little black bag. Today doctors specia lize in one part of the body and require the support services of large institutions and other specia lists. In this context it is natural for one to seek out the services of those who are learned in matters that they do not either have the time, interest, or training to handle for thems elves. However, would you go to an unlicensed physicia n who had a hidden agenda, lacked training in medic ine, who performed treatments for which the results and costs were uncertain? As the uninitiated will discover, this is standard operating procedure when hiring an attorney. If there is a system for which there is a bigger gap between perception and the reality of its inner workin gs, I know not what it is. This includes attorneys themselve s. By design, the true nature of alleged courts , the law, and the relationship of the individual to the state has been hidden by the architects of the system, lest its secrets be exposed. Popular perceptions are groomed by the purveyors of controlled media, and education (including so-ca lled law schools) mostly through entertainment and inculcation of so-ca lled national identity. Independent thinkers within the ranks of attorneys may eventually realize the significa nt incongruities in plying their trade, but not one in a million will figure it out. Only upon being invited into the inner sanctum of judgeship and higher will the secrets begin to be revea led. So, how is this accompl ished? Since the so-ca lled Military Social Government Const ruct's Bankruptcy in 1933 (see Amer icas \"New Deal\", the Looting of a Nation) attorneys and judges have a near license to steal the wealth of the community backed by force of arm. They are amply rewarded for activities that promi se nothing. They function at the heart of a system that has, as its ultimate goal, subjugation and conquest of the popUlation through commerce. Although wars on the surface may appear to settle the differences between men and countr ies, it has been the behind the scenes manipulations by the bankers and merchants that continue to control. This was the case at the conclusion of their Americ a's war for Independ ence, as it is now-not surpri singly mediated by attorneys (see A Brief History of United States ). Attorneys do this with their own private language in which they change the popular meanings of words and imbed the rules of the game inside inscrutable code-you can't play the game unless you understand the rules and that takes an attorney - - and even if you are one in a million, you are not allowed to use their private code to prosecute them for their thievery because such Codes are Copyrighted, There is no higher form of incestuous relations to prevent the people from the sheer BAR to justice, established to prevent the Money Kings, by and through their Agents (Attorneys), from fleecing the peop le. So, what is an attorney anyway, and does this mean the same thing as lawyer? Although modem usage tends to obscu re the distinction between the mean ings of these words, historically, they are not the same. To understand this distinction it is necessa ry to trace the legal profession REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 221"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"in their United States back to its roots in Brita in. Even the word \"bar\" is of British or igin. In England, only some lawyers are called Advocates. Others are called \"solicitors,\" still others \"barristers,\" \"counselors ,\" \"mediators,\" and \"attorneys.\" These are not terms referring to just any lawyer, they are specific titles used to desig nate the type of lawyer they are and how they practice law. Advocates and solicitors have a very simila r ro ll, but on the oppos ite side of any given disput e. While a solicitor is one who presents a case on behalf of an accuser, otherwise known as the plaintiff, an advocate provides argument for the defendant. The barrister holds a specific position of trust beyond an area where even other lawyers are barred from entry. \"Crossing the bar\" means far more than just walking over to a different place in the room. It is the act of placing yourself under the jurisdictional authority of the court whose bar you've crossed. The BAR stands for British Accredited Registry. A mediator's job is to facilitate an agreement between oppo sing sides. Counselors, on the other hand, primarily do just what their title indicat es, counseling. To obtain \"assistance of Counsel,\" therefore is not the same as being repre sented by an attorney. So, what is an attorney? Notice that the word for each title clearly ident ifies its unique characteri stic: • Solicitor = one who solicits a cause of action • Advocate = one who advocates for the accused • Barrister = one who goes where others are barred from entry • Mediator = one who mediates between two parties • Counselor = one who provides counsel from a given perspective • Attorney = one who attorns or engages in attornment The term \"attorn\" is defined in Black's Law Dictiona ry: \"to turn over; to transfe r to anoth er, mone y or goods; to assign to some partic ular use or service. \" \"Attorn \" has its origin from the days of the English Feudal System. Its process employed the class title of nobility known as Esqu ire, which means a greater or elevated Squire. The Squire was an armor bearer fo r the Knight. Among other duties, the ESquire performed the attornment ceremony necessa ry to preserve a class structure of nobility. While performing his attorney functions, the ESquire used a system of unequal protection under different sets of laws. Among these varying standards were the laws of the King's Court, of the Court of Exchequer, of the Common Courts of Pleas, and for the different levels of royalty, noblemen, freemen, peons, serfs and slaves.

Their job, if faithf ully carried out, would assure that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. This transf er of wealth is enforced in several ways . Since all attorneys take the title ESquire, you end up in last place in the pecking order of allegia nce, which goes first to the crown, then the courts, before going to you. If you doubt this, just ask your attorney to sign an agreement that puts you first in line and see what happen s. Un less they want to bring a quick end to their careers , don't expect to see a signature. Second, since the bankruptcy and the partitioning of the law (See Essay on the Law), the law was replaced by publ ic policy (private copyrighted International Law), you were replaced by a legal fiction (See, Adhesion Contracts ), and two party contracts were replaced by construed constructive trusts (See Essa y on Trusts). If you have not completed your VCC-1 Filing you are considered a ward of the court /state. The ramif ications of all of this are as follow s: Since the bankruptcy, all corporations are insolvent and there is no way to pay a debt. If there is no way to pay a debt, there is no way to execute a law (no payment is possible), and laws, including the facts upon which they are based, become irrelevant. Your duty under these circumstances is to be a good little trustee by honor ing your implied promi se to perform under all of your adhesion contra cts. Courts are no longer about law, fact of law, or anything real for that matter. They cannot be because THERE IS NO WAY TO PAY! The carefu l observer of court room drama will notice that the judge will typically only look at one or two pages of any of the court briefs that pass before them, regardless of how long they are. Today 's cour ts are about one thing, and that is hono r-did you honor your cont ract to perfo rm as a good trust ee? One more fact is worth noting before concludi ng. The much ballyhooed and pre stigious License to practice law does not even exist (see The My thological License to Practice Law). There is no department of State which issues said license, nor does the State Bar in their alleged state exist, other than as a corporation. You can prove this to yourself by going to the Commissioner of Corporations in their state. The so-ca lled Bar is merely a private club that collects union dues from its members who posture as licensed professionals, which does not exist by and through any Executive Authority (Governor's Executive Powers) of the so-ca lled State which issues all licenses to control suppose dly every licensed professional. In summary, when you hire any attorney, you are underwriting the English Crown to assign one of their unlicensed agent s, learned in procedure not law, to animate a legal fiction (Strawman) that was created on your behalf. There is misrepresentation by and through centers of education to accept such contrivances as legal. When you were born, they bring you into their slaughter house to argue your case \"thus giving meaning to the legal fiction they have created there.\" Hence, subject matter jurisdiction gives rise to a cause of action, whether legally or not, while transf erring as much of what you presume is your wealth as they can get away with. Then it is hoped that you will come back for more on appeal (a sucker is born every day, and they know this because they educate them to remain born suckers).

To begin this journey of discovery you can go online to the Secretary of State for California's web site. All bona fide corporati ons, public and private, must be registered with the Secretary of State. Do a search for \"California Bar Association\" and notice several strange anomalies with the posted informa tion. For one, while the incorporation date of record is listed as 1907, this date differs from the date on the seal of the letter head for the California Bar that lists an incorporation date of 1927. Now notice that the status of the California Bar is inactive. Also notice that there is no registered agent listed for service of process, nor is there a listing for the corporate address. Go to the Secretary of State web sites for the so-called states neighboring California and you will discover the same anomalies-listed but inactive, without contact informati on. Now call the California Corporate Commission to discover if they can expla in the so-ca lled anomalies and they will advise you that the State Bar of California was formed by statute (legislative act), and therefore not formed in accordance with the California Corporation Code. Next, call the Executive Director at the headquarters for the California Bar Association in San Francisco and ask the following three questio ns: 1. Why is the California Bar Association an inactive corporat ion? 2. What type of organization (lega l class ifica tion) is the California State Bar Association? 3. Why does the incorporation date on the letter head seal differ from the date of incorporation listed with the California Corporation Commission? While the Executive Director will not be able to clear up the myst ery to any of the questions listed above, you will be assured that the State Bar of California is a Const itutional agenc y with the judicia l branch of State government. It serves an administrative function for the California Supreme Court in matters relating to the regulation of the legal prof ession.

By claiming that the State Bar Corporation was created by legisla tive act, the Secretary of State can take the position that it lacks authority to issue the certificate, even though the State Bar Association actively touts itself to be a public corporation. In so doing, the California Bar has effectively exempted itself from registration and shielded its books from public scrutiny. The following obscu re cite from 7 Corpus Juris Secundum 9 reveals the deceit being perpetrated here: \"In view of the decision that the creation of public corporat ion by special acts is prohibited by state Constitution, state bar act creating state bar corporat ion as public corporat ion has no validity and designat ion of state bar as 'public corpo ration ' has no legal effi cacy. \" Bridgeg room v.

To further interpret what this means: the State Bar of California enjoys the best of both worlds; an apparent agenc y of gove rnm ent, enjoying the power and protection of the state, including exemption from taxat ion, while it is, in fact, a private institution without legal basis. Wher eas, the notion of a \"license to practice law\" is scarcely mentioned in state and federal codes, the requirements relating to every other kind of license in existence is spelled out in mind­ numbing detail (e.g. Vehicle Code, Internal Revenue Code, etc.).

Answers to que stions regarding where it comes from, how it is conferred, where one goes to see what it looks like, its tenure and its cost remain elusive like the wind . These, and other inten sely pertinent question s, remain unanswered by the codes that imply its existence. So, pull up a chair and take a front row seat as we examine what the word manipulating Esquires have done to convince us that such a thing 'really' exists .

PER SONS Since the so-ca lled bankruptcy in 1933, \"in this state \" signifies the military federal socia l construct known as the \"State of California,\" with its subject \"citizens of the United States,\" artificial persons existing under statute in an artificial realm. In the de jure California, the word person means the flesh and blood man or woman. Thus § 6002 says that only artificial persons (legal fictions) may be admitted and licensed. Real persons need not apply !

Another fatal flaw in both § 6002 and § 6125, according to Corpus Juris Secundum 9, listed above, and the Secretary of State, is that the State Bar itself has no legal existence. In contradiction to Sec.9 of their California State Constitution and the California State Bar Act, § 6001 states that the State Bar is a public corporation.

Section 6002 is framed to satisfy the reader 's perfunctory inquisitiven ess, while remaining firmly ambig uous. Also, the reader of section 6002 may get the impression that Bar members are the only ones that may be \"admitted and licensed to practice law in this state.\" However, because of the way Section 6002 is worded, non-members of the State Bar are not excluded from being \"admitted and licensed to practice law in this State.\" In addit ion, Bar membership is a result of being admitted and license d to practice law, whereupon the admitted party is then granted membership in the State Bar by a bar card-not the other way around.

Though the controlled and licensed media and courts would have us believe other wise, non­ State Bar members are not excluded from being \"licensed to practice law in this State.\" Cal. B&P 6060, 6060.5 reveal that the \"license to practice law\" follows (is one in the same) \"admission to practice law,\" not membership in the bar-association. Section 6060 says that one may be certified to the so-ca lled Supreme Court (admittedllicensed to practice law) even if they haven 't been \"admitted to practice law\" (no bar-c ard) in another state. An article in the Los Angeles Times entitled \"Clinton Resigns from the High Court Bar\" unders cores this point: \" ..• 'Former President Clinton hereby respectfully requests to resign from the bar of this court,' his lawyer, David E.

Critics two years ago launched a referendum on whether to abolish the bar, but with just over half the state's lawyer's voting, the bar survived.

Oceanside, California Republican Assemblyman Bill Morrow, who spons ored a bill for overhauling and shrinking the Bar in 1998, is quoted in the same LA Times article cited above: \"Morrow said that he is not worried that lawyer discipline will lapse.

B&P 6067 implies that attorneys take oaths of office and that this is printed on \"the license.\" If you read Section 6067 caref ully, these attorneys are not a \"member of the State Bar,\" but \"admitted persons.\" Section 6067 is desig ned to lull the reader into the false belief that attorneys take Constitutional oaths of office. Since the license is effectively the bar card-a credit card sized piece of plastic - note that the only text appearing on the bar card of the State Bar of California concerns annual union dues. There is no oath: \"This certifies that the person whose name appears on this card has paid the annual fee required by statute.\" So, on further analysis, Code Section 6067 provides yet another meanin gless entry desig ned to mislea d and distract one from getting closer to the truth. SOU RCE OF THE \"LICENSE\" AND TITLE Since the Code painstakingly avoids ever actually naming or identifying the imaginary \"license to practice law,\" we can safely say that its architects don't really want us to know the underlying source from which attorneys derive their privilege to practice law. Looking deeper, we find there is an underlying aspect of the certificate of admi ssion revealed at 7 Corpus Juris Secundum 4 (page 80l). \"In this state, the right to practice law is conferred by letters-patent, issued under the great seal of the state by its chief executive ...

The source of the patent, as well as letters patent, from the beginni ng, has always been the Sovereign, the Crown, the Originator of the devic e, because the Crown had a supreme need for distinguishing its commercial interests in their Amer ica, while continuing to conduct busin ess in the name of its Straw-men (Attorne ys) Esquires. CONCLUS ION In conclusion, no attorney can produce a valid state-issued \"license to practice law,\" becau se no such license exists . It is a right granted by letters patent \"certificate of admission.\" Bar associations function merely as labor unions, like the Teamsters. Just as a membership in the Teamsters Union does not confer the privilege of driving, membership in the bar association likewise doesn 't confer the privilege of practicing law. Rather, membership in the bar association is a result of being \"admitted and licensed to practice law.\" The notion that a bar association has any obligation to discipline its members is a fantasy, and whatever occurs is gratuit ous. State bar associations cannot be very different than their parent, the American Bar Association (a \"voluntary membership association of attorneys\" per their web site). The reason that Esquires can practice law without a state issued license is that courtrooms in their America are no longer de jure Const itutional instrumentalities of a social compact operating via International Public Order. They have been hijacked and turned into private, monopolized, commercial marketplaces for the enrichment of the owners of code (see Essay on the Law) via Private International Law. Since there is no requirement that an attorney at law identif y himself as an Esguire, there must be some other factor at play that induces such extraneous behavior: \"Admission to the practice of law is membership in an ancient and honorable profession that has for its goal the furtherance of the administration of justice, and the attorney is an instrument for the achievement of such noble purpose.\" McFarl and v.

Many conflicts and battles between the city­ states took place because of the continual disagreements with the boundary lines between them, in order to keep the people and their land under their control for commerce and taxati on. This is where the term \"citizen\" came from. Roman rulers continued to use the term as they conquered each territory by decla ring, \"You are citizens of Rome!\" Since the people did not want to fight the Roma ns, they acquiesce d, and thus, they were verbally contracted under Roman rule. Hierarchy of Law The first order of law is Natural Law. These are the Supreme Creator's Pillars of Universal Law and in Principle, which so necessa rily agrees with nature and State-Of-Man. Without observing their inherent maxims, the peace and happine ss of any socie ty as a socia l compact can never be preserved. Knowledge of natural laws may be attained merely by the light of reason, from the facts of their essential agreeabl eness with the Const itution of moral entities in nature. Natural Law exists regardl ess of whether it is enacted as po sitive law or regarded in any other light whatsoever or cloaked in darkne ss by whomever or by whatever means. When law bega n to emerge into any moral entity 's conscience through thoug hts, words and deeds, the next order of law on this planet and/or universe was begun . The most fundamental law of all moral law has to do with survival, which is a Universal Principa l. It has to do with moral interactio ns, of any kind, via relati onships of buyin g, selling or trading or relating in any way. It is based upon treating and/or dealing with others the way that you would like to be treated and/or dealt with. This is known as the true Law of Commerce. The Law of Commerce has been in operation since man interacted with each other starting many thousands of years ago through the recorded antiquity of the SumerianlB abylonian era where commercial law was codified and enforc ed. Ancient artifacts dating over 6,000 years old reveal that the system was so complex it even included receipts, coined mone y, shopping lists, manif estos and a postal system with the medium being baked clay. As a derivative of Law of Commercial , being removed from natural law, and therefore inferior, is Common Law (common [L co together + munis service, gift, exchange] to exchange toget her). This emer ged, basically, in England out of disputes over a portion of the Earth in Allodium (Sovereign ownership of land) and was allegedly based on \"common\" sense. So, common law is the Law of the Earth governing the exchange of soil. Com mon law gave rise to the jury system and many writs and processes which governments have absorbed, satirized, and made into rules and regulation processes in such courts. Common Law procedures were based on the opportunity \"to face your accuser or the injured REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 234"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"party\" in front of witnesses to sort out the problem directly. This process was never intended to include \"lawyers, attorneys or judges construing their own law,\" as these \"titles\" are all based upon the allegiance of \"representation\" which can never \"be the real thing .\" Because conflicts of interest generally begin over the setting of the court and the recognition of parties to the Cause of Action, there often arise many disputes over conflicts or undisclose d conflicts . It is no wonder there is confusion. As a rule of thumb, the process often mimic s the games of the coliseum. After common law, came those governments which � around these customs and usages. Their laws and legislative regulat ions, ad infinitum such as those, which gave rise to their various city-states, kingdom s, and so-called organic republ ics. The only \"laws\" that these socia l compacts can create are those that \"allow commerce to flow more efficiently WITHIN their social compact\". The only \"law\" the so-ca lled agency central government, known as The United States of America, could create was to \"allow commerce to flow more efficiently BETWEEN the social compact parties known as States.\" It was never intended to regulate the Sovereign People of Earth who created the socia l compact - the true Sovereigns exercising their Political Right s, which are superior to all civil rights of the common citizens. Below that, the \"garbage froth,\" more or less, is politics and the private copyrighted company policy of foreign corporations, such as the military social const ruct known as the UNITED STATES, THE STATE OF ... , THE COU NTY OF ... , THE CITY OF ... , etc. The purpo se of these \"municipalit ies\" [L munus service, gift, exchange + capere to take; to take service and exchange] is to \"govern\" fictitious entities such as JOHN DOE and K-MART - not to regulate people. Remember back when you thought that YOU were JOHN DOE because that is how it is written on the fictions drivers license in commer ce? One of our problems here is that when we engage with agency government, muni cipalities and other such elements (in all our dealings in the law), we have been conditioned to interact on and in THEIR level (subject of the corporations as a sub-co rporation enfranc hised and registered) . We have never risen to the level where the base of law is. Here the reality, the power, the solidity and the pre-eminence exists - THE SOVEREIGN 'S LEVEL. But now, we can function in this power ful level. This is Checkmate . This is the end of the game. THIS IS THE REMEDY.

Potentially count less commercial transactions can be consum mated based on the current UCC at any time.

The man on the street still excla ims, \"But what can I do?\" The power brokers continue to manipulate the world stage from behind the scenes using every techn ology and dirty trick at their disposa l to maintain their tight- fisted control over the alien masses that appear, despite much complaining, unable or unwilling to assert their authority to emerge into any other political status freely determined by a people for their own safety, liberty and pursuit of happine ss. Since the reasons for this so-ca lled state of affairs are numerous and complex, we will focus on exploring those issues most central to the subject of the Sovereignty of all people in this short essay. The history of the word Sovereign may be traced from the past up to the present through its many form s: super (Latin: above), superii nus (Old French from Vulga r Latin) and soverain (Middle Engli sh). There is some specula tion that one of the Engli sh Mona rchs modified soverain so that it would include the word reign , resulting in its present form. Most people equate Sovereignty with justice, freedom and liberty. By liberty we mean the assurance that every man shall be protected in doing what he believes to be his duty again st the influen ces of authority and ma jorities, custom and opinion . By Justice we mean the machinery to protect one while exercising these principal s. And by freedom we mean the exercise of liberty from such machinery of Justice to accom plish the outcome of all three condit ions of Sovereignty within the frame of equality for all people. Ultimately the Sovereignty enjoyed by a peoples is determined by the price (sacrifice) that they are singula rly, jointly and severally co llectively willing to pay (pledge) to ensure their enjoyment of such and this itself is dependent on their educat ion, identity, perception, responsi bility, access to a free flow of unmanaged information, and the balance of power between the majority and the minority that seek to control them within the framework of the socia l compact which people construct for the enjoyment of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happin ess of the signa tory members and their posterity of such compact . When the forces of control operate in secrecy, the effect on private liberty has always been catastroph ic. Everything secret degenerate s, even the administration of justice; nothing is safe that does not show how it can bear discus sion and publicity, if such discussion and publicity is for the greater good of the whole appertaining to the signatories and posterity thereof. The fate of every socia l order based on the Sovereignty of People depends on the choices it makes between these opposite principles, absolute power on the one hand, and on the other, the restraints of morays and tradition within such compact that creates a society for the exercise of such Sovereignty of People. It is inarguable that men are the Creators of the constructs of social order, so it follows that Man is Sovereign over his Creations. It is also inarguable that the word substitutes for socia l orders like \"the state,\" and so-ca lled \"government,\" are really just conve nient abstractions that are entirely without referent-there is no person or thing that can be ascribed to these lingui stic expressions-Man is the State, lest we forget this. And finally, all Social Order has a REDEMP TION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 239"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"higher value than anarchy-it is paramount to peacef ul and productive social relations. As long as Men have disput es, some forum, sanctioned by morays and tradition, will likely be formed to resolve them as the preferable alternative to war. Given the assum ptions of the preceding paragraph: the Sovereignty of Man over government, the necessities of Social Order, and Resolution of Disputes, the Sovereignty of People. This then reduces to the problem of how to set up a Social Order that will, over time, prevent this Hierarchy of Power from becoming inverted, where the arbitrary whims of the few subvert the freedoms of the many. The most certain test by which people judge whether a compact is really free is the amount of security enjoyed by all touching upon their contractual nexus appertaining to safety, liberty, and the pursuit of happine ss within the social compact. The condition of whether or not minorities exist within the framework of a social compact reflects the nature of true equality of each People to one another. If the Sovereignty of each People is to be guarded by the principal s of equality for all Sovereigns, then the concept of minorities and/or degradation of or by any of the socia l compact members towa rd one another would be a breach of the Sovereignty of any one People at the cost of the Sovereignty of all People. So, for true Sovereignty to exist for all People, the idea of a minority within any framework of a social compact where peaceful Sovereignty exist for all People would be non-exi stent. Where any disrespect could be or would be allowed in any Public display, Sovereignty is destroyed for that People and injury has occurred again st the peace and dignity of all. This does not mean that if such a People cause any member of a social compact to react to the deeds of one or another which may appear to be categorized in some manner of expression which under simila r conditions would be considered a breach of peace, but goes on to say that such expression has been brought to the public 's attention due to the actions of another, which may or may not disrespect one People or all People, depending upon the nature of the act or expression, and whether such could be considered to deliver a messa ge of respect or disrespect toward one or another. All actions of the Social Compact individually, jointly, and severally must be guided by the principa ls of the Social Compact concerning dignity for the innoce nt when deciding whether or not a particular action shall be allowed or curtailed for the benefit of all by measu ring the social redeeming qualit ies of any action within the framework of the social compact for the safety, liberty, and pursuit of happine ss for all Sovereign People. At one point, in a private discussion with some liberal minded folks regarding Sovereignty, someone in attendance declar ed: \"We are all Sovereign. People are free to discuss any topic People like, and People come and go as all People please.\" Does this sound like something that you or a friend might say? Let's see how true this might be by exploring our alleged status as ''free Men and Women (Gentlemen and Ladies)\" guaranteed by the Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States of America. Objectivity will require that we examine our assumpti ons and understand something about the nature of the techniques and politics of contr ol. Let's say that you were really an evil person and that you wanted to control a group of People, large or small, without having to const antly fight to maintain control. How might you approach this? Logic dictate s that you could accomplish such a goal by changing things incrementally in such as way that they were barely noticea ble, all the while maintaining appearan ces to be the same, until one day everything was inverted and you had eaten out all substance.

Case in point, a quiet, bloodless revolution was carried out on the soil of the so-ca lled North America in the early 1930's. So sophistica ted in its planning, and so flawless in its execut ion, that over 70 years later, the majority of so-ca lled Americans are still unaware that it even occurred. It remains the standard for techniques in revolution (read \"Peoples Pottage\" by Garrett Garet) . In fact some still honor some of its perpetrators as so-ca lled American heroes. It was the large st theft in world history. All property, biolog ical and physica l, including our labor was pledged to the \"invading army.\" The nature of the conspirac y to defraud all people may be gleaned from studying the following comments quoted from a meeting between Mr. Woodrow Wilson and Colonel Edward Mandell House, circa 1920. House, who some resea rchers specula te was the voice behind so­ called President, Mr. Woodrow Wilson, was one of the major conspirators in the triumph of establishing the Federal Reserve System. His book \"Philip Dru Administrator,\" was disguised as a novel to dupe the masses. It was the blueprint for the radical socialist revolution that ensla ved the military social construct known as the United States during Mr. Woodrow Wilson's and Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's so-ca lled presiden cies: \"Very soon, every American will be required to register their biological property (human bod y) in a national system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient system of pledging. By such method ology, we can compel people to submi t to our agend a which will affect our securi ty as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency (Federal Reserve Notes).

Were you introduced to stories about the so­ called founding fathers and shown various depictions of them standing around at the signing of those contra cts? Were you told how they fought for freedom for you and all your posterity?

What would your reaction to that scrap of paper be? Does it make sense that you would be bound to that little agreement, even if you were not party to the private discussion that led to its creation, or at the least, gave your conse nt and signature to it? Is it possi ble that people outside such socia l compacts which created such Constitutions are free in their safety, liberty, and pursuit of happine ss, even if so-ca lled Const itutions do not exist? Did you know that the so-ca lled Const itution of the United States for The United States of America was incorporated into the by-laws of the United States located in the District of Columbia when it was incorporated in 1871? Did you know that the 13th, 14 t h , and 16th Amendments, were fraudulently enacted and that this fraud renders the entire contract invalid on its face, but is illicitly taught to be applicable to the Sovereign People, when, in fact, it operates only and solely over all the employees of the corporati on. Do you see now why the so-ca lled Presidents routinely legisla te outside the restrictions of their corporate Const itution? If any part of a contract is found to be fraudulent, the entire document is dishonored. Those who have more powe r are liable to sin more ; no theorem in geometry is more certain than this.

There is no Sovereignty where People have fallen prey to the Mind Control agendas of the Men who Rule from the shadow s. There is no Sovereignty for People who will not bargain for their rights. There is no Sovereignty for People who lack the courage to face evil and stare it down . To think that you have Sovereignty while nurturing these things is to live a fantasy. Before you can be free, it is imperative that you come to understand how you are currently being controlled.

All of this is from document ed, historical sources. Yet we continue to believe the myths that are in their histories, their movi es, their mainstream media and their mass consciousnes s. Mr. John Fitzgerald Kennedy warned us that: \"The great enemy of the Truth is very often not the lie - deliberate, contrived, and dishonest - but the myth -persistent, persuasive and realistic.\" You will probably find it hard to accept that you have been living in an illusion for your whole life. Much of what you believe is an illusion and you will only find your freedom when you can allow yourself to look behind the veils of illusion to see Reality. WHO you are is far greater than \"what\" you perceive yourself to be. When you have the courage to stand face-to-face with the illusion and call it what it is, you will have stepped through the most difficult task set before you on your Earth Journey. There IS a way out! But the only way out is through-through understanding how we came to this predicament and by following a precise formu la to obtain your Sovereignty from the illusion. We have been warned repeatedly throughout their history, but we were n't listening very closely. Now, we might have one more chance to take back our power and our Sovereignty from those who seek to control, through the creative rewriting of history, all People (as subjects). We're in this predicament because we have failed to accept liability of self-government in support of the International Public Order by emerging into a political status that all ows us to freely determine our own futures that are established not only for ourselves but for our posterity. All our life we've looked for the roots of war, injustice and oppression because, if we can find the basis of the rampant injustice in the world, we could relieve enormous struggle and suffering. We've wondered at how little the so-ca lled Const itution seemed to affect the courts and how often the truth was buried in silence. Most ly we saw greed and heartle ssness in a power struggle played out in politic s. But we didn't realize that the game had been played in secret throughout their American history.

Plus, the true hidden knowledge that the documentary evidence and principal application as to how rights and privileges or immunities are establish ed or enforc ed, are never revealed to the People by and through the systems of educational institutions, not for their benefit, but for the sole and express benefit to keep control of all People through such centers of education from Womb to Tomb.

In Orwellian doubles peak, the Chief Justice, Mr. Antonin Scalia wrote on Saturday, December 9, 1999: \"The counting of the votes that are of questionable legality does, in my view, threaten irreparable harm to [Bush], and to the country, by casting a cloud upon which he claims to be the legitimacy of his election. Count first, and rule upon legality afterwards, is not a recipe for producing election results that have the public acceptance democratic stability requires. \" It was a brazen and Orwellian declarat ion. What so-ca lled American who attempts to continue to believe in a democracy could claim that something was wrong with counting votes \"first?\" What so-ca lled American who attempts to continue to believe in a democracy could declare one candidate the winner and protect him from \"irreparable harm\" if a vote count showed him not to be the winner, after all? Of course, it doesn't make any sense, unless you realize the foundation upon which Mr. Antonin Scalia based his transparently partisan remar ks. He doesn 't believe in democracy, he doesn 't even believe in republicanism, he is a monarchist, who is only enfor cing, shall we say, Martial Law, where he decides the outcome of the assumed political vote of the People via Orders of the Comman der-In-Chief. Mr. Antonin Scalia revealed his true motivat ions when he spoke on the subject of capital punish ment at the University of Chicago (February 2002). During his remar ks, he stated: \"The reaction of people of faith to this tendency of democracy to obscure the divine authority behind government should not be resigned to it, but the resolution to combat it as effectively as possible.\" Democracy obscuring divine authority behind government? Perhaps this helps shed some light on why Mr. Antonin Scalia and the four other right-wing \"Justices,\" or so-ca lled left­ wing \"Justices,\" watch it happen without raising a public outcry that could so easily subvert what we have been taught as being our election pr ocess and, through an act of divine (Justice) intervention, usher the Son onto the throne lost some eight years earlier by his father, George I. We are assuming that we are still Independent Sovereigns and so-ca lled freemen as declared by their (our as sumed) Declaration of Independence and that their Constitution is still in effect. Mr. Antonin Scalia has no such illusion. History supports his position, sorry to say. Mr. Antonin Scalia is an ideologue so accus tomed to our acceptance and willingn ess to continue to be subjects of their beliefs, which were given to us to control us, that he does not even consider the ideal of a government of, by, and for the people because he truly knows it never exist ed for anyone other than those who were signatory to the creation of the socia l compact for their benefit and that of their posterity and the present condition of the so-ca lled Military Social Government Construct known as the United States.

Mr. Antonin Scalia speaks of civil disobedie nce with contempt and quotes the Bible, \"Ye must needs be subject.\" We must, as mere servants of the ruling class, acquiesce to their divinely guided leade rs. For who are we, as mere subjects, to question those who make (or interpret) the laws? After all, he says that \"Government carries the sword as 'the minister of Go d,' to 'execute wrath' upon the evildoer. \" No, he has not reverted to a justice of another time-WE have by our ignorance and silence, acqui esced to a lower status remini scent of another time by accepting their history as ours and allowing their tools of public education to continue to foist upon us, and our posterity, delusionary concepts which reduces not only ourselves but our children to utter slavery. There you have it! In his eyes, we are subjects unworthy of honor, peace and justice. Somehow Mr. Antonin Scalia's statements seem like a long way from the Declaration of Independence in which so-ca lled Americans were taught that they stood before the world as Sovereigns invest ed with certain Unalienable Birthrights, including the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happin ess. After the so-ca lled American Revolut ion, the Monarchies of Europe saw Democrac y as an unnatural, ungodly, ideologica l threat, every bit as radical and dangerous as Commu nism was regarded by West ern nations upon its incept ion. Just as the 1917 Communi st Revolution in Russia spawned other revolutions around the world, the so-ca lled American Revolution provided an example and incentive for people all over the world to overthrow their European Monarchies or other such forms of government which were oppressive. What has happened ? When did we give up our natural, Creator-Given rights ? The Declaration of Independence recognized that all People are Sovereign under Natural Law of the Supreme Creator's Pillars of Universal Law. Sovereign People of the various E'States, created the social compact State governments for the protection of their rights and that of their posterity. They delegated certain authority from their assumed powers of the Earth to which the Laws of Nature and Nature 's Creator entitle them by and through the contractual state Const itutions in order that the three branches of their government could presumably carry out the dictates outlined in their agency compact party State Constitut ions to protect their rights and that of their future posterity. The agency States then created the socia l compact Union of States known as \"The United States of America.\" The so-ca lled Constitution of the United States for The United States of Amer ica created a new structure of a compact party agenc y gove rnment that was established on a much more divided plan of agenc y government than either the parliamentary system or the confederation of The United States of Amer ica.

That it was the 'people ' who instituted gove rnment and in so doing, the people \"secur ed these rights, \" and that government (at every level) derives their ''just powers from the consent of the govern ed. \" It also a well established fact that the people did not give up all of their 'power' to governmen t(s). The Decla ration of Independence created the sovereignty in the people, not in government.

In regards to the principles established in The Declaration of Independence and the subs e q uent ' C onstitutions' written and create d after it, and of the true sovereignty, a written Const itution is not only the direct and basic expression of the sovereign will, it is also the absolute rule of action and decision for all departments arid offices of government with respect to all matters covered by it and preceding after it, and it must control as it is written until it is changed by the authority which established it.

To this we answer: We The People ... ordain and establish this Constitution\" ... the government of the state had only delegated power (from the People) and even if they had an inclination, they had no authority to transfer the authority of the Sovereign People. The people in their capacity as Sovereigns made and adopted the Constitution; and it binds the state governments without the state's consent. The United States, as a whole, therefore, emanates from the People and not from the states, and the Constitution and laws of the states, whether made before or since the adoption of that Constitution of the United States, are subordinate to the United States Constitution and the laws made in pursuance of it. The people are the Fountain of sovereignty. The whole was originally with them as their own. The state governments are but trustees acting under a derived authority, and had no power to delegate what is not delegated to them. But the people, as the original Fountain, might take away what they have lent and in trust to whom they please.

Every transaction is now considered by the United States, INC. to be a commercial transaction by fictional entities (fictions at law) operated by their agents, empl oyees and all representatives and officers of their corporati on. What is a Fiction at Law? A fiction at law, or a legal fiction, is an artificially created entity that is only contemplated in law. In other words, it is not real except in the eyes of the law written by men. Legal fictions are the opposite of natural entities, such as people . A created legal fiction is endowed by the law to have some privileges that resemble the rights that people have, such as the right to hold property and to sue and be sued. The most common legal fictions are corporations and trusts. These have been around for quite some time with their main purpose being to limit the liability of the people holding the corporation or trust, allowing them to NOT be personally responsible for their actio ns. As to corporat ions, they can do one thing that you cannot, they can live forever ! Legal Fictions are not compatible with the Common Law, which is the law our land was founded upon. In common law, everyone is responsible for his own actions and is held accountable and responsible for any wrongdoing (harming another in any way) What does this have to do with me? In 1933, the governors of all the states met to discu ss the \"emergency\" declared by FDR and to support the new process that was being established. The \"government\" was in bankruptcy and had to be funded in its state of bankruptc y. The governors made a \"pledge\" to the United States, INC. to fund it. The pledge was that the assets and the energy of the people (YOU) would back the \"government\" and secure the debt. But there was one little problem, natural living people cannot mix with legal fictions (corp orations) so it was necessa ry to create a \"bridge\" between the fictions and the people to bring the people under control and make them subservient to the REDEM PTION MANUA L - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 257"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"\"government\" corporation via their pledge . When the governors made the pledge, they agreed to regis ter the birth certif icates of the people with the U.S. Department of Com merce. The birth certificate is the security instrument (colla teral) used to back up the pledge . The legal fiction was created by using the name on the birth certificate and writing it in all capital letters, the desig nation for a legal fiction . Then, because of the \"pledge\" YOU were determined to be the surety for the legal fiction . Surety means: The one who is responsi ble to pay. So, when the government or any corporation uses any process whatsoever, they are using it against the legal fiction, which they want YOU to think IS YOU. But when your name is written in all capital letters, IT IS NOT YOUR NAME ! It is the desig nation of a legal fiction that is an entirely separate entity. A living flesh and blood man cannot be a legal fiction, and a legal fiction cannot be a living flesh and blood man. One is real or natural, the other is created by \"law\" and is a 'fiction !' Whenever a gove rnment agency (such as a court) determines liability, it is a liability directed to or laid upon the legal fiction or the 'Straw-man ' since everything is done in commerce with fictions/corporate entities. You are presumed, as evidenced by the pledge of your governor, to be the surety for the Straw-man and you must pay the fine, fee, tax, debt or other liability. REMEM BER: Every transaction is presumed by the \"gove rnment\" to be a transaction in commerce by a legal fiction . What 's the Answer? The only way out of this is to overcome the presumption that you are the surety for the Straw­ man (legal fiction). That's why the \"Redemption Process\" is the ONLY way to defeat this presumption by using the Uniform Commercial Code, via Public Notice, which is the CODE that the fictional commercial world operates under. The first step is to \"Capture the Straw-man\" is to establish a security agreement between you and the Straw-man and then file a UCC-! financ ing statement to secure a claim via a 'superior security intere st' against the all capitalized legal fictiOn/Straw-man, the property and the colla teral. Said security interest or 'registration' of title/control is placed upon the Birth Certif icate, Social Security Accou nt, Drivers License, etc., by and through 'acceptance for value.' Included in the proce ss is the creation of a power of attorney, copyright notic e, and hold­ harm less indemnity agreement. The UCC- ! financing statement (security interest. .. and a lien) and the filing of the existence of these documents will REDEEM you and your Debtor/Straw-man from the commercial system and establish documented evide nce to overcome the presumption that you are the surety for the Straw-man. When all has been 'accepted for value ,' including the birth certificate, YOU become the Holder in Due Course of all the documents , collateral and the property and are now in commercial control of the property, the colla teral and the Debtor. There is a 'Charge Back Process' that goes back to the United States Treasury to charge-up what is called your \"ucc CONTRACT TRU ST ACC OUNT ,\" identified by your/the Debtor/Straw­ man's \"Social Security Number\" (See the two invest igative articles on the Treasury & IRS via the Redemption Companion - Books & materials List in the Append ix).

Around the time of the war between the United States and the southern states of the American union, the United States was busy putting together their plan that would increase the jurisdiction of the United States. This plan was necessa ry because the United States was in debt, had few subjects and only the land ceded to it from the states, i.e., the 'District of Columbi a' which was only ten miles square (+/-) and such other as ne cessa ry was only for forts, magazine s, arsenal s, etc. Between the 1860's and the early 1900's, banking and taxing mechani sms were changing through legislation . Cunning people closely associa ted with the powers in England had great influence on the legisla tion being passed in the United States. Of course such legislation did not apply to the states or to the people in the states, but making the distinction was not deemed to be a necessary duty of the legisla tors. It was the respon sibility of the people to understand their relationship to the United States and to the laws that were being passed by the legisla ture. This distinction between the United States and the states was taught in the homes and the schools and churche s. The early admiralty courts did not interpret legisla tion as broadly at that time because the people knew when the courts were overst epping their jurisdictio n. The people were in control because they knew who they were and where they were standing in relation to the United States Corpora tion. In 1913, the United States added numerous private laws to its books that facilitated the increase of subjects (the newly so-ca lled freed slaves from the Civil War) as property of the United States. The 14th Amendment provided for a new class of citizens - United States citizens that had not formerly been recognized. Until the 14th Amendment in 1868, there were no persons born or naturalized in the United States. They had all been born or naturalized in one of the several states. United States citizensh ip was a result of state citizen ship. After the Civil War, a new class was recognized, and was the beginning of the democracy first positioned in the District of Colum bia. The American people in the republic to be found in the several States, could choose to benefit as one of these new United States citizens BY CHOICE . The new class of citizens was given the privilege to vote in the democracy in 1870 by the 15th Amendment. These new citizen subjects were required to apply for marriage, regis ter to vote, register births, deaths, etc. All it required was an application . Benefits came with this new citizenship, but with the benefits , came duties and responsi bilities and liabilit ies that were totally regulated by the legislature for the District of Columbi a. Edward Mandell House is attributed with giving a very detailed outline of the plans to be implemented to ensla ve the American people . (1) The 13th Amendment in 1865 opened the way for the people to volunteer into slavery to accept the benefits offered by the United States. Whether House actually spoke the words or not is really irrelevant because the scenario detailed in the statement attributed to him has clearly been implement ed. Central banking for the United States was legislated with the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. The ability to decrease the currency in circulation through taxation was legislated with the 16th Amendment in 1913. Support for the presumption that the American people had volunteered to participate in the United States democracy was legislated with the 17th REDEM PTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 261"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Amendment in 1913 . The path was provided for the control of the courts by the British Crown, with the creation of the American Bar Associa tion in 1913. In 1917, the United States legislature passe d the Trading with the Enemy Act and the Emergency War Powers Act, opening the doors for the United States to suspend limitati ons otherwise mandated in the Constitutio n. Even in times of peace, every contrived and created social, political, or financial emergency was sufficient authority for the office rs of the United States to overstep its peace time powe rs and implement volumes of \"law\" that would increase the cof fers of the United States. There is always a declared emergency in the United States and its States (adm inistrative units ), but it only applies to their subjects. In the 1920's, the States accelerated the push for mothers to register their babies as first required upon the new federal property - the so-ca lled freed Black slaves. Life was good and people were not paying attention to what was happening in government. The stock market crashed, and those who were not on the inside were not warned to take their money out before they lost everyt hing. In the 1930' s, federal legisl ation provided for registration of babies through applications for birth certificates, so government workers could get maternity leave with pay. The States pushed for registration (surrender of ownership) of cars through applications for certificates of title, and for registration of land through registration of deeds of trust, which turned the land over to the State. Const ructive trusts were secretly created as each of the people blindly walked into the United States democrac y, thereby agreeing to be sureties for the debts of the United States. The great depression supplied the diversion to keep the people 's attention off what gove rnment was doing. The Social Security program was implemented, along with numer ous other United States programs that invited the American people to volunteer to be the sureties behind the United States' new registered property and adhesion contracts through the new United States subjects. The plan was well on its path by 1933. Massive regis tration (surrender) of property through United States agenci es, including the 'State' subdivisi ons, was assuring that the United States and its officers would get rich beyond their wildest expectati ons. All of this was done without full disclo sure of the material facts that accompanied each application for registration. Is that fraud? The fraud was a sufficient reason to charge all the United States officers with treason, UNL ESS a remedy could be supplied for the people to recoup their property and collect for the damages they suffered as a result of the fraud. If a remedy was availa ble, and the people chose not to or failed to use the remedy, no charge of fraud could be sustained even in a common law court. The United States only needed to provide the remedy. It was not required to explain it or even tell the people where the remedy could be found. The attorneys did not even have to be taught about the remedy. That gave them plausible deniability when the people struggled to understand the new laws. The legislators did not have to have the intricate details of the law expla ined to them regarding the bills they were passing. That gave them plausible deniability. If the people failed to use their remedy, the United States came out the winner every time. If the people did discover their remedy, the United States had to honor it and release the registered property back to the people, but only if the people knew they had a remedy, and only if they requested it in the proper manner. It was a great plan.

Passing new State and Federal laws that appeared to subject the people to rules and regulat ions, added another level of protection against the people finding their remedy. The public 'socialist medi a' was molded to report politically correct, though substantially incorrect news day after day, until few people would even think there could be a remedy available to them . The people could be separated from their money and their time to pursue the remedy long enough for the solutions to be lost in the millions of pages of the books in huge law libraries across the country. So many people knew there was something wrong with all the conflicts in the laws with the \"facts\" taught in the government schools. How can the American people be free and sub ject to a de-facto government 's whims at the same time? Who would ever have thought the people would be resourcef ul enoug h to actually find the remedy? BUT they did! (2) In 1933 the United States put its insurance policy into place with House Joint Res olution 192 and recorded it in the Congressional Record. It was not required to be promulgated in the Federal Regist er. An Executive Order issued on April 5, 1933 paved the way for the withdrawal of gold in the United States. Representative Louis T. McFadden brought formal charges on May 23, 1933 against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank system, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Secretary of the United States Treasury (Congressional Record May 23, 1933 page 4055-4058). HJR 192 passed on June 3, 1933. Mr. McFadden claimed on June 10, 1933: \"Mr. Chairman, we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known . I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks ... \" HJR 192 is the insurance policy that protects the legisla tors from conviction for fraud and treason against the American people. It also protects the American people from damages caused by the actions of the United States. For speaking like he did, Mr. McFadden was poisoned by the powers that be by agents of that federal corpora tion. HJR 192 provided that the one with the gold paid the bills. It removed the requirement that the United States subjects and employees had to pay their debts with gold. It actually prohibited the inclusion of a clause in all subsequent contracts that would require payment in gold. It al so cancelled the clause in every contract written prior to June 5, 1933, that required an obligation to be paid in gold - retro actively. It provided that the United States subjects and employees could use any type of coin and currency to discha rge a public debt as long as it was in use in the normal course of busin ess in the United States. For a time, United States Notes were the currency used to discharge debts, but later the Federal Reserve and the United States provided a new medium of exchange through paper notes, and debt instruments that could be passed on to a debto r's creditors to discha rge the debto r's debts . That same currency, Federal Reserve Notes, is used to discharge public debts. Take Note : the Federal Reserve Notes have no value, as stated by the Federal Reserve! In the 1950's, the Uniform Commercial Code was presented to their States as a means of unifying the generally accepted procedures for handling the new legal system of dealing with commercial transactions and fictions as though they were real. Security instruments (commercial paper) replaced substance as colla teral for debts. Security instruments could be supported by REDEMP TION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 263"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"presumptive contra cts. Debt instruments with colla teral, and accommodating parties, could be used instead of mone y. Money (of exchange) and the need for money was disappea ring, and NEW money was being created i.e., 'Money of Account' (created by Bill of Exchange) and a uniform system of laws had to be put in place to allow the commercial venue and the courts to uphold the security instruments that depended on commercial fictions as a basis for compelling payment or perform ance (see 'Tender of Payment in your State statute !) .. All this was accompl ished by the mid 1960's. And by 1964, most all the States had adopteu the Uniform Commercial Code. The commercial code is merely a codification of accepted and required procedures all people engaged in commercial activities must follow. The basic principles of commerce had been settled thousands of years ago, but were refined and became more sophisticated over the years . In the 1900's, the age-old principles of com merce shifted from substance to form. Presumption became a big part of the law. Without giving a degree of force to presumption, the new direction in enforc ing commercial claims could not be suppor ted in their courts. If the claimants were required to produce their claims every time they tried to collect money or time from the people, they would seldom be successful. The principles expressed in the code combined the means of dealing with subst antive commercial activities with the means of dealing with presum ptive commercial activiti es. These principl es work as well for the people as they do for the deceivers . The rules do not respect person s. Those who enticed the people to register (surrender) their property (land, cars, guns, childr en, etc.) to the sub-divisions (State s) under dictate by the United States, gained control of the substance through the 'registration s' and the States were able to extract more 'use' taxes, from the people to use the property of the State! The States and the United States became the Holder of the titles to all the property, even children and many other things. The definition of \"property\" is the intere st one has in a thing. The thing is the principal . The property is the interest in the thing. Profits (intere st) made from the property of another belong to the owner of the thing. Profits were made by the deceivers by pledging the registered property in commercial markets, but the profits do not belong to the deceivers . The profits belong to the owners of the 'things.' That is always the people. The corporation only shows ownership of paper - titles to things. The subst ance cannot appear in the fiction . [Watch the movie Last Action Hero and watch the confusion created when they try to mix substance and fiction.] Sometimes the fiction is made to look very much like substa nce, but fiction can never become substa nce. It is an impossi bility ! The profits from all the registered things had to be put into a 'constructive' trust for the benefit of the owners . If the profits were put into the general fund of the United States and not into separate trusts for the owners , the scheme would represent fraud. The profits for each owner could not be co-m ingled. If the owner failed to use his available remedy (fictional credits held in a const ructive trust account, fund, or financia l ledge r) to benefit from the profits, it would not be the fault of the deceive rs. If the owner failed to learn the law that would open the door to his remedy, it would not be the fault of the deceivers . The owner is responsible for learning the law, so he understands that the profits from his things are available for him to discha rge debts or charges brought against his public person (Debtor-S traw-man) by the United State s.

The definition of \"fund\" is money set aside to pay a debt. The fund is there to discha rge the public debts attributed to the United States subjects, but ultimately back to the accommodating parties - the American people . The national debt is what is owed is to the owners of the registered things - the American people, as well as to other creditors ! If the United States owes a debt to the owner of the thing, and the owner is presumed (by accommodation) to owe a public debt to the United States, the logical thing is to ask the United States to discharge that public debt from the trust fund. The way for the United States to get around having to pay the public debts for the people is to claim the owner cannot be an owner if he agreed to be the accommodating party for a debtor -person . If the people are truly the principle, then they know how to handle their financial and political affairs, ULN ESS they have never been taught. If the owner admits by his actions out of ignora nce, that he is an accommodating party, he has taken on the debto r's liabilities without getting consid eration in excha nge. Here lies the fiction again. The owner of the thing does not have to knowingly agree to be the accommodating party for the debtor person; he just has to act like he agreed. That is easy if he has a choice of going to jail or signing for the debtor-pers on. The presumption that he is the accommodating party is strong enough for the courts to hold the owner of the thing liable for a tax on the thing he actually owns or owes . Debtors may have the 'use' of certain things, but the things belong to the credito rs. The creditor is the master. The debtor is the servant . The Uniform Commercial Code is very specif ic about the duties and responsi bilities a debtor has. If the owne r of the thing is pre sumed to be a debtor because of his previous admi ssions and adhesion contra cts, he is going to have a difficult time convincing the United States that it has a duty to discha rge public debts for him. In addition, the courts are staffed with loyal judges who will look for every mistake the people may make when trying to use their remedy. Now the quasi- owner (user) of the property (thing), after learning the law and discovering who he is in relation to the United States Corporat ion, can file a UCC Financing Statement based upon a Security Agreement, regist ering his security interest in the artificial entity DEBTORf PERSON, being the ENS LEGIS which the United States created after your Mom signed the 'Root of TitlelNewborn Identif ication' and then was compelled to apply for a birth certif icate.

Until your Financing Statement is filed, the United States is the holder of the title to the artificial entity . Its name is spelled in all capital letter - JOHN HENRY DOE. When John Henry Doe files the Financing Statement supported by a Security Agreement signed by the artificial entity (JOHN) and the owner (John) , he becomes the holder in due course of the title to JOHN. The UCC and the State commercial law are very specific about the effect of a registered security interest. It has priority over most other interest claimed (only claimed) in the same thing. The evidence that is missing in the court is the registered claim over the person (JOHN) . The owner also must notify the Secretary of the Treasury that he is going to handle his own affairs in the future.

You cannot go into the public because you are not a fiction. JOHN has no power until it is charged with some energy. That energy comes from an IRS default notic e, court judgment, credit card bill, utility bill, traffic ticket, or some other instrument that has a $ amount and JOHN'S name on it as the presumed debtor.

You probably retained posses sion of the thing, but the United States/S tates invested the title and made a profit. If you did not specifically authorize the United States/State and its agents to invest the legal title, the profits made from that title belong to you, because as the owner, you remain the equitable title holder. Lega lly, all the profits from the invest ment of the titles to all your registered things must go into a fund for your benefit. If they did not put the profits in a trust fund of some sort, it would be fraud. Just acquiring the tit les through what is promoted as mandatory registration, is fraud.

Today the majority of Americans pay taxes because when they get a job their employer requests that they fill out either: Internal Revenue Service Form W-2, Form W-4, or Form 1099, which, as a direct result, withholds taxes from their paychecks for their labor. The majority doesn't have a clue as to why they are paying these taxes in the first place, other than being conditioned to pay their so-called 'Fair Share! ' It has been affirmed that labor is a fundamental, unalienable, protected right and this fundamental right is not supposed to be taxed. No profit of gain is to be realized via your labor! It is presumed that everyone is expected to know the law. It has been long held that, ignorance of the Law is not an excuse or a defense. There is a well-established maxim that states, \"He who fails to assert his rights - HAS NONE! \" which unequivocally establishes that, just as a closed mouth never gets fed, \"a matter must be expressed to be resolved.\" The Bible, Book of Luke, 11 t h Chapter 52n d verse states: \"Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering ye hindered. \" When it comes to dealing with lawyers, government, and the Internal Revenue Service (which is not an agency of the United States Government, but a private foreign-owned corporation) withholding and keeping knowledge from the people is nothing new. It is a common business tactic that has been going on from the beginning of its inception. It will, most likely continue as long as we rely upon lawyers and government to do that which we ourselves should be doing. The Bible unquestionably verifies this with the following: Book of Isaiah, 5 t h Chapter 13th verse tells us: \"Therefore my peo � le are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge;\" and the Book of Hosea, 4 Chapter 6 t h verse: \"My people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge. \" In order to find the answer as to why your labor is being taxed when the Constitution says it is not supposed to be, it is necessary to understand how government exists and operates. To accomplish this requires a quick review back in history to the time of the War Between the States. The People of this Nation lost their true Republican form of government. On March 27, 1861 seven southern States walked out of Congress leaving the entire legislative Branch of Government without quorum. The Congress of the Constitution was dissolved for inability to disband or re-convene. The Republican form of Government, which the People were guaranteed - ceased to exist. Out of necessity to operate the Government, President Lincoln issued Executive Order No. 2. in April 1861, reconvening the Congress at gunpoint in Executive, emergency, martial-law-rule jurisdiction. Since that time there has been no \"'d e jure\" (sanctioned by law) Congress. Everything functions under \"color of law\" (the appearance or semb lance, without substance, of legal right.) Through Executive Orders under authority of the War Powers, (i.e. emergency, i.e. law of necessity) the \"law of necessity\" means no law whatsoever, as per such maxims of law as: REDEMP TION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 267"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"\"Necessity knows no law\" (the law of forbidding killing is voided when done in self­ defen se). \"In time of war, laws are silent.\" Cicero. To establish the underlying debt of the Government to the Bankers, to create corporate entities that are legally subject to the jurisdiction in which they exist, and to create the jurisdiction itself correctly, the so-ca lled (fraudulent and un-ratified) Fourteenth Amendment was proclaimed and passed in 1868. This was a cestui que trust (operation in law) incorporated in a military, private, International, commer cial, de facto jurisdiction created by, and belonging to, the Money Power, existing within the emergency of the War Powers , the only operational jurisdiction since the dissolution of Congress in 1861. Through the 14 t h Amendment, an artificial person-c orporate entity-f ranchise entitled \"citizen of the United States\" was born into private, corporate limited liability. Section 4 of the 14 t h Amendment states: \"The validity of the Public Debt of the United States (to the Bankers) ... shall not be quest ioned .\" Within the above-referenced private jurisdiction of the International Bankers, the private and foreign owned \"Congress\" formed a corporation, commercial agency, and Government for the \"District of Columbi a\" on February 21, 1871, Chapter 62, 16 Stat. 419. This corporation was reorganized June 11, 1878, Chapter 180, 20 Stat. 102, and re­ named \"United States Government .\" This corporation privately trade marked the names: \"United States,\" \"U.S.,\" \"US,\" \"U.S .A.,\" \"USA\" and \"Americ a.\" When the United States declared itself a municipal corporation, it also created what is known as a cestui que trust to function under by implementing the Federal Const itution of 1871, and incorporating the previous United States Constitut ions of 1787 and 1791 as amended, as by-la ws. Naturally, as the grantor of the trust, this empowered the United States Government to change the terms of the trust at will. As evidenced under the Federal Const itution of 1871, the 14 t h Amendment, the People of the United State s, without their consent, were declared \"Citizens\" and granted \"Civil Rights .\" These so­ called civil rights are nothing more than mere privile ges. Privileges which government licen ses, regulate s, and can re-interpret to suit its purposes at any time for any reas on. The Federal Corporate Gove rnment also conv eniently somehow forgot to disclose to the People that the term \"Citizen ,\" with which they have made every living and breathing inhabitant a \"subject,\" was defined in law as a \"Ves sel\" engaged in commer ce. In 1912 , when the bank-owned bonds that were keeping the US Government afloat became due, the Bankers refused to re-finance the debt. As a result, the colora ble, martial-law ruled Congr ess was compelle d to pass the Federal Rese rve Act of 1913 . This Act surrendered Const itutional authority to create, contr ol, and manage the entire money supply of the United States to a handful of private, mostly-f oreign banke rs. This placed exclusive creation and control of the money within the private, commercial, foreign, and military jurisdiction of 1861, into corporate limited liability. America converted from United States Notes to Federal Reserve Notes, beginning with the passage of The Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Federal Rese rve Banks were incorporated in 1914, and, in 1916 , began to circulate their private, corporate Federal Reserve Notes as \"money \" alongs ide the nations \"de jure\" currenc y, the United States Notes. Whereas United States Notes were actually ware house receipts for deposits of gold and silver in a warehou se (bank), thus representing wealth (substance, portable land; the money of soverei gns), the new flat money (Federal Rese rve Notes) amounted to \"bills for that which was yet to be paid, \" i.e. for what was owed ! For the new \"benefit\" of being able to carry around U.S. Gove rnment debt instruments (Federal Rese rve Notes) in our wallets instead of Gold Certif icates or Silver Certif icates, we agreed to redeem the newly REDEM PTION MANUA L - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 268"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"issued Federal Reserve Notes in gold and also to pay interest for their use in gold ONLY!

Through paying interest to the Federal Reserve Corporation in gold, the US Treasury became progr essively depleted of its gold. Amer ica's gold certif icates, coin, and bullion were continu ally shipped off to the coffers of various European Banks and Power Elite . In 1933, when the Treasury was drained and the debt was larger than ever (a financial condition known as \"Insolvency\"), President Roosevelt proclaimed the bankruptcy of the United States. Every 14 t h Amendment \"citizen of the United States\" was pledged as an asset to finance the Chapter 11 re-organization expenses and pay interest in perpetuity to the CREDITORS (Federal Reserve Bankers) and the \"national debt\" (\"which shall not be questioned \").

Under House Joint Reso lution 192 of June 5, 1933, Senate Report No. 93549, and Executive Orders 6072, 6012 and 6246, the Cong ress and President Roosevelt officially declared bankruptcy of the United States Government. Regar dless of the cause or reason, what many Amer ican's either do not understand and/or have failed to seri ously grasp, is that by the use of Federal Rese rve Notes; (which is not Cons titutional Money defined under Article I Section 10 of the United States Constitut ion), the People of the United States, since 1933, have not had any Const itutionally lawful way to pay their debts. They, therefore, have not had any way to buy or own property. The People, for the benefits granted to them by a bankrupt corporate Government, discha rge their debts with limited liability using Federal Reserve Notes. They have surrendered, by way of an unconscionable contract, any semblance of 'Rights ' as exchanges for mere privileg es! A review of countle ss United States Supreme Court decisions since the 1938, landmark case, Erie Railroad v. Tompk ins, (304 U.S. 64-92) clearly establishes that only the State has Const itutional Righ ts, not the Peop le. The People have been pledged to the bankruptcy of 1933. The federal law administered in and by the United States is the private commercial \"law\" of the CREDITOR S. That, due to the bankrup tcy, every \"citizen of the United States\" is pledged as an asset to support the bankr uptcy, must work to pay the insurance prem iums on the underwriting necessa ry to keep the bankrupt government in operation under Chapter II Bankruptcy (Reorganizat ion).

How can all this really be? Why haven't you been told all of this before now? Ignorance of the law is no excuse. Every man is deemed (required) to know the law.

The majority of Amer ican's have been given a Public government Education to teach them only what the Public, i.e. government (CREDI TORS ) wants them to know. It is and always has been each individual 's personal respon sibility, duty and obligation to learn and know the law. What this breaks down to is this: Back in 1933, when their United States went into bankruptcy because it could no lon ger pay its debts , it pledged the American People, themsel ves, without their consent as the asset to keep the government afloat and operating. Because government no longer had any way to pay its debts with subst ance, and was bankrupt, it lost its sovereignty and standing in law. Outside and separate from Const itutional Government, to continue to function and operate, it created an artificia l world consist ing of artificia l entities. This was accompl ished by taking everyo ne's proper birth given name and creating what is called a \"fiction in law,\" by way of an acronym, i.e. a name written in ALL-CAPITAL -LETTERS to interact with. A name written in ALL­ CAPITAL-LETTERS is not a sentient, flesh and blood man. It is a corporati on, fiction or deceased person. Government, as well as all corporat ions, including the Internal Revenue Service, cannot interact with you or interact with you via your proper name given you at birth, only through your ALL-CA PITAL-LET TERS-NAME! Another little tidbit of knowledge which has been conve niently kept from the People is this: When the Several united States signed the treaty with Great Britain ending the Revolutionary War, it was a concession that ALL COMMERCE would be regulated and contracted through British Attorney's known as Esquires only. This condition and concession still exists today. No attorney or lawyer in the United States of America has ever been \"licens ed\" to practice law (they've exempted them selve s) as they are a legal fiction \"person\" and only an \"ADMITTED MEMBER\" to practice in the private franchise club called the BAR (which is itself an acronym for the British or Barrister Aristocratic Accreditation Regency), and as such are un-regi stered foreign agents, and so they are traito rs.

To try and break this down even furth er: Few people truly understand the words \"slave and slavery .\" The biggest benef it in filing a UCC-I Financ ing Statement is that you will no longer be a slave. The fact is, most dictionaries fail to provide an accurate definition of the words \"slave and slavery.\" Even Webste r's 1828 edition of the Engli sh language dictionary fails in its attempt to define the true meaning of the word \"slavery\" : \"Slave: a person who is wholly subject to the will of another,\" Slavery is not a matter of being totally 100% subject to the will of another. Any person who is to any degree involuntarily subject to the will of another, is still a slave. There are no degrees of slavery. The second part of the 2 n d definition of slave provided by Webster's 1828 Edition is: \"One who surrenders himself to any power whatsoever,\" which is closer to the real point. The Uniform Commercial Code [UCC] governs ALL commercial transactions in the United States. Any \"person\" including government corporat ions, agencies, etc., involved in the \"sales of goods , commercial paper, bank deposits and collections, letters of credit, bulk transfer, warehouse receip ts, bills of lading, investment securit ies, and 'secured transact ions' is gove rned by the UCc . The A form of Uniform Commercial Code is adopted by all States. To comply with the Uniform Commercial Code in your state, a UCC-I Financing Statement must be filed with the Secretary of State, by anyone who makes a claim against any other \"person\" in the area of commer ce. All government agenc ies, (city, county, state and federal ), operate in commerce and all of them, including the Internal Revenue Service, are private corporations (persons). All Courts operate in commer ce. All Banks operate in commer ce. All \"Corporat ions\" operate in commerce and all of these \"entitie s\" exist financially because WE are their colla teral. They borrow on our \"credit.\" At one time, our currency was backed by or given subs tance by gold or silver. It has been thought by many, since their United States took the substance of gold and silver away, that Federal Rese rve Notes were simply worthl ess paper, backed by nothing at all. That is not correct! Today, real people, you, me, your children, etc. back Federal Reserve Notes, much the same way that gold and silver did in the past. In other words, the living, breathing people guarantee or provide the subst ance for ALL money that is created. The Federal Reserve Bank clearly states: \"Federal Reserve Notes are backed by the Full faith and credit of the American People .\" Blind Faith sets forth that YOU trust THEM . Who ? None other than the Federal Rese rve! Credit means something is due you! The Federal Reserve uses our credit to create ALL mone y. All of the money created belongs to the American People and the deceit of the Public and private corporations is so complete that they create it, charge it to us as a debt, and then tack interest to it on top of that!

It was given to the Federal Rese rve by a corporation called the United States, the very same corporation that created the Federal Rese rve.

That is how the American People became colla teral for the Federal Rese rve Notes and so-called debts . The American People became wareh ouse receipts, like a warehouse full of any type of valuable goods. All of this, however, was a major fraud. Neither the Internal Revenue Service nor any other entity of Government files a UCC-I Financing Statement into the Commercial Regis try with the Secretary of State . If they did, they would instantly become subject to all the regulations of the Uniform Commercial Code. The Internal Revenue Service has done very nicely by bluffing and intimidation, as all others mentioned, by operating under \"Public Policy\" where there is in reality \"No Law\" at all! The State Citizen is drawn \"into commer ce\" when their Birth Certificate is registered and sent to the Commerce Department in Washington, D.C. This is where the American People became warehouse receipts upon which all of the money printed and circulated is created and guaranteed. In short, the American People became the collateral for all debts. They \"The People\" allegedly are \"Government \" proper ty! Government is a \"fiction\" and an artificial person and deals with us as a fiction or artificial persons only as stated before. To take this still to another level, let's use an example to explain and use the name of John Henry Smith. When John Henry Smith was born, his parents gave him the Christian name of John Henry and he shared the 'family' name of Smith with all the other members of his family. He was born a living, breathing 'sentient' being. When his Birth Certificate was sent to the Department of Commer ce, it was registered and the Government, because it was bankrupt, turned his \"real name \" into a fiction. His new fictional name became JOHN H. SMITH or John H. Smith. His ALL­ CAPITAL-LETTERS NAME was registered as a corporation at the Puerto Rico Department of State Corporations (Departamento de Estado - Divisi on de Corpora ciones) P.O. BOX 3271, SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO, 0090 4-327 1, making itfhim liable for taxes. He is now a fiction or artificial person ; a non-living, non-breathing \"person .\" It is a \"Straw-man\" (Lat. stramineus homo) or \"fiction\" upon which government brings all its so-ca lled charg es again st and NEVER does so again st the real person. Just like \"yours,\" his driver's license now reads JOHN H. SMITH or John H. Smith. When he signs a 1040 Tax Form, he dutifully fills out the form as John H. Smith and then signs his name \"under penalty of perjury,\" thereby admitting he will be responsible for all the taxes of JOHN H. SMITH, a fiction in law, corporat ion. Look at your drive r's license and see who it is issued to. How can government use a form of our name and tum it into a fiction (corporation) without our permi ssion? They can't, we sign our name to all of their form s, which is purely voluntary \"permission-in -ignora nce.\" In short, we do it to oursel ves! However, for those who wish to control and own this fiction and prohibit government corporat ions, including the Internal Revenue Service, from making so-ca lled charges again st it, the remedy is available to you. You do this by executing a UCC- 1 Financing Statement! John Henry Smith would simply do what Government and the Internal Revenue Service does not do: File your UCC- 1 Financing Statement into the Commercial Regist ry with the Secretary of State and claim EVERYTHING related to JOHN H.

John Henry Smith knows full well he must respond to the presentment he's just received from Internal Revenue in a timely manner.

John Henry Smith also knows that he is not to protest or argue the amount of deficiency in any tax case. If you are not required to file, you should not care whether they say you owe fifteen thousand dollars or one hundred and fifty million dollars . If you are not required to file, the amount doesn't matter. You never argue the amount because that is a fact issue. The reason for this is, usually when you receive a Notice of Deficiency, it is for some unworldly amount. The Internal Revenue Service wants you to run in and argue about the amount. The minute you say \"I don't owe that much,\" you have just agreed that you owed something and conceded jurisdiction. One of the proper methods is to, as soon as possible, send a CONDI TIONAL ACCEPTANCE FOR VALUE FOR PROOF OF CLAIM (CAF V) - to seek an agreement with the IRS, in relation to certain points and facts, that all you can do is discha rge the tax liability of your Debtor/Straw-man with Bill of Excha nge.

After filing your UCC-I Financing Statement, it becomes evidence of a \"Security Interest\" in the Debtor/f iction (aka Straw -man) whom the Internal Revenue Service uses to force, intimidate, threaten and compel the real flesh and blood man/woman to pay what are called taxes. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, a Financing Statement is used under Article IX to reflect a Public Record that there is a Security Interest or claim to the property /goods in question to secure a debt or interest. The Financing Statement is filed by the Security Holder (real man/woman) with the Secretary of State, or simila r public body, and as a result becomes Public Record and becomes evidence of title.

Holder in Due Course is defined as: \"Title Holder of the contra ct.\" Thus, whenever you see any advertisement in the paper by, as an example, a New Ca r Dealer offering you a new car at a certain price and you're attracted by what is offered, you are responding to an offer. You run right down to the car dealer and without knowing it become the victim of the oldest game of bait and switch in existence! Here is how the real shakedown works: After you settle on the car with all its opt ions and the price with the dealersh ip, you then sign your name to a contract, which in doing so, makes you the Offeror and the dealership the acceptor of that off er. It works the sa me identical way in every retail sa le in the country, including Real Estate. You lose, because the seller is the Holder of the contract and is in charge (and norma lly, the contract is to their benefit ... not yours !

They keep the original contract and original signatures and obediently enter the property into commerce as the lawyers intend ed. It is a diabolical scheme ! Whenever a Government Corporation sends you a letter, indictment, or anything else charging that you violated some statute or code, or that you owe some sort of tax or fine, think of that as an offer by the Government. For exampl e: let's say you receive a bill for property taxes. This is an offer by the tax office just like the new car dealer. There are several options that you have when you get the bill. The number one option which most people take is to write out a check for the amount due. A check, of course, is a debt instrument. Thus you are making a coun ter-of fer to the tax collect or, whom they of course will accept, but the debt HAS NOT been exting uished. It is simply added to the PUBLIC DEB T. Once again, you have become the victim of a bait and switch ! Let's use the same example as we've previ ously discus sed and this time, let's use a different tactic. Remember that the acceptor is in charg e. This time, let's simply Accept the \"tax bill\" for Value, with the right to discha rge after the IRS has established the agreement with you (as your only remedy is commercial discharge of the tax liability) . When you examine your property tax bill, you find out it is made out to a name (purportedly yours) in all capital letters . Which, as you've already discovered, is not you! It is a fiction created by the government. If you've done your homework, you've obtained a certified copy of your Birth Certificate from the Bureau of Vital Statistics in the State where you were born and have filed your UCC-I Financing Statement. Now you control all rights , title and interest in that all capital letter name character, including ALL contra cts, mortgages and pledg es. You're now in charge of anything dealing with your Debtor /fiction. It works the same way with Internal Revenue Service. They send the fiction a \"tax bill\" for $20,000.00. You, as the Secured Party Creditor of the Debtor/ fiction, you accept their presentment for Value, place a value of $20,0 00.00, for exampl e, on it and notify whoever sent you the presentment that you can request a copy of their fiduciary tax return (see Append ix). You can request this because all of the money created uses your creditllabor as collateral. The amount you use is \"dollar for dolla r.\" ACCEPTANCE FOR VALUE? Once the \"real, live, flesh and blood man/woman has filed a UCC-I Financing Statement supported with Security Agreement in place, taking \"all rights , title and intere st\" in the ALL-C APITAL-LETTERED FICTION, ARTIFICIAL PERSON (that very so-ca lled REDEM PTION MANUA L - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 276"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"name may be spelled with a first name, middle initial and last name) or \"Straw­ ma n/ woman \" when a \" person \" (agen cy or other public or p rivate corporation) submits a letter, bill or form (presentment) sugge sting that you (when it's really the fiction) is being charged with a debt, taxes or whatever, a persona lized letter is sent to the person who signed the letter or form or to a person responsible for the letter or form or 'Bill' being sent to the fiction . That letter explains that you (the real deal) \"Acce pt the Charge for Value .\" This basically tells them you hold title to the FICTION and anything connected to the FICTION. It gives them NOTICE that they have committed a \"Trespass against your property ... Your Rights !\" It sets in stone that you are \"the Holder -in-Due-Co urse.\" This is a banking/securities term and requires a quick refre sher definit ion: \"In every contract there must be an offer, acceptance and a consi derat ion. Corporations specialize in bait-an d-sw itch tactics to protect them selves in every contractual arran gement . Such as, when you see a home you like, the real estate agency may have \"offered\" the home for sale through various adverti sements . This is an off er. You look at the home, like it, and the price is right . You tell the real estate agent \"Yes, I'll take it!\" At that point you have become the acceptor of the contract and, of cours e, the home and price is the considera tion. From a legal standpoint, this contract is completed. The offer, acceptance and consid eration are completed right then. The acceptor is the one \"in charge .\" That, at the moment, could be you. Then comes the old switch-a-r oo! Now is when the bait-and -switch goes down . The real estate agent (unwitt ingly, as though ignorance of the law is any excuse or defense) then requires you to fill out a FORM in which you make an Offer and They [the Seller] become the Acceptor ! The bait and switch is complete . It's that simple. You have now \"voluntar ily\" become a DEBTOR - \"forev er,\" even if you paid cash for the place or later pay off the mortgage. Why? Why can't you pay it off? YOU CANNOT EXTINGU ISH DEBTS WITH A DEBT INSTRUMENT (I.e. FEDERAL RESERVE NOT ES)! [Debt + Debt = Debt ; Credit ­ Debt = '0' and the debt is discha rged ... as a promise to pay!].\" You have voluntarily made someone else the Holder in Due Course of the propert y. They accepted the instrument (contract) FOR VALUE . They now own the property. \"All parts of the contract, including the deed are now \"recorded in the property recor ds. Look at your deed. It will have the, \"FICTION 'S\" written in all capital letters. All we really do is add to the so-ca lled National Debt whenever you pay those taxes and make that counter­ offer. The debt, however, does not change and remains the same whenever you purch ase anything in this manner. As an example, when you receive a Notice of Property -taxes on your home, the taxing authority is really making you an \"offer.\" When you pay the taxes you are making a counter-of fer, because your payment will not exting uish the debt or cancel it out. They will accept your counter-of fer, but the debt will still be there. By the way, the Notice of Property Tax due will be made out to your FICTION I DEBTOR ! Keep these things in mind when you purchase a home, land, auto, open a bank account, apply for a license, etc. You must make the contra ct! Make the seller the Offeror and yourself (the real flesh and blood man with your name spelled correctly) the acceptor of the offer. This puts you officia lly in charge ! You will be the Holder in Due Cour se. YOU keep the original contract and give the Offeror a copy. Do not record the contract unless you want to give up the 'Allodial ' title to the property. Record ings are not required as you are the sovereign and the original contract is all you need to prove and establish ownersh ip. You will want to do a UCC-3 Amendment filing and add the newly acquired property to your commercial affairs. Now with this explanation covered, let's move to the person/agency that wrote the letter or sent the bill (presentment) charging that your Debtor owes something.

And, as applied to some matter dealing with a 'contract,' i.e., Credit Card, not only is there that 'larger' amount - total due, there is also the issue as to the 'agreement/contract' as to: 1. Was there a meeting of the minds as to the contract? 2. Was there fraud on the contract? 3. Was it an unconscionable contract? To addre ss the above issues, as to a contract, you can utilize the CONDITIONAL ACCE PTANCE FOR V ALUE FOR PROOF OF CLAIM to allow the other side to provide 'Proof of Claim' that there was a meeting of the mind s, that there was no fraud on (in) the contract and/or that it was not an unconsci onable contract. At which time, per your agreement, you will continue to pay on or pay the contracted debt.

CONVENT IONS RECORDS: It is strongly recommended that you only use your original documents to make two color mast er copies and retire the original to your files immediately for safe keeping. If you are not equipped with a small fire proof safe, and can obtain one, this is also highly recommende d. Take the two master copies per original document to a notary for certifi cation.

SECURITY AGREEM ENT: The Security Agreement is the first document that must be filled out and notarized before proceeding with the rest of the process because it is the authority or basis for becoming a Secured Party Creditor. It is the agreement that transfers a security interest in personal property between the public side debtor (Straw-man) and the privat e-side creditor (secured party). The security interest is normally perfected either by the creditor taking possession of the collateral or by filing financing statements in the proper public recor ds. Once security agreement is perfected (filed first in time-first in line), you as creditor has first priority right of posses sion, and lien. (The UCC-l or 3 establishes 'superior security interest and lien' bad replacement title in the property as supported by your security agreement. Since all property has been pledged to the state and owned by the International Bankers, it now has been 'redeemed ' after the filings (UCC -l & 3's). 1.

Commencement of foreclosure, whether by action of a tribunal, self-help, repossession, or other method, by a creditor of DEBTOR against the collateral. 16.

Cur e of Default If a fault or dishonor under this agreement is curable through an account held by debtor but managed by the UNITED STATES or one of its subdivi sions, agents, officers, or affiliates, such fault or dishonor may be cured by the debtor with authorization by Secured Party; and upon advice by the fiduciary that the fault or dishonor has been cured, and no event of default will have occurred. A dishonor under this agreement, initiated by third party intervention, will not cause a default if such intervention is challenged by debtor by its good faith effort to confirm or disprove the validity or reasonablene ss of a public claim which is the basis of the public creditor 's proceeding; but debtor must, in that event, deposit such surety with secured party as is necessary to indemnif y the secured party from loss. Acceleration In the event of default, Secured Party may declare the entire indebtedness immediately due and payable without notice. Liquidation of Collateral In the event of default, Secured Party shall have full power to privately or publicly sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise deal with the collateral or proceeds or products there-from, in his own name or in the name of the debtor.

Severability If one or more provisions of this agreement shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforc eable.

In the event that such a finding and limitation causes damage or hardship to either party, the agreement shall be amended in a lawful manner to make all parties whole. Waiver of Contractual Right The failure of either party to enforce one or more provisions of this agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or limitation of that party's right to subsequently enforce and compel strict compliance with every provision of this agreement.

To quote Justice Jackson writing fo r the Court in Mullane, \"But when notice in a person's due process which is a mere gesture is not due process. \" 339 US, at p. 315 It is from this pint, that I examine the claimant's position. In doing so, I do not give any weight to the fact of the publications in the Law Bulletin. As noted by Justice Jackson, \" ... it is too much in our day to suppose that ... (anyone) does or could examine all that is published to see if something may be tucked away in it that affects his property interests. \" Mullane, supra p. 320. To begin this analysis, Mr. Cleves had notice of the seizure on April 22, 1992. This notice was actual.

FINAN C ING STATEMENT The pur pose of the UCC- I FINANCING STATEMENT is to create a public and private notice of a superior (first in line, first in time) security interest, claim, or lien on colla teral . Although strictly speaking, colla teral is evidence (indicia) of property, not property itself, the word property may be used synonym ously with colla teral . In addition, the value of the property may be a benefit only (you control the account) as in the case of a drive r' s lice nse.

Snow (Secretary of the Treasur y). Fine, you're now a secured party creditor. The private banker ! You're on the path and the commercial world is now before you. And, in some cases, you're just going to have to step out there in faith ! We're not saying it's going to be easy. There will be challenges as usual. And your 'education' must continue in respect to the commercial scheme. Some people in the past have done some dumb and stupid things, have screwed up and have gotten into trouble and some have gone to jail for a few hours or maybe a few days. But we now have all the past exper iences to learn from and know not to do those things that might get us in trouble. You will come to understand that this is just business. You have to accept for value, you can only discharge, and if the other side is going to misapply their statute, you 're going have to exercise your exclusive remedy and file a Tort ! It's just business ! And yes, you can retreat and go back into the program (plantation), as in the MATRIX, but understand this: if you do, you'll be that debtor/slave on the Plantation. You'll own/control nothing, own no property, your life blood/energy will be harvested and you will subject your children to same grueling servitude and their private code/statutes wherein your children will never be free!

There's no guarantee when you hire an attorney and go into court that you will prevail, is there? Or, on the operating table, when the doctor says, \"We 're going in to explore and find the problem and cut it out - wish me luck !\" Or, when you hear that knock at the door and it's some gove rnment agent and he says, \"Hello, I'm from the government. I'm here to help you !\" There are no guarantees ..• other than 1) your debtor will be taxed until you die and 2) you can't take anything with you when you (cross over) leave this planet.

You may now realize that there are no Const itution(s) that they do not operate upon you, that so­ called governments are mere de-facto corporations, their so-ca lled oaths of office are meaningless or frivolous formalities to deceive you that politicians lie, that the so-ca lled American way of life today is a society built upon the creation of DEBT. From the debt established from hospital giving birth, to the new home, the new car, putting your son in college, the credit cards, to everything in between . So-ca lled government is not here to 'serve the peop le,' but to control them and harvest their energy (taxe s), convert them into 'customer s,' take their 'exemptions ' and produce the credit (money) for the survival of the corporati on(s).

There was great success in the beginning as people began to understand the so-called government scheme and Redemption and apply the new found technology and terminology to the economic servitude impo sed upon them. Certainly, Redemption found itself within the so-called 'Freedom Moveme nt' as those in the movement were already fed up and exposed to the antics, corruption and mindset of government and the 'police state !' In the past, it was the norm to protest, to fight the so-called agents, to go into their courts and defend your non-exi sting rights. It was taught to sever all ties with so-ca lled agencies of government (driver licenses, social security, etc.), become free and, as applied to IRS and taxes, quit filing, study the IRS Code book to argue that the code and its various statutes did not apply to you. But all that was 'protest ing ' and as many have come to understand, \" ••• you 're going to war .•• not going to peace !\" And, as we now look back ••• we'r e in agreement. We can see that protesting and arguing did not get us anywhere but into more trouble or deeper into the quagmire of more FIGHTING, STR ESS, WASTED TIME, FINES and what is called GOING TO WAR ... and the resulting injuries and wounds are quite severe ! But along came Redemption and the commerc ial- economic-scheme 'lights ' came on and now we can see and understand the whole enchilada!

But today, that's not an easy thing to do. It does take some time, and a computer. The process can be a little exten sive. A record (copies) has to be maintained, certified mailings done. There may be continued communications within a matter and there could very well be a DISHONOR (non-acce ptance) of your instrument ! The 'other side' may file a court action to compel 'payment !'

Since 'corporations ' are 'fictions ,' though they can sue and be sued, they exist under 'pr ivile ge' and therefore under the Martial LawlPolice StatelBankruptcy. \"They\" are licensed to perform in commerce, for regulation of these entities for the purpose for taxation and raising of revenue/profit. If there were no U.S. Bankruptcy and the 'their' so-ca lled government operated under a strict social compact of a 'Constitutional ' form of government, the agencies established for the benefit of the signatories or their posterity thereto, under 'due course in law,' and as 'their ' so-c alled 'rights ' were guaranteed via the social compact contract known as the Constitutions as such operates upon their 'agents ' of agency government via their officer 's 'Oa th of Offic e,' MOST ALL LICENSES WOULD NOT APPLY TO THE PRIV ATE MAN ! License is defined as to do that which otherwise is illegal ! When did the Supreme Creator direct that His Children live under lice nse? Did their so-called 'fore-f athers ' establish within their 'Dec laration of Independence ' that their right to LIFE, LIBERTY AND PURS UIT OF HAPPIN ESS was subject to license? When was it ever illegal to marry, to go (travel by any mode of conveyance) to work, or to pursue happiness (would not a Certificate of Competence be better than a licens e)? Point is, all commerce in done in the 'corporate activity/name/entity' and once you understand that, the rest of the commercial puzzle will begin to fall into place. Obviously, in the past, you entered into contracts with compan ies, corporat ions, and various government agencies, etc., via in the name of your alleged Debtor controlled by the corporation 's const ructs. Now you 're the secured party. You now received a 'Bill,' of accounting in the mail (a 'Presentment ') and it's a request/demand to pay a sum certain money of account. For ease of understanding, let's use the presumption of an assumed asses sment alleged in an IRSlTax issue as an example. But first, within this book and other information available elsewhere (in books, internet, etc.), you must understand the so-ca lled money issue. If you do not understand what the terms used in respect to money means or any issue related thereto, then One cannot accept the facts in relation thereto ! Don't go any farther. Either understand the money issue, because it is key to everything, or otherwise, Redemption is not for you! Return to the Plantation and perform under commercial servitude ! Per their original socia l compact party contract (U. S. Constitution), \"No state shall make anything but Gold or Silver coin a tender in payment of debt.\" And per 'Bo uvier 's Dictionary of Law ' (1839); 'Title' as defined in #5, states; \"THE LA WFUL COIN OF THE UNITED STATES WILL PASS THE PROPERTY ALONG WITH THE POSSESSI ON.\" The 'property' and the 'possession ' are called the DR OIT -DROIT and/or DUP LICA TUM JUS, and is defined as the double right! You have to understand that back then, gold and silver was the money of exchange as the accepted medium and was the substance of money or what was to back the money of account in the form of any 'Notes ' or such 'IOU ' came into existence by and through custom and usages of commercial affairs.

Since the bankruptcy, the gold was ordered to be removed as a basis of value/substance backing the money of account and later the silver was removed as well. Therefore, there is nothing of value backing the so-called money of account except your 'full faith and cred it' in their fraud today, which is no more than 'Bankruptcy Script of a Private Corporation' (Federal Reserve Bank System) having no value of substance, as stated by the Federal Reserve System. Therein, when you maybe bought your home or your car, the 'property' (RES) and the 'possession ' (title) did not pass to you ! You do not possess the double right, the Droit-Droit and/or Duplicatum Jus. So the quest ion is ... ''What do you have access to, in the form of money of exchange to pay your debts in law today that has value?\" And most importantly, if some so-ca lled government agency/entity sends your debtor a 'pr esent ment' for payment, is the payment sought in compliance with Article I, Section X of their contract known as the U.S. Constitution ••• per their Oath of Office? If all value has been removed then what is left to pay your debts? All that remains is 'paper !' However, with 'paper' one cannot 'P!!Y,' the debt ... you can only 'discharge' the liability of the assumed debt until sometime in future when the bankruptcy is terminated and 'substan ce' is restored as backing what is called 'money ' in paper form, saving the hassle of carrying heavy gold and silver in your pockets, as that would be a bit impractical with some 200 million people allegedly in their u.S. today ! So obviously, in the past, paper money was created for convenience. HOWEVER, in 1965, then so-ca lled President, Mr. Lyndon B. Johnson signed a public law (more aptly put 'public policy' due to the current military social construct caused by the Civil War) altering the COI NAGE ACT OF 1792 and said, as he was signing it, \"We have no idea of ever returning to it.\" This is all that One needs to see that the social compact under the so-called Const itution is dead and the new military social const ruct operating under the copyright trademark of the \"United States\" for \"The United States of America\" as it applied to the contractual Article 1, Section 10, Clause 1, refere ncing the obligations arising in relationship to payment in gold and silver as lawful Tender in payment of debt within the Compact Party States of the Union, styled \"The United States of America.\" And pursuant to the NEGOT IAB LE INS TR UMENTS LAW, commercial paper, as designed, IS THE CURR ENCY !

Since everything operates under contract or agreement, understand that pursuant to a contractual nexus between you and the social compact party States known as the State of \"Whatever\" of the United States and/or The United States of America, you have no rights as clearly stated within their so-ca lled judicial case law per Padelford, Fay & Co. vs. The Mayor and Alderman of the City of Savannah, 14 Ga. 438, 520 (18 54), a 'pr ivate ' person (man) IS NOT A PARTY TO THE U.S. CONSTI TUTION, which is the compact/contract for the public servant, bound by their Oath of Office. So, if you are not a party to the social compact contract known as the Constitution, how do YOU become liable to some so-ca lled federal agency (or State) and their rules and regulat ions? If not due to the fact one may be a federal employee, then maybe you consented ! The same applies to the State ! If their forefath ers created their agency government (in valid contractual concept & principle) would you think they were so ignorant that they would place themselves within the contract designed only for their 'servants ?' However, take notice that YOU have no 'contract ' with any social compact or const ruct otherwise called 'government' to bargain for your rights, let alone to secure your rights in the second place. Is that why you are raped, pillaged and plundered by their so-ca lled government and their corporations that they create? Theref ore, since you are not a party to their social contract, then it doesn 't take a rocket scientist to understand that it makes sense to get an agreement from any particular agency, party, attorney general, government, IRS, agent, etc., to DIS CHARGE THE DEB T. Since the corporate fiction cannot tax you, the 'charge/BilllPresentment' comes via an agent representing the 'fiction ,' and sent to your debtor ... but where's the agreement? Whether it's a traffic ticket or the IRS ... it makes sense to go back to the agent and/or agency and get the agreement . .. that all you can do is discharge the fine, fee, tax, judgment or debt! Based upon the basic format of a CAFV (there being a few different formats out there !), the concept of the first paragraph is ... AGR EE WITH THY ADVERSARY ! As part of that concept, while you want to agree with your adversary, you also want and NEED to agree to 'pe rform ' to some prior offer, whether a traffic ticket (to pay the $$), a complaint, a Bill to pay money, etc., but 'pr esent ' to 'them ' your 'counter- offer' in the nature of your CAFV. As it is said: \"You want to give honor, not go into dis-honor!\" Per 'their ' offer, while you have accepted and though you agreed to perform, now that you counter-of fered, you cannot 'perform' to 'their' offer, until 'they' now perform to your counter-of fer. And should 'they' fail or ref use to perform to your counter-of fer, you cannot REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 409"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"perform to 'their' offer! You went to 'them' in honor, said, \"Yes, I accept, I agree, but conditioned and 'pr edicated ' upon you producing or providing 'Proof of Claim ' (facts/di scovery, etc.)!\" Well, if your opponent fails, or refuses to do so, he fails to \"state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" It's called a 12 B (6) in the Federal Rules of Civil Proce dure ! Also, 'estoppe ls' kicks in. Meanin g, your opponent, by his sil ence, is stopped from going forward. His silence is taken as an agreement, acceptance and even to admittance to participating in fraud. The maxim is: \"For a matter to be resolved - it must be expressed !\" Well, what did you just do with your CAFV? Did you not 'expr ess ' the matter to seek someth ing: resolution, agreement or even your agreement to walk away; there being proofs of claim provided that your opponent was right? Therefore, after the CAFV is sent, your opponent is given a minimum of 10 days to bring forth the requested 'Proofs of Clai m,' with a response both to you and to your Notary and/or Mall Escrow Agent. See the two examples that follow, espec ially the closing 'caveat ' paragraph s. Should your opponent fail (or refuse) to provide 'Proofs of Clai m,' he/she \"stipulates to the facts as they operate in your favor.\" Your opponent can 'agree ' to whatever you want himlher to agree to (within reason) . Again, see the examp les. Read them over 3 or 4 times ! Understand the 'concept ' and 'intent ' and apply it to each and every one you do! After your opponent fails to respond, you then send a 'No tice of Opportunity to Cure ' their fault of non-r espons e. Sh ould they fail or refuse, you then send the 'Affidavit of Notice of Default' and you have your Notary or a 'Third Party' sign the Affidavit of Certificate of Non -Response, either in their Official Capacity, if the response was to be directed to the Notary, or the Certificate of Non-R esponse signed and notarized by the 'Third Part y.' You send a copy of those two documents to your opponent while you maintain the origina ls, being holder in due course. Portions of the following information is taken from the 'C AFV -C D', as advertised in the newspaper; The American 's Bulletin, P.O. Box 3096, Central Point, Oregon 97502 (Ph. #54 1 -779-770 9), that contains 14 Plus CAFV 's for IRS. Traffic. AutolHome Mortgage. Money Debt Collection. Attorney General. Property Tax.

Conditional Acceptance for Value (CAFV) is the tool to use to EXHAUST YOUR PRIVATE ADMINISTRA TIVE REMEDY to detennine if there is a CO NTROVERSY with your opponen t/agent/off icer, or to allow the other-side to establish an agreement with you as to discha rge of debt or anything you want. You are not expect ed to run into court just because you think you have a problem and want to sue somebody ! You want all your 'ducks ' in a row. If, in your use of CAFV, you then detennine that you have controversy due to the fact that your opponent provided the proof and the discovery that establishes a controversy, then and only then is the court the place to go to settle the contr overs y. Of cours e, under Biblical law, you are to go to your brother first. Well, the CAF V can be const rued to be that proce ss. But what if your opponent goes silent and or refuses to \"bring forth Proof of Claim\" (exculpa tory discovery) ? He is now in dishonor and by his silence and/or 'general acquiescence' has stipulated to the facts as expressed in your CAFV and has 'agreed' to the injury, misapplication of statute, etc. and now you have to ask yourself, \"Is your opponent in the best position?\" NO ! He's in full Acceptance and even in verifiable Fonnal Acceptanc e! Therefore, you now have three witne sses against him, along with the fact that he has 'stipulated' to the facts in the CAFV as they operate in your favor, if your adversary chooses to trespas s! If your fonner adversary chooses to trespass upon the contractual agreement, you now have witnesses in evidence for tort damages and, once perfected, may become marketable debt for full settlement and accord for settlement of the accounts when you accept unlimited liability via International Public Order to become signa tory to a social compact for your own safety, liberty, and pursuit of happine ss and that of your posterity, which they acquire by birth. Nonna lly, you allow the other side 10 to 30 days to respond with 'Proof of Clai m,' allowing 3 days (nonnally) for return mail. After non-re sponse then you mail out the Notice and Oppo rtunity to Cure, allow three days, with three days for return mail. If no 'Cure ' of their fault occurs through the provision of a 'Proof of Claim,' then you proceed with an Affidavit of Notice of Default and Acceptance and the Affidavit of Certificate of Non- Response (signed and notarized by your 'Notary' or 'Third Party'). Note: The Notary cannot notarize hislher own signature, so the Notary has to have another Notary notarize the document ! Later, depending upon whether there arises any related court matter, you must have all documents presented under Copy Certification by Document Custodian (YOU are the Document Custodian) which you want or need to have notarized by a Notary. If any presentment involves a bill of exchange you will have to have an additional Notarial Protest done by a Notary, which, in some cases, may have to be done from out of State. Check with a Notary in your area as to hislher willingne ss to provide this service for you.

So per the document (Affidavit of Certificate of Non-Response) remove the word 'Affidavit' so that it only becomes a 'Certificate' for the Notary to sign! Now, in matters dealing 'agents ' of so-ca lled government who may have caused an injury, a commercial damag e, etc., it is strongly sugge sted (since we cannot use the 'advice ' word !) NOT TO FILE A LIEN! Though they are proper, howeve r, due to the fact that some people have been charged with 'simulation of legal proce ss,' a strange charge in itself, since the military social government const ruct is a fiction, simulating the very same process or others similar when they or 'it' files a lien against your debtor ! And some people have even been charged with 'Paper Terror ism, ' via the guise of criminal syndicalism. Seems, strange again to be charged when One is only proceeding with a 'Redress of Grieva nce ' for wr ongs committed . Therefore, this is just one more fact in point to prove that the current system, the so-ca lled courts are not there for you, to give you a remed y. If you go into their court with the truth, facts and law, you should win hands down every time . Wher e's the evide nce of such wins by any people? Wher e's the evidence that so-ca lled judge recognizes your sovereignty, rights, title(s), and interest in the any matter. Why do I ask? Why doesn 't he uphold it and honor his Oath to their people who they say, are said to be free and living in the land of the free and home of the brave? Is it probable that 'they' have breached their oath/contract? That going bankrupt, the agenda of so-ca lled government is to administer the bankruptcy and all the pledged property and treat you only as debtors/slaves on the Plantation because you and your fathers have slept on your rights and lost the knowledge of who you are and what your power is, as sovereign people and you have no contract with the so-called new military social construct known as the government of the United States! Aside from that, instead of filing a lien, utilize TORT CL AIM. In that you file a Tort Claim, it's a claim process, normally filed into a 'Risk Management Office ' or 'Administrative Services ' at any level of government venue/ jurisdiction, i.e., municipal, county, state, or federal level. Check your State statutes on its 'Tort Claim Proce ss.' The federal venue uses a STANDARD FORM 95. All Tort Claims are to be supported by Affidavit In Suppor t of Notice of Cla im and an Affidavit of Negative Averment and any exhibits you deem necessa ry and attach a true and correct copy of your original VCC- I.

These prior events are: A. You have \"captured your Straw-man\" by filing a UCC- l Financ ing Statement with the real, flesh and blood man, indicated by name in upper-and lower -case letters , as the Secured Party and your \"ENS LEGIS/nom de guerre\" or corporate franchise, indicated by all capital letters , filed as the DEBTOR. B. You have likewise signed and notarized a Security Agreement and placed it in the Commercial Registry, either Q!! the original VCC-l or a subseq uent VCC- 3 Amendment and the Hold Harmless Agreement, in which the DEBTOR has indemnified the Secured Party by pledging all of DEBTOR 'S property as collateral against any kind of loss or harm that should accrue to the Secured Party as the result of any transmitting utility activities of DEBTOR. Such loss or harm would occur, for instance, if the DEB TOR , and thereby the Secured Party on whose behalf DEBTOR functions in commerce as a transmitting utility and for which Secured Party signs as the accommodating party, is fined, charged, or impri soned by some commercial presentment having been issued against the DEB TOR which the system deems to have been dishonored. (See also the Hold Harmless Agreement!) UCC 9-105(1) states: \"'Security agreeme nt' means an agreement which creates or provides for a security interest.\" Black's 6th states: \"An agreement granting a creditor a security interest in personal property, which security interest is normally perfected either by the creditor taking posses sion of the collateral or by filing financing statements in the proper public records.\" The Security Agreement you file in the UCC- l is a binding, sealed contract between DEBTOR and Secured Party which includ es, inter alia, an itemization of the property/collateral the DEB TOR has pledged to the Secured Party. All the property belongs to the DEBTOR but the Secured Party holds all interest in it. Since the DEB TOR has pledged all of DEB TOR'S property/collateral to the Secured Party, and a binding contract is filed registering and recording that agreement and the Indemnity Bond as agreed by the DEB TOR to indemnif y the Secured Party against loss, no third party is able to state a claim upon which relief can be granted against the DEBTOR or any of the property pledged by DEB TOR to Secured Party. All commercial affairs are the province of and interacti ons of commercial entities with the DEBTOR, as per the text in one's UCC- l statin g: \"All proceeds, products, accoun ts, and fixture s, and the Orders there-from, are released to the DEBTOR.\" REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 432"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"C. You have received an actual presentme nt/offer (with a 'dollar' and/or money of account to a sum certain amount allegedly due), not merely a notice, and have time to deal with it within 10 to 20 days of your receipt thereof. A 'present ment' is a demand for payment . In some cases a previously completed Conditional Acceptance for Value (CAFV) to get the agreement from the Offeror establishes agreement to proce ed. Other wise, as Creditor .. proceed with the pro cess! D. In some cases, it could be a 'directi ve' to engage in some specif ic performance desired by the party issuing the presentment, hereinafter the \"Offeror.\" Your acceptance of the specif ic perform ance occurs when you go silent and/or fail to deal with the presentment properly - you'd be in disho nor and the Off eror does a Banker 's Acceptance of your dishonor of the presentment. If you simply pay, he wins automatica lly; if you fight or do nothing, you traverse or dishonor and are locked into the commercial jurisdiction in which they always win unless you have \"Captured your Straw-man\" and properly deal with their presentme nts. E. All arrests and incarcerations today consist of seizing the collateral/surety (the real you) to pay the debt against the DEB TOR based upon their having done a Banker 's Acceptance of your commercial dishonor and executed a Bill of Exchange with themselves as Creditor and your Straw-man as DEBTOR. Since any bill, presentme nt/offer, you receive, ESPECIALLY THO SE HAVING A VOUC HER/C OUPON AT THE BOTTOM of the Presentment, from the government system or company/corporation is a commercial instrument, whether it is a traffic citation, tax bill, or summons to court, the procedure for dealing with it is the same, within the first three days of receiving it. The steps herewith apply in most situat ions, but sometimes on a case by case basis. F.

REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 437"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"DISCHARGE OF DEB T? - Reality Check - In the last seven (7) years of Redemption, we have been exposed to several different ways to discharge debt. Some didn't work to good, some people did not know what they were doing, made certain changes on instruments and some processes were altered and therefore some problems were created and the 'system ' eventually came to reject some of the discha rge process/instrum ents. 'Sight Drafts ' were the first to go into the shredder. Checks on a Closed Account, were the next to go. While there have been succes ses, from the various instruments from the beginn ing, the Bill of Exchange has been the most successf uL .. to a point. In reviewing several processes from around the country, it appears that styles and forms vary greatly. What was more apparent were the incon sistencies and non-p rofessional appearance of the letters, documents and instrument s. However, while that in and of itself would not necessarily be cause for problems , the 'first impress ion ' principle is to disregard them and of cours e... some of the letters, documents and instruments look 'extremel y' unprof essional irrespective of substance over form! What we have learned over time is: Redemption is real, it is very serious! When one becomes a Secured Party Creditor, one becomes a 'pr ivate banker !' Your 'Full Faith and Credit ' is on the line! But people were not trained as bankers . We all went to government school, read government newspa pers, grew up watching their government TV, and sat on pews in their government SOl-C 3 churche s. We didn't go to 'COMMERCE AND BANK ING SC HOOL !' So for all of us, we dived into Redemption for various reasons. Some saw a quick buck! Some saw the next major puzzle piece to addre ss their servitude and saw the remedy. But now we have come to the understanding that Redemption is just the second to the last step in the quest for freedom ... in operating within the commercial venue/scheme and credit transact ions. Again, in the last seven years , though we have seen many successes and such advancement towards new knowledge of the commercial scheme, a greater sense of control over the economic conditi ons perpetuated by de-facto corporate government, we now see a few more people getting into trouble. Not so much that the current process is incorrect, but from the position that their compan ies, corporations and government corporations (primarily State created entities) refuse to accept the instruments and adjust the accounts, therein causing DISHONOR, breach of agreement (your CAFV) and commercial fraud! While we agree that there should be the agreement in place to discharge the fine, fee, tax or debt, we see that most all of those who have discha rged the same, have not set in place the agreement to discha rge (via CAFV). There exists only the other side's agreement/contract whereby you agreed to bind your Debtor wherein the contract most likely did not specif y the form of payment ! And if it did, i.e., in US Dolla r $$, there is no constitutional money of exchange that circulates in any State of the Union ! And due to the social Military const ruct's U.S. Bankruptcy, since they took the Gold away, there exists in all contracts ... fraud, unconscionability and therefore no honest 'me eting of the mind ' as to the monetary condition (no lawful money of exchange) (see Affidavit of Walker Todd) in their commercial venue. Yet the contract you are compelled to sign with their compan ies, corporations and government corporations has some inference to paymen t... perceived to be in 'federal reserve notes ' - , of which the Federal REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 438"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"Reserve Bank states; \"In the United States neither paper currency nor deposits have value as commoditie s. Intrinsically, a dollar bill is just a piece of paper, deposits merely book entries.\" (Modem Money Mechan ics - page 3). Federal Reserve Notes, having no value, are merely bankruptcy script being merely 'pa per promises to pay ' or the other word is; a Bill of Exchange ! Therefore, you have a problem ... one; you cannot 'pay at law' to lawfully obtain title in what think you purchased ! And two; those demanding payment cannot demand payment in specific coin or currenc y. If the government (municipality, county or state) is demanding payment, they are governed by their 'Oath of Office' to uphold and support the U.S. Const itution at Article I, Section X, in that; \"No State shall ... make any Thing but gold or silver Coin a Tender in payment for Debts .\" So do you see the problem? It is our position that we do not want to see people get into trouble in these ways before they/you lay the neces sary foundation and understanding. We understand that we must ALL maintain a form of 'stewar dship ' to our fellow man, and as such, a hard decisi on was made not to present the process of commercial discharge of debt in this book via the Bill of Exchange process. As we do not want to see 'newbies' get into trouble, we also do not want to assume the liability in any manner if someone gets into trouble, prosecuted and imprisoned and then the fingers are pointed back to us, because someone did lay the foundation and prepare the mselves . As a Secured Party Creditor, it is your responsibility to take full responsibility for your action s, standing and capacity ! You cannot pass the responsibility on to somebody else! If we were to give some sort of honor to any 'discharge process ,' we'd have shown every form and type of transaction and have addressed their relevant aspects and trying to answer every conceiva ble question, et c., which would add an additional 100 pages to this book which would have delayed this book for another 6 months to do that. A time frame we could not afford ! The intent of this book is 'Entry Level,' that is to lay the foundation and provide the steps and proce ss to become the Secured Party Creditor with the additional understanding that there is NO LAWFUL MONEY and you have not PAID for anything since 1933! HOWEVER, that being said, the other (a ctor you must understand, even as a Sec ured Party Creditor, you may have standing to discha rge the fine, fee, tax or debt in behalf of the Debtor, but aside from that, you have no contract with the company, corporation, etc. to discharge the debt in behalf of your Debtor. You have no contract with their Federal Government ! You are not a signatory to their compact/Constitution and the same is applied to their State ! Therein, you have no agreement to discha rge the liability or the trespass per the transaction. Not being a party to their compacts nor a signatory, pursuant to international law, YOU ARE DEEMED AN ALI EN! So where do you get the authority to discha rge without assuming any liability in any dealings with any of their 'forei gn' company/corporations and/or their government agency? Therein, understand, you have no rights within their jurisdictional social compact or const ructs, as you are certainly not a U.S. Citizen ... and not a signatory to 'their ' Const itution are you? Their 'Bill of Rights ' do not operate upon you just as well as their Const itutions do not operate upon you! Per international law, the only right you have is to file a (To rt) claim!

(See Conditional Acceptance elsewhere in this book) But as a Secured Party Creditor with the 'discharge agreement' in place, the discha rge can go forward still knowing that there is no money of excha nge, then if there is a 'dishonor, the Secured Party Creditor may have to exer cise their 'exclusive ' remedy of Tort for various violations and dishonor by the 'foreign compa ny, corporation, government agency/agent, etc. in the interest of your commercial Justice ! These are NEW concepts for people to understand and accept within Redemption as to your freedom and that of your posterity and understanding that there is no lawful money in circulation Once you become Secured Party Creditor, you must continue your education as the Secured Party Creditor lPrivate Banker, understand and use the 'Conditional Acceptance for HonorNa lue' process and obtain the best information on commercial discharge as you can. WITH THAT BEING SAID ; aside from the Bill of Exchange process, we do present a simpler method to discha rge via 'Acceptance for Value and Returned for Discharged '. Read the following and understand it, though it is not complicated, and use as necessary. But first read this manual , several times, and read other books as mentioned at the end of this book.

(See Walker F. Todd Affidavit) It may seem the de-facto agents of the bankrupt military-c orporate government are doing whatever necessary to deny the secured party creditors the remedy provided by Co ngress, for such discha rge of debt, but it is of necessity for 'evolution' of the 'discharge of debt' to proceed forward, in spite of the ongoing and continuous 'fraud' perpetuated by every government REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 440"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"employee, officer and elected official within every level of government today . Understand that there are several methods for the discha rge of debt for the Secured party Creditor to utilize. It is not his function of this Manual to go into detail of each of these proce sses. The 'AFV-RFD'/MONEY ORDER PROCES S is sufficient for you at this time, as it is most important for you to lay the foundation first. As such, today, as a last resort, it may be necessary to 'go to war' via law suit (via the technology of Citizens of the American Const itution) for fraud and treason (viola tion of Oath of Office to 'their' const itution) by the agents own stipulation, agreement and confession of the violation of Article One Section Ten of the U.S. Const itution as it operates within the States. The Tort Claim process is still the primary tool for redress as the 'exclusive' remedy preceding any 'civil action' by the agents , again, via their own stipulation, agreement and confession of the same, however, here, the 'Claim' is filed into the Risk Management/insurance side of the government corporat ion. You just have to know that it is not an easy thing to do in monet izing the lien. There are two other ways to utilize the credit; 1) by assignment and 2) by International Bill of Excha nge. Irrespective of this 'Notice,' Walker F. Todd, ex-legal counsel of one of the Federal Reserve Banks states in his affidavit the following: \"From my study of historical and economic writings on the subject, I concl ude that a common misconception about the nature of money unfortunately has been perpetuated in the U.S. monetary and banking systems, especially since the 1930s. In classica l economic theory, once economic exchange has moved beyond the barter stage, there are two types of money : money of exchange and money of accoun t... For nearly 300 years in both Europe and the United States, confusion about the distinctiv eness of these two concepts has led to persistent attempts to treat money of account as the equivalent of money of excha nge. In reality, especially in a fractional reserve banking system, a comparatively small amount of money of exchange (e.g., gold, silver, and officia l currency notes) may support a vastly larger quantity of business transactions denominated in money of account . The sum of these transactions is the sum of credit exten sions in the economy . With the exception of customary stores of value like gold and silver, the $monetary base of the economy largely consists of credit instrumen ts. Against this background, I conclude that the Note, despite some language about \"lawful money\" explained below. clearly contemplates both disbursement of funds and eventual repayment or settlement in money of account (that is. money of exchange would be welcome but is not required to repay or settle the Note) . ... Legal tender, a related concept but one that is economically inferior to lawful money because it allows payment in instruments that cannot be redeemed for gold or silver on demand, has been the form of money of excha nge commonly used in the United St ates since 1933, .... Legal tender under the Uniform Commercial Code (U.c.c.), Section 1-201 (24) (Official Commen t), is a concept that sometimes surfaces in cases of this nature... The referenced Officia l Comment notes that the definition of money is not limited to legal tender under the U.C.C . ... The narrow view that money is limited to legal tender is rejected .\" Thus, I concl ude that the U.c.c. tends to validate the classica l theoretical view of money .\" (emphasis added !) And in citing the Henwood case; \" ...

A few years back, I subscribed to 'The American 's Bulletin ', then later, when Redemption came forward, I became a 'Secured Party Creditor' at the end of 2003. I have to say that I have learned a lot from that 'newspa per' and since becoming a secured party, I decided to take care of some commercial matte rs, you know; debts ! I had a debt matter with a local bank for about $2,000.00, a TV Service Company for about $135.00, a Cell Phone Company for about $930.0 0, a Computer Finance Company for about $ 1,600.00, an Insurance Company for about $580.0 0 and a Credit Card Debt for about $4,000.00. All of these matters were of 2 years ago. What I had done, was to take their 'presentment ', their 'bill or 'demand for payme nt' and I wrote across them; \"Accepted for Value and Returned for Discha rge per UCC- 1 enclosed\" and signed each presentment, under my name is 'Secured Party ', and I mailed them back to them 'fellas' by certified mail. I only heard back from one of them, the bank. They had sent the matter to a Debt Colle ctor, one from California and one from New York. I then took their 'Demand Letters ' and done the same thing and have never had heard from those either ! Now I know there 's no guarantee, and I don't know what would happen if you did the same thing, I'm just saying that it worked for me and that discharging some $9,000.00 in debt 'cause of what I have learned in the Redemption process has been well worth it. ••• Though the 'pr ocess' in above article was som ewhat sim pler, it has worked fo r the author over nine times!

In the previous 'article,' we dealt with the 'Da mage Control ' issue as it relates to the commercial discharge by Bill of Exchange of fine, fee, tax, or so-ca lled debts as it relates to your Standing and Capacity in relation to their corporate government and commercial law. But first, we have to go 'back to the future', so to speak. The path has already been blazed by those behind us, who desired freedom, even commercial freedom. Our history is full of those who sacrificed all to work towards those ends. But the path was blazed by those who stepped forward out on faith. They put their credibility on the line, as we know so clearly well. They put their 'John Henry ' on that parchment. They understood the risks, they certainly identified the objective (to come out from an oppressive government), they made plans and preparati ons ... then with one step, then another . .. on to what they created, the rest is history. We could certainly point to John Adams, Patrick Henry and many others since then, in all that was done in the so-ca lled fight for freedom, or so we're told. It's been called the 'Am erican Experime nt,' and many today would agree that the 'experime nt' has failed! The information presented in this book certainly supports that statement and it is possible that your own personal experience confirms that as well. Many people in the last 25 years or more have 'experienced ' their milita ry social government ! Do you have more fre edom today that tho se of tho se that ca me bef ore you ? Can you honest ly say that you own your property, your home, your ca r? Ca n you disprove that all your property was not 'pledged ' to their State ? And due to their bankruptcy and the economic situation in their so- called country, just about every man/woman and family is in a po sition of assum ed debt and every State in the military socia l const ruct known as the U.S .lUnited St ates of Amer ica, Inc . is in debt as Const itutors (C alifornia - so me 40 Bi llion in debt alone !).

And don't forget about the $90 Billion debt their U.S. Corporate Officer-President Bush created due to the Iraq war that their U.S. Citizens will be required to 'pay their fail share ' of to the (last farthing) penny! Keep in mind that their 'State ' treats you as their debtor slave on their Plantation. Their State does not recognize your 'So vere ign ' status/capacity, does not respect you in the same manner. By the actions of their agent/em ployees, their police, their courts and their so-ca lled public servants, you are only seen as a revenue base to support their various de-facto corporations through taxes, taxes and more taxes! (Remember the Matrix?) Evidently, you have no standing or recognition as a 'Debtor on the Plantat ion'. Keep in mind that you are not a signatory to their so-ca lled federal or state Constitution(s) and therefore you are not a party to their social compact servicing their debt. Simply stated, you have no agreement or contract by which you can offer proof or proffer that you have ever bargained for your rights or that of your posterity, or that in any manner any of your so-ca lled rights are protected by their form of so-called government, their codes, statutes or laws at any level!

When their Washing ton State Department of Licensing (their agenc y) answered the State level FOI A (Request for Public Recor ds), they answered June 1, 1995 and in their second paragraph stated thusly: \"The Departm ent has no document s on file which woul d demonstrate that you are a party to any social compact or contract which can be demonst rated to operate to confer any contractual , controlling, insurable, lawfu l, legal, pecuniary, regulatory, or any other interest in your being and/or property to the benefit of the county or state, etc.\" Also, per Padelford, Fay & Co. vs The Mayor and Aldermen of the City of Savannah, 48 Ga 438 (1854) wherein the court stat ed: \"But, indeed , no private person has a right to complain, by suit in court, on the ground of a breach of the Const itutio n. The Constitution, it is true, is a com pact, (contract), but he is not a party to it!\" (emph asis added) So how much evidence do you need to see that you are not a party to their 'social compact ' (their Const itutions) and aside from the fact that you are not a signatory to it/them (your signature not appearing on their Const itutions) and the factual inference is that you have nothing to do with their governme nt corporations or their debt and they have nothing to do with you!

Since you have no agreement with them to trespass on their copyrights, when you use their corporate name on court documen ts, briefs , liens, etc., they charge people with 'simulation of legal proce ss,' 'paper terror ism, ' 'criminal syndicalism ' or they can charge you with failure to file, bank fraud, jay-walking, whatever they want to!

They are the 'officers' of the corporation compelling you to their 'private-c orporat e-statutes' unlawfully, to compel your obedi ence, extract revenue from you or imprison you within their 'facilities' for their commercial gain. They will assume that you are cluele ss to their game, easily conned/conf used, and a push­ over. Sovereignty is evidenced when you cease to be a victim of unrevealed, unconscio nable contracts and servitude by signing contract and treaty via international protocols for said recognition of right to emerge and of establishing your sovereignty as recognized both by national and international venues . And by not consenting! Not consenting means not taking part in the dialog, not approving of that which is proposed, opting out from the very beginni ng, before anything can be const rued as having contractually begun with the de-facto States, etc. The Supreme court has consi stently ruled that there is no requirement that anyone conse nt with anything, that no one can be compelled to enter into a contract unwillingly with another -including municipal corporati ons, State corporations and United States Inc.! The agents of government must involve you their commercial scheme and get you to consent ! Be prepared because YOU WILL BE TESTED! The agents have many ways to contract with your Debtor. While this is a very big net, if you have achieved the elevated status of secur ed party creditor, you have in place the necessary instruments for leveling the playing field. However, you can only leverage the power of these documents by knowing the who, what, where, and when of being a sovereign. It only takes a momentary loss of confidence or missing a subtle cue to contract and offering an acceptance before realizing it, to lose control of a situat ion. Your body language is how you communicate 90+% of your me ssage, and it rarely lies. If you are not certain that you are a soverei gn, it is unlikely that you will convince others that you are. The greatest liability will be your past conditi oning. However, it can be effectively offset by diligently practi cing your new response under pressure. The important concepts to 'embed' into your mentaVnervous system are as follows: A citizen is a SUBJECT of the state. In an article entitled \"Redemption Traffic Win ... \" Summer REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 460"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"Dawn was confused about her identity when she states: \"I told the Officer that I was a secured party and a sovereign Citizen of the United States of Amer ica.\" While she prevailed in her traffic matter as a secured party creditor, she puts herself at risk when claiming to be 'a citize n'. Infere nce to this means you are saying 'I'm a subject of the federal corporation and subject to your rule!' The statement above may be overlooked by a patrolman, but how about a judge? Statutory Law only applies to the FICTIONSIDEB TORS. You (flesh & blood) have no more obligation to follow the statutes (being not named in them) and edicts of municipalit ies, count ies, States and UNITED STATES by and through their employees, agents, Legislators, etc., than you do MCD ONALD S CORPORATIO N. This applies to all employees of the United States and their sub-unit States and Countie s. The U.S. Courts are NOT Constitutional and there is NO CONS TITUTIONAL REMEDY for you there. This is why you can never prevail by taking your Const itutional arguments into the courts . They are military courts of Admiralty based on the private, copyrighted, international law of equity. The judges and attorneys are administrators of the U.S. bankr uptcy. It ONLY becomes judicial when you ACC EPT an offer (and sign) that they make to you. All of your training in United States History has seduced you into the false belief that courts are adjudicating the Common Law based on the Bill of Rights and the Const itution. There is no greater fiction in the collective mind set of the American people than this, today ! The courts were partitioned from Common Law Remedy in 1938 in the landmark Supreme Court decision, Erie Railroad v. Thom pson. A judge will not accept any precedent prior to this; you cannot reference the common law. This simple fact should GIVE YOU A CLUE ! Since 19933, there is NO WAY to PAY a debt. The word 'pay' is an euphemi sm for DISCH ARGE . You can only discharge since the Bankrup tcy. Most everyone has heard of or played the game Monopoly © . The longe st running game, lasting 70 days, ended the same way that every other game ended ; the 'Bank' ends up with having all the money, and everyone else broke. You can see the same process, monopo lization of all real estate and wealth, going on in the world around us. Although most of you would never consider using Monopoly © 'money' to 'pay' your bills, there is absolutely no dif ference in their intrinsic worth when compared to Federal Reserve Not es. The only difference, besides the way they look, is that you have given value to Federal Reserve Notes based on your own experience of how others respond to them. While this is not a trivial distinct ion, they have no more intrinsic value than Monopoly © money. If you can remember this, you will be way ahead. This will help you to understand why there is no real Law, since that would imply the ability to pay a debt. (see Article I, section X of the U.S. Const itution and Article 11, Section 1 of the Oregon Constitution - for referenc e!) Most importantly, it may help prevent you from getting whisked off to jail when you are questioned by a judge regarding that Bill of Exchange you are using, when s/he asks you, \"does this Bill of Exchange 'pay' your debt( s)\", and before realizing it, you end up accepting the offer by announcing 'YES' it does. REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 461"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"WHEN DEALING WITH THE COURTS The United States is the most litigious society in the world. Anyone can sue you at any time for anythi ng. When you consid er that there are over 60 million laws on the books and that America has the highe st per capita rate of incarceration of any country in the world, reason would therefore suggest that the American legal and criminal justice system has a target painted on your back. While it is not this purpose of this book to induce fear or paranoia, it is sugge sted that it would be prudent to understand and accept the fact that if you live in America there are predators in your midst, sanctioned by the public corporations via their private law, having as their primary objective an interest in doing business with you, i.e., fines, fees, citations, taxes, etc. This system for inducing you to fine, fee, jail, or commerce has been so carefully designed, that without specialized knowledg e, such as the information contained in this book, your chanc es of prevailing in an encounter with it are almost non-exi stent. It owes its suc cess to the interlocking connection of three fundamental ploys : 1) Build a system based on appearanc es. (fiction) 2) Create subtle ways of getting people to contract with the fiction in order to make them accommodation parties to it. 3) Induce people to give this fiction life/substance by arguing and testifying. 4) Get the people to CONSE NT to the liability and punishment as surety for the fiction . Corporate entities, Federal Reserve notes, property descriptio ns, and legisla ted (statutory laws) are legal fictio ns. There is nothing of substance to them. A corporate entity such as your Straw­ man-debtor, is not the flesh and blood you. Federal Reserve notes do not come into existence through their assignment to something of value such as gold or silver, but by taking out a loan. A title deed identifies a home in terms of an artificial system of meets and bounds called a property descr iption-a description of property that is NOT; if you read it, you won't find anything that describes any attribute of the real house. This also applies to your car title and any other title to property. The real substance of a thing is referred to as the RES. Legislated (statutory) laws are not written pursuant to the contracts (Const itution and Bill of Rights) that would limit government 's power over the sovereign flesh and blood men and woman . By creating a system that is fiction from end to end, they insure that the real game stays hidden and not one in a million will figure it out. Most people suppo se or assume that a contract has to be knowin gly, intentionally, and voluntarily agreed to by the parties involved. This is usually the case even when there is no written and signed contract. For example, when eating at a restaurant, if you place an order for food, then pro ceed to consume your order when it is delivered, the custom is you've contracted by implication (implied contract) and you'll pay the bill. However, there is a whole class of contracts of a far more sinist er nature; they are called, adhesion contract s. Contracts made wholly for the benefit of a single party. They come into existence wheneve r you exercise a benefit offered by the corporate state such as welfare, Social Security, Medica id, food stamps, postal delivery, sign an application for a passport, use federal highways , sign your name to obtain a REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 462"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"license, marriage license, driver license, pilot license, CPA license, etc.), or register property (babies, automobil es, etc.) with the State. Unless you specif y that you don't want to be liable for the unrevealed benefits of any agreement or commercial contract, you have become an accommodation party to the corporate fi ction. But now for whatever reason, you have to go into court. It is presumed that you are a debtor­ slave on the plantation, ward of the state, a subject and class one ostrich, unaware that you have spent an entire lifetime contracting to create a nexus between you (flesh and blood) and the legal fiction that has been created on your behalf (Straw-man). REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 463"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"Going Into Court In a perfect (real) world, or in a perfectly real and just political/legal/economic system, there would not be many occasions where the common man would be required to appear in an administrative or a judicial forum and certainly not without an injured party willing to swear to firsthand knowledge of the facts. Unfortu nately, in a world of fictions, as it is at the present time, many are being forced, under duress and threat of arrest, to appear before any number of quasi­ judicial fiction forums for any number of crimes, violations, infracti ons, etc. of a fictional , commercial nature. So, the task at hand in such a situation is to understand what is going on and to protect yourself as best as you are able. Critical to achieving the best results is to be perfectly clear what your goal is, and to keep our eyes on the goal amidst the physical, emotional, and intellectual turmoil that such a situation brings forth. We must understand that we can only control what is within our power to control, and that we personally cannot control the thoug hts, words, or actions of another. What we can do is control our own attitudes, thoughts and actions, and the making of the record. Our posture, or the way we present ourselves is vital. Are we able to remain as men and woman of righteousness in a world of unrighteo usnes s? Simple, but not that easy. As to the making of the record, keep in mind that in the vast majority of occasions the record made at the lowest level is the only record subject to review at any higher level. In other words, our ability to make the record to reflect the information that is vital to our well-being, at the initial hearings, is directly proportionate to the remedy that will be available to us, in any forum, for any violations of any rights and the misapplica tion of la ws, statut es, rules, regulat ions, etc. The goal is to remain in honor and to make the record . The way to make the record is to stay \"on point\" , to not be led into the myriad other matters that may arise in the heat of the moment . Knowledge is potential power, knowledge is made into effective powe r in individual circumstanc es by effective application of that knowledge . And now, on to the specif ic knowledge relevant to survival and success in the commercial fiction venues for settlement of disputes (the courts). Again, it must be emph asized that this is not presented as legal advice specif ic to any particular individual or proceeding, but is offered as general information for educational purpo ses. It is up to each man or woman to determine the benefit to themselves in any specif ic application of any information presented in any specific manner. With freedom comes responsibility. You are responsi ble for your own choices and action s. GOING INTO COURT : The judge either calls out your name, or asks you to reveal who you are. The judge is referri ng to the all-caps 'person' (legal fiction) but you are unawa re of this, even though this perso n's name is on every piece of identification that you have ever received, every bill that has come to your home, and every legal instrument that was created on your behalf, so you admit to being that 'person ' and step into the jurisdiction of the court. So you may want to ask the man behind the bench ; Sir, may I have your Name ? ... thank you Mr. Smith (or whatever !) then state into the record as you either cross the bar or upon the judge calling out your Debtors name ; \"I am REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 464"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"____ , the secured party creditor /third party intervener in respect to this matter over title to the proper ty.\" The judge then reads the 'commer cial' charges and asks you to make a plea ... in behalf of the debtor/defendant - the fictionlEns legis.

Having been trained all your life to acquie sce to authority figure s, your willingn ess to sign and accept your fine/punish ment without ever asking if your signature is mandatory or volunt ary. If this is a criminal matter the judge is very interested that you are well represented by a class of commercial contractors called Attorneys . The judge may say, \"If you can't afford one, one will be appointed to represent you for 'free\"'. Don't believe that one - you will be presented with a contract to sign to agree to pay for the attorney! The attorney is an 'officer' of the court. However, you have been seduced into thinking that the attorne y's first loyalty is to you, but as an off icer of the court, their first and sole allegiance is to the court - not you! The attorney can promi se you nothing, and that is exactly what he will help you get. Of cours e, if you hire or accept an attorney, you become a 'ward of the state' , an incompetent, a lunatic of unsound mind.' NOTE : if compelled, to plea \"not guilty\" , you still imply you're guilty but will allow the judge or 'show' jury to decide the matter, but you have then already agreed to accept the liability and the decision of the court and now ... the stage is now set. If You go away with an attorney and he's to prepare your 'argument' and 'defens e,' beware that he will not prepare an appropriate affidavit of the facts, or know an appropriate defense for why you are not liable for the charges again st your Debtor. On the day of your next court appeara nce, the attorney will help you argue your case. The judge may ask you questions through the attorney, and you may be called to testify. With the attorney there, you are not allowed to speak for yourself. By testifying and arguing you will be giving substance to the controversy and to all the fictions in the courtro om. In this way you will be admitting your guilt. This will be a slam dunk for the attorney and a slam dunk for the court system. If an attorney is forced upon you, you might ask the attorney, \"Can you represent me in my private capacity?\" The answe r will most likely be \"No I cannot !\" Which is admission that the attorney is ONLY THERE TO REPRESENT THE COMMERCIAL FICTIO N - YOUR DEBTOR ! The so-called defense is for appearance only, before being found guilty, imposing a fine or handing you over to one of the biggest growth industries in America, the police state/pri son system ... irrespective of not being subject to the statute ! Prior to going into court, One should do the CAFV first (see Section 5, The Private Admini strative Process), then at the arraignment or hearing, there are questions and statements of fact that are important to make \"on the record\" in the hearin g. If you have completed the CAFV for the particular matter, as the judge calls the debto r's name, you state or read into the record the 'appearance brief' statement (see Section 6 - Conditional Acceptance - Read Me First!) ... simila r to; \"Well your it honor, I accepted for value the prosecuto r's claim and agreed to pay the fine (go to jail, etc.) predicated upon proof of claim.

However, in the event the judge moves forward, utilize the followi ng original 'Three Magic Questions (as they have been called!) ... plus there's an additional one! Often they will attempt to evade their responsi bility of answering these legitimate question s. In such a situation one could repeat the quest ion and/or ask if they are refusing to answer the question . (Remember, you are making the record.) Also, some choose to preface their questions before the court with the phrase \"Without dishonor\" , followed by the question. The intention is to establish that there is no intention to be presumed to be acting dishonorably or in a contemptuous manner. 1) Question to the magistrate or judge, \"May I have your name please?\" 2) Question to the judge; \"Do you have a claim against me?\" 3) Quest ion to the judge, \"Do you know of anyone who has a claim against me?\" Repeat the same to the prosecutor ! The prosecutor really is the only one who could have a claim against you ... if you were subject to the statute ! 4) Quest ion to the open court (or one could face the gallery, and ask; \"Does anyone present here today have a claim again st me?\" 5) Statement to the judge, \"As it appears that there is no legitimate claim presented, there is no public business before the court. I request that the order of the court be released to me at this time so that I may be free to go\" And an additional verbal question might be \"Will the court compel the prosecutor to produce the evidence of my liability to the statute ?\" Understand that there are any number of ways that any particular magistrate, judge (no, they are not the same), or prosecutor may respond to these question s. Remember, your question and the CAFV is your private process to obtain DISCOV ERY ! That does not mean that the questions are not valid, or that whatever they might say in response may only be to distract or evade . The reality in the system as it is that the agents are saying and doing all sorts of things that are beyond their lawful authority (ultra vires), if there is mi sapplica tion of the statute.

Do you have a claim against me?\" If there is not a· direct response to the question, then in effect, by their 'general acquiescence' they are all in agreeme nt! Some have, in response to a direct threat from the court (i.e.; \"If you say that again . I am going to find you in contempt and remand you to custody\" ) have asked questions such as, \"What will the nature of the contempt be?\" (civil, criminal, or the inherent powe r of the court to enforce its internal policy and procedure) or \"Is it the purpose of this court to abuse me?\" or \"Are you refusing to permit me to know if there is a legitimate claim before this court?\" or \"Are you refusing to inform me of the nature of the claim in this matter?\" At every opportunity, attempt to have the order of the court released to you.

Many actors in the system seem to be drunk with power and have more guts than brain s. Many are willing to \"cut off their nose to spite their face\" rather than be faced with having to acknowledge any limit to their authority. Whatever they might say or do under the circumstanc es, it is clearly established that if they exceed the bounds of their authority (misapplication of the statute) their orders, judgments , pronouncements, etc. are void, and it is possible that they may be called into account for such actions. UNDERSTAND 'They' will do whatever they want to do ... you the sovereign, must do what you have to do! The sovereign must exercise hislher 'exclusive' remedy ... TORT ... for that misapplication of the statute. ALSO, keep in mind in any matter, where you may have been arrested to any quasi­ criminal court matter, from traffic tickets to serious criminal matters, the jail and the court will attempt to lure you into a contract. In the majority of cases, anything you sign on the public side will be a contract. Signatures will generally be requested on your booking form, for picture and fingerprint, and at the time your personal property is checked into the jail. When you are solici ted for the purpose of making a statement or providing your signature, state clearly that you do not conse nt to it. If you are pressured, ask the question, \"Is signing this mandatory or voluntary.\" If they insist that it is mandatory, ask them to \"show you the law\". If they don't show it, tell them that \"you will wait for them to bring it to you. Failing this, if threatened with physical harm, announce to them that you are signing under duress.

HONORIDISHONOR One might logically conclude that the courts are about the law and the facts. Whereas this would normally be the case if not for the US Bankruptcy, there is no current way to exting uish a debt­ no way to pay. The bankruptcy inverted the logic of the phrase \"to pay\", and everything affected by \"paymen t\", and this includes the law. The bankruptcy took us from the gold standard, to the promise to pay standard. Externally, the corporati ons look like they have all of the wealth , don't they? Once again your senses are deceiving you from the facts. The game is kept going in this way, as what's really going on is far from obvio us. The current system in America consists of two groups: Debtors and Creditors . All Corporations like the federal United States and its sub-c orporati ons: States, Counties, and Cities are insolvent . All of your property and labor were pledged to the insolvent corporation-debtors, making you the Debtor. The owne rs are the International Banking Cartel, i.e., Federal Reserve Bank, IMF, House of Rothschild, etc. So everything is based on TRUSTS now, not true contra cts, since there is no longer any lawful consideration. This is evidenced by the fact that the titles for your automobile and home are only evidence of ownership (certificates), not real owne rship . The new car dealersh ips, banks , and mortgage companies don't tell you this, but that is precisely what is going on. This is also why we have courts in equity since the bankruptcy and not courts at law. Pursuant to Fehl v Jackson County, \"County courts are no longer Const itutional courts .\" So what is a contract without consid eration? What is a contract based only on a promi se? Answer: A quasi-c ontract/im plied trust. The plaintif f appears in court (whether they know it or not) as the implied beneficiary of the implied trust (contrac t). The judge will const rue the implied trust relationship found in the alleged contract into a const ructive trust (court order) which specifies the rights of the plaintif flbeneficiary and the duties of the other party to the implied trust-the defendant/tru stee. Because this process is trust-based, there is no requirement for full disclo sure. Beneficia ries can be denominated as plaintif fs; trustees can be denominated as defendants or responden ts. Pleadings can even be denominated as petition s. The court being duty bound to act in the best interest of the beneficia ries, will almost always favor the plaintif f. So if the courts are not about the law or facts, what is it about? Answ er: Have you been a good REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 472"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"trustee today? In other words, it's about honor. Are you honoring the military occupa tion that's been in force since 1933, and are you performing according to all of those implied contracts and the statutes that you have been exercising the benefits of? See \"On the Subject oj Sovereignty for detail s. The da nce of the courts is like a ball game, or a game of 'hot potato'. Who ever goes into dishonor first, looses the game, and there are penalties for hanging on to the 'hot potato '. It usually starts with the initiation of a suit or claim recorded by the clerk of the court. The clerk of the court passes the 'potato' to the Defendant via service of claim, e.g. summon s. Si nce you are surety for the Defendant/Debtor, it's essential for the courts , in order to play out its game to acquire jurisdiction or nexus to the flesh and blood living person. They do this by inducing you to plead, argue, testify, and/or sign ... on the bottom line! I hope you're not in shock (this is a lot of informati on), or that your eyes are beginning to glaze over. So now the potato is in your hands, and you have two choices, HONOR or DISHONOR. If you don't respond in the stipulated period of time, or go silent, that is a dishonor. If you charge into court like a thunderbolt-a rguin g, testifying and demanding your non-exist ent Const itutional ri ghts, you are in disho nor (you also give them jurisdictio n). \"But, indeed, no private person has a right to complain, by suit in court, on the ground of a breach of the Constitution. The Constitution, it is true, is a compact [contract], but he is not a party to it. The States are a party to it .•• \" Padelf ord, Fay & Co. v. The Mayor and Alderman of the City of Savanna h, 14 Ga. 438 (1854) So what can you do? CAFV , Ask questions (Demur e), accept for value, file an affidavit(s) and file your Tort claim ! (liens are a no-no !). All you really need to do is become smart enough to rebut the presumpt ions, but let the other side establish an 'agreement' with you! If you can't separate yourself from any implied fiduciary obliga tion to the plaint iff (benef iciary) , your toast. While it is not the purpose of this essay to teach you how to fully do this, it will give you a serious head start. The first major step toward separating yourself is to become a Secured party. On the value of the UCC- l filing : If you don't file, there is no public notice in place of the superior security interest over the property to displace the courts presumption that you do not control your property/debtor and affairs. Silent judicial notice of the lack of is fact will be noted and the court will assume control by your default. Note : Many people in the freedom movement are under the impression that the agents of the UNITED STATES, STATES , COU NTIES and CITIES are doing it all wrong. However consid er that THEY are doing it RIGHT ! As there are only CREDITOR S and DEBTO RS, and you are perceived to be the Debtor ! This includes those who claim to understand Redemption, when in fact they are practicing Common Law execut ion, which is not Redempti on. They have failed to realize that there is no REMEDY under the Common Law anymore because there is NO MONEY . They 're doing certif icates of prote st (dishon or), instead of acceptance for value (honor) .

It's best to keep dialog in any courtroom encounter to a minim um. Clear, conci se, statements and closed ended questions that can be answered with a yes or no are best. However, the following six questions are good to control most courtroom encounte rs. They are simple and will generally solicit a predictable and reliable respon se. Remember, to ask questions is to 'demur', to answer questions is to 'travers e' (testify!) and you are not there to testify ! It is recommended that you memorize and roll play the statements and quest ions with a partner until you feel that you can remember and deliver them under pressure while you're managing your adrenalin pumpin g. The more disagreeable your training partner is, the more your responses will be tested. It is far better to draw a blank expression in a training session, than when you're' facing a court judge-you will lose control of the dialog if you are unable to martial a capable respon se. Questions are: 1. Do you have a claim against me? (as covered above !) 2. Are you asking me to testify? 3. I'm here to exchange the exemption and a guilty plea to the facts, for the bond. 4. I am not here to dispute the facts 5. What is my liability or nexus to the statute s? 6. I accept your offer for value on proof of claim that the state Const itution operates upon me, by and through the state legisla ture, by and through the state statute s. 7. I stipulate to all the facts and accept and return the same for full settlement and closure in the transaction. 8. I take exception to all matters raised in these proceeding . 9. I don't understand, I'm not signing anything, and I do n't consent to being incarcerated (usually stated at sentenci ng!) Also, understand the following conce pts: • If you argue, the judge gets discretion over all your pre sumpt ions, because no one can prove anything. Besides, that's how they keep their jobs, and charge their clients higher court-appearance fees. If judges were to let it be known that they choose who wins based on dishono rs, the game would be over, and none of them would have any work. • Case sites are arguments (dishonors) and are nothing but opinions and presumpt ions, which are clearly public illusion. This is why judges never read more than one or two REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 474"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"pages of each side's briefs, no matter how long they are, or how much evidence you attach. • When you file evidence of your completed 'Conditional Acceptanc e' (in regards to the 'officer' or the 'Prosecuto r') that plaintif f has failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, there is now an 'agreement on the table and tha t's all the judge can see and now he's placed in a minis terial capacity, not a judicial capacity due to evidence of no controvers y! OTHER APPLICATIONS THREE STR IKES: Realize that debts are PAID in the public during the bankruptcy of the U.S. You can tender an offer to discha rge all old case 'bonds ', bails, or other obligat ions with an exchange of your exemption (valuable consideration), un-do the lasting liability of those old cases, and stop them from coming against you in the present case, then offer to discharge the present case with asset instrument and not a liability instrument s. The court may rule your criminal charges ADJOURNED ! CO MPET ENCY : Defense counse l raises a question about defendant's competen cy. Interpretati on: Since you were so stupid as to let this guy get these papers into the record, I'm shifting the liability to you, (the judge) so you better hope this bozo falls into dishonor (agues or goes silent) in this civil charge, which will allow us to reinstate the criminal charge . The compete ncy claim was conditionally accepted upon proof of claim that (1) the defense attorney has submitted probable cause for the claim that the mental compet ency of the man was in question (by putting in an af fidavit listing the specific behaviors demonstrating said incompeten ce); (2) that any test administered by the psychologist would be a more valid predictor of compete ncy than the 5 affidavits from people who have known you for 20-yea rs (can ink-blot test do this???); and (3) the public hasn't attempted to shift liability for this guy's loss of freedom onto the psycholog ists! VIOLATION OF PRO BAT ION : Man threatened with 3 years for probation violation. The Public Defender was honored (got the potato passe d to him) when the creditor (respondent) asked him to release the bond in excha nge for his exempti on, and get the living soul released. The Public Defender visited the jail on numerous occasions but ignored the respondent (disho nor). Upon protest (for the dishonor) , the court noticed the position the Public Defender was in. Then one day, \"all of a sudden\", the District Attorney responsible for setting all the parties in the court, tells the Public Defender that the District Attorney thinks he remembers something unusual about the case, and sends an invest igator to the old court (hundreds of miles away) to see if the transcript shows that respondent was never told to perform the 'duty' he was charged with 'violating '!

REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 478"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"Advanced Concepts and Techniques The next scenario details the 'Roger Elvic k' criminal trial involving writing checks on a closed account (no longer sugge sted) in the recent past. The advanced concept here deals with the 'Appearance Bond.\" It has been effective, but to a point. It has been observed that your request for an 'Appearance Bond' be done during a 'fresh arrest' and the request made with your 'one free phone call', first asking for the phone number of the judge, to request 'the Appearance Bond without fees and costs.' If you seek the appearance Bond say after arraignment, most likely the request will be denied. Since the Bond is necessary for the commercial discha rge of the 'charges,' and it being denied , injury has been done in the matter and this point would be covered in your Tort! Is it public or private? In the matrix, on the public side of the equation you have the courts. Courts deal with fiction; fictional plaintiffs, fictional defendan ts, fictional laws (only applies to the Straw-man, not you), and fictional property (paper titles). You (flesh and blood) on the other hand, are on the private side. YOU are the source of ALL VALUE through your ACCEPTAN CE; pleas , signature, etc. Courts and their repre sentat ives are insolvent ; they have no way of giving substance to ANYTHING, unless they can get YOU (flesh and blood) to give it value (cons iderati on). Consideration There are only two ways in which you can give consid eration in a commercial transaction, sweat equity and by using your exempt ion. Debtor- slaves on the plantation offer consid eration in the form of Federal Reserve Notes. Although Federal Reserve Notes are not backed by anything of value, they are a store of energy that represents their work. You earn these by doing time in the corporate work yard (please fill out your W -4 and 1099). Secured Party Creditors on the other hand can use their exemption (signature) in light of the US Bankrup tcy. The SPC has unlimited credit ! Why, because \"the wealth of the sovereign is in his credit.\" Via his exemption (signatur e)! Due to HJR 192-Public Law 73 via the bankruptcy that pledged all of your labor and property to satisfy the debt of the municipal corporate United States. Since you were dragged into the bankruptcy by fraud and all means to 'pay' were removed from circulation (abrogation of the gold clause), the only thing that has value is the commercial credit created by the CREDITOR . .. YOU ! Honor-Dishonor and the Draft All transactions are COMM ERCIAL, even criminal charges. The powe r of the court is to referee a dispute between the parties of a commercial transaction. There can be no judgment against you when both parties are in agreement, and consid eration has passed between them to settle the contract. Like an umpire in a foot ball game, the judge is supposed to 'blow the whistle' for REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 479"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"fouls, dirty play, or holding onto the ball for too long. The draft (example-brief filed) and the re­ draft (response brief) are the models for the commercial 'ball game', being play-out back and forth! While this is the normal way it's done in their court, your goal is to stay in honor while avoiding the dishonor, this being done via CAFV and 'agreeing with thy adversary '. Whenever you argue, testify, or fail to act (silence or perform) you are in dishonor. Courts of Equity or Common Law? The American legal system is based on equity not the common law. Bankruptcy means there is no way to pay a debt and without the ability to pay, there is no remedy under the common law. Since the courts are in bankr uptcy, they do not have the standing or capacity to execute a sentenc e, or charge you in common law. That's why the prosecutor and the judge will get YOU to 'admit, confess, consent or agree ' to the charge, fine or incarcerat ion! Look at it this way, if the public charge s you, why does the judge want you to post bond? Because now that you've plead and granted the court subject matter jurisdiction, they want you to assume the liability. Why should they disclose that they must post the Bond and bring it forward upon your request if they do not want to assume the liability? If you are practicing common law execution (Const itutional arguments, law and procedure) you are not practicing Redemption, but arguing - giving life to a controversy and stepping into the jurisdiction to accept full liability for punish ment ! Don't look for your fourth amendment right in the courts, you have no rights ! The only right you have is the right to file a 'Tort Claim.' Many individuals that think they are doing redemption when they go in and argue the law, INSTEAD of Agree with thy adversary - accept for value and discha rge.

Two different approaches are offered depending on your status prior to making an appeara nce. STRATEGY ONE The first strategy assumes that you have mastered the information in Section 4: Becoming a Secured Party Creditor and Section 5: The Private Administrative Process . It also requires that you are a Secured Party Creditor and that you have exhau sted your admini strative process. If you have not accomplished this, you can skip this part and go directly to scena rio two. STRATEGY TWO Strategy two only assumes that you have been arrested and are now in jail aWaItmg your arraignment. The jail and the court will attempt to lure you into a contract. In the majority of cases, anything you sign on the public side will be a contract. Signatures will generally be requested on your booking form, for picture and fingerprint, and at the time your perso nal property is checked into the jail. When you are solici ted for the purpose of making a statement or providing your signa ture, state clearly that you do not conse nt to it. If you are pressured, ask the question \"Is this mandatory or voluntary .\" If they insist that it is mandatory, ask them to \"show you the law\". If they don't show it, tell them that \"you will wait for them to bring it to you. Failing this, if threatened, announce to them that you are signing under duress. Before you sign your name, write above the line where your signa ture goes \"Without Prejudice\" . This will reserve your rights. If the form is refused and they give you a new one, sign it the same way. When signatures are requested, ask the quest ion \"is my signa ture mandatory or voluntary ?\" ADDITIONAL GLOS SARY AP EARANCE BOND. Type of bail bond required to ensure presence of defendant in a criminal case. As a Secured Party Creditor you can request an appearance bond without fees and charges from the judge or prosecutor.

EQUITY. Justice admini stered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law. It is based on a system of rules and princ iples which originated in England as an alternative to the harsh rules of common law and which were based on what was fair in a particular situat ion. One sought relief under this system in courts of equity rather than in courts of law. The term \"equity\" denotes the spirit and habit of fairness, justice, and right dealing which would regulate the intercourse of men with men. Equity is a body of jurisprude nce, or field of jurisdiction, differing in its origin, theory and methods from the common law; though procedurally, in the federal courts and most state courts, equitable and legal rights and remedies are administered in the same court. See Equity, courts of.

The philosophy of law, or the science which treats of the principles of positive law and legal relations.

It has no direct concern with questions of moral or politica l policy, for they fall under the province or ethics and legisla tion; but, when a new or doubtful case arises to which two different rules seem, when taken literally, to be equally applicable, it may be, and often is, the function of jurisprudence to consider the ultimate effect which would be produced if each rule were applied to an indefinite number of simila r cases, and to choose that rule which, when so applied, will produce the greatest advantage to the community.

If you spend an hour to learn this material you will be rewarded for the rest of your life. If you should discuss Hale v. Henkel with a run-of-the-mill attorney, he or she will tell you that the case is 'old' and that it has been 'overturned .' If you ask that attorney for a citation of the case that overturned Hale v. Henk el, there will not be a meaningful response or a case produced. Hale v. Henkel was researched and what was found was this: \"We know that Hale v. Henkel was decided in 1905 in the U.S. Supreme Court.\" Since it was the Supreme Court who made the ruling, the case is binding on all courts of the land, until another Supreme Court case decision says it isn't. Has another Supreme Court case overturned Hale v. Henk el? The answer is NO! As a matter of fact, since 1905, the Supreme Court has cited Hale v. Henkel a total of 144 times. A fact more astounding is that since 1905, Hale v. Henkel has been cited by all of the federal and state appellate court systems a total of over 1600 times. None of the various issues of this case has ever been overturned. So, if the State through the office of judge continues to threaten to impri son or does impri son you, he/they are trying to or has forced you into the 'State created Office of 'person' while not being a party to their 'social compact. ' As long as you continue to claim your Rightful Office of 'soverei gn, the State lacks all jurisdiction over you. The State needs someone filling the office of 'person' in order to continue prosecuting a case in their private courts. [ Note: most all court cases are void!] The threat of jail or a hefty fine or a few weeks in ja il puts intense pressure upon most 'persons'. Jail means the loss of work, respect, humilia tion in the community, separation from home and loved ones, piling up of debts , possi ble fines, etc. Judges will aid in applying this pressure when they attempt to arraign you. When brought into a crowded courtroom in chain s, the issue of counsel will quickly come up and you can tell the judge that \"Are you addressing the debtor or the secured party, because I'm the 'secured party - third party intervener ' in this matter over title to the property and that the name on the charging instrument is not m., I'm here for settlement and adjustment of the account! \" Most things about your life are private and not the State's busin ess to evaluate .

At any time papers are presented to you to sign, ask the question \"Is my signature on this document mandatory or voluntary ?\" \"If it is mandatory, please provide the law that says that I must sign!\" \"If it's voluntary, then I do not wish to voluntary sign!\" The import of this is that no one can force you to sign a contract or agreement ... including the State via their agent s/officers/employ ees.

The Supreme Court in the case of Wills vs. Michigan State Police, 105 L. Ed. 2d 45 (1989) made it perfectly clear that the Sovereign cannot be named in any statute as merely a \"person\" or \"any person .\" The private man or woman is a member of said \"sove reignty, itself remains with the People, by whom and for whom all government exists and acts.\" Now that you know the hidden evil in the word 'person,' try to stop using that word in everyday conversat ion. Simply use the correct term; man, woman or private man, private woman, etc. Train yourself, your family and your friends to not use the derogatory word 'person' The word \"person\" in legal termi nology is perceived as a general word which normally includes in its scope a variety of entities other than human beings. See e.g. 1 U.S.C. sec 1. Church of Scientology v. U.S. Dept. of Justice (1979) 612 F.2d 417, 425. One of the very first of your state statutes will have a section listed entitled \"Definiti ons.\" Carefully study this section of the statutes and you will find a portion that reads simila r to this excer pt: In const ruing these statutes and each and every word, phrase, or part hereof, where the context will permi t: (1) The singula r includes the plural and vice versa. (2) Gender- specific language includes the other gender and neuter. (3) The word \"person\" includes individual s, children, firms, associations, joint adventure s, partners hips, estates, trusts, busin ess trusts, syndicat es, fiduciar ies, corporati ons, and all other groups or combination s. NOTE : HOWEVER, THE DEFINITIONS STATUTE DOES NOT LIST MAN OR WOMAN -­ THEREFORE THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM ALL THE STATUTES !!! Under the rule of const ruction \"expr essio unius est exclusio alteriu s,\" where a statute or Const itution enumerates the things on which it is to operate or forbids certain things, it is ordinarily to be const rued as exclud ing from its operation all those not expressly mentioned. Generally words in a statute should be given their plain and ordinary meani ng. When a statute does not specifically define words, such words should be const rued in their common or ordinary sense to the effect that the rules used in const ruing statutes are also applicable in the const ruction REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 489"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"of the Constitution. It is a fundamental rule of statutory con struction that words of common usage when used in a statute should be const rued in their plain and ordinary sense . If you carefully read the statute laws enacted by your state legisla ture you will also notice that they are all written with phrases similar to these five examples : 1. A person commits the offense of failure to carry a license if the person ... 2. A person commits the offense of failure to register a vehicle if the person ... 3. A person commits the offense of driving uninsured if the person ... 4. A person commits the offense of fishing if the person .. . 5. A person commits the offense of breathing if the person .. . Notice that only \"person s\" can commit these state legislature created crime s. A crime is by definition an offense committed against the \"state.\" If you commit an offense against a human, it is called a tort. Examples of torts would be any personal injury, slander, or defamation of character. So how does someone become a \"person \" and subject to regulation by state statutes and laws ? There is only one way. You must ask the state for permi ssion to volunteer to become a state person. You must volunteer because the U.S. Const itution forbids the state from compelling you into slavery. This is found in the 13th and 14th Amendme nts. 13th Amendment - Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punish ment for crime , whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction . 14th Amendment - Section 1. All persons born or natural ized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due proc ess of law, nor deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. You become a state created statutory \"person\" by taking up residency within the state and stepping into the office of \"person .\" You must hold an \"office\" within the state government in order for that state govern ment to regulate and control you. First comes the legislatively created office, person, then comes their control. If you do not have an office in state government, the legislature's control over you would also be prohibited by the Decla ration of Rights section, usually found to be either Section I or II, of the State Const itution as it operates upon the agent of government . The most common office held in a state is therefore the office known as \"person.\" Your state legislature created this office as a way to control peopl e. It is an office most people occupy without even knowing that they are doing so. The legisla ture cannot lawfully control you because you are a flesh and blood human being . God alone created you, and by Right of Creation, He alone can control you. It is the nature of Law, REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 490"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"that what One create s, One controls. This natural Law is the force that binds a creature to its creator. God created us and we are, theref ore, subject to His Laws, whether or not we acknowledge Him as our Creator. The way the state gets around God's Law and thereby controls the People is by creating only an office and not a real man. This office is titled as \"person\" and then the legislature claims that you are filling that office. Legislators erroneou sly now think that they can make laws that also control men. They create entire bodies of laws - motor vehicle code, building code, compulsory education laws, and so on, ad nauseum. They still cannot control men or women , but they can now control the office they created. And look who is sitting in that office -- YOU. Then they create government departments to administer regulations to these offices. Within these administrative departments of state government are hundreds of other state created offices. There is everything from the office of janitor to the office of governor. But these administrative departments cannot function properly unless they have subjects to regulate . The legislature obtains these subjects by creating an office that nobody even realizes to be an official state office. They have created the office of \"person.\" The state creates many other offices such as police officer, prosecutor, judge etc. and everyone understands this concept . However, what most people fail to recognize and understand is the most common state office of all, the office of \"person.\" Anyone filling one of these state offices is subject to regulation by their creator, the state legislature. Through the state created office of \"person,\" the state gains its authority to regulate, control and judge you, the real human . What they have done is apply the natural law principle, \"what one create s, one control s.\" A look in Webst er's dictiona ry reveal s the origin of the word \"person.\" It literally means \"the mask an actor wears . \" The legislature creates the office of \"person\" which is a mask. They cannot create real people, only God can do that. But they can create the \"office\" of \"person, \" which is merely a mask, and then they persuade a flesh and blood man to put on that mask by offeri ng a fictitious privilege, such as a driver license. Now the legisla ture has gained complete control over both the mask and the actor behind the mask. A resident is another state office holder. All state residents hold an office in the state government. But not everyone who is a resident also holds the office of \"person . \" Some residents hold the office of judge and they are not persons. Some residents hold the office of prosecutors and they are not persons. Some residents hold the office of police officer(s) and they are not perso ns. Some residents hold the office of legisla tors and they are not persons. REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 491"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"Some residents are administrators and bureaucrats and they also are not persons. Some residents are attorneys and they also are not persons. An attorney is a state officer of the court and is firmly part of the judicial branch. The attorneys will all tell you that they are \"licensed \" to practice law by the state Supreme Court. Therefore, it is un-lawf ul for any attorney to hold any position or office outside of the judicial branch. There can be no attorney legisla tors - no attorney mayors - no attorneys as police - no attorneys as governor. Yes, I know it ha ppens all the time. However, this practice of multiple office holding by attorneys is prohibited by the Const itution and is a felony in most states. If you read farther into your state Const itution you will find a clause stating this, the Separation of Powers , which will essentially read as follow s: Branches of government -- The powe rs of the state government shall be divided into legisla tive, executive and judicial branches. No person belonging to one branch shall exercise any powers appertaining to either of the other branches unless expressly provided herein. Theref ore, a police officer cannot arrest a pro secutor, a prosecutor cannot prosecute a sitting judge, and a judge cannot order the legisla ture to perform and so on. Because these \"offices\" are not person s, the state will not, and cannot prosecute them, therefore they enjoy almost complete protection by the state in the perform ance of their daily duties. This is why it is impossible to sue or file charges again st most government employee s. If their crimes could rise to the level where they \"shock the community \" and cause alarm in the people, then they will be terminated from state employment and lose their absolute protection. If you carefully pay attention to the news, you will notice that these government employees are always terminated from their office or state employment and then are they arrested, now as a common person, and charged for their crime s. Simply put, the state will not eat its own. The reason all state residents hold an office is so the state can control everythi ng. It wants to create every single office so that all areas of your life are under the complete control of the state. Each office has prescribed duties and responsi bilities and all these offices are regulated and governed by the state. If you read the fine print when you apply for a state license or privilege you will see that you must sign a decla ration that you are in fact a \"resident\" of that state. \"Person\" is a subset of resident. Judge is a subset of resident. Legislator and police officer are subsets of resident. If you hold any office in the state, you are a resident and subject to all legislative decrees in the form of statute s. They will always say that we are free men. But they will never tell you that the legislatively created offices that you are occup ying are not free. They will say, \"All men are free,\" because that is a true statement. What they do not say is, that holding any state office binds free men into slavery for the state. They are ever ready to trick you into accepting the state office of \"perso n,\" and once you are filling that office, you cease to be free man. You become regulated creature s, called person s, totally created by the legisla ture. You will hear \"free men\" mentioned all the time, but you will never hear about \"free persons .\" REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 492"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"If you build your life in an office created by the legisla ture, it will be built on shifting sands . The office can be changed and manipulated at any time to conform to the whims of the legisla ture. When you hold the office of \"person\" created by the legislature, your office isn't fixed. Your duties and responsi bilities are ever changing. Each legislative session binds a \"person\" to ever more burdens and requirements in the form of more rules, laws and statute s. Most state Const itutions have a section that declares the fundamental powe r of the People : Political power -- All political power is inherent in the People. The enuncia tion herein of certain Rights shall not be const rued to deny or impair others retained by the People. Notice that this says \"people \", it does not say persons. This statement declares beyond any doubt that the People are Sovereign over their created government. This is natural law and the natural flow of delegated power. A Sovereign is a private, non-r esident, non-domestic, non-person, non-in dividual, NOT SUBJE CT to any real or imaginary statutory regulations or quasi laws enacted by any state legislature which was created by the People. When you are pulled over by the police, roll down your window and say, \"You are speaking to a Sovereign political power holder. I do not consent to you detaining me. Why are you detaining me against my will?\" Now the state office of police man know s that \"IT\" is talking to a flesh and blood Sovereign. The police officer cannot cite a Sovereign because the state legislature can only regulate what they create. And the state does not create Sovereign politica l power holders . It is very important to lay the proper foundation, right from the beginn ing. Let the police officer know that you are a Sovereign. Remain in your proper office of Sovereign political power holder. Do not leave it. Do not be persuaded by police pressure or tricks to put on the mask of a state \"person.\" Why aren't Sove reigns subject to the state's charge s? Because of the concept of offi ce. The state is attempting to prosecute only a particular office known as \"person.\" If you are not in that state created office of \"person ,\" the state statutes simply do not apply to you. This is common sense, for exam ple, if you are not in the state of Texas, then Texas laws do not apply to you. For the state to control someone, they have to first create the office. Then they must coerce a warm­ blooded creature to come fill that office. They want you to fill that office. Here is the often expressed understanding from the United States Supreme Court, that \"in common usage, the term \"person\" does not include the Sovereign, statutes employing the word person are ordinarily const rued to exclude the Sovereig n.\" Wilson v. Omaha Tribe, 442 U.S. 653, 667 (1979) (quoting United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U.S. 600, 604 (1941)). See also United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 275 (1947). The idea that the word \"person\" ordinarily excludes the Sovereign can also be traced to the \"familiar principle that the King is not bound by any act of Parliament unless he be named therein by specia l and particular words . \" REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 493"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"Dolla r Savings Bank v.

Herron, 20 Wall. 251, 255 (1874), even the principle as applied to the enacting Sovereign is not without limitati ons: \"Where an act of Parliament is made for the public good, as for the advancement of religion and justice or to prevent injury and wrong, the king is bound by such act, though not particularly named therein; but where a statute is general, and thereby any prerogative, Right, title, or interest is divest ed or taken from the king, in such case the king is not bound, unless the statute is made to extend to him by express words .\" U.S. Supreme Court Justice Holmes explain ed: \"A Sovereign is exempt from suit, not because of any formal conception or obsolete theory, but on the logical and practical ground that there can be no legal Right as again st the authority that makes the law on which the Right depen ds.\" Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U.S. 349, 353, 27 S. Ct. 526, 527, 51 L. Ed. 834 (1907). The majority of American states fully embrace the Sovereign immunity theory as well as the federal government. See Restatement (Second) of Torts 895B, comment at 400 (1979). The following U.S. Supreme Court case makes clear all these princip les: \"I shall have occasion incidentally to evince, how true it is, that states and governments were made for man; and at the same time how true it is, that his creatures and servants have first deceived, next vilified, and at last oppressed their master and maker .\" \" ... A state, useful and valuable as the contrivance is, is the inferior contrivance of man; and from his native dignity derives all its acquired importance . ... \" \"Let a [political] State be consid ered as subordinate to the people: But let everything else be subordinate to the state. The latter part of this position is equally neces sary with the former. For in the practice, and even at length, in the science of politics there has very frequently been a strong current against the natural order of things, and an inconsid erate or an interested disposi tion to sacrifice the end to the means. As the state has claimed precedence of the people ; so, in the same inverted course of things, the government has often claimed precedence of the state; and to this perversion in the second degree, many of the volumes of conf usion concerning Sovereignty owe their existence. The ministers, dignified very properly by the appellation of the magistra tes, have wished and have succeeded in their wish, to be considered as the Sovereigns of the state. This second degree of perversion is confined to the old world, and begins to diminish even there but the first degree is still too prevalent even in the several states, of which our union is compo sed. By a state I mean, a complete body of free persons united together for their common benefit, to enjoy peaceably what is their own, and to do justice to others . It is an artificial person. It has its affairs and its interests: It has its rules: It has its Rights : and it has its obligati ons. It may acquire property distinct from that of its membe rs.

It may be bound by contra cts; and for damages arising from the breach of those contra cts. In all our contemplation s, however, concerning this feigned and artificial person, we should never forget, that, in truth and nature, those who think and speak and act, are men. Is the foregoing description of a state a true description? It will not be questioned, but it is . ... \" \"It will be sufficient to observe briefl y, that the Sovereignties in Europe, and particularly in England, exist on feudal principles. That system considers the prince as the Sovereign, and the people as his subjects; it regards his person as the object of allegiance, and excludes the idea of his being on an equal footing with a subject, either in a court of justice or elsew here. That system contemplates him as being the fountain of honor and authority; and from his grace and grant derives all franchise, immunities and privil eges; it is easy to perceive that such a Sovereign could not be amenable to a court of justice, or subjected to judicial control and actual const raint. It was of necessity, therefore, that suability became incom patible with such Sovereignty. Besides, the prince having all the executive powers , the judgment of the courts would, in fact, be only monitory, not mandatory to him, and a capacity to be advised, is a distinct thing from a capacity to be sued. The same feudal ideas run through all their jurisprudence, and const antly remind us of the distinction between the prince and the subject.\" \"No such ideas obtain here (speaking of Americ a): at the revolution, the Sovereignty devolved on the people ; and they are truly the Sovereigns of the country, but they are Sovereigns without subjects (unless the African slaves among us may be so called) and have none to govern but themsel ves; the citizens of America are equal as fellow citize ns, and as joint tenants in the Sovereignty. Chisholm v. Georgia (February Term, 1793) 2 U.S. 419, 2 Dall. 419, 1 L.Ed 440.\" There are many ways you can give up your Sovereign powe r and accept the role of \"person.\" One is by receiving state benefi ts. Another is by asking permi ssion in the form of a license or permit from the state. One of the subtlest ways of accepting the role of \"person\" is to answer the questions of bureaucra ts. When a state bureaucrat knocks on your door and wants to know why your children aren't registered in school , or a police office r pulls you over and starts asking question s, you immediately fi ll the office of \"person\" if you start answering their questio ns. It is for this reason that you should ignore or refuse to \"answer\" their questions and instead act like a true Sovereign, a King or Queen, and ask only your own questions of them. You are not a \"person\" subject to their laws. If they persist and haul you into their court unlawf ully, your response to the judge is si mple and direct, you the Sovereign, must tell him: \"I have no need to answer you in this matter. It is none of your busine ss whether I understand my Rights or whether I understand your fictitious charge s. It is none of your business whether I want counsel .\" The reason it is none of your business is because I am not a person regulated by the state.

The judge will try to force you to abandon your Sovereign sanctuary by threatening you with jail. No matter what happen s, if you remain faithful to your Sovereignty, the ju dge and the state may not lawfully move against you. The state did not create the office of Sovereign political power holder. Therefore, they do not regulate and control those in the office of Sovereign. They cannot ascribe penalties for breach of that particular office. The reason they have no authority over the office of the Sovereign is because they did not create it and the Sovereign people did not delegate to them any such power. When challenged, simply remind them that they do not regulate any office of the Sovereign and that their statutes only apply to those state employees in legisla tive created offices. This Sovereign individual paradigm is explained by the following U.S. Supreme Court case HALE V HENKEL: \"The individual may stand upon his Constitutional Rights as a citizen. He is entitled to carry on his private business in his own way. IDs power to contract is unlimited. He owes no such duty [to submit his books and papers for an examination] to the State, since he receives nothing there from, beyond the protection of his life and property. His Rights are such as existed by the law of the land [Common Law] long antecedent to the organization of the State, and can only be taken from him by due process of law, and in accordance with the Constitution. Among his Rights are a refusal to incriminate himself, and the immunity of himself and his property from arrest or seizure except under a warrant of the law. He owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their Rights.\" Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43 at 47 (1905). Let us analyze this case. It says, \"The individual may stand upon his Const itutional Rights .\" It does not say, \"the sovereign.\" There is a principle here is: \"You're not signatory to the Cons titution and not a party to the socia l compa ct. \" However, the sovereign ... \"is entitled to carry on his private business in his own way. \" It says \"private busin ess\" - you have a Right to operate a private busin ess. Then it says \"in his own way.\" It doesn't say \"in the governme nt's way. \" Then it says, \"His power to contract is unlimited .\" As a Sovereign individual , your power to REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 496"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"contract is unlimited. In common law there are certain criteria that determine the validity of contra cts. They are not important here, except that any contract that would harm others or viola te their Rights would be invalid. For example, a \"contract\" to kill someone is not a valid contract. Apart from this obviou s qualif ication, your power to contract is unlimited. Next it says, \"He owes no such duty [to submit his books and papers for an examination] to the State, since he receives nothing there from, beyond the protection of his life and property .\" The court case contrasted the duty of the corporation (an entity created by government permi ssion - feudal paradigm) to the duty of the Sovereign 'man'. The Sovereign 'man' doesn't need and didn't receive permi ssion from the governme nt, hence has no duty to the government. Then it says, \"His Rights are such as existed by the law of the land [Common Law] long antecedent to the organization of the State. \" This is very important. The Supreme Court recognized that human s have inherent Rights . The U.S. Const itution (including the Bill of Right s) does not grant Righ ts. We have fundamental Right s, irrespective of what the Const itution says. The Const itution acknowledges some rights and via the Bill of rights, but only as they operate upon the agents of government by their oath of office not to viola te them in respect to the peopl e. And Amendment IX states, \"The enumeration in the Cons titution, of certain Righ ts, shall not be const rued to deny or dispa rage others retained by the people .\" The important point is that our Rights antecede (come before, are senior to) the organization of the state. Next the Supreme Court says, \"And [his Rights] can only be taken from him by due process of law, and in accordance with the Constitution .\" Does it say the government can take away your Rights ? No! Your Rights can only be taken away \"by due process of law, and in accordance with the Const itution .\" \"Due process of law\" involves procedures and safeguards such as trial by jury. \"Trial by jury\" means, inter alia, the jury judges both law and fact. Then the case says, \"Among his Rights are a refusal to incriminate himself, and the immunity of himself and his property from arrest or seizure except under a warrant of the law.\" These are some of the supposed Rights of a Sovereign man. Sovereign men need not report anything about them selves or their businesses to anyone. Finally, the Supreme Court says, \"He owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their Rights .\" Therefore, does the Sove reign man owe taxes? If you should discuss Hale v. Henkel with a run-of-the-mill attorney, he or she will tell you that the case is \"old\" and that it has been \"overturned .\" If you ask that attorney for a citation of the case or cases that overturned Hale v. Henkel, there will not be a meanin gful response. The OUTLAWS have researched Hale v. Henkel and here is what we found: As stated above, we know that Hale v. Henkel was decided in 1905 in the U.S. Supreme Court. Since it was the Supreme Court, the case is binding on all courts of the land, until another Supreme Court case says it isn't. Has another Supreme Court case overturned Hale v. Henkel ? The answer is NO. None of the various issues of this case has ever been overruled.

Sands, Sutherland 's Statutes and Statutory Const ruction SS 47. 16 (4th ed. 1973); ct. Lenhoff v. Birch Bay Real Estate, Inc., 22 Wn. App. 70, 79, 587 P.2d 1087 (1978). In light of the contex t, the word \"person\" should be interpreted to mean \"corporation or company\" (See 73 C.J.S. Property sec. 10, 63A Am Jur 2d Property sec. 2). The meani ng of doub tful words may be determined by refere nce to their relati onship with other associated words; Shurgard v. State, 40 Wash. App. 721, 700 P2d 1176 (1985), City of Mercer Island v. Kaltenbach, (Wash. 1962),371 P2d 1009; 2A N. Singer, Statutory Const ruction SS 47. 16 (4th ed. 1984). To properly const rue the term \"person \", we must look to statutes in pari materia, Kucher v. Pierce County, 24 Wash . App. 281, 600 P2d 683 (1979); The word \"pers on\" in legal termi nology is perceived as a general word which normally includes in its scope a variety of entities other than human beings. See e.g. 1 U.S.c. ss 1. Church of Scientology v U.S. Dept. of Justice, 612 F 2d 417, 425 (1979). The \"ejusdem gener is\" rule requires that general terms appearing in a statute in connection with specific terms are to be given mean ing and effect to the extent that the general terms suggest items similar to those designated by the specific terms. In short, specific terms modif y or restrict the application of general terms where both are used in sequenc e. King County Water Dist. 68 v. Tax Comm'n, 58 Wn.2d 282 244 (195 1). Under the rule of ejusdem generis, specific words modif y and restrict interpretation of general words. Dean v. McFarland, 81 Wash . 2d 215, 221; 500 P2d 1244 (1972). The meaning of the general words, \"includes every natural person, firm, co-pa rtnership, corporati on, association, or organization\" are restricted by the specific word \"corporation \". \"corporati on\" is defined in Black's Law Dictionary, 4th Editi on, Page 409, as: CORPORATI ON.

The police are a private army and have been at war with you since President Roos evelt, under color of law, altered the Trading With the Enemy Act, effectively declaring all Sovereign Americans to be enemies of the state . On October 6, 1917, the UNITED STATES passed a corporate policy called the Trading with the Enemy Act. In Section 2, sub-section (c) of the Act it defines the enemy as \"other than citizens of the UNITED STATES\", i.e., any individual not born in the District of Columbia, a territory, or posses sion of the UNITED STATES- the Sovereign people of Amer ica. Soverei gns are \"foreign\" to the UNITED STATES. Then on March 3, 1933, the Trading with the Enemy Act was again amended for the pur pose of confi scating all private gold holdi ngs. While the amendment only targeted \"citizens of the UNITED STATES\", the Executive Order calling in the gold was circula ted throughout the 50 states of the Republic, implying that those \"foreign\" to the UNITED STATES were also obligated to comply with the order. The trick worked. A dolla r of gold was excha nged for a dollar of debt. The debt was owed to the Federal Reserve Bank on which they charge interest in the form of the Income Tax.

When you walked into the DMV to register 'your' car, through the 'registration' process, you SURRENDERED the 'owner ship' of the car/vehicle to the State.

Do you remember signing that Power of Attorney? As Secured Party Creditor (SPC), having 'registered' your property, the car, boat, motorc ycle, etc., on a UCC- 3, you have effectively established a 'superior security interest' in the property, over and above the State. You have in essence, placed a 'cloud' over the property, saying \"I have a superior interest in this property and it is filed first-in-line-fi rst-in-t ime\" ... unless anyone by prior notice via UCC filing, has a superior filing before yours ! Your UCC filing becomes evidence of your Title to the property, and as referenced in your security agreement.

Before discussing the mechanics and techniques of the police encounter it is very important for you to understand that the police and court system today is extremely corrupt and operates in many cases without authority, due process, or even the pretense of legality. If you have any illusions that you are living under a Const itutional system where your so-ca lled civil rights are protected under the common law, you are seriou sly misinforme d. There is a high probability that you will be treated with contempt, and it is impossible to expect any kind of uniform results using ANY technique. There are simply too many varia bles.

You are not required to give persona l information such as socia l security numbe rs, even though you may be pressured to supply it. It's best to keep dialog in any encounter as short as possible.

The incident starts when Martin goes to the Sara's apartment to request his possessio ns. After a few minutes of dialog she threatens to call the police. Martin, feeling somewhat threatened, leaves the door and walks to the garden area of the apartment complex and sits down on a bench to think about what to do .

They now have probable cause to arrest Martin, who goes to jail as a John Doe, until they can figure out who he is. This scenario has all the elements referred as a citizen informant (having inside knowledge), a naIve suspect, and probable cause for an arr est. Martin cooperated fully (rolled over) , and all of the information he provided was used against him. Martin was completely within his rights to remain silent, but he didn't know that. For thi s reason he was a mark-f ood for the system. SENERIO 3: Now let' s use our understanding of police practice and the techniques to see how Martin may have handled this situation differe ntly.

Martin is sitting peacefully by hims elf, and there is no crime being committed . Whereas the police may have reasonable suspicion to detain Martin based on the information that they were provided, they recognize Martin 's right against self incriminati on. Martin has just saved himself a whole lot of headache by simply knowing how to use some basic informati on. SENERIO 4: The next two strategies are offered as examples of some other approaches that one might take. While good technique s, there is a lot more risk involved . The more verbose the dialog is, the greater the chance that you may be cut off mid stream while delivering your message. There is also the attendant risk that you might forget your lines, or fail to recall them under stressful circumsta nces. These techniques are desig ned to throw the police officer off guard by overwhelming him with information that sounds credible, and to which he must weigh the potential liability to him against whatever he hopes to gain in the encounter. If you run into trouble with these technique s, you could always return to the more conse rvative approach outlined above as a fallback position. Stay within your abilities and be safe. Officer: Sir, may I see your driver 's license? Motori st: Sir, may I see your identification; your bond card and number and the company or agency that you are bonded with? (If they claim the State, ask for the State's Bonding Com pany) Officer: What are you talking about? Motor ist: Well you know that in order to arrest me you need a bond (i.e. insurance) in case you violate my rights as a sovereign. Officer: No, I don't know anything about that. Motor ist: Well, If you don't have a bond to protect my rights, then I am free to go and I am leaving . Because you cannot charge me or give me a ticket unless you are Bonded ! Bye!

The last topics we will cover relates to travel documentation and the often asked question : \"Are REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 509"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"there alternatives to automobile registration, driver 's license, and insuranc e. The answers to these questions constitute a whole course in and of them selves, so we will only provide an overvi ew. On the topic of registrati on, if you go way back in your states early history near the introduction of the automobile, you will discov er that once upon a time, automobile registration was only required for the commercial use of a vehicle, and still is! If you are not engaged in commerce (your vehicle is not for hir e), the state has no business regulating your vehicle. In addition, a drive r's license is a violation of your right/freedom to trave l. (Aga in, see MYTH ILOGICAL MOTOR VEHICLE article!) States also have laws on the books which give you the option of using a liability bond in place of auto insurance. The bond option is not widely know or unders tood, and the state would like to keep it that way. If you are a Secured Party Creditor, you have unlimited liability, why not use it! If you prepare a bond in place of insura nce, and show it should you be stopped, the officer is compelled to accept it. If not, ask the officer if s/he \"is a lawyer and if s/he is making a legal deter minat ion. This should get their attenti on. The drive r's license issue is a little harder to deal with but it can be done . The background for understanding why the state is so insistent that you have one, is that next to the Social Security Card, the driver 's licen se is the principle means of identifying and keeping track of you. The two definit ions following this paragraph, gives you a feel for why they want you to have one. If you understand how the bankruptcy changed everything, including the form of \"law\" practiced today, you can grasp the reasons for this. Remember also, that you are an enemy of the state which is at war with you. (See Trading with the Enemy Act). VEHICLE. That in or on which persons, goods , etc. may be carried from one place to another, espec ially along the ground. That which is used as an instrument of conveya nce, transmission or communicat ion. Vehicle refers to every device in, upon or by which a person or property is or may be transported upon a highway. Black's Law 6th Edition Note : According to the above definit ion, a transmitting utility is a Straw-man vehicle. Also, another definition for vehicle is an \"inland vessel in admiralty \". VESSEL. The term vessel, in admiralty law, is not limited to ships or vessels engaged in commer ce. Black's Law 6th Edition Note : In admiralty, names of vessel are designated in all-capital letters. Whenever you appear in any public forum it is always via your Straw-man, your all-capital­ letters vessel, much like an officer stands on the bridge of his ship and sails it into port. All law is now admiralty/maritime and you can no longer go into court as a man or woman, only by \"sailing your vessel\" into the jurisdiction of the court. Everyone speaks from his/her vessel, in terms of one vessel-o fficer to another. Each is trying to get the other officer to rec ognize the condition of his/her vessel; i.e. its registrat ion. If a vessel is unregi stered on the high seas in time of war it is presumed or assumed to be a pirate vessel to be confiscated and investigated. If the vessel is registered, then the issue is exactly what public entity is it registered REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 510"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"to, and is that entity on the public side or the private?

So yes, you can drive without a drive r's license IF (the biggest word in the English language) you want to defend it all the time. Remember, a traffic stop isn't a good opportunity to educate your faithful servants on the fine points of SovereigntyIRedemp tion. If you know how to defend it successf ully, you can build a local reputation, and they will leave you alone. If you travel widely however, you will be doing a lot of explaining as you go. Some who drive without a license as a secured party, elect to have private engraved license frame that say \"SECURED PARTY CREDITOR-PRIVATE PROPERTY, followed by their UCC- I contract number. While the 'frame' is not going to keep you out of trouble, it is notice ! On the question of travel docume nts, this is a tricky subject. It's hard to predict exactly what the officer's respon se might be. If you are looking for an alternative to the drive r's license, carry whatever alternative you wish to use. If you're a secured party, it would probably serve you to carry a certified copy of your UCC- I, and UCC-3, and your privatelliability bond . But anything more will probably cause proble ms. Officers have been known to throw documentation back at drivers, throw it on the ground, or fold it and put it in their pocket. But it's not your job to conduct impromptu Redemption classes along the roa dside. It will be the rare officer whose interest will be piqued by what you are doing . The best way to deal with the issues of adhesion contracts is to become a Secured Party Creditor. Attempting to rescind adhesion contracts is an effort that doesn 't really bear much fruit. Number one, it will make your life inconvenient. Two, the matrix is more pervasive than just adhesion contract s. Three you can sign all of your paperwork with the State, \"Without Prejudice\" and preserve all of your rights. Four, adhesion contracts did not involve your consent, a necessary element to contract, so they can't be defended in court. So do exactly as you please-you 're the Sovereign! Remember though, you are NOT to prote st or go to war! Your to go to Peace, accept, discharge and file a Tort claim, if neces sary! However, remember, the 'Traffic Officer' is an employee/agent of the State Corporati on. They are there to solely protect the property of the 'corporat ion,' and regulate the 'subject property/debtor slaves on the plantation via enforcement of private rules, statute s, etc., i.e., Drive r's License, Registration, Insura nce, etc., but techni cally, only if you are engaged in commercial use, occupation or professional of the use of the highways for profit or gain in a commercial use of said highway s. If not, there is misapplication of the statute, law, etc. So as the Secured Party Creditor, as the Oregon State Statutes state (as an exampl e); Tort is the exclusive remedy. Therefore, due to this section on Traff ic, courts, etc., on a case by case situation, you have to do whatever you have to do to deal with the matter as best you can. But keep in mind, if any agent/employee mi sapplies the statute, law, etc., your ONLY REMEDY IS TORT ! Tort deals with the 'moral wrong(s)' committed against you.

Kennedy, Attorney at Law and Virginia Jailer - By permission It is unusua l that any attorney, let alone a conse rvative attorney, would dare to speak: out against the judicia l system and its supporting agencies for several reasons, only some being obvio us. But for me to sit in front of some of the news shows night after night, hearing the debate over the woes of the Military Courts and how we are known for our Civil and Criminal Due Process Rights , and at the same time picturing in my mind the many people who have been hoodwinked and even ruined by this so called \"just\" system, is not tolerable to me. Linda L. Kennedy, Attorney at Law Dear Media : I realize that some of you may not be aware of the deception that the \"due process/Con stitutional attorne ys\" are spewing out on our airways, but let me set that record straight for you on military courts -- and I hope you have the guts and integrity to report it. I have heard of no one who is saying on the air what I have to say today . Many unfortunate citizens know and agree with what I will be describing to you. That is why I am writing, because it must be said and you must hear it from an other wise, conse rvative attorney. Additionally, I had just recently met with a former Attorney General of the United States. Although he indica ted that the judicia l system needs fixing, for him it was all about one politica l party being right while the other one was wrong. That is absolutely not the problem. Because this point of view I am presenting will be surprising coming from a \"conservative\" (trained at Pat Rober tson's Regent University School of Law) attorney, I hope you will see how ridiculous the Military Court v. Civil /Criminal Court's debate actually is and the legal fiction the distinction between the two creates. The public should not be fooled by these \"schola rs\" who try to paint a difference between the two systems which are in all practicality, the same. Additionally, I have put myself in grave jeopardy becau se I dare speak: out against the \"gods\" of some of the courts, i.e., some of the judges, and their government agencies, for obvious reasons. It has been and still is professio nal suicide to say what I have to say and I have certainly \"walked the plank\" more than just a few times for being so outspoken in a way that is not \"big-business friendly.\" What I have to say must be said however, for the public's best intere st. Most of what I am hearing on the air which is of concern to some of the Cons titutional attorneys being interviewed, is that the Milita ry Courts may be unfair because they do not allow for adequate discove ry (turning over of evidence to the opposition so that the defense can prepare a case), they have quick trials and secretive hearings, they will incor porate biased judges, they have no juries, and possibly no appea ls. The bottom-line is simply: All of this debate has to do with protecting civil rights. I want to show you why this debate is moot in practicality, and by not having the following view as a part of any discussion, is misrepresenting the real problem to the public. In comparing these courts, we need to actually look at what civil rights the people are REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 516"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"actually receiving and then compare the courts . Let's not look at the situation in a test tube any longer. Here is what I am telling you is happe ning, not only as a schola r, but as a practicing attorney who gets to see the inside of a courtroom all day-every day. My claim which I can support with volumes of hard evidence includ ing testimony, transcripts , etc., is that some of our courts are already uncons titutionally acting as military courts against the people today . Many individual plaintiffs that go into our courts (depending on which courts) get to learn this shocking lesson all by them selve s, and then after the dusts settles, they get to try to pick up the pieces of their lives once they have truly experienced the tyranny of our own corrupted system which ignores our Cons titutional Rights daily. Because the reality is kept so secret from the public at large, and because many news agenc ies will not inform the public of the horrendous condition of these courts, the public is totally unaware of the injustices happening daily; only to find out if they are unfortunate enough to get caught up in the \"vortex\" of the judicial system -- with only fleeting hope of ever getting free of it with their shirts still on their backs ! Our civil rights are not protected now, even though the Const itution guarantees them, since some of the courts ignore the Constitution regularly when it actually secretl y, quietly, and quickly dism isses our cases, without so much as a hearing, without so much as a right to an appeal (rubber stamped \"denied \" without so much as an opinion as to why we lost, which then goes into an \"unpublished opinion\" file at the discr etion of the court so that nobody else (not even attorneys) know that the case existed, and it does not affect precedent s). These courts openl y and willingly allow one side (usually the defense in civil cases, and the prosecutors in criminal cases) to commit repeated perjury and allow it to thwart discovery requests (the lawful and mandatory turning over of documents which allows the opposition to know what the issues are). If these exam ples do not fit into the concerns of the Cons titutional \"scholars \" over the Military Courts what does? I ask you, why are so many specia l interest corporations funding judicia l and governmental officials to go on trips and to hear \"pro-corporati on\" seminars ? Doesn't this sound a little bit like a biased court would result from such junkets? This is happening regularly within our state and federal systems, without hardly a word from the media. Why else would the Congress be so concerned over appointments and the personal stands each judge has on issues? It is because Congress knows that an unbiased and impartial judiciary is nonexistent when it comes to specia l interest groups and any poor plaintif f and/or that attorney that tries to cha llenge it will pay dearly for daring to do so. Would you be surprised to hear from two people who actually had their judge's fall asleep during the trail, only to take the de cision away from the jury once awakened, and then dism iss it without the benefit of due process? Of course, big busin ess won again. The special trips and semina rs for judges pay off. One case was dismis sed after the judge used 19 facts that were not even admitted into evidence (that is like not allowing for discove ry as military courts are professing to do ). This is forbidden by law. Appeal was denied, and the opinion was unpublished like about 90% of the opinions in the 4th circuit so that nobody is the wiser. What about a judge that dism isses a defamation claim against an insurance company, saying that the plaintiff should not have filed a suit, because money is more important than reputation anyway, and that she should read some REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 517"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"books because everyone know s that. Doesn't it make you wonder which big-busin ess supported that decision? What about a judge who refuses to acknowledge \"blacklisting\" as a law, even though Congress/General Assembly made such a law to be enforced by the courts? Would you be surprised that in both of these cases described above, the plaintiff got sanctioned (assesse d fines and fees against them) for daring to bring these cases into court? I ask you then, in reality how is our present court system any different from the Military Courts to which so many are taking offense? Besides me, I know of only one other attorney who is trying to bring these abuses to light. She stepped down from a government position because of all of the corruption for which she did not want a part. She filed suit and clearly showed the corruption of a particular city's police, attorne ys, and judges. Not only was she sanctioned for daring to bring such a case forward, but those she expo sed placed a gag order on her, every single pleading ever filed is sealed so that nobody can find out about this corruption, and she is regularly arrested by that city's police as punishment. To top it off, although the case was never heard on the mer its, she was sanctioned about $18,000 and she has approximately another $200,000 waiting for her in our wonderful 4th Circuit Court. That is what happens to those few of us who dare to expo se what is really going on in this corrupt system. Sounds like something we would describe might happen under the reign of the Taliban doe sn't it? Certainly this is worse than any military court which will at least have some scrutiny placed on it. How would you feel if you were judged by a judge who liked to use the word \"nigger\" and derogatorily acts in a stereotypically \"poor black from the 1800's manner\" after he finds an African American guilty ? How about a judge who proudly claims that he does not find for employees in employment law cases (how 's that for unbiased judges). Why then is the issue Military Courts v. Civil/Criminal Courts when, practically, there is no differe nce? If you look at the statist ics, and open your forum to citizens who have been a part of actual court proceedings in certain jurisdictions including federal jurisdictions, you will clearly find that some courts are treating their suppos edly open courts as if they were Military Cour ts -­ and getting away with it daily. I will show you just one Federal Circuit who routinely viola tes our Cons titutional Rights daily with the blessing of the Court of Appeal s, but only one for brevity sake. Please note that this is not my only example. Take the Federal 4th Circuit located in Virgini a. There exists a Title VII statute that allows for a plaint iff in a \"protected class\" to file suit against employers who treat them wrongly because of their race, color, sex, national origin, or religion. Just in the year 2000 which is the last full year of statistics, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals heard 11 cases on appeal from district courts (not counting unpublished opinions and all the other district court cases which were quietly and secretl y dismissed). Of these cases all 11 were decided in favor of the defendant (big-bu siness) at the district court level . One of these was even heard by a jury (Con ner v. Sc hrade r-Bridgeport International, Inc., 227 F.3d 179 (4th Cir. 2000)) and the jury found for the plaintiff. Let me explain . Getting to a jury in the 4th Circuit is almo st unheard of in employment law cases although it is granted as a right under Title VII. In spite of the jury finding in favor of the plaintif f, the district court judge then proceeded to take the case from the jury and find for the defendant anyway (How 's that for due process?) Furthermore, of these 11 cases, all had been REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 518"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"decided for the defen se on summary judgment Uudge refuses to provide for a trial for the plaintiff), or judgment as a matter of law Uudge decides that even though the jury may have been present, they do not get to decide the case at all). Because I have taken part in cases like these a nd r eg u la r l y have to tell my client \"don't even bother going to this court for justice,\" I will absolutely guarantee you that much of the evidence was obvisca ted by the defense and the judge was absolutely no assist ant of justice in making the defen se turn over the evidence it was hiding. In fact, if the plaintif f gets hislher hands on a document of the employers which could prove the truth; one that the defense is falsely claiming they don't have, the judge then finds that it is \"stolen,\" and makes the plaintif f return the document to the defen se. The defense then can continually claim that the document does not exist even though the court knows that is not true and that perjury has been committ ed. Additionally, these judges are repeatedly \"wined and dined \" by big-busin ess with big corporate interests (Please see .. www. Tripsfor judges.com .. for my information here). According to Tripsfor judges.com, judges have been sent on vacations even as far as Israel by big-busin ess. Also the Foundation for Research on Econom ics and the Environment (FREE) and the Liberty Fund pays for these vacations for judges which are, coincidentally, very close to their headquarters for \"seminars .\" One judge even received a trip for he AND HIS SON, by busin essman Mr. Hank Jones. How 's that for unbiased Judges? FREE is a nonprof it organization that advocates reliance on the free market and private property rights, instead of environmental laws to protect the environment. Obvio usly, any tenant, empl oyee, environmental ist, and anyone else challenging the acts of one of these interests is in for a surpri sing, and rude, awaken ing. Judges who attend their lectures are indoctrinated into the emphasis of property rights and market processes according to big-busin ess interests. FREE gets its funding directly from corporati ons, founda tions of large companie s, and from prominent conse rvative foundat ions. FREE receives 1/3 of its budget directly from corporations such as Shell Oil Company Foundation, Burlington Resources Foundation, General Electric Fund, Temple-Inland Foundation, and Kock Oil (Lambe Foundat ion). Foundations which support FREE are Sarah Scaife, Carthage Foundat ions, and the John M. Olin Foundation. These foundations are among the largest supporters of nonprofits that challenge environmental regulations in federal court. How 's that for unbiased Judges and the possibility of a citizen of the United States receiving a full and fair hearing under the law? Liberty Fund was founded by busin essman Pierre F. Goodr ich. The Liberty fund makes grants directly to conservative and libertarian organizations such as the Cato Institute, the Center for the Study of Federa lism, and the Political Economy Research Center.

A story the origin of which is forgotten, that ostensibly relates historical events which are usually of such character as to serve to explain some practice, belief, institution ... \". Some people believe that they drive a motor vehicle, some actually do, and most do not. A few vehicles powered by motors are beginning to appear on our modem highwa ys. There were a few vehicles powered by motors as our society emerged from the horse and buggy mode . Most were powered by, and still are, engin es. The Vehicle Code of the several states is a legitimate exercise of the police power reserved to the states. The police power is exercised by Executive Branch Organizat ions, also known as \"agenci es\", and is intended to secure the health, safety and welfare of the public . Police power must be exercised within Const itutional const raints inherent in the enabling clause, adopted upon entry by each state to the Union. Under such const raint, police power cannot impinge upon the peop le's Const itutionally secured rights. Commercial interests, by nature, being driven by profit motive, have always been the object of executive branch organization or state agency (hereinafter \"agency\") polici ng. While many busines smen are upright, the temptation is always at their elbow to cut a comer. Agen cies, with a few notable excepti ons, establi sh and enforce rules, consist ent with their legisla tive mandate, to protect the public from un scrup ulous business practi ces, in part by requiring examination and licensing of var ious tradesmen and professionals. The legislative language of the state of Oregon defining \"license\" is: \" ... permi ssion required by law to engage in any commercial activity, trade, occupation or professio n.\" I am a former father who, out of concern for his son and children generally, devoted fourteen conse cutive years to lobbying for family law reform. One of the bills I opposed would, and now does, provide that a dead beat parent (at least we got the dead beat (ad language gender neutralized) could lose his or her driver 's license. At the next legisla tive session it was brought to the legisla ture's attention that ex-spouses of doctors , lawyers , architects and other professionals were entitled to equal protection against non-payment of child support. My dawning of consciousn ess, a driver license is another professional licen se! A license or privilege is granted by the state to a qualified (maybe) person to protect the public from unscr upulous or incompetent business operators . What the state gives the state may take away. I had heard rumors that the Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division (hereinafter DMV) might be running a scam. My first \"officia l\" confirmation of this came from a trip to Multnomah County's Central Library. While strolling the stacks , looking for the point at which to begin my research, I was literally touched near my knee by the General Laws of Oregon, 1921. The REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 521"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"\"General Laws\" is the term referring to legisla tive enactments made by Oregon 's Legislature during the first half of the nineteenth century, now the same thing is referred to as \"Oregon Law\". These journal s of legislative activity are distinct from the \"Revised Statue s\", which are regularly edited into contextually appropriate volumes by, the: staff of Le gislative Counsel (the legislature 's attorney) . If you want to look at General Laws at the Multnomah Coun ty Library now, you must fill out a request slip asking that they be brought up from the basement. In a \"specia l session\" of 1921, Oregon 's Legisl ature exercised its police power in re-enacting the Vehicle Code. To meet an emergency created by the use of heavy haulers causing damage to the public 's highways , it was declared that all vehicles transporting persons and property for compensation would be charged fees to offset the cost of maintenance and, along with their operators, be subject to regulat ion. Later, I wrote to the attorney for the Oregon Legislature, Mr. Greg Chaimov , and asked him where the most recent legisla tive definition of motor vehicle was to be found. His uneq uivoca l answer was that it is to be found in the General Laws of Oregon & 1925, Chapter 380. The purpose paragraph, which appears above the text and provides context in a summary of the act, is language very similar to the 1921 version. Legisla tive purpose is expressed as : We, the legislature intend to \"impose a charge upon motor vehicles for the use of such highways in the transportation of persons and property for compen sation ... \" In the definition section : Motor Vehic le. \"motor vehicle \" means any self-propelled vehicle moving over the public highways of this state and not moving, operated, or driven upon fixed rails or track. It includes motor trucks and motor buses and trailers, semi trailers and other trailers used in connection therewith. Note that \"includ es\" is an exclu sive term. That which is not within the list of \"included\" is not there, unless the phrase \"but not limited to\" follows. In the 1925 re-enactment \"compen sation\" was defined in minute detail to include, but not limited to, barter, futures, and secur ities. Apparently some truckers were hauling on the promi se of a percentage of the value of the load they were transport ing. Additionally classes of regulated \"motor vehicles \" were established based on weight and tire width . In 1927, responding to police zeal in enforcement of the registration provisions of the Vehicle Code upon businessme n's automo biles, the legislature inserted a paragraph descr ibing a list of busin ess uses that are exempt from regulat ion. In no uncertain terms, our elected representatives clarified that regulated \"motor vehicle s\" are those actually transporting persons and property for compensation. Motor vehicles are not to be confused with those used to merely travel to sales meet ings or going somewhere incident to busin ess. (Depending on what the subsequent legislative record show s, this could be the basis for penalties aga inst peace officers for assailing automobiles used by the public. Resea rch yet to be done .) To clarify that everything running under its own power was not a \"motor vehicle\" the 1927 legislature also added the definition of \"vehicle\" as \"every mechanical device moving by any powe r\", except for human pqwe red, and those operated over stationary rails. Highway was REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 522"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"defined on the same page as: all the places in the state, including the streets and roads of municipalities and count ies, \"u sed or intended for use by the general public for vehic les\". Right of use of the highway by the public was understood in the early part of the twentieth century, perhaps becau se people were close r to their common law heritage. In 1983 the legisla tive language defining highway was amended to include the word \"open\" and the phrase \" ... or vehicular traffic as a matter of right \" . Thus, the \" general publi c\" uses every \"mechanical device\" on the highway, \"as a matter of right\" . This right of use is clearly contra-di stinguished by current statutory language which declares that subject to the provisions of the Vehi cle Code, the state grants a privilege to \"motorists\" to \"operate motor vehic les\" on the highway. In 1929, realizing that there was more road work the state would like to do than could be covered by the licensing and registration fees, the legislature impo sed a tax on fuel used by regulated \"motor vehicles\" of three cents per gallon. This is the same \"motor vehicle fuel tax\" that today is twenty-four cents per gallon in Oregon. The motor vehicle fuel tax, neither state nor federal, has ever applied to every mechanical device powered by whatever means, used on the highway by the pUblic. When the state tax was three cents per gallon, most people knew it didn't. Now that state and federal tax is almost 50¢ a gallon, most people pay it without a thought. How many of your regularly paid taxes amount to anything like your \"motor vehicle fuel tax\"? The statutory language through the 1981 Oregon Revised Statutes listed two types of licenses, \"operato r's\" and \"chauffe ur's\". While there may be some confusion about the word \"operator\" (even among citizen legislators), most literate individual s understand that busin esses \"operate \". For those of us who don't understand the business connotation of \"operate\", there is the \"Operator Manual \", available at a DMV Branch near you. The manual clearly states that \"Oregon currently issues three classes of driver license; Class A commercia l..., Class B commercial .... , and Class C commercial .. .. \". The manual is intended as a study guide for those who will be employed to \"operate\" a vehicle for compensa tion. When one looks to an era appropriate edition of Black's Law Dictionary, the term Operate ... when used with relation to automo biles, signifies a personal act in working the mechani sm of the automob ile; That is, the driver operates the automobile for the owner, but the owner does not operate the automobile unless he drives it himself. Similarly, Driver. One employed in conducting or operating a ... motor car, though not a street railroad car.\" And, Chauff eur. An operator who directly or indirectly receives compens ation for operating motor vehicle. Operators who drive jitneys in cities and towns for hire. Person employed or paid to operate, drive and attend car. By the term \"era appropriate edition\", it is meant an edition which was published, or in use during the early years of the Vehicle Code when the language was being developed and \"settled\" by the courts. The edition cited throughout this article is the fourth, with court citations giving rise to the definitions virtually identical to those cited in the third. The most recent statutory definition of Chauffeur, which was deleted by Oregon Laws 1983, Chapter 338 is consi stent with Black's definition of driver and chauf feur: REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 523"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"\"Chau ffe ur means every person who is employed by another for the principal purpose of driving a motor vehicle carrying persons or property for compensation .. \" An exception under this definition makes it perfectly clear that the dividing line between drivers who are licensed and other highway users is the issue of compensation: students operating vehicles, commonly known and used as private passenger vehicles, which are not operated for compensation ... It is interesting to note that \"passe ngers \" are technically those who pay a fare to be transported from one place to another (see Black's), but the legisla ture (or perhaps legislative counse l committee) qualified the use of \"passenger\" by the modifying phrases, \"commonly known and used as private ... \" and \"not operated for compensation .. \" This mixing of terms by the legislature should const antly be born in mind by readers of the law or statutes, because many of our elected representatives have had just as faulty an education as most of the rest of us. In 1931 the Oregon Legislature changed the wording in the definition of the term \"vehicle \" to: \"every device in upon or by which persons and property is or may be transported upon the highway \". By the time the Legislature began working on the major revision of the Code that is pretty much what we see today, the original definition of \"vehicle\" had been reinserted, but with the addition of a third exception, the devices that traveled under overhead trolley wires. The fact that the definition has changed back and forth means that the charges were not substantive, and probably were done by legisla tive counsel as an editing function. The significance of the definition of \"vehicle \", either original or current, cannot be overestimated. Even though \"vehicle\" is not now explici tly defined, there remains enoug h history in its grammar, if you know how to conjugate Engli sh and have Black's Law Dictionary definition of: Transportation. The removal of goods or persons from one place to another, by a carrier (carrier is defined as an entity engaged in the activity for hire). Thus, every device which \"is\", connotes those currently engaged in commer ce, and \"may be\" means that by form, the vehicle could be, but is not now so engaged . A casua l reader without knowledge of the legisla tive language above might inquire why the legislature, or legisla tive counsel would currently define the regulated object, motor vehicle, the way it does: ORS 801.360 Motor vehic le. A vehicle which is self-propelled or desig ned for self-prop ulsion. Unless it was intended to apply to every body's car, nowhere in the Vehicle Code does it say that \"everybody' s car is a motor vehicle \", or that \"the public operat es\". Most important however, is REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 524"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"the context in which the definition occurs . The legislative language of 1925 providing adequate context has been deleted, ostensibly for the sake of simplification, but what remains is nearly ident ical. YOU can't tell what's in a book from the cover, but it is the first indication of context. When one approaches a bookshelf loaded with the nineteen volumes of Oregon Revised Statut es, it can be seen that Volume 15, is titled Business Regulati ons (Part 2), Volume 14 being Part 1. The Vehicle Code is \"Title 59\" of Business Regulat ions (Part 2). Here's a bone for conspirac y buffs: The subject matter indicated on Volume IS's cover does have Busin ess Regulations (Part 2) in its lead line, but each of the \"sub heading s\" are in the same font, laid out in lines, and separated by semi-colons as though listing things of similar importance. In contrast, Volume 14 has Business Regulati ons (Part 1) as the lead line, but what follows is in much smaller font, in a column centered under it (so the list is literally \"sub headin gs\"). When the reader flips past the fly leaf to the table of contents, the format for both volumes is identical, and of course Business Regulati ons is not one of the listed \"Titles\". I had a talk with Legislative Counsel Chaimov about the inconsi stency in formatting and apparent misuse of the semi-colons in 2001. Because he had no legitimate explanation for the way the covers look, I wrongly assumed that corrections would be made in the 2002-2003 version of the Oregon Revised Statut es. Unfortu nately for peace officers and personnel of the DMV, they are regularly provided an excerpt of Business Regulations (Fart 2) called the Vehicle Code Handbook, so they never get to see the primary contextual statement. I person ally conducted a poll of peace officers, asking whether they enforce business regulat ions. None knew that they did, and most were adamant that they didn't. In reading statute s, it is always a good idea to read the policy statement that precedes the subst ance, and the definition section. When people do not comprehend context, they sometimes believe that the law is a complicated thing becau se of all the numbers thrown in with the text. This is not a complica ting factor at all, but rather a means of referencing, so that context ualizing sentenc es and paragraphs do not have to constantly be restated, but are neverthel ess explicitly referred to. One particularly well contextualized passa ge that is not interspersed with refere nce numbe rs, describes the offense of \"operating motor vehicles without grant of driving privilege \" (ORS 807.010 ). In this passage the grammatical technique of contradistinguishing is employed : \" ... every person who operates a motor vehicle on the highway or premi ses open to the public ... \" must have a licen se. Two kinds of people are explicitly mentioned in this sente nce, persons who operate motor vehicles and the Public for whom the highway is open . The legisla ture (or legislative counsel) did a great job convey ing the intent of the Vehicle Code with this particular section of law, as the phrase \"open to the public \", excerpted from the language defining \"highway\" used by the public by right, makes it clear that the public is not the subject of regulat ion. The language in the financial respons ibility paragraph (ORS 806.0 10) just happens to use exactly the same phrasing as who must be licensed. In 1983, the legislature extensively reorganized the Vehicle Code with this stated intent, \"It is not the intent of the Oregon Legislative Assembly to change the law by enacting this revision if the REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 525"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"Oregon Vehicle Code ... \". They go on to say: \"The intent of the assembly is to make the law relating to vehicles easier to use, amend, and understandably simplifying the language ... \" They emphasize their intent not to change the law by stating : \"Every agency of this state, every court, and every person shall consider the revision to be a continuation of the vehicle laws in effect on the effective date of the revision \". Need less to say, the statement of legi sla tive intent does not routinely make it into the Oregon Revi sed Statute s. So by co nfining on e's re sea rch to the statute s, esse ntial context cannot be taken into account. For example \"d r ive \" is one of the most crucial words of the Vehicle Code. If one does not refer to Oregon La ws, chapter 338, to read the leg isla tive intent, and then find the 19 81 definition of chauf feur who is employed to \" driv e\", how would one kno w? It should be noted that there is one ref er ence left in today 's Vehicle Code to chauf feur. The paragraph at ORS 802.0 70 provides that the DMV will funnel money into schools to teach students about chauf feur's and operator' s licenses. Call your local high school 's driver training program to find out just what students are learning and see what happe ns. If one does not know what a \"driver\" is, then comprehending what a \"Driver license\" allows is impo ssible. Throughout the Vehicle Code one sees the term \"license \", which is to be used interchangeably with \"Drivers license \" (ORS 801. 245). Usua lly the crucial words of any given code are defined at the beginn ing. In the Vehicle Code, one will not find the definition of \"License\". Historical note: In 1985 the Attorney General 's Office supported a bill to change the definition of license. The reason given was that they had been involved in several lawsuits over what a driver license is and hoped that by obscuring the meaning they would not have to keep on arguing this issue (SB 118 of 1985). Though most of the Vehicle Code bears a footnote indicating revision in 1983, the Legislative Session of 1985 capped the four year project. This business had been going on during the interim session as well as during regular session. In April of 1985, a lobbyi st from the DMV visited the joint sub-c ommittee on Transportation to lobby for a law allowing the DMV to adopt rules so that they could title and register vehicles which are exempt from the titling requirements, Senate Bill 124-A. The lobby ist explained that under the pr evious language it was obscure to which vehicles needed to be titled, but the new language was now so clear that steps had to be taken . She brought along an exhibit supporting SB 124-A, labeled Exhibit B, and signed in behalf of her boss, the director of the DMV . Frank admi ssion was made in this document acknowledging that the DMV had been titling and regist ering vehicles without authorizati on. While the document says they were \"historically\" doing what they were not authorized to do, during sub-c ommittee sessions it was generally acknowledged that it had been going on longer than anyone in the room could remember. In the officia l minutes of the subcommittee, the word \"illegal \" is used to describe the practice which the lobbyi st n-w wanted authorization to do. Just to confirm what the document said, the chair woman , who was later to become one of Oregon 's more notable DMV directors, asked if there would be any changes as a result of this bill's passage. The lobbyist reiterated that there would be no change, not even in the fees that they were currently charging without authori zation. Most significa nt was the lobbyi st's testimony that no change to the titling requirements was propo sed, because \"titling depends on use\". While the lobbyist repeated this several times during REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 526"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"her appearances before the sub-com mittee, she never actually said what the \"use\" was. There was some discussion about making certain \"types\" of vehicles subject to registrati on. There was even a suggestion that it might be easier if every vehicle with a motor in it was therefore required to be titled, but the lobbyi st told her listeners that every vehicle which could be titled and registered was potentially exempt becau se it is use that determin es. The point I will make here about SB 124-A, and there are others, is that it resulted in the current ORS 803.035, \"O ptional titling rules \". This paragraph provides that \"upon request of an owner ... \", any \"otherwise exempt vehicle\" may be titled by the DMV. When DMV accepts the owne r's money and becomes title holder in fact, the vehicle becomes subject to all the provisions of the Vehicle Code. Of course the owner sets the benefit of one form of proof of right to posses sion. Exhibit B actually contends that this is a benefit owners \"sometimes want\". The bottom line is, \"If this authority were not continued, there would be some loss of revenue \". Slight misstatement, the purpose of the bill was to obtain authority never posses sed by the DMV , but the previous sentence says, \"if this authority were not continue d\". Options are always nice to have. Did anyone at the DMV ever tell you about their optional titling program? Of course, anything that can be opted into has to have an opt out protocol. The very next paragraph, ORS 803.040, which was part of SB 124-A, says that, an optionally titled vehicle will so remain \"until the owner uses a method recognized or established by the department to establish the vehicle is no longe r subject to the provisions of the vehicle code\". That sounds pretty inviting. Who knows what the method is? Who 's going to say, even if he or she knows? I don't have all the answers, but I am involved in processes which are leading to more informa tion. I have used a method which must be recognized by an agency with repeated results, twice. That resulted was that the agenc y did not contest the method, and declined to engage in agency review of the implication of their defau lt. After I obtained the minutes of these meetings, I had to have the audio tapes. The archivist who filled my order told me that I was the first to ever purchase these recor ds. Because I have met many people who know something about the DMV scam and articulate their aggravation, if not hostility, I found it amazing that I am the first to pull these recor ds. The Senator who chaired the Senate Transportation committee and the joint subcommittee and who became the director of DMV, found it so amazing that I had photo copies of her eighteen year old meet ings that she had to break off abruptly from the pleas antries of sharing a latte' with me. It is hoped that by includ ing many source citations readers will be encouraged to research for themsel ves. There may be readers who would like to exchange information or reimburse me for research and material s. I have hard copy of all documents referred to, plus Public Record Law Demands which were made to establish the non-exist ence of a record . Much of the records are formatted to compact disk. There are audio tapes of four 1985 joint subcommittee on Transportation meetings, two House Transportation Committee meetings, and one Senate Transportation Committee meeting on SB 124-A. These tapes have been edited down to a presentation that can be made in one hour. The edited tape also has ref erence to bills to change definition of driver license and classes of licenses.

These and more are all exam ples of the Affidavit. The affidavit, when properly used, especially when leveraged by your standing as a secured party, is the most power ful instrument available in protec ting, defen ding, and asserting your soverei gnty. For this reason, it is incumbent upon you to become practiced in its use and in your ability to recognize its many form s. AFFI DAVITS BACK ALL ADHESION CONTR ACTS If you are unable to recognize when affidavits are being solicited, you may be the unwitting dupe of another parties attempt to create a binding contract. By the signature of your own hand, or before you became of legal age, the signature of your parent or other authority such as a physician, have been signing you into bondage since you were born. Certificate of Live Birth, application for a driver's license, and IRS form 1040, a voter's registration, and every single document that the system desires others to be bound or obligated by, is, or requir es, an affida vit. When signed, they represent an oath, or Commercial Affidavit, executed under penalty of perjury, \"true, Correct, and complete \". Affidavits may also occur in a court setting where testimony (oral) is stated in judicia l terms by being sworn to be \"the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God. \" In chapter 5 we will explore some strategies that you can use to avoid this solicitation to contract. MAXIMS OF THE AFFIDAVIT Before we get into the structure, form, and requirements of the formal affidavit, with exam ples, let's develop a deeper comprehension and understanding of the purpose, and important maxims that govern their use. 1. First and foremost, in commerce, truth is sovereign-and the Sovereign tells only the truth. Your word is your bond. If truth were not sovereign in commer ce, i.e., all human action and inter-relati ons, there would be no basis for anything. No basis for law and order, no accountability, there would be no standard s, no capacity to resolve anyth ing. It would mean \"anything goes\", \"each man for himsel f', and \"nothing matte rs\". That's worse than the law of the jungle. \"To lie is to go again st the mind\". Oriental proverb : \"Of all that is good, subli mity is supreme .\" REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 530"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"2. In commerce for any matter to be resolved, it must first be expressed. No one is a mind reader. You have to put your position out there-you have to state what the issue is in order to have something to talk about and resolve. A person must put himself on the line and assume a position, take a stand, as regards the matter at hand. One who is not damaged, put at risk, or willing to swea r an oath on his commercial liability for the truth of his statements and legitimac y of his actions, has no basis to assert claims or charge s and forfeits all credibility and right. Legal Maxim : \"He who fails to assert his rights has none.\" 3. He who leaves the battlefield first, looses by default. This mean s that an affidavit which is un-rebutted point for point stands as \"truth in commer ce\" because it hasn't been rebutted and has left the battlef ield. Governments allegedly exist to resolve disput es, conflicts and truth. Governments allegedly exist to be substitutes for the dueling field and the battlefield for disputes . Conflicts of affidavits of truth are resolved peacea bly, reasona bly, instead of by violence . So people can take their disputes into court and have them all opened up and resolved, instead of going out and marching ten paces and turning to kill or in jure. Legal Maxim: \"He who does not repel a wrong when he can, occasions it\" . 4. An un-rebutted affi davit stands as truth in commerce. Claims made in your affidavit if not rebutted, emerge as the truth of the matter. Legal Maxim: \"He who does deny, admits.\" 5. An un-rebutted affi davit becomes the judgment in commerce. There is nothing left to resolve. Any proceeding in a court, tribunal, or arbitration forum consists of a contest, or duel, of commercial affidavits wherein the points remaining un-rebutted in the end stand as truth and matters to which the judgment of the law is applied. 6. A lien or claim can be satisfied only though a point by point rebuttal of an affidavit, resolution by jury, or payment . No court or judge can overturn or disregard or abrogate somebody's affidavit. The only one who has any capacity or right or responsi bility or knowledge to rebut your affidavit, is the one who is advers ely affected by it. Just as no one can know what your truth is, it's the affected parties responsi bility and obligation to issue their own affidavit and to speak on their own behalf. C OMMERCIAL LAW IS PRE-JUDICIAL Another important conce pt to understand as a sovereign, if you should go before the court, becau se it establishes the basis for keeping your matter in the private, is that Commercial Law is REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 531"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"non-judicial, in fact, pre-j udicia l (not prejudice). It is the only foundation by which government or any court system can possibly exist or function.

Now to get an idea of all the fun that you've been missi ng out on by not knowing about affida vits, not even knowing that you could ASK FOR ONE, here is an example of how to leverage your knowledge of Commercial Law and the power of the affidavit. In commerce there are two phases; assessm ent, and collect ion. The Assessm ent aspect, is about determining who owes who, what, why, how much, and for what reason. The collection aspect is based in International commerce that has existed for more than 6000 years . It is based on Jewish Law and the Jewish grace period, which is in units of three ; three days, three weeks , and three mont hs. This is why you get 90day letters from the IRS. Remember, commercial processes are non-judicial . They are summary processes (short, concise­ without a jury). THE POWER OF THE AFFID AVIT Now , the IRS creates the most activity of Commercial Collection in the entire world. The collection process is relatively valid, although the IRS is not registered to do business in any state. Did you understand what you just read? The IRS is NOT REGIS TERED TO DO BUSI NESS OR PERFORM COM MERCI AL MATTERS IN ANY STATE. So how do they get all the money they get? ANS WER : because you give it to them without requesting a proof of claim from them or even if they were \"licens ed\" to give you offers based on \"arbitrary\" estimations. However, this is where things get very interesting. Remember the assessm ent phase? THERE IS NO VALID ASSESS MENT . The IRS has, and never can, and never will, and never could, EVER issue a valid asses sment lien or levy. It's not possible. First of all, in order for them to do that there would have to be paperwork, a True Bill in Commer ce. There would have to be sworn Affi davits by someone stating that this is a true, correct affidavit, complete and not meant to deceive, which, in commerce , essentially \"the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth\" when . Now, nobody in the IRS is going to take commercial liability for exposing them selves to a lie and have a chance for people to come back at them with a True Bill in Commerce, a true accounting. This means they would have to set forth the contract, the foundational instrument with your signature on it, in which you are in defau lt, and a list of all the wond erful goods and services for which you owe them money; or a statement of all the damages that you have caused them, for which you owe them. To my knowledg e, no one has ever received goods or service from the IRS for which they owe money. I personally don't know of anyone that has damaged anybody in the IRS that gives them the right to come after us and say that \"you owe us money because you damaged me\". The asses sment phase in the IRS is non-exist ent, it is a complete fraud.

Eliot wrote a wonder ful little phrase in one of his poems : \"We shall not cease from exploration, and the result of all our exploring will be to arrive at the place at which we began and know it for the first time.\" This is the beginn ing, and this is the end . This closes the circle on the process. One reason why the super-rich bankers and the super-rich people in the world have been able to literally steal the world and subjugate, plunder, and bankrupt it all the while making chattel property out of most of us is because they know and use the rules of Commercial Law and we don't. Because we don't know the rules, nor use them, we don't know what the game is. We don't know what to do. We don't know how to invoke our rights, remedies and recours es. We get lost in doing everything under the sun except the one and only thing that is the solution . No one is going to explain to you what and how all this is happening to you. That is never going to happen. These powe rs-that-be have not divulged the rules of the game . They can and do get away with complete fraud and steal everything because no one knows what to do about it. SOLUTION What CAN you do about it? YOU CAN ISSUE A COM MERCIAL AFFIDAVIT. You don't have to title it that, but that's what it is. You can assert in your affidavit, \"I have never been presented with any sworn affidavits that would provide validity to your assessm ent. It is my best and considered judgment that no such paperwork or affidavit exists .\" At the end of this document, you put demands on them . They must be implicit and then you state, \"Should you consider my position in error ... \" You know what they have to do now, don't you? They must come back with an affidavit which rebuts your affidavit point for point, which means they have to provide the paper work with the real assessm ent, the true bill in commer ce, the real sworn affidavits that would make their assessm ent or claims against you valid. No agent or attorney of a fictitious entity can sign an affidavit for the corpora tion. How can they swear as fact that the corporation has done or not done ANYTHING? They do not have the standi ng. They cannot and never will provide you with this. This means your affidavit stands as truth in commer ce. Note : An even more streamlined and sophi sticated approach in dealing with the IRS is to send them a package with a letter and an IRS power of attorney requesting a determination of your tax status. This is more powerful because you have completely REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 533"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"drawn them into your power.

Which do you think they will choo se? DEFINIT IONS In its formal expression, an affi davit is a statement of facts that chronicle the events of a particular commercial or legal matter, reduced to writing, and sworn to or affirmed before a person legally authorized to administer an oath or affirmation such as a notary. The person making the statement is technically known as the affi ant or deponent. The affidavit usually contains statements that you can attest to, based on your experience, and may also co ntain statements based on the observati ons of others if you indicate this by adding that the information is based on your 'information and belief' . You may sometimes see affidavits titled and referred to as \"Affidavits of Truth\" or \"Affidavits of Facts\". This is informal and redundant-all affidavits are about truth and facts. Here are some formal definiti ons and types of affi davits and the definition for declaration since this is used in the definition for affidavit from Blacks Law 6 t h Edition : 1. Affidavit. A written or printed declaration or statement of facts, made voluntar ily, and confirmed by the oath or affirm ation of the party making it, taken before a person having authority to administer such oath or affirmation. 2. Affidavit of defense. An affidavit stating that the defendant has a good defense to the plaintif f's action on the merits; e.g. affidavit filed with motion for summary judgment. 3. Affidavit of inquiry. By court rule in certain states, substituted service of process may be had on absent defendants if it appears by affidavit of plaint iff s attorney, or other person having knowledge of the facts, that defendant cannot after diligent inquiry, be served within the state 4. Affidavit of merits. One setting forth that the defendant has a meritorious defense (substantial and not technical) and stating the facts constituting the same . See affidavit of defen se. 5. Affidavit of notice. A sworn statement that affiant has given proper notice of hearing to other parties to action. 6. Affidavit of service. An affidavit intended to certify the service of a writ, notice, summ ons, or other document or proce ss. In federal courts, if service is made by a person other than a United States Marshall or his deputy, he shall make affidavit thereof.

An affidavit required in many cases before the defendant in a civil action may be arrested. Such as affidavit must contain a statement, clearly and certainly expressed, by someone acquainted with the fact, of an indebte dness from the defendant to the plaint iff, and must show a distinct ca use of action. 8. Declaration. A common-law plead ing, the first of the pleadin gs on the part of the plaintif f in an action at law, being a formal and methodical specification of the facts and circumsta nces constituting his cause or action . It commonly comprises several sections or divisio ns, called \"counts \", and its formal parts follow each other in this general order: Title, venue, commencement, and cause of action, coun ts, and conclu sion. The declaration at common law, answers to the \"libel\" in ecclesiastica l and admiralty law, the \"bill\" in equity, the \"petition\" in civil law, the \"com plaint\" in code and rule pleadin g, and the \"count\" in real action s. The term \"compla int' is used in the federal courts and in all states that have adopted Rules of Civil Procedure. ELEMENTS & FORMATS There are two forms of the affidavit, court brief format and letter. If your matter is private, use the letter form at. The court brief format requires a case number and must be in the standard legal form. If you write an affidavit in a private matter, which then ends up in the courts, you could rewrite it in legal form at; however, it is not necessa ry since you can submit the affidavit in letter form as an exhibit. On the facing page is an example of the court brief form of a generic affidavit. You can use it as a template for creating your own. The required elements in order are the Title, Venue, notic e, introd uction , statements of fact, date and signa ture block, and the notary block for notary information and seal.

GE NER ALL Y AC CEP TED ACC OUNTING PRINCI PLES 3. Ban ks are req uired to adher e to Gen erally Accepted Acco unting Princip les (GAAP) . GAAP follo ws an acc ounting conv ention tha t lies at the heart of the doub le-entr y bookk eeping sys tem called the Ma tch ing Princ iple. This principle wo rks as follows : Wh en a bank accepts bullion, coi n, currency, checks , drafts , prom isso ry notes , or any other simil ar ins tru men ts (her eina fter \"ins tru me nts\") from cust omer s and deposits or reco rds the instrume nts as assets , it mu st reco rd offset ting liabili ties tha t ma tch the assets tha t it accepted from cust omer s. The liabi lities represent the amou nts tha t the bank owes the cus tomer s, funds accepted from cust omer s. In a fractional res erv e ban king syste m like the Un ited States banking syste m, mo st of the funds adv anced to borrowe rs (assets of the bank s) are created by the banks themselv es and are not mer ely trans ferred from one set of depos itor s to ano ther set of borr owe rs . RE LE VAN CE OF SUB TLE DIS TINC TIONS ABOUT TY PE S OF MONE Y 4. From my study of his torical and eco nomic writi ngs on the sub ject, I conclude that a common misconcep tion about the nature of money unfortuna tely has been pe rpetua ted in the U.S. mone tary and banking syst ems, espe cially sin ce the 1930s . In classical econom ic theor y, once economic exchange has mo ved bey ond the barte r stage , ther e are two types of money: money of exchange and money of account. . For near ly 300 years in both Eur ope and the Uni ted Sta tes, conf usion about the distinc tive ness of these two concep ts has led to persiste nt atte mp ts to treat money of acco unt as the equ ivalent of mon ey of exc hange . In rea lity, espe cially in a fractional reserve banking syst em , a compar ative ly small amount of money of exchange (e.g., gold, silver, and official currency notes) ma y support a vast ly larger quan tity of busi ness transac tions den om ina ted in mo ney of ac count. The sum of these tran sac tions is the sum of credit ext ensions in the economy. Wi th the exce ption of cus tomary sto res of value like gold and silver, the mone tary base of the economy largely consis ts of credit instru men ts . Against this background, I conclude that the Note, despite some langua ge about \"lawful money\" explained below, clearly contempla tes both disbur sement of funds and eventual repaym ent or settlement in money of account (that is, money of exchange would be welcome but is not reguired to repay or settle the Note). The fac tual bas is of this conclusion is the refe rence in the Disbu rsement Requ est and Author iza tion to repaym ent of $95 ,905.16 to Michigan Na tional Ban k from the proceeds of the No te. Tha t was an REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 543"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"exchange of the credit of Bank One (Plai ntiff) for credit apparently and previously exte nded to Defe ndan ts by Michigan National Ban k. Also, ther e is no reaso n to belie ve tha t Plai ntiff wo uld refuse a sub stit ution of the credit of ano ther bank or banker as com plete paym ent of the Defe ndants' repaym ent obli gation under the No te. This is a case about exch anges of mo ney of acco unt (credit) , not about exchan ges of mon ey of exchange (law ful mon ey or eve n legal tender ) . 5. Ironically, the No te explicitly refe rs to repaym ent in \"law ful money of the Uni ted States of Ame rica\" (see \"Pr om ise to Pay\" clause) . Trad itionall y and legally, Con gress defines the phr ase \"law ful mone y\" for the Un ited Sta tes . Law ful mo ney was the form of mone y of exchange tha t the federal governmen t (or any state) could be requir ed by stat ute to rece ive in paym ent of taxes or other deb ts. Traditionally, as defined by Congr ess , lawful money only includ ed gold, silver, and currency notes rede emable for gold or silve r on demand. In a banking law cont ext , lawful mo ney was only those forms of mon ey of exchange (the form s just men tioned , plus U.S. bonds and notes redee mable for gold) tha t cons tituted the reserv es of a national bank prior to 1913 (da te of creati on of the Federal Reser ve Ban ks) . See, Law ful Mone y, Webster' s New International Dicti onary (2d ed. 1950) . In light of these facts. I conclude that Plaintiff and Defendants exchanged reciprocal credits involving money of account and not money of exchange; no lawful money was or proba bly ever would be disbursed by either side in the covered transactions. This conclusion also is cons istent with the bookke eping entries that underlie the loan acco unt in dispu te in the present case. Mor eove r, it is puz zling why Plaintif f wo uld retain the archaic langua ge, \"law ful mo ney of the Un ited States of Amer ica ,\" in its other wise mo dern-se emin g No te. It is pos sible that this langua ge is mer ely a lega cy from the pre-1933 era. Mo dern credit agr eem ents might includ e repaym ent langua ge such as, \"The repaym ent obl igation under this agreement shall conti nue until pay ment is received in fully and finally collected fund s,\" wh ich avoids the enti re questi on of \"In wha t form of mo ney or credit is the repaym ent obl iga tion due? \" 6. Legal tender. a rela ted con cept but one that is econom ically inferior to lawful money because it allo ws paym ent in ins tru men ts that canno t be red eemed for gold or silver on demand, has been the form of mone y of excha nge com monl y used in the Uni ted States since 1933, when dom estic private gold tran sac tions we re suspended (until 1974) .. Basical ly, legal tender is wha teve r the gov ernment says that it is. The mo st com mon form of legal tender today is Feder al Reserve notes , which by law canno t be red eemed for gold since 1934 or, since 1964, for silver. See, 31 U.S.C. Sec tions 51 03, 51 18 (b) , and 51 19 (a) . No te : I question the state men t tha t fed reserve notes canno t be redeemed for silver since 1964. It was Johnson who declar ed on 15 Mar cy 1967 that after 15 Jun e 1967 that Fed Res No tes wo uld not be exchanged for silve r and the pract ice did sto p on 15 June 1967 - not 1964. I bel ieve this to be error in the text of the author's affidavit. 7. Legal tender under the Uniform Commer cial Code (U. CC .), Secti on 1-20 1 (24) (Of ficial Commen t) , is a concept tha t sometimes surfaces in cases of this natu re.. The referenced Official Co mm ent notes tha t the defini tion of money is not lim ited to legal tender under the U,C.C. Money is define d in Sec tion 1-201 (24) as \"a medium of exchange autho rized or adopted by a dome stic or for eign gove rnment and includ es a mone tar y uni t of acco unt est ablished by an intergov ernmen tal organ ization or by agr eemen t betwe en two or mor e nati ons.\" The relevant Official Commen t states that ''The test adopted is tha t of sanction of gove rnment, whet her by autho riza tion before issue or adop tion afte rwar d , which rec ogniz es the circulating medium as a part of the official currency of tha t gov ernment. The narrow view tha t mo ney is lim ited to legal tender is reject ed .\" Thus, I conclude tha t the U.C.C. tends to valida te the cla ssical theor etical view of mone y.

The typ ical form of such ext ensions of credit was drafts or bills of exchange drawn upon them selves (claims on the credit of the drawees) ins tead of disbu rseme nts of bullion , coin, or oth er forms of mon ey. In transac tions with thir d parties, these drafts and bills came to serv e mo st of the ordinary func tions of mone y. The thir d parties had to det ermin e for themsel ves wheth er such \"credit mon ey\" had value and, if so, how mu ch. The Federal Re serv e Act of 1913 was drafted with this model of the com mer cial economy in min d and provided at lea st two me chanisms (the dis count window and the open­ ma rket trad ing desk) by which cert ain types of bank ers' cred its could be exchanged for Federal Reser ve credits, which in tur n cou ld be wit hdr awn in law ful money. Credit at the Feder al Rese rve eve ntually became the princip al form of mone tary reserves of the com mer cial banking syste m, espe cially after the suspension of dom estic transac tions in gold in 1933. Thus, credit mone y is not alien to the current official mone tary syst em; it is just ra rely used as a device for the creation of Federal Reserv e credit that, in turn , in the form of either Federal Reserve notes or banks' depos its at Federal Rese rve Ban ks, functi ons as mo ney in the cu rre nt mo netary syste m. In fact , a means by which the Fede ral Reserv e expands the mo ney supply, loose ly defi ned , is to set banks' reserve requir emen ts (cu rrently, usually ten per cent of demand liabil ities) at lev els tha t wo uld enc our age bank s to exte nd new credit to borr owe rs on thei r own books that thir d partie s wo uld have to present to the same banks for redemp tion, thus lea ding to an exp ansion of bank-cr eated credit mo ney. In the modern economy, ma ny non-bank provider s of credit also exte nd book credit to the ir cus tomer s without previously set ting aside an equ ivalent amount of mone tary reserves (credit card line of credit access che cks issued by non-bank s are a good example of this type of credit), which also causes an exp ansion of the agg regate quantity of credit mon ey. The dis cussion of mon ey taken from Federal Re serve and other mo der n sou rces in paragraphs 11 et seq. is cons istent with the account of the origins of the use of bank credit as mo ney in this par agraph. ADVANCES OF BANK CREDIT AS THE EQUIVALENT OF MONEY 9. Plai ntif f appare ntly asse rts tha t the Defe nda nts sig ned a prom ise to pay, such as a note(s) or credit appl ica tion (col lective ly, the \"No te\"), in exchange for the Plai ntiff's advance of funds, credit, or some type of money to or on behalf of Def endant. Ho weve r, the bookke eping entries req uired by appl ica tion of GAAP and the Federal Reser ve's own wri tings should trigger clo se scrutiny of Plai ntiff's apparent asse rtions tha t it lent its funds, credit, or mo ney to or on behalf of Def endan ts, ther eby causing them to owe the Plai ntif f $400 ,000.

It is not an unreasonable argument to state that Plaintiff appare ntly chang ed the economic substance of the transac tion from that contempla ted in the credit applica tion form. agreement. note(s). or other similar instrument(s) that the Defendants executed. thereby changing the costs and risks to the Defendants. At most, the Plai ntiff exte nded its own credit (money of acc ount) , but the Defe nda nts wer e re quir ed to repay in money (money of exchange, and la wful money at tha t) , which creates at least the inference of inequality of obligations on the two sides of the transac tion (mone y, including lawful money, is to be exchanged for bank crediQ .

This would show tha t the bank received the cus tomer's signed promise to repay as an asset, thus mone tizing the customer's signature and creating on its books a liability in the form of a demand deposit or other demand liability of the bank. The bank then usually wo uld hold this demand deposit in a transac tion accou nt on behalf of the cus tomer. Instead of the bank lending its money or oth er assets to the cus tomer, as the cus tomer reaso nably might bel iev e from the face of the No te, the bank created funds for the cust omer 's transacti on acc ount without the cus tomer 's permissi on, authoriza tion, or kno wledge and del ivered the credit on its own books representi ng those funds to the cus tom er, me anwh ile alleg ing tha t the bank lent the cus tomer money.

COMMEN TARY AND SUMM ARY OF ARGUMEN T 14. Plai ntiff appar ently accepted the Def endants ' Note and credit appl ica tion (money of acco unt) in ex change for its own credit (also mo ney of acco unt) and depos ited that credit into an acco unt with the De fenda nts' names on the acco unt, as we ll as appar ently issu ing its own credit for $95 ,905.1 6 to Michigan Na tional Ban k for the accou nt of the Defe ndan ts . One rea sonably might argue tha t the Plai ntiff recorded the No te or credit appl ica tion as a loan (money of acco unt) from the De fendants to the Plai ntiff and that the Plai ntif f then bec ame the borrowe r of an equ ivalent amoun t of money of acco unt from the Defe ndants. 15. The Plaintiff in fact never lent any of its own pre-ex isting mone y, credit, or assets as consid eration to purch ase the Note or credit agreement from the Defendan ts. (No te: I add tha t when the bank does the for going, then in tha t eve nt, ther e is an utter failure of consi deration for the \"loan cont racf' .) When the Plai ntiff depos ited the Def endants' $400 ,000 of newly issued credit into an acco unt, the Plai ntif f created from $360, 000 to $400 ,000 of new mo ney (the nom inal princip al amoun t less up to ten per cent or $40 ,000 of reserves tha t the Feder al Re serv e wo uld req uire agai nst a demand deposit of this siz e). The Plai ntiff received $400 ,000 of cr edit or mo ney of acco unt from the Defendants as an asset . GA AP ordinarily wo uld req uire tha t the Plai ntiff reco rd a liabili ty acco unt, cr editing the Defe nda nts' deposit acc ount, sho wing that the Plai ntif f owes $400 ,000 of mo ney to the Defe ndants, just as if the Defenda nts were to deposit cash or a payr oll check into the ir acc oun t. 16. The followi ng appear s to be a dispu ted fact in this case about which I have insuf ficient informa tion on which to form a concl usi on: I infer tha t it is alleged tha t Plai ntiff refused to lend the Defe ndan ts Plai ntif f's own money or assets and rec orded a $400 ,000 loan from the Defe ndant s to the Plai ntiff, which arguably was a $400 ,000 dep osit of money of account by the De fend ants , and then when the Plai ntiff repaid the Defe nda nts by payi ng its own credit (money of accou nt) in the amoun t of $400 ,000 to thir d-party seller s of goods and services for the acc ount of Defe ndants, the Defe ndan ts we re re paid their loan to Plai ntiff, and the transac tion was comp lete. 17. I do not have suf ficient knowledge of the facts in this case to form a conclusion on the following disp uted poi nts : None of the following ma terial facts are dis clo sed in the credit appl ica tion or No te or were adve rtised by Plai ntif f to prove tha t the Defe nda nts are the true lender s and the Plai ntif f is the true borrowe r. The Plaintiff is trying to use the credit application form or the Note to persuade and deceiv e the Defenda nts into believing that the opposit e occurred and that the Defendants were the borrower and not the lender. The following poin t is und isput ed: The Defe nda nts' loan of their credit to Pla intif f, when issued and paid from their deposi t or credit account at Plai ntif f, became money in the Feder al Rese rve System (sub ject to a red uction of up to ten per cent for reserv e re quir eme nts) as the newly issued credit was paid pur suant to writ ten order s, including che cks and wir e transfers , to sel lers of goods and services for the account of Defenda nts . CONCLUSION 18. Based on the forego ing, Plai ntiff is using the Defe ndan t's No te for its own purposes , and it remains to be proven whether Plai ntif f has incu rred any financial loss or actual dama ges (I do not have sufficient information to form a conclusion on this poi nt) .

Most sign ificantly for secu red lender s, Article 9 will now apply to (i) sales of paym ent intang ibles and prom issor y notes (only sales of accou nts and cha ttel paper are inclu ded today) ; See Revision § 9-109(a)(3) (ii) secu rity inte rests in health-car e insurance rece ivables (no interests in insur ance pol icies of any kind, except cas ual ty insur anc e procee ds, are included tod ay) ; See Revision § 9-109(a)(1), (a)(3), (d)(8) (iii) secu rity inter ests in deposit acco unts as orig inal col late ral (wh ich, as I mentioned , are exclud ed today in all but a ver y few state s); See Revision § 9-109(d)(13) and (iv) secu rity interests in com mer cial tort claims (wh ich are not includ ed today) . See Revision § 9-109(d)(12). Also to be includ ed under Article 9's umbr ella are non- possesso ry, stat utor y agri cul tur al liens See Revision §§ 9-102(a)(5); 9-109(a)(2) (some thought was given to including all stat uto ry liens, but the idea was late r aban doned as being ove rly ambi tious and possibly creati ng dif ficult circular ity of lien issues) , all forms of co nsig nme nt, See Revision § 9-104(a)(4) cert ain claims agai nst governmen tal uni ts, See Revision § 9-109(c)(2)- (3) and guaranties and letter of credit paym ent right s tha t support the paym ent or performance of other colla ter al such as account s and chatte l paper. See Revision §§ 9-102(a)(77); 9- 102, Official Commen t #5f , 9-308 (d) . Also includ ed will be em bedded soft war e, which will be deemed part of the goods in which the software is em bedded . See Revision §§ 9-102(a)(44); 9-109(a)(1). If, howeve r, the software mai ntains its independent sta tus, it will be treated as a gener al intangible. See Revision § 9- 102(a)(42). Retu rning to deposit acco unts as original colla ter al, inclusion will be lim ited to non-c onsumer deposit acco unts See Revision § 9-109(d)(12) and filing will be elimina ted as a means of perfecti on. See Revision § 9-312(b)(1). Instead , per fec tion will be obt ained only through \"contr ol\" ove r the deposit acco unt, a conc ept we 'll rev iew later when we take up the sub ject of per fec tion in mor e det ail. See Revision §§ 9-203( b)(3)(D); 9-312(b)(1). With respe ct to com mer cial tort cla ims, a secu rity inter est will not attach unless the tort claim exis ts See Revision § 9-204( b)(2) and is specif ically described in the secu rity agree ment. See Revision § 9- 108(e)(1). (Specific descri ption in the secu rity agree ment will not, howeve r, be necessar y for other types of colla ter al -- but mor e about tha t later.) Personal injur y clai ms will con tinue to be excluded from Article 9 until they are set tled and bec ome contr actual in nature, as with struc tur ed set tlemen ts . See Revision §§ 9-109(d)(12); 9- 109, Official Commen t #15. On ce the injury claim is trans formed into a contrac tual claim , it can ther eafte r be sold or pledged under Article 9 unless other state law prohi bits the aSS ignm ent. See Revision §§ 9-109(a)(3); 9-109, Official Comm ent #15. Let 's go back to health -care rece ivables for a mom ent. Wh at are they? The Revision defines them as interests in or claims under a pol icy of insur ance evide ncing a right to the paym ent of mone y for providing health-c are goods or services. See Revision § 9-102(a)(46). Including health-c are rece ivab les in Article 9 will permit health -car e provider s to lump insur ance receiv ables with other acco unts in a singl e pac kage and fina nce the whole thing under Article 9. See Revision § 9-109(a)(1), (3). This change will also allow healthcar e provi der s to take aSSignmen ts of insur ance claims from their patie nts and be per fected autom atical ly, without the need to file any thing -- a ver y help ful amendmen t. See Revision §§ 9-309( 5); REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 663"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"9-309, Official Comment #5. Let's briefly return to the sale of paym ent intangibl es and promis sor y notes . How do you incl ude sales of them in Article 9 (which the entir e secu ritiza tion indus try wants done to clear up some sign ificant \"true sale\" issues in the legal opin ions the rating agencies and acco untants reque st) , and not have such an inclusion res ult in financing state me nts being req uired to be filed eve ry time a lender sells a loan partici pation (which is a paym ent intan gible}S ee Revision § 9-102(a)( 61) to ano ther lender ? As we know, to perfect a sale of accou nts under the exis ting Co de, a financing state men t is req uired to be filed . See Current § 9-302(1). The same is true with resp ect to cha ttel paper unle ss you take possession of the paper. See Current §§ 9-302( 1)(a); 9-305. Well, the solution proposed is rea lly quite ingen ious. First, under the Revis ion the definition of \"acco unts\" will be expanded to incor porate virtually all rights to paym ent except propert y cons tituting a \"paym ent intangib le,\" which is so nar rowly drawn as to arguably include only inter ests in loans. See Revision § 9-102(a)( 2), (61). Per fec tion of a sale of \"acc ounts \" (as newly defined) will still req uire a filing, See Revision § 9-310(a) while perfec tion of a sale of paym ent intan gibles (and prom issory notes) will be automa tic -- no filing will be requir ed. See Revision §§ 9- 309(3)-(4); 9-310(b)(2). This will allow the secu ritiz ation indus try file to per fect the sale of acco unts and all the intangibl es surrou nding the acco unts that are sold to the SPY's and condui ts, while not placing a filing bur den on the loan partiC ipa tion mar ket . It's an ingenious reso lution to a difficul t problem , and it should work. Enough about the expanded scope of Article 9. Let me now touch briefly on the atta chmen t of the secu rity interest befo re we mo ve on to perfecti on. Not mu ch will change when it comes to atta chment. You will still need wha t you always needed -- value going to the deb tor, agreem ent of the deb tor that the secu rity interest atta ch, and the deb tor having rights in the col later al. See Revision § 9-203(b). Wh at is new is tha t the secu rity agre ement will not need to be physica lly signed by the deb tor, nor will it have to exis t on pape r. See Revision §§ 9-102(a)(7); 9-203( b)(3)( A). It will, howeve r, need to be some thing which you'll hear often under the Revision -- namely an \"authentica ted recor d .\" A \"recor d\" is defined as \"information tha t is inscribed on a tangible medium (Le., paper ) or which is sto red in an ele ctroni c or other me dium and is retrievable in per ceivable form .\" Re vision § 9- 1 02(a}(69} (em phasis added ). Examp les of current techno log ies tha t wo uld quali fy as a \"reco rd \" include magne tic media, optical discs , digi tal voice me ssage syste ms, ele ctronic mail, audio tapes and pho tog raphic media. See Revision § 9-102, Official Comment #9a. So that's a \"reco rd\" -- how is a reco rd \"authentic ated ?\" If it's pape r, it's phy sically signed. See Revision § 9-102(a)(7)( A). If it's some oth er form of reco rd , the Revision provides that it is authent icated when the authentic ato r encr ypts or simi larly processes the record with the present intenti on of both ide ntifyi ng the authe nticato r and adop ting or agree ing to the reco rd . See Revision § 9-102(a)(7)(8). The purpose of this exp ansion of existi ng Article 9's conc epts of a \"writi ng\" and of \"Signed\" is obvious -- new Article 9 is intended to be medium neutr al. The parties don't need pape r, but they still need to demons trate in some disce rnab le, retriev able form , that they intend to take the action the reco rd purport s to evidenc e . The Re vision mer ely refl ects the rea lity of our time -- peo ple make agree me nts , initiate filings and other wise commun ica te in me dia oth er than paper, and the commer cial laws tha t gove rn the ir actions should be moder niz ed to ref lect tha t re ality. See Revision § 9-102, Official Comment #9. Mor e on ele ctroni c records later. Let's mo ve now from attach men t to perfec tion. How will a secu rity interest which has attac hed (Le., tha t is enfor ceab le agai nst the debtor) be per fected REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 664"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"(i.e., be enfor ceable agains t thir d parties, including bankrup tcy trus tees)? Ag ain, basic con cepts are not chang ed, but some existi ng proced ures are. In essence, ther e are still two ways to perfect -- eith er by filing a financi ng state ment or by taking actual or con struc tive possess ion of the colla teral . Revision § 9- 31 0. (Per fec tion in some lim ited ins tances can be autom atic -- like per fec tion of sales of paym ent intangib les and secu rity inter ests in supp orting obli gati ons, but for the mo st part, filing or \"posses sion\" will still be necessar y.) See id. But wher e and wha t you file, and how you take possess ion are changed to simpli fy the process , to resolve some curre nt problems and to reflect mo der n techn ology. First -- filing. Wha t's new with UCC-1 financi ng state men ts? Ma ybe the mo st sign ificant change in the for m al req uisi tes for a UCC-1 (and ma ybe one of the mo st sign ificant chang es ove rall) is tha t the deb tor's sig natu re will no longer be req uired on the financing stat ement. See Re vision § 9-502(a). This change is intended to facilitate electr onic filing. See Revision § 9-502, Official Comment #3. Author ization for filing by the secu red part y will, in mo st cases, be cont ained in the secu rity agr eement, and authoriz ation will be aut oma tic to the extent the col late ral des cribed in the UCC- 1 is coexte nsi ve with the colla teral cove red by an other wise authe ntica ted security agr eemen t. See Revision § 9-509( b). If the tr ansac tion involves the pre-filing of UCC -1 's, the secur ed party will have to obt ain independent authori zati on. Under the Rev ision it will make no diffe rence tha t actually makes the filing. All tha t is import ant is tha t the party maki ng the filing has bee n author ized to do so. See Revision §§ 9-509; 9-510. The deb tor's authoriz ation is req uired for the filing of the initial financi ng state ment and for any amendmen t that adds colla ter al. See Revision § 9-509(a). Only the secu red party's authoriz ation is requir ed for other amendmen ts, like name and addr ess changes . See Revision § 9-509(d )(1). If the secu red part y is req uired to term inate a filing (i.e., because the secur ed deb t is paid or because it neve r exis ted in the first pla ce) and fails to do so, the debtor has certain lim ited rights to do so. See Revision § 9-509( d)(2). (This right is restric ted but was thought necessar y to protect deb tors agai nst secu red parties tha t had gone out of busi ness and agai nst rad icals in some parts of the cou ntry who file UCC -1's agains t publi c figures for per sonal or pol itical rev enge.) Oth er changes in formal req uisi tes for the UCC- 1 include the ability to use a super - generic descrip tion of the colla teral such as \"all assets of the deb tor now owned and hereafte r acquir ed\", assuming of cou rse tha t this desc ription accu rately describ es the deal betwe en the deb tor and the secu red party. See Revision §§ 9-108; 9-504( 2). This represent s a 180 degr ee change from existi ng law appl icable to financing state men t descrip tions. But the use of gener ic descrip tions does not exte nd to the secu rity agree ment, which still mu st describe the colla ter al by item or type, and be even mor e precise when the col lateral is a com mer cial tort claim or the transac tion involves a con sumer and the col lateral is con sumer goods or certai n types of inves tmen t property. See Revision §§ 9-108(e); 9-203( b)(3)( A). Before lea ving the topic of filing, you should also kno w tha t the Revis ion (Part 5) cont ains seve ral new provisions gov erning the oper ations of filing offices, wher e it was felt tha t filing officer s have bec ome too independen t in their adoption of so-c alled local rules which someti mes resu lted in other wise legally suf ficient filings being reject ed . The Rev ision sets forth only a very few reaso ns for rejec ting a filing such as tenderi ng an insuf ficient filing fee or communi cati ng the UCC- 1 or other reco rd to the filing office by a medium not author ized by the office . See Revision §§ 9-516; 9-520. Filing offices will also be requir ed to link all records received afte r the original filing (such as assig nme nts and contin uation state me nts) to the initial financing state ment they re late to. See Revision § 9-519(c)-(e). Ano ther change prohibits a filing office from deleti ng a financi ng state ment and related records from the files no ear lier than one year after lapse and eve n then only if a con tinua tion state me nt hasn't been filed. REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 665"},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"See Revision §§ 9-515; 9-519(g); 9-522. This will help both to elimi nate filing office discre tion and to ease problems associated with mul tiple secu red parties and mul tiple partial assignm ents. See Revision §§ 9-519; 9-520. Finally, the Revis ion (i) provides for the promulg ation of filing office rule s dealing with min iste rial det ails best left out of the stat ute See Revision § 9-526 and (ii) manda tes periodic report s tha t should le ad to a har monizing of the filing and search rules thr oug hout the Uni ted Stat es. See Revision § 9-527. So that's what's new with respect to the form al req uis ites of the UCC -1 . Wher e you will be req uired to file the UCC- 1 is a topic we 'll get to in a mom ent after we briefly explor e the seco nd me thod of perfecti on, which is possess ion. Earlier, when discus sing deposit acco unts as a cate gor y of original colla teral cove red by the Revis ion , I stated tha t perfecti on was poss ible only through \"contr ol.\" This is a concep t borr owed from rev ised Article 8 of the UCC deal ing with inves tmen t prope rty. Contr ol, which is a form of construc tive posses sion , will now be imported into Article 9 to deal not only with investm ent prope rty (which was acc omp lished in the 1994 Rev isions of Article 9), See Revision § 9-106 but also with deposit acc oun ts, See Revision § 9-104 rights to paym ent under lette rs of credit. See Revision § 9-107 and \"ele ctronic cha ttel pape r\" (Le. cha ttel paper that isn't on paper ) . See Revision § 9-105. To perfect in a dep osit account, other than as proceeds of other collateral, the secu red part y mu st get the deposito ry bank's agree men t to act on the secu red party's ins truct ions (Le. , get a blo cked acco unt agree me nt) , beco me the bank's cus tomer with respect to the acc ount or actually be the depositor y ban k. See Revision § 9-104 If you do get a typ ical blo cked acco unt agr eement, how eve r, you 'll kno w that you're per fected in the bank acco unt. See Revision § 9-104(a). Co ntrol ove r rights to paym ent under UC 's occu rs when the UC issuer conse nts to the assignme nt of proce eds . See Revision § 9-107. (As you kno w, today you mu st take posse ssion of the UC to perfect .)See Current §§ 9-304(1); 9-305. The Re vision shifts from possess ion of the pie ce of paper to control ove r the proceeds . Con trol is only me ans to perfect in deposit accou nts and UC rights as original collater al. See Revision §§ 9-203( bX3)(O); 9- 312(b)(1)-(2). To the exte nt the UC support s paym ent of an acco unt or paym ent intang ible, if you 're per fected in the accoun t or paym ent intang ible, you'll be perfected in the rights to paym ents under the UC . See Revision § 9-308( d). Per fec tion in inves tment propert y will conti nue to be governed by the rules (which incl ude both filing and contr ol) adopted as part of the 1994 amendmen ts. See Revision §§ 9-106; 9-309( 10)-(11); 9-310; 9-313(a); 9-312; 9-314. Pe rfecti on in electr onic cha ttel paper can be achie ved either by control (a spe cially defi ned contr ol, in \"hi-tec h\" terms, for this type of col lateral), or by filing. See Revision §§ 9-105; 9-310; 9-312; 9-314. Finally, the Rev ision mak es an important chang e in the perfec tion rules relating to the use of bailees. Un der current law, mo st decisions hold that a secu red party can perfect sim ply by giving notice to the bailee tha t the secur ed part y has a secu rity interest in the propert y in the bailee's posses sion. See Revision § 9-313, Official Com men t #4 (citing In re At lantic Syste ms, Inc., 135 B.A. 463 (Bankr. S.D.N .Y. 1992)). Un der the Revis ion, howeve r, the bailee mu st not only rece ive notice of the secu rity inter est, it mu st also acknowl edge, in an authent ica ted recor d , tha t it is holding the col late ral for the secu red party's bene fit. See Revision § 9-313(c). Un fortu nately, this revision will elimi nate the handy \"bailee with notice \" device available today, but the change was thought necessar y to bette r evidence the fact tha t the se cur ed party's control ove r the colla teral was sufficient enough to constitute construc tive posses sion. See Revision § 9-313, Official Comment #4. The new rule isn't wonder ful, but it is mor e logically consis tent with the Revis ion's concept of \"contr ol\" than old § 9-305 . We'll learn to live with it. So, dep ending upon the type of colla ter al involv ed, you can file, you can take actual posse ssion , or you REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 666"},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"can obta in construc tive possess ion (Le. contr ol), or in some ins tances you can file and take possess ion; but if you file, which , just like today, you will do mo st ofte n, wher e do you file? In ans wering this quest ion , I belie ve I will be telling you about the single mo st import ant of the Article 9 revi sions. It cer tainly is likely to save you and your cus tomer s the mo st mon ey. Today, the choice of law rule s gov erning per fec tion (the rules about wher e you file) for mo st collater al, tang ible and intangible, look either to (i) the law of jurisdiction wher e the deb tor is lo cated or (ii) the law of the jurisd iction wher e the colla teral is lo cat ed. See Current § 9-103. The jurisdiction of the deb tor's location currently governs the perfecti on of a secu rity interest in acc ounts , gener al intangibles and goods tha t typically mo ve among diffe rent jur isdic tions, such as cons truc tion equipment. See Current § 9- 103(3). The debtor's location is also the proper pla ce to file today if you elect to per fect agai nst cha ttel paper or inves tment propert y by filing ins tead of possess ion or contr ol. See Current § 9-103(4), (6). Wi th respect to mo st ot her types of colla teral (lik e invento ry and equip me nt) you mu st file wher e the colla ter al is lo cat ed, and this can involv e all 50 states in some transa ctions. See Current § 9-103(1). Un der the Rev ision, howeve r, the jurisd iction of debtor's loca tion will apply for all types of col late ral, tangible and intan gible. See Revision § 9-301(1). In dete rm ining loca tion, § 9-307 of the Rev ision essent ially follows exis ting law under § 9- 1 03, namely, loca tion of debtor is the deb tor's pla ce of busine ss (or chief executive office , if the debtor ha s mor e than one pla ce of busi ness) .See Revision § 9-307(b)(2)­ (3). But the new law contains thr ee ma jor excep tions. First, a \"regis ter ed organiz ation\" such as a corpor ation or LLC, is deemed located in the state under whose law the debtor is organ ized (which , for a cor por ation, will be the state of incor por ation) . See Revision § 9-307(e). Sec ond, an indi vidual debtor is located at his or her princi pal residence. See Revision § 9-307 (b)(1). Thir d, ther e are spe cial rules for determ ining the loca tion of regis tered organiz ations organiz ed under the la ws of the Uni ted States and for for eign debtor s dOing busine ss in the Uni ted States but other wise organiz ed under the la ws of a jur isdic tion tha t doesn 't have a public notice filing system for non- posses sor y secu rity inter ests . See Revision § 9-307(f). These for eign debto rs are deemed located in the District of Colum bia. See Revision § 9-307(c). Wha t all this me ans is that, in mo st cases under the Revis ion , secu rity interests in the assets of dom estic corpo rati ons which can be perfected by filing, can be per fected with one filing in the state where the debtor is incor porated or registered . No t so good for the search firms, but great for us! One interes ting dic hoto my in the new cho ice of law reg ime is tha t while location of debtor will freq uen tly gove rn pla ce of filing, it will not govern prio rity, See Revision § 9-301 (3)(C) nor will it govern perfecti on of posses sor y secu rity inter ests . See Revision § 9-301(2) or agricultural liens. See Revision § 9-302. Those topics will conti nue to be governed by the laws of jurisdic tion wher e the colla teral is located at the time of perfect ion , the same as under existi ng law. Additio nal special cho ice-o f-Ia w rules, wh ich are too inv olv ed for this discussio n, but which don't make rad ical changes, will govern goods cove red by certific ates of title. See Revision § 9-303. Let me ma ke some gener al obse rva tions about prio rity and proceeds before turning to enfor cement. For the mo st part, exis ting prio rity rules will not change. The lon g-s tanding rule (since 1972) , tha t the first part y to file a financing state ment or to other wise perfect its secu rity inter est will have priority, con tinue s. See Revision § 9-322(a )(1). Tha t said, ther e are still a numb er of imp ortant changes effected by the Revis ion . REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 667"},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"First, as CF A re quested back in 1991 , the rules with respect to pur cha se money secu rity interests are clarified for non- consu mer transact ions. The new defi nition of a pur cha se mon ey secu rity inte rest mak es it abso lutely clear tha t a secu rity interest ma y be both pur chase mo ney and non-pur chase mon ey at the same time. (This is the so-called \"dual- sta tus\" appr oach.) See Revision § 9-103(f). In effe ct, the change rejects the \"transfo rma tion rule\" under which a pur chase money secu rity inter est was \"tran sfo rmed\" into a non-pur cha se mo ney secu rity inter est (an d, cons equen tly, lost its spec ial prior ity sta tus under the UCC) when ther e was no on e-to-one correspo nden ce betwe en collater al and the debt which was incu rred to pur cha se or finance the pur chase of tha t col later al. See Revision § 9-103, Official Comment #7. This is an imp ortant change for floor plan financer s who exte nd credit to vendor s in amoun ts greate r than the pur cha se price of floor plan ned goods. Wi th \"dual sta tus\", the secu rity inter est granted the floor plan financer can be both pur cha se mo ney (with super prio rity sta tus for some of the deb t) See Revision §§ 9- 317(e); 9-324 and non- pur cha se money (sub ject to the regular first to file or perfect rules) for the balance of the debt. This will greatly simpli fy inter-cr editor nego tiations and documen tation, which today are often leng thy and cos tly. Ne xt, the Revision provides a numb er of new rules with respect to deposit acco unts which have been patte rned on the rules for inves tment property under Article 8. If a secu red party has control of the deposit acc ount, its secu rity inter est will be senior to a secu rity inter est perfected in any other manner (such as by filing, or eve n as proceeds of othe r colia ter al). See Revision § 9-327(1). If mor e than one secu red party has control of the same deposit acc ount, priori ty ranks acco rding to who obtai ned control first, See Revision § 9-327(2) unle ss one of the com peti ng secu red parties is the depository bank, which will win unle ss the other secur ed party takes control of the deposit acc oun t by bec oming the depos itory bank's cus tomer. See Revision § 9-327(3)-(4) or unless the deposi tor y bank has agr eed to the contr ary. See Revision § 9-339. Ano ther very sign ificant amendmen t affec ting deposit acco unt s gives prior ity to the offset rights of the depos itory bank ove r the secu rity interest held by another secu red party, including an asset- based lender who claims the deposi t acco unt as proceeds of its colla teral. See Revision § 9-340. This is a 180 degr ee change from exis ting law, but was necessar y to get the Fede ral Reserve on boar d with the amendmen ts gener ally. The priority given to the offset ting bank can be overco me by exp ress agree men t with the bank. See Revision § 9-339 or by havi ng the com peti ng secu red party put the acco unt in its name, ther eby bec oming the ban k's cus tomer. See Revision §§ 9- 104(a)(3); 9-340(c). Many lender s will find tha t they al ready have such provisions in their blo cked acco unt agr eeme nts today. Turning to lette rs of cred it, control will also trump per fec tion by any oth er me ans. See Revision § 9- 329(1). Remem ber, per fecti on in rights to paym ent under UCs will be acc ompl ished by control (Le. by obtai ning the consen t of the UC issuer to the assignm ent of the UC proceeds) See Revision § 9-107. ins tead of physical possess ion of the UC unless , of course, the UC cons titutes a supporti ng obl igation for an acco unt re ceivab le, in which case per fec tion is automa tic if the secu rity inter est in the underlyi ng oblig ation (be it an acco unt or paym ent intan gibl e) is perfected . See Revision § 9-308( d). But, agai n, control will trump autom atic perfecti on. The priority rules for cha ttel paper will not change mu ch. Diffe re nt rules will apply depend ing upon wheth er pur chaser s who give new val ue and take possession of, or obtain control ove r, the pape r, do so with the paper being mer ely proceeds of other col lateral or as separ ate ly fina nced assets .

(This ove rrules contr ary cases such as Ha stie v. FDIC, 2 F.3 d 1042 (10th Cir. 1993)) .See Revision § 9-102, Official Comment #13a. Proceeds will also includ e license reve nues and claims stem min g from loss or non -conform ity of, defects in, or dam age to , collater al, including infr ingem ent claims against third parties. See Revision § 9-102(a)(64). Final ly, proceeds will incl ude col lec tions on acco unt of supporting obliga tions, such as guar anties and rights under UC s. See Revision §§ 9-102(a)(64)(8); 9-102, Official Com me nt #13b. All these exp ansions in the defi nition of proceeds resolve in favo r of the secu red lender vari ous ambigui ties tha t have exis ted ove r the years wh ich caused secu red lender s to be denied the bene fit of colla ter al they thought they had bar gained for. Turning to another ma jor impr ovemen t for the secu red len ding indus try, the sec tion of Article 9 tha t prohibi ted the tracing of cash proceeds into com min gle d bank accou nts afte r the debtor's bankrup tcy (Le. current § 9-306(4) (d)), and tha t oth erwise gave rise to a numb er of frigh tening preference problems under the Bank ruptcy Code, will be elimi nated . See Revision § 9-315(b)(2). This ma y seem like a small impr ove ment, but, belie ve me, it's ma jor ! Finally, let's look at enfor cement. The Revi sion ma kes a numb er of import ant chan ges in the law govern ing debtor def aul t and secu red party enfor cement. Let me foc us on those I belie ve ma y be mo st important. First, the Re vision ma kes stric t fore clo sur es (wher e the secur ed party retains colla teral, ins tead of selling colla ter al, to satisfy the deb t) mu ch mor e attractive for secu red lender s. Un der existi ng law, stric t for eclosur e was thought to be unavai lable if the lender either wanted to have the col lateral satisfy a part, rather than all the debt, or the lender wanted to retain intan gible colla teral (like acco unts) rather than tangible col lateral (lik e equipment or inventor y) . Both of these lim itations on strict foreclos ure have been elimi nated by the Revis ion . See Revision § 9-620. And as a final blo w to exis ting lim its on stric t foreclos ure, the Rev ision ma kes it clear tha t (i) junior secu red claim ants are discharged by a senior 's rete ntion of the colla teral -- an unlik ely res ult under current law, See Revision § 9-622(a) and (ii) secu red parties who fail to exped itiously dispose of colla teral after def aul t will not be deemed to have foreclosed on it. See Revision § 9-620(a )(1), (c). Ne xt, in one of the mo st sought afte r changes in Article 9, the Rev ision ado pts the reb uttable presump tion rule for creditor misbeha vior during the forec losur e process , rather than abso lute bar rule. See Revision § 9-626(a). This me ans that in non-cons umer transa ctions , the secu red party won't lose its deficiency claim sim ply because one aspec t of the foreclosur e is fou nd not to have been com mer cially reaso nable. Ra ther, the non-c omplying secu red part y will be req uired to credit the deb t with the greater of the net sales proceeds received on forec losur e or the amoun t a court later det ermines the secu red part y wo uld have received if the for eclo sur e had been cond ucted in a com mer cial ly reaso nable manner. See Revision § 9-626( a)(3)-(4). This is a ver y important cla rifica tion in the law. Sta ying with deficiencies for a mom ent, the Revision cont ains a series of spe cial new rules for calc ula ting def iciencie s and sur pluses wher e the col lateral is sold at forec losur e to the secu red party, to an affiliate of the secu red party, or to a sec ondar y obligor (Le. a guarantor) . See Revision § 9-615(f). Some member s of the Drafti ng Comm ittee belie ved tha t sales to related parties could be mor e easily manipula ted and REDEMPTION MANUAL - FOUR POINT FIVE EDITION 669"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"abused , and , conse quen tly, needed protec tion above and bey ond wha t the sim ple com mer cially rea sonable standar d provi ded. See Revision § 9-615, Official Comment #6. So the drafters cam e up with the follo wing solution -- if the sale yields pr oceeds \"sign ificantly below the range of proceeds\" tha t a comp lying disposition wo uld yield to an indep endent thir d party, then -- eve n if the sale itself was otherwise proced urally proper -- the deficiency or sur plus will be calcula ted based upon the amoun t of proceeds tha t wo uld have been realiz ed in a com mer cially rea sonable sale to an unr ela ted third party. See Revision § 9-615(f). Un fortu nately, this change will either discou rage secu red parties from bidd ing at their own for eclosur e sales (particularly when the colla teral is har d to val ue and, thus, will lik ely gener ate litigatio n), or will promp t secu red parties to obt ain appr aisals (maybe mor e than one) in each case wher e they intend to bid, and then pla ce their bid at the middle or above the middle of the appr aised val ue. Per sonally, I didn' t belie ve this change was necessar y, but several important represe ntatives of our indus try did (evidently, because they have witn essed mor e rigged sales than I have) . In any event, the revision is ther e, and we' ll have to conduc t ourselves accor dingl y. Finally, let me look at the notices tha t have to be given to third parties when foreclo sing. Un der current law, notice of foreclosu re is requir ed to be given only to those creditors from whom the foreclos ing secu red part y has received notice of an inter est in the collateral and a desire to receiv e notice. See Current § 9-504( 3). This provision was part of the 1972 rev isions of Article 9 and it changed then exis ting law. Well, we' re chang ing back to the pre-1972 ver sion of Article 9 and req uiring the foreclos ing secu red party to conduc t a lien sear ch in the appr opria te jurisdicti on (which will be mu ch easier when you file on everyth ing in one pla ce) and to provide writte n notice to all secu red parties of recor d whose financing state me nts cove r the colla teral being for eclosed on. See Revision §§ 9-611(c)(3); 9-621. The Rev ision sets out in det ail the conte nts of the notice and how far in advance of the sale notice mu st be sent. See Revision §§ 9-611 to 9-614. The Rev ision also cont ains a safe harbor if a lien sear ch, which is conduc ted with in a specified time prior to sale , fails to reve al a filing or if the search isn't comp leted within a rea sonable time. See Revision § 9-611(e). But, at the end of the day, the secu red party will still have to search and notify other secu red partie s of reco rd -- som eth ing it does n't have to do today unless a juni or secu red party so requests . Ther e are other new rules (i) giving juni or secu red par ties certai n protec tions, (ii) diffe rentiating the rights of debtor s , obligor s and secondar y obl igor s, (iii) limi ting the ability of guar antor s to waive certain surety def enses , See Revision §9-602. (iv) provi ding secu red parties greate r flexibil ity in collec ting rece ivables See Revision §9-607. and (v) diffe rentia ting con sumer from non-cons umer reme dies, but I bel ieve we cove red enough for one day. Su ffice it to say, ther e is a lot to learn , but I'm con vinc ed tha t the Rev ision will facilitate secu red financing, red uce its cost, bring greate r certai nty to trans actions covered by Article 9 and provide greate r protec tion to deb tor s and secu red parties alike. These are desirable res ults, and the Revis ion dese rves our support. -e nd.
