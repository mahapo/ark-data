As indicated herein, the highways were established for the use of the general public. Streets and highways are established and maintained primarily for purposes of travel by the public and incidental uses. Am Jur 2d Highways, Streets and Bridges §227, citing Birmingham Ry. Light and Power Company v Smyer 181 Ala 121, 61 So 354 The term travel is a generic and broad term. The phrase “incidental uses” in the above citation means the use of the highways as a means of personal gain, discussed later on. It is now, and has been known, that traveling is of two basic categories: those who travel in a personal capacity for pleasure and those who travel the public highways incident thereto for profit. ... the terms “travel” and” traveler” are usually construed in their broad and general sense where used in this connection, rather than in a narrow and restricted one, and the duty and consequent liability is extended so as to include all those who rightfully use the highways viatically, and who have occasion to pass over them for the purpose of business, convenience, or pleasure. Van Cleef v. Chicago , 240 Ill 318, 88 NE 815, 23 LRA(NS) 636, 130 Am St Rep 275; Traveling for pleasure connotes the movement from one place to another for ones own enjoyment, as in the case of visiting friends and relatives. However, it is undisputed that the use of common highways is also for general purposes. Those common purposes may include, but are in no way limited to traveling to or from the following places: doctor, veterinarian, grocer, hardware store, beach picnic, coffee stand, work, movie, funeral, convenience mart, bank, school, families homes, dinner out, sporting events, etc."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"A distinction may also be made between private carriers who transport their own property for compensation and those who transport their own property without compensation. The use upon the public highways of motor vehicles engaged in transportation for hire may be prohibited restricted or conditioned by the controlling public authority. Highways are public avenues for use by the entire public for their private and personal purposes and the use of a highway for profit and gain may be restricted. Stephenson v Binford 287 US 251, 53 S Ct 181 \"...Based upon the fundamental ground that the sovereign state has the plenary control of the streets and highways in the exercise of its police power may absolutely prohibit the use of the streets as a place for the prosecution of a private business for gain. They all recognize the fundamental distinction between the ordinary Right of the Citizen to use the streets in the usual way and the use of the streets as a place of business or a main instrumentality of business for private gain. The former is a common Right; the latter is an extraordinary use. As to the former, the legislative power is confined to regulation, as to the latter, it is plenary and extends even to absolute prohibition. Since the use of the streets by a common carrier in the prosecution of its business as such is not a right but a mere license of privilege.\" Hadfield v Lundin , 98 Wash 657, 168 P. 516 The use of the highways for the purpose of transporting persons or property for hire by the ordinary means is incidental to and consistent with the primary purpose of their establishment [highways] and is therefore a proper use in the absence of any restricted regulation. Such use is not however one which may be exercise as of right but is a special or permissive use. A street is a road or public way in a city town or village. A way over land set apart for public travel in a town or city is a street no matter by what name it may be called. It is the purpose for which it is laid out and the use made of it that determines its character.

Its prime essentials are the right of common enjoyment on the one hand and the duty of public maintenance on the other. It is the right of travel by all the world, and not the exercise of the right, which constitutes a way a public highway, and the actual amount of travel upon it is not material. If it is open to all who desire to use it, it is a public highway although it may accommodate only a limited portion of the public or even a single family, although it accommodates some individuals more than others.\" [citing] 25 Am. Jur. 339, §2 \"Highways are public ways as contra – distinguished from private ways. The distinguishing mark of a highway is that it must be opened generally to public use, as expressed in the English books, 'common to all the king's subjects,' although it is the right to travel upon a highway by all the world and not the exercise of the right which makes the way a highway. It's character is not determined by the number of persons who actually use it for passage; if it is open, it is immaterial that but few individuals are in a position to make use of it, or that one person is most benefited by it; and its character as a highway is not affected even by the fact that it furnishes access or egress to but a single property owner.\"  [citing] 29 CJS 366, §1 State of Washington, in re Oregon- Washington Railroad& Navigation Company et al. v. Walla Walla County et al., 5 Wn.2d 95, To further proliferate the fundamental liberty that is the Right to travel the common highways is the language below. In the first sentence, in italics, the court uses the language “ existence, creates, permits, will ”. These words are proof positive as declared by the courts, that one has a constitutional liberty interest in the free uninhibited use of the public highways. To exemplify these words, they become the epitome of divinity. Existence is existential , creates is creation or creator, permits is permission, will is liberty or freedom. The pinnacle summation of the forgoing, in strict text, reads: “existence from creation is existential permission by our creator to the free use ”. R emembering that phrase, we understand the dominate introversion of private traveling versus the extroversion of traveling for hire and/or commercial travel."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The existence of a public highway creates a public easement of travel which permits the general traveling public to use the highway at will .

City of Cincinnati 310 F.3d 484, 6th Cir. 2002 (Constitution protects right to travel locally through public spaces and roadways). The right of the public to use a street for travel is greater than that of an individual to occupy it for other purposes. Am Jur 2d Highway Streets and Bridges §230. The evolution of the highways dates back centuries, but this writing is confined to the 20 th century. The “road” is what our grandfathers' grandfathers traveled to survey and settle this continent. It was traveled by horse, mule and wagon. Those people were not required to have a"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"driver license to travel the roads, albeit they were drivers, drivers of mule teams, etc. As noted below, one may choose the method and or mode of transportation which is most prudent to, and for his particular needs, not prohibited by law. Provided the use of said vehicle does not transcend to commerce. It is therefore the adaptation and use rather than the form or kind of contrivance that concerns the courts. Italic mine Huddy On Automobiles 6 th Ed., Citing Indiana Springs Company v Brown 165 Ind 465, 74 NE 615 The public easement includes every kind of travel and communication for the movement or transportation of persons or property which is reasonable and proper in the use of a public highway, or of a particular portion thereof, with all means of conveyance which can be introduced with a reasonable regard for the safety and convenience of the public, and without inflicting upon the owner of, the fee, an injury differing in kind from that imposed by use and improvement for ordinary public travel, and embraces all public travel, not prohibited by law, or by dedicatory restriction, on foot, in carriages, omnibuses, stages, sleighs, or other vehicles, including motor vehicles, as the wants and habits of the publics demand. The public is not confined, to the use of vehicles in use at the time when the streets or highways were established, but may use such other reasonable means of conveyance as may be discovered in the future, provided they do not exclude the proper use of the highway by other modes or kinds of vehicles, or tend to destroy it as a means of passage and travel common to all. The use of such new and improved means of locomotion must be deemed to have been contemplated when the highways and streets were laid out or dedicated, whenever it is found that the general benefit requires it, and such new means of locomotion cannot be excluded there from or be deemed unlawful merely because their use may tend to the inconvenience or even to the injury of those who continue to use the highways and streets by former methods.

Cloverdale Homes v Town of Cloverdale 182 Ala 419, 62 So 712. Improved methods of locomotion are perfectly admissible... “pubic rights do not depend upon the methods of travel recognized at the time the streets were opened or such public uses as have been sanctioned by long continued custom and acquiescence. The use of the streets must be extended to meet the new needs of locomotion .”  Italic mine Huddy On Automobiles 6 th Ed., citing People v Field & Co. 266 Ill 609, 107 NE 864. In all human activities the law keeps up with improvement and progress brought about by discovery and invention and in respect to highways, if the introduction of a new contrivance for transportation purposes is conducted with due care, the contrivance is compatible with the general use and safety of the road. Huddy on Automobiles 6 th Ed. §31 In the cases of Ryder and Swift supra, the court uses the term “provided”. T here is no proviso in the statutes discussing a uniform blanket general licensing scheme, applicable to private travel.

Light and Power Company v Smyer supra, by the usual and customary mode of transportation not inconsistent with the current status of mobility, which is a legally and lawfully acceptable use.

[ Lutz ] The state, by any agency, has not disputed and can not dispute any point of law herein, but will incessantly default to the statutory phrase “drive a motor vehicle” or “operate a motor vehicle”. This default motive claim, without objection, to the personal and private use of an automobile for personal and private purposes, is for all intents and purposes a tacit admission of the distinctions of personal use, without governmental interference, and the “incidental use” for commerce, which is secondary systemic; discussed further herein. The rights of locomotion, freedom of movement, to go where one pleases and to use the public streets in a way that does not interfere with the personal liberty of others are basic values \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\" protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment [citations omitted]. One may be on the streets even though he is there merely for exercise, recreation, walking, standing, talking, socializing, or any other purpose that does not interfere with other persons' rights. further, No right is more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the liberty assurance of the due process clause than the right of every citizen to the possession and control of his own person, free from restraint or interference by the state. The makers of our Constitution conferred, as against the government, the right to be let alone -- the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized man. Union Pacific Railway Company v. Botsford 141 U.S. 250, 11 S. Ct. 1000; Olmstead v. United States 277 U.S. 438, 48 S. Ct. 564.

See Papachristou, supra. further, We recognize that defendant would distinguish pedestrians strolling and meeting on the sidewalk from persons operating motor vehicles on the streets but we reject this argument. Motor vehicles are a lawful means of locomotion and plaintiff has the right to drive himself where he pleases - to go where he wants to go for whatever reason - if he is otherwise obeying the law, including relevant traffic statutes and ordinances. Plaintiff has therefore asserted a valid liberty interest. ...\"intrastate travel\" as we understand that phrase, encompasses the right to migrate freely within a state. Lutz v. City of York, Pennsylvania, 692 F. Supp. 457 It should be noted here that the court does not use the phrase “drive a motor vehicle” or “operate a motor vehicle”, both of which have very clear contextual meanings in commerce. The terms motor vehicle and drive are broad terms, and these terms should not be confined to a single definition unless strictly done so by a legislative body. see Huddy and DLLA infra The term travel is a broad term having two legally distinguishable meanings. One being the statutory definitions listed herein which specifically clarify, that commercial travel is accomplished when a person undertakes to deliver, using a public highway, that which has been purchased, and accepts a fee for such delivery. The other, being normal everyday use, as discussed above, by way of traveling public roads to connect oneself with the community. As the Eggert court points out, traveling the highways is not based on the commerce clause. The right to travel is a right applicable to intrastate as well as interstate commerce. In as much as the right to travel is not based on the commerce clause, it does not depend on the interstate nature of travel. Rights such as the right to travel which involve personal liberty are not dependent on state lines. Both travel within and between states is protected.

The definition of personal liberty is; \"Personal liberty, or the Right to enjoyment of life and liberty, is one of the fundamental or natural Rights, which has been protected by its inclusion as a guarantee in the various constitutions, which is not derived from, or dependent on, the U.S. Constitution, which may not be submitted to a vote and may not depend on the outcome of an election. It is one of the most sacred and valuable Rights, as sacred as the Right to private property ... and is regarded as inalienable.” 16 C.J.S., Constitutional Law, §202 This concept is further amplified by the American Jurisprudence Encyclopedia, 1 st ed.; \"Personal liberty largely consists of the Right of locomotion -- to go where and when one pleases -- only so far restrained as the Rights of others may make it necessary for the welfare of all other citizens.

When the state allows the formation of a public corporation business, it may control its creation by establishing guidelines (statutes and charters) for its operation. Companies that use the roads in the course of business do not use the roads in the ordinary course of life. There is a difference between a corporation and an individual. The United States Supreme Court has stated; \"...We are of the opinion that there is a clear distinction in this particular between an individual and a corporation, and that the latter has no right to refuse to submit its books and papers for examination on the suit of the state. The individual may stand upon his Constitutional Rights as a Citizen. He is entitled to carry on his private business in his own way. His power to contract is unlimited. He owes no duty to the state or to his neighbors to divulge his business, or to open his doors to investigation, so far as it may tend to incriminate him. He owes no such duty to the state, since he receives nothing there from, beyond the protection of his life, liberty, and property. His Rights are such as the law of the land long antecedent to the organization of the state, and can only be taken from him by due process of law, and in accordance with the Constitution. Among his Rights are the refusal to incriminate himself, and the immunity of himself and his"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"property from arrest or seizure except under warrant of law. He owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their rights.\" further... \"Upon the other hand, the corporation is a creature of the state. It is presumed to be incorporated for the benefit of the public. It receives certain special privileges and franchises, and holds them subject to the laws of the state and the limitations of its charter. Its rights to act as a corporation are only preserved to it so long as it obeys the laws of its creation. There is a reserved right in the legislature to investigate its contracts and find out whether it has exceeded its powers. It would be a strange anomaly to hold that the state, having chartered a corporation to make use of certain franchises, could not in exercise of its sovereignty inquire how those franchises had been employed, and whether they had been abused, and demand the production of corporate books and papers for that purpose.\" Hale v Hinkel 201 US 43 Corporations engaged in mercantile equity fall under the purview of the State's admiralty jurisdiction, and the public at large must be protected from their activities, as they are engaged in business for profit. In order to reach a full understanding of the Right versus \"privilege\", it is important to know that courts have ruled consistently without ambiguity, no sacrifice exists; \"Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them.\" Miranda v Arizona 384 US 436, 86 S.

The State of Washington wholly concurs with this writers rendering of statute policy and law. The following is former attorney general John J. O'Connell's opinion as to the intent and application of the operator and driver license. Mr. O'Connell, as a [former] representative of the State of Washington, agrees that all statutes relating to operating and driving are static, as well as confirming that all license's issued by the Dept. of Lic. are in fact issued to “for hire” status and, by use of the latin legal maxim, expressio unius est exclusio alterius, he acknowledges that no license may issue for personal use of an automobile. Mr. O'Connell's opinion reads as follows: AGO 61-62 No. 46 ________________ EDITED FOR SPACE AND CONTENT ________________________ \"The business of operating as a motor carrier of freight for compensation along the highways of this state is a business affected with a public interest. The rapid increase of motor carrier freight traffic and the fact that under the existing law many motor trucks are not effectively regulated have increased the dangers and hazards on public highways and make it imperative that more complete regulation should be employed to the end that the highways may be rendered safer for the use of the general public;...\" RCW 81.80.211 provides: \"The commission may adopt rules and regulations relating to the hours of duty of motor carrier drivers and operators.\" RCW 81.80.290 provides in part: \"The commission may, by general order or otherwise, prescribe rules and regulations in conformity with this chapter to carry out the purposes thereof, applicable to any and all 'motor carriers,' ...\""},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Outside the confines of chapter 81.80 RCW, but of prime importance and significance to our consideration of this matter is RCW 81.04.460 providing: \"The commission shall enforce the provisions of this title and all other acts affecting public service companies, the enforcement of which is not specifically vested in some other officer or tribunal.\" Thus, addressing ourselves solely to that portion of your question which relates to driver qualifications, we conclude that the public service commission has the authority to both adopt and enforce rules and regulations governing driver qualifications with respect to auto transportation companies and motor freight carriers. By this, we do not mean to imply that such authority includes the power to prescribe conditions precedent to the issuance of a motor vehicle operator's license. The \"general supervision and control of the issuance of vehicle operators' licenses\" is specifically vested in the director of licenses. RCW 46.20.010. However, the commission may prescribe safety regulations over and above those prerequisite to the issuance of a driver's license with respect to the drivers of auto transportation companies and motor freight carriers. In so far as your question relates to the authority of the commission to adopt and enforce rules and regulations governing safety of equipment, a final conclusion at this juncture would be premature without first considering certain provisions of Title 46 RCW. Section 46.08.010, chapter 12, Laws of 1961, provides in material part: \"The provisions of this title relating to the certificate of ownership, certificate of license registration, vehicle license, vehicle license plates and vehicle operator's license shall be exclusive...\" In this respect, it is worthy of note that although several provisions of chapter 81.68 RCW and chapter 81.80 RCW have been amended at various times since the original enactment and amendment of RCW 46.37.005, the legislature has never seen fit to amend in any way the particular provisions of RCW 81.68.030 and RCW 81.80.130 which grant the public service commission the authority to regulate the safety of operations of auto transportation companies and motor freight carriers respectively."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Under these circumstances, we do not feel it can be said that there is a manifest intent upon the part of the legislature to effect a repeal by implication.

In determining whether any particular rule or regulation of the public service commission is in conflict with those of the state commission on equipment or those set forth in chapter 46.37 RCW, the test is whether the former permits, or licenses, that which the latter forbids, or prohibits, and vice versa. Bellingham v. Schampera , 157 Wash. Dec. 1 (1960) [[57 Wn.2d 106]].

When a man hears or thinks of police, his mind sees a public employee with a uniform, usually adorned with assorted weaponry. The word police is a conjugal derivative of policy. There are three branches of government; legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislative body writes policy; the executive branch enforces that policy; and the judicial resolves conflicts of policy. Government employees only fall into one of three categories, if the employee is not a member of the judiciary or a member of the legislature then he is a member of the executive branch, no matter municipal or state or his status. The uniformed, armed, executive employees that prey upon our common highways are the same executive branch policy enforcers likened to those that sit behind a desk and issue tax warrants or demands for child support payments or issue building permits. The truth of the matter is, that if one applies for and receive a driver license, that creates an assumption that one is always engaged in driving. Driving is legally defined as, a person in actual physical control of a motor vehicle, as an occupation or business; don't forget the underlying criteria of being paid for services rendered. ...the police power is exercised for the promotion of the public welfare by means of the regulation of dangerous or potentially dangerous business, occupations or activities... 16A Am Jur 2d Constitutional Law §318 The state, resting upon their original basis of sovereignty, exercise their police powers and regulates its domestic commerce, contracts.

If a business itself is a proper subject of police regulation so are all its incidents and accessories such as the manner of conducting the business. 16A Am Jur 2d Constitutional Law §372 Since it is a universal rule that every business or occupation itself is subject to proper police regulation for the public interest, it logically follows that the right of every person to pursue a business, occupation, or profession is subject to the paramount right of the government as a part of its police power to impose such restrictions and regulations as the protection of the public may require.

The license which is required restricts business use as well as types of business and the incidentals; load capacities, night time driving, chemical containers, explosives and oversize vehicles to name a few.

It is however, with no small measure of deference, that the definition of “private carrier” is again fragmented and encrypted in yet another title of the statutes, as to what exactly is intended by the phrase, “use of the highways for gain.” RCW 81.80.010(6). A \"private carrier\" is a person who transports by his or her own motor vehicle, with or without compensation, property which is owned or is being bought or sold by the person, or property where the person is the seller, purchaser, lessee, or bailee and the transportation is incidental to and in furtherance of some other primary business conducted by the person in good faith.

In the Scheffel case, the court reasons a particular use in a particular way, which is prohibited. The Scheffel court, not inconsistent with the Stephenson court, have each succinctly denominated the separate and distinct nature of operating and driving for hire, as against the personal use of an automobile. Revocation of a motor vehicle operator's permit is within the ambit of the state's police power to protect the public from reckless or negligent operators. The governmental interest involved is that of the protection of the individuals who use the highways.

Cohen v City of Hartford 244 Conn 206, 710 A 2d 746 The definition of motor vehicle is nearly succinct with the definition of vehicle at both state and federal levels, see definitions. Although the state definitions may be fragmented and diffuse, they operate with the same intent, to regulate commercial activity at the state level. By their language, they are intended to regulate commerce and transportation , for compensation or the transmission of credit upon the receipt and delivery of property (obtained as the result of a transaction). Notice that the state definition is nearly exact to Federal, save the deletion of the term commerce. Transportation is defined as; The removal of goods or persons from one place to another, by a carrier. Interstate Commerce Comm. v Brimson 154 US 447, 14 S.Ct.1125 Here again, notice that this definition, incorporating the term carrier, refers to one \" conducting business .\" No mention is made of one who is traveling in his personal private automobile.

But, what was the distinction?

The statutes are void for vagueness as being overly broad and void for want of substantive due process, by failing to provide notice of the distinctions in traveling, whereby not clearly and succinctly delineating the differences and establishing proper authoritative and jurisdictional guidelines. A statute is constitutional or unconstitutional in accordance in the way in which it operates and the effect that it has.

A competing state interest may be found by comparing, for instance, the right of privacy of a sex offender to live at an unpublished location, against the states interest to protect the public and publicize his location for the safety of the public.

The personal private use and enjoyment of the highways is neither an existing threat, as in the former, neither an impending threat, as in the latter. The states use of a private “for hire” classification in one statute, and a vaguely written driver licensing statute, is an attempt to surreptitiously create or manifest some potential threat generated by all who use the roads and highways; these may be construed as fraud, because the courts, and the Attorney General, and other statutes have already confirmed that it is commerce that creates the threat. Further, the licensing statutes reach unconstitutional vagueness, because elemental in their failure to provide notice, the statutes do not define with specificity a rational basis for including, covertly, the personal and private use of the highways and how it reasonably relates to licensed commercial activity, which would have to be done consistent with the threat discussed above. \"The traditional test for a denial of equal protection is: whether the challenged classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of a valid state objective.\" Turner v.

The unwritten policy at issue here is not premised on a violation of specific park rules. The policy delegates complete discretion to the police officer, and there are no guidelines for the exercising of that discretion. A reasonable person would not have fair warning of what conduct would violate that regulation. Not only are the policy's prohibitions not clearly defined, the policy presents substantial risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. While there is no evidence Pool used this policy in a discriminatory manner, the policy presents significant risk it could be used in such a manner. The unwritten policy is unconstitutionally vague. Due process is ordinarily absent if a party is deprived of his or her property or liberty without evidence having been offered against him or her in accordance with established rules. In re Application of Eisenberg , 654 F.2d 1107, 1112 (5th Cir. 1981). see red section below \"However, a court may not assume the legislative prerogative and rewrite a statute in order to save it if the statute is not readily subject to a narrowing construction.\" Id . Without completely rewriting the policy, there is no reasonable interpretation of the unwritten policy that would be constitutional. We are to sever the unconstitutional portion of the unwritten policy, and the unable unwritten policy is not susceptible to a narrowing construction. In reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence, we view the relevant evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Johnson v. State , 23 S.W.3d 1, 7 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). Lamar Anthony, Jr., v State of Texas 209 S.W.3d 296; 2006 Tex. App. Somewhat similar is the statement that is a rule as old as the law that; \"no one shall be personally bound [restricted] until he has had his day in court,” by which is meant, until he has been duly cited to appear and has been afforded an opportunity to be heard. Judgment without such citation and opportunity lacks all the attributes of a judicial determination; it is judicial usurpation and it is oppressive and can never be upheld where it is fairly administered. A sentence of a court pronounced against a party without hearing him, or giving him an opportunity to be heard, is not a judicial determination of his rights, and is"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"not entitled to respect in any other tribunal. ...Until notice is given the court has no jurisdiction in any case to proceed to judgment, whatever it's authority may be, by the law of it's organization, over the subject-matter. ...that no one shall be personally bound until he has had his day in court... Judgment without such opportunity wants all the attributes of a judicial determination. ...\" The definition here given is apt and suitable as applied to judicial proceedings, which cannot be valid unless they 'proceed upon inquiry', and render judgment only after trial.\" Hovey v. Elliot 167 U.S. 409; State v Strasburg 60 Wash 106, 110 P. 1020; Dennis v Moses 18 Wash 537, 52 P. 333; see also 12 Am. Jur. [1st] Const. Law, §573. When later we discuss tort liability, it is important to understand the 4 th Amendment law of search and seizure. The following court ruling is a cumulative summation, including some of the most reverent search and seizure case studies this writer could delineate. So, without compounding duplicitous rulings, the law of search and seizure is stated thus; The application of the Texas statute to detain appellant and require him to identify himself violated the Fourth Amendment because the officers lacked any reasonable suspicion to believe that appellant was engaged or had engaged in criminal conduct. Detaining appellant to require him to identify himself constituted a seizure of his person subject to the requirement of the Fourth Amendment that the seizure be \"reasonable.\" Cf. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1; United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873. The Fourth Amendment requires that such a seizure be based on specific, objective facts indicating that society's legitimate interests require such action, or that the seizure be carried out pursuant to a plan embodying explicit, neutral limitations on the conduct of individual officers. Delaware v. Prouse 440 U.S. 648. Here, the State does not contend that appellant was stopped pursuant to a practice embodying neutral criteria, and the officers' actions were not justified on the ground that they had a reasonable suspicion, based on objective facts, that he was involved in criminal activity. Absent any basis for suspecting appellant of misconduct, the balance between the public interest in crime prevention and appellant's right to personal* * * security and privacy tilts in favor of freedom from police interference. Brown v. Texas 443 U.S. 47 (1979) The Brown case above exalts the operational dictate that a policy enforcement employee"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"must have at least one of three potentially overlapping minimal criteria; reasonable suspicion, reasonable cause or probable cause. When a policeman stops a traveler on the highway and upon his approach to the automobile, the traveler should inquire of the Policeman his reasonable cause to stop; and the answer he gives should be “reasonably” along the lines of operating a business evidenced by the license attached to the automobile. Second, inquiry as to the “probability” that a violation of some motor vehicle business related statute has occurred; civil or criminal, is irrelevant. When construing this Act, we are guided by the familiar rule of construction stated by this court in United States v. Miller, 303 F.2d 703, 707 (9th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 955, 83 S.Ct. 507, 9 L.Ed.2d 502 (1963), when construing provisions under the previous aviation act (the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938): 'It is axiomatic that any regulation should be construed to effectuate the intent of the enacting body. Such intent may be ascertained by considering the language used and the overall purpose of the regulation, and by reflecting on the practical effect of the possible interpretations.' U.S. v Christensen 419 F.2d 1401 The history of the invasion of the Citizen's Right to use the public highways was not attempted in an outright action, but in a slow, meticulous, calculated encroachment upon the Citizen's Right to travel. \"Disobedience or evasion of a Constitutional Mandate cannot be tolerated, even though such disobedience may, at least temporarily, promote in some respects the best interests of the public.\" Slote vs. Examination , 112 ALR 660 \"Economic necessity cannot justify a disregard of Constitutional guarantee.\" Riley v Carter 79 ALR 1018; 16 Am.

Then there is the issue of public policy . Public policy a.k.a. statute, is just that, public policy, and does not transcend the private. However, if this argument is used, it too must fail, as: \"No public policy of a state can be allowed to override the positive guarantees of the U.S. Constitution.\" 16 Am. Jur. 2nd Const. Law §70 “Statutes that violate the plain and obvious principles of common right and common reason are null and void.” Bennett v. Boggs, 1 Baldwin 60 So even public policy cannot abrogate the Citizen's Right to travel and to use the common highways in the ordinary course of life and business. Therefore, it must be concluded that; \"We have repeatedly held that the legislature may regulate the use of the highways for carrying on business for private gain and that such regulation is a valid exercise of the police power.\" \"The act in question is a valid regulation, and as such is binding upon all who use the highway for the purpose of private gain.\" Northern Pacific R.R. Co. v Schoenfeldt 123 Wash 579, 213 P. 26 It is possible to go on quoting court decision after court decision, but it is not necessary, because the Constitution itself tells us a government cannot legally put restrictions on the rights of the American people at any time, for any reason. Article Six of the U.S. Constitution reads; “This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof;...shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or laws of any State to the Contrary not one word withstanding.\" In the same Article, it says just who within our government are bound by this Supreme Law: “The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution...” The state cannot proceed upon presumption. The presumption that someone allegedly violated some business regulation is based on a presumption that someone was driving as defined by statute. The law against presumption is found in 5 ALR 3d 100 Inference on Inference et seq; The rule that it is not permissible in making a case or proving an issue to draw one presumption based upon another presumption may be found stated in many cases. United States v Ross (1876) 92 US 281, 23 L ed 707; Manning v John Hancock Mut. L. Ins. Co. (1880) 100 US 693, 25 L ed 761; Looney v Metropolitan R. Co. (1906) 200 US 480, 50 Led 564, 26 S Ct 303. The presumption that officials have done their duty is limited by the rule that a presumption cannot be based upon a mere presumption , and will not supply proof of independent, substantive facts, such as that a deficiency judgment was entered and docketed by the clerk of the court.

The state would have absolutely NO control over interstate commerce common carriers if they [State] were not certified to participate in the Federal Motor Carrier Act.

To the extent that this chapter conflicts with general driver licensing provisions, this chapter prevails. Where this chapter is silent, the general driver licensing provisions apply. As shown above and amplified below, again it is declared by the legislature that state statute is to be implicitly factored in relation to federal law. Below we see the use of the term “other laws” which in cludes federal laws, and other state laws through the interstate driver compact at RCW 46.21.010. The viscous use of the phrase 'other laws' or 'all laws' is an inclusive mandate to read statutes in pari materia. This declaration is demonstrated as follows; RCW 46.98.020 Provisions to be construed in pari materia.

The question or statement of harm raises, in a criminal context, the rule of corpus delicti. The rule of corpus delicti demands that the crier show proof that some actual injury has been sustained. So, the question begs, in a criminal traffic prosecution, against the unaware traveler who thinks a license is mandatory, what exactly was the loss incurred by the crier [state]? Immediately there are only two suspect yet undisclosed potential losses: 1) loss of revenue, 2) failure to maintain the business in conformance with state policy mandate; more to the point, corpus delicti, in a legislative context, means an injury malum prohibitum , which means, violation of a legislated policy, i.e. loss of interest; it does not import actual physical loss. The WHOLE ACT RULE"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"and ' EXPRESSIO UNIUS EST EXCLUSIO ALTERIUS ' This chapter is dedicated to the summation that all law supports all law. It does not matter the type of law; commercial, civil, criminal, common, or tort. All law is somehow and somewhere dependent on other forms of law. For instance criminal trespass lends itself to civil tort. Maritime law lends itself to commercial trade. While this writing is prejudice to common law travel, constructive rules of law still apply. The whole act rule is based in part on these two latin maxims of law; Optimus interpretandi modus est sic leges interpretare ut leges legibus accordant The best mode of interpreting laws is to make laws agree with laws. Optima statuti interpretatrix est (omnibus particulis ejusdem inspectis) ipsum stutum The best interpreter of a statute is (when all the separate parts of it have been considered) the statute itself. The basic introduction to the whole act rule is stated thus; Statutes in pari materia must be construed together. Statutes in pari materia are those which relate to the same person or thing, or the same class of persons or things; and in construing a statute, or statutes, all acts relating to the same subject matter of having the same purpose, should be read in connection therewith as together constituting one law. The object of the rule is to ascertain and carry into effect the intent of the legislature, and it proceeds upon the supposition that the several statutes having to do with related subject matters were governed by one spirit or policy , and were intended to be consistent and harmonious in their several parts and provisions. emphasis mine State v Houck 32 Wn 2d 681, (citing State ex rel.

Consequently each part or section should be construed in connection with every other part or section and so as to produce a harmonious whole. It is not proper to confine the attention to the one section to be construed. `It is always an unsafe way of construing a statute or contract to divide it by a process of etymological dissection, into separate words, and then apply to each, thus separated from its context, some particular definition given by lexicographers, and then reconstruct the instrument upon the basis of these definitions.'\" 2 Lewis Sutherland, Statutory Construction (2d ed.), 706, § 368.

The ordinary meaning of these words is a broad one – 'to stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or connection with,' Black's Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979) This passage supports the district court's conclusion that the phrase \"related to\" in the express preemption clause at 49 U.S.C. § 14501(c)(1) should be broadly construed. The Supreme Court's statutory interpretation in Morales also bolsters the proposition that the phrase \"relating to\" in the price preemption exception of 49 U.S.C. § 14501(c)(2)(C) should be construed broadly. The Morales court effectively equated the words \"related to\" and \"relating to,\" even though the phrases were found in different acts, i.e. , the ADA and ERISA. See 504 U.S. at 383-86. Similarly, we should not differentiate these phrases in the ICCTA, especially when they are found in the same statute. It is true Morales construed \"relating to\" with regard to the breadth of preemption, not the breadth of an exception to preemption which is at issue here, but the principle is the same. Morales emphasized that \"statutory intent\" is based on \"'the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose. [Citations omitted.]'\" 504 U.S. at 383. Nothing in the ordinary meaning of language suggests that cognates of \"relate\" have a broad meaning for purposes of preemption but a narrow meaning for purposes of an exception to preemption. Such a construction could only be based on a consideration other than the statutory language itself. In this regard, we note there is a general presumption against preemption of state law.

State ex Rel Port of Seattle v Dept. of Public Service 1 Wn 2d 102 In construing a statute and ascertaining the legislative intent, certain rules are observed by the courts. The legislative intent must be gleaned from a consideration of the whole act by giving effect to the entire statute and every part thereof. Houck supra (citing Lin v. Reid, 114 Wash. 609, 196 Pac. 13; State ex rel. Baisden v. Preston, 151 Wash. 175, 275 Pac. 81; P ease v. Stephens , 173 Wash. 12, 21P. (2d) 294; Arden Fare Co. v. Seattle, 2 Wn. (2d) 640, 99P. (2d) 415; State ex rel. Wilson v. King County, 7Wn. (2d)291.) Language within a statute must be read in context with the entire statute and construed in a manner consistent with the general purposes of the statute. A learned writer has explained: The presumption is that the lawmaker has a definite purpose in every enactment and has adapted and formulated the subsidiary provisions in harmony with that purpose; that these are needful to accomplish it; and that, if that is the intended effect, they will, at least, conduce to effectuate it. That purpose is an implied limitation on the sense of general terms, and a touchstone for the expansion of narrower terms. This intention affords the key to the sense and scope of minor provisions. From this assumption proceeds the general rule that the cardinal purpose or intent of the whole act shall control, and that all the parts be interpreted as subsidiary and harmonious. Wilson v Lund 74 Wn 2d 945. Where the language of a statute is plain, free from ambiguity, and devoid of uncertainty, there is no room for construction because the meaning will be discovered from the wording of the statute itself.

Under this approach, it is appropriate for a court to give, and did the court appeals, a nontechnical statutory term its dictionary meaning.

The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent. State v. Martin , 293 S.C. 46, 358"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"S.E.2d 697 (1987). Typically, legislative intent is determined by applying the words used by the General Assembly in their usual and ordinary significance. Martin v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company , 256 S.C. 577, 183 S.E.2d 451(1971). Resort to subtle or forced construction for the purpose of limiting or expanding the operation of a statute should not be undertaken. Walton v. Walton , 282 S.C. 165, 318 S.E.2d 14 (1984). Courts must apply the clear and unambiguous terms of a statute according to their literal meaning and statutes should be given a reasonable and practical construction which is consistent with the policy and purpose expressed therein. State v. Blackmon , 304 S.C. 270, 403 S.E.2d 660 (1991); Jones v. South Carolina State Highway Department, 247 S.C. 132, 146 S.E.2d 166 (1966). Rules of construction are but guidelines by which to arrive at legislative intent and must be applied with care and with due regard to common sense. A study not only of the rule but the cases applying them and attention to the purpose of Congress, prior tariff acts, background information, and legislative history are important in this area. L.R. Markell et al. v. United States , 16 Ct. Cust. Appls. 518, T.D. 43239 (1929). It is a primary function of the courts to determine legislative intent. United Metal Goods Mfg. Company v. United States, 46 CCPA 120, C.A.D. 712 (1959); United States v. S. H. Kress & Co. , 46 CCPA 135, C.A.D. 716 (1959). The first source for the determination of that intent is the statutory language, which is presumed to be used in its normal sense. United States v. Esso Standard Oil Co. , 42 CCPA 144, 151, C.A.D. 587 (1955); United States v. British Cars & Parts, Inc., et al ., 47 CCPA 114, C.A.D. 741 (1960); John S.

It is the duty of the court to adopt the rule of construction which will give effect to the intention of Congress as ascertained. United States v. American Express Co. , 2 Ct. Cust. Appls. 95, T.D. 31636 (1911). In the presence of ambiguity in a statute, the fact that inconsistent or absurd results may flow from one construction and not another will often lead the court to adopt the latter as most likely expressing the legislative intent. Cohn & Rosenberger v. United States , 4 Ct. Cust. Appls. 378, 383, T.D. 33536 (1913); Spencer-Importing & Trading Co. v. United States, 2 Ct. Cust. Appls. 444, T.D. 32201 (1912). A possible ambiguity in the first part of an act may be resolved when the entire statute is read and considered. Border Brokerage Company v. United States, 27 Cust. Ct. 223, 227-228, C.D. 1375 (1951), aff'd 40 CCPA 185, C.A.D. 515 (1953). It is well-established that in the construction of a statute the intention of the legislature is to be deduced from the whole statute and every material part of the same. The entire context must be considered and every effort made to give full force and effect to all the language contained therein. United States v. Invicta Seeland Inc. , 25 CCPA 300, 305, T.D. 49397 (1938); Dart Export Corp. et al. v. United States, 43 CCPA 64, 74, C.A.D. 610 (1956); United States v.

While it may be, with some coordination of interrelated statutes, reasonably established that a common carrier is any person who transports persons or property for compensation, the subtle illusion comes from the private automobile, which may be used in some instance for monetary gain on the highways. It is contended that the absence of a drivers license was evidential of the operators unfitness to drive a car. We think such evidence was irrelevant and that the rejection was proper. Non observance of the statute, by the [driver], is not evidence of his ability to drive a car. He may have possessed more skill than may persons that held a license... Ross v Penn. R.

It is necessary to turn the clock back forty years and in some instances over one hundred years to establish that the 'incidental use of the highways' language which is the historical legislative authority, regulating commerce, does not transcend the private, until that private is intended to be used commercially. This is exactly the question in considering “narrow” policy construction, whereby inquiring and invoking the “strict scrutiny” rule.

NO! The object rule of substantive “notice” is to be plainly posted for a person of average intelligence to understand. The rule does not provide any latitude for the state to fragment chapters, which clearly have a causal link to the primary intent and purpose of the regulation, which would tend to force an affected person not to suspect that there are volumes more relevant and pertinent information on the requirements of a “driver” license. In considering the “offer and acceptance” practice that is the fundamental basis of commerce, when the state proffers a claim a.k.a. charge, civil or criminal, it is the states burden of proof, to show that in fact their was a commercial act to effect their claim. If the state, in their enforcement proceedings, cannot show commercially, that personal affairs falls within the reach of the questioned policy, the policy does not provide notice of whether or not private conduct falls within the prescript of the legislative intent. The state is equally bridled with, in consideration of the foregoing paragraph, the burden of showing that there was an attempted solicitation to “hire” out. As a general rule of construction, the plain language of the statute will prevail in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.[4] Only when the meaning of the language is unclear will the court resort to the recitals in or title of a statute to ascertain the intent of the Legislature.[5] However, it is a fundamental principle that statutes should be construed to effectuate the Legislature's intent.

Because the statute [RCW 46.20 et seq] as written, clearly uses the term motor vehicle but does not imply private travel. To narrowly construe the statute, the term vehicle should be defined. We know what the legal definition of vehicle is, but it is equally important that the natural language definition of vehicle is understood for translation from natural language to legal language, the natural language definition is “medium ─ means of conveyance”. When one speaks legally, the term 'convey' by any extension, means to transfer property from one place or person to another place or person. But when the statute impinged on the common law, that is, legislation was in derogation of the common law, the courts could narrowly interpret the statute by appealing to the canon of interpretation that such statutes should be narrowly construed.

Because we cannot add words or clauses to an unambiguous statute, we are prohibited from reading into the statute \"civil actions.\" Thus, we presume that the legislature intended to exclude \"civil actions\" from RCW 10.31.040.

If an individual has a driver license or a vehicle business license, enforcement is not arbitrary. However, if one did not have either license and declared oneself to be a private traveler or common law traveler, then any enforcement is arbitrary and may raise tort liability to the individual policeman. It is, by reading the current driver license statute and even the current vehicle license statute, exceedingly simple to fall into the business trap set by the legislature, whereby the common law right to free travel “falls within the scope of regulation”. It was stated thus; “A regulatory statute does not violate substantive due process unless constitutionally protected activity falls within its scope. The permissible scope of a legislative regulation depends upon an evaluation of the governmental interest promoted versus the degree and reasonableness of the intrusion on individual rights.” (cite omitted) “A regulatory statute is not so vague as to violate procedural due process protections unless it does not give fair notice to citizens of the conduct subject to regulation or does not contain clear standards to prevent arbitrary enforcement.“ (cite omitted) Referencing the above quote, and considering RCW 46.20, give attention to the use of the phrases; governmental interest, fair notice, subject to regulation, clear standards to prevent arbitrary enforcement. Ask these questions...;  Does the current statute give fair notice of the intent of the statute?  Does the current statute give fair notice of the subject regulation?  Does the current statute give fair notice of preventative restrictions that a policy enforcement employee would trespass against private travels, and arbitrarily enforce public business standards?"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" Does the current statute provide notice of the states competing or compelling interest?

The special commercial motor vehicle provisions of 46.25 trump and prevail over the general license proviso of 46.20. That is proof positive that all licenses are in fact commercial! The following case law is introduced to influence thought as to the entire application of the motor vehicle act. The following case is a good example for a criminal traffic infraction; can a person be charged with, for instance, driving under the influence, while traveling privately? NO. WHY? Initially, because the rule of preemption dictates that federal statute prevails. That is important here because federal statute only regulates commerce. Secondly, state statute has already admitted to be predicated on the federal statute. Thirdly, as and for commercial consideration, with respect to the rule of lenity, and the following rule of severability, the DUI and DWI statutes were passed subsequent to the initial licensing act; so, speaking to these rules means that, according to the rule of lenity, to strictly construe a DUI statute is to make it only applicable to drivers of businesses, thusly, to the rule of severability below, if were able to delete from the states police power and regulation the licensing provisions, would then the state have the ability to charge a person with a DWI under motor vehicle laws? No. It also runs counter to the constitutional requirement that the prosecution must prove every element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Winship , 397 U.S. 358, 363, 90 S.

The U.S. Supreme Court phrase “The Equal Protection Clause requires more of a state law than nondiscriminatory application within the class it establishes” stated in the case below, when placed juxtapose the Washington legislature’s own language; “It is intended that this 1965 amendatory act be liberally construed to effectuate the purpose of improving the safety of our highways through driver licensing procedures within the framework of the traditional freedoms to which every motorist is entitled ”[SB 334(1965)]; galvanizes the utilitarian aspect of highways, as secondary to the primary private use classification. Yet the fact that all those not benefited by the challenged exemption are treated equally has no bearing on the legitimacy of that classification in the first place. A state cannot deflect an equal protection challenge by observing that in light of the statutory classification all those within the burdened class are similarly situated.

What Washington statutes have done is to dilute the clarity of express language, appealing to the supposed necessity of the “driver license\", and has concealed the concept of the free and unmolested use of the highways by the general public, and openly enforced, by statute, the highways only as a place of business, bootstrapping the governments alleged compelling interest to regulate travel.

The application must show: (1) Name and address of the owner of the vehicle. _____________ (2) Trade name of the vehicle, the model, year, type of body, factory number and motor number thereof. (3) The power to be used, whether electric, steam, gas or other power. (4) The purpose for which said vehicle is to be used and the nature of the license required. (5) The rated carrying capacity of such vehicle, which in cases of auto for hire, auto stages or auto stage trailers shall be the adult seating capacity thereof and in cases of motor trucks or trailers shall be the rated capacity load as given by the manufacturer ... In 1923, the legislature, once again makes a published admission that there is a separate and distinct difference between those who operate motor vehicles as a business on the public highways and the common traveler. In one enactment the legislature has distinguished vehicle, motor vehicle and other. SESSION LAWS, 1923, CHAPTER 122, [S. B. 267.] MOTOR VEHICLES. An Act relating to the operation of vehicles and the use of public highways , providing for the licensing of persons operating motor vehicles , providing for the enforcement thereof and all other highway and motor vehicle laws and prescribing penalties for violations thereof; and amending Section 234-22 of Pierce’s Code, and adding a new section. emphasis mine Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Washington: SEC. 2. That a new section be added to Sec. 234-22 of Pierce’s Code, to be known and designated as Sec. 234-22-a, to read as follows: Sec. 234-22-a. It shall be unlawful for any person to drive a motor vehicle in a reckless manner over and along the public highways of this state. For the purpose of this section, to drive in a reckless manner shall be construed to mean the operation of a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this state in such a manner as to endanger or inconvenience unnecessarily other users of such highway . Any person found"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"guilty of a violation, of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and the court may in his discretion suspend the operator’s license for a period of time not to exceed six months.   emphasis mine By 1937, motorized automobiles had been around for near thirty year. So, what is the difference though between an automobile, a vehicle, and a motor vehicle? As it is defined by federal law, a motor vehicle is, while not distinguishing types, a publicly available commercially applied vehicle. A vehicle however is a private not for public use vehicle. Although a private vehicle is still commercially engaged because it is employed in the private business sector. This distinction was clarified by the Washington State legislature as follows; SESSION LAWS, 1937 [CH. 188.] SEC. 29. ...The application must show: (2) Trade name of the vehicle , model, year, type of body, the motor number thereof if such vehicle be a motor vehicle , or the serial number thereof if such vehicle be a trailer ;  emphasis mine"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"TAXATION The exertion of power used in the case of private travel cannot, however, be the power of taxation since an attempt to levy a tax upon a Right would be open to Constitutional objection. A state may not levy a tax or fee on the exercise of a protected Right; a Right that may be taxed is not a Right but a mere privilege. “Each law relating to the use of police power must ask three questions: 1. \"Is there threatened danger? 2. Does a regulation involve a Constitutional Right? 3. Is this regulation reasonable?\" People v Smith 108 Am. St. Rep. 715; To the first, as discussed earlier herein, the term “threatened danger” requires the state to show a compelling interest. That compelling interest has been considered by the courts and they have determined that businesses whom spend, in all probability, the better part of a business day on the highways are more of a threat than those who infrequently occasion the roads for quick trips to a market. \"The automobile is not inherently dangerous.\" Cohen & Others v Meador 119 Va 429, 89 SE 876; Blair v Broadmore 93 SE 532 “We do not believe that the automobile can be placed in the same category as locomotives, gun powder, dynamite and similarly dangerous machines and agencies. It is true that the operation of these machines is attended with some danger not common to the use of ordinary vehicles and we believe and have already held that those who operate these machines must be held to that degree of care which is commensurate with the dangers naturally incident to their use.” Jones v Hoge 47 Wash 663, 92 Pac 433"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Next, does the regulation involve a Constitutional Right ? The Right to travel freely is a liberty interest. While personal private travel is a separate liberty interest from the driver license, the driver license none the less remains a property interest of which a person may not be deprived without due process of law, see Bell v Burson 402 US 535 (1971), also Goldberg v Kelly 397 US 254 (1970). \"If the Right of passing through a state by a Citizen of the United States is one guaranteed by the Constitution, it must be sacred from state taxation.\" ...further, \"... It may be said that a tax of one dollar for passing through the state cannot sensibly affect any function of government or deprive a Citizen of any valuable Right. But if a state can tax ... a passenger of one dollar, it can tax him a thousand dollars.\" Crandall v Nevada 6 Wall 35 Indeed, the very purpose of constraining the state to comply with the limitations of the Constitution was to protect the rights of the people from intrusion, particularly by the forces of government. So, we can see that any attempt by the legislature to convert the act of using the public highways as a matter of Right into a granted privilege crime, is void upon its face. \"The state cannot diminish Rights of the people.\" Hurtado v California 110 US 516; see also Miller , supra; Sherar , supra We know that taxes are of two varieties, direct and indirect. A direct tax is notoriously either a strict percentage or a flat rate, and applied to a specific (tangible) thing or group. An indirect tax is applicable to a thing or class which tends to be passive in nature. The excise tax paid to renew the tabs on a vehicle business is a quasi-direct tax on the vehicle itself but indirect in nature, as to the business it purports to represent."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"“One invariable limitation upon the power of taxation is that it must always be exercised for the benefit of the public. * * * Whether or not a particular purpose of taxation is a ‘public’ purpose, is a question which must be determined, in the first instance, by the legislature.

Among the purposes “unquestionably ‘public’ in every proper sense of the term” the author last quoted (p.340), mentions “the construction, repair, and improvement of public roads including highways, turn pikes, and paved streets in cities.” See also Cooley on Taxation 3d Ed., p. .182. Lowell v.

Certainly if the state can prosecute, either civilly or criminally, the motor vehicle act against an individual, it must be then, that quarterly B&O and sales taxes are due to the Dept. of Revenue. “[taxation]assumes the legality of the business for any who may choose to pursue it, but imposes a burden for the public benefit upon those engaged in it. ...A license law, assumes the illegality of the business and denounces penalties upon those who pursue it without previously protecting themselves by procuring a license. ...Hence it follows that any law which requires certain acts other than the mere payment of the tax, to be done by the party as a prerequisite to his right to enter upon the pursuit * * * and makes it a penal offense to engage in the business without such formalities, is in reality a license law, no matter whether it be called a tax or by any other name.” The Law Applied To Motor Vehicles.

Everything basic, needed to understand the right of travel, the privilege of commerce, and authority of state control, is contained in these first three paragraphs. And the reason why the use has always been held a public one is that such a road is a highway, whether made by the government itself, or by the agency of corporate bodies, or even by individuals, when they obtain their power to construct it from legislative grant. ... Whether the use of a railroad is a public or a private one, depends in no measure upon the question who constructed it or who owns it. It has never been considered a matter of any importance that the road was built by the agency of a private corporation. No matter who is the agent, the function performed is that of the state. Though the ownership is private, the use is public. . . . The owners may be private companies, but they are compellable to permit the public to use their works in the manner in which such works can be used. That all persons may not put their own cars upon the road, and use their own motive power, has no bearing upon the question whether the road is a public highway. It bears only upon the mode of use, of which the legislature is the exclusive judge.’ \"All public highways are subjects of general state jurisdiction, because their uses are the common property of the public. This principle of the common law is in this state of universal application. As to the class of public highways known as railroads, the common law is fortified by the express conditions of the statutes creating or regulating or controlling them. further, On other public highways every person may be his own carrier; or he may hire whomsoever he will to do that service. Between him and such employee a special and personal relation exists, independent of any public duty, and in which the state has no interest.

Co. 28 Hun, 543"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"\"This brings us to inquire as to the principles upon which this power of regulation rests, in order that we may determine what is within and what without its operative effect. Looking, then, to the common, law, from whence came the right which the Constitution protects, we find that when private property is ‘affected with a public interest, it ceases to be juris privati only.’ This was said by Lord Chief Justice Hale more than two hundred years ago, in his treatise De Portibus Maris , 1 Harg. L. Tr., 78, and has been accepted without objection as an essential element in the law of property ever since. Property does become clothed with a public interest when used in a manner to make it of public consequence, and affect the community at large. When, therefore, one devotes his property to a use in which the public has an interest, he, in effect, grants to the public an interest in that use, and must submit to be controlled by the public for the common good, to the extent of the interest he has thus created. He may withdraw his grant by discontinuing the use; but, so long as he maintains the use, he must submit to the control. Thus, as to ferries, Lord Hale says, in his treatise De Jure Maris , 1 Harg. L. Tr. 6, the King has “A right of franchise or privilege, that no man may set up a common ferry for all passengers, without a prescription time out of mind, or a charter from the King. He may make a ferry for his own use or the use of his family, but not for the common use of all the King’s subjects passing that way; because it doth in consequence tend to a common charge, and is become a thing of public interest and use, and every man for his passage pays a toll, which is a common charge, and every ferry ought to be under a public regulation, viz.: that it give attendance at due times, keep a boat in due order, and take but reasonable toll; for if he fail in these he is finable.” So if one owns the soil and landing-places on both banks of a stream, he cannot use them for the purposes of a public ferry, except upon such terms and conditions as the body politic may from time to time impose; and this because the common good requires that all public ways shall be under the control of the pub1ic authorities. This privilege or prerogative of the King, who in this connection only represents and gives another name to the body politic, is not primarily for his profit, but for the protection of the people and the promotion of the general welfare. This statement of the law by Lord Hale was cited with approbation and acted upon by Lord Kenyon at the beginning of the present century, [1800] in Bolt v Stennett , 8 T.R., 606.

The United States Supreme Court has laid down the following as one of the guiding principles in the interpretation of statutes: \"Even in construing the terms of a statute, courts must take notice of the history of legislation, and out of different possible constructions, select and apply the one that best comports with the genius of our institutions and is therefore most likely to have been the construction intended by the law-making power. “The history of legislation,” as set forth in the preceding pages, seems to make it clear, that attempts to control the contractual freedom of persons engaged in trade and commerce have been found unwise and pernicious. The “genius of our institutions” is overwhelmingly in favor of emancipation from all restrictions on complete contractual freedom—in private employments. In public employments— wise jurists and wise legislators are well agreed, that the individual citizen must have all needful protection at the hands of the State. But what are we to say of the latest attempt at State control of trade and commerce, in private employments? STATE CONTROL OF TRADE AND COMMERCE BY NATIONAL OR STATE AUTHORITY, c1897 [a book] BY ALBERT STICKNEY OF THE NEW YORK BAR citing; Texas & Pac. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission , 162 U. S. 197, 218. There are many judicial rulings both at the state and federal level, which will indicate that a driver license is not a contract. The application for a driver license does not create a contract, neither does the possession of the driver license; IT IS however, an application for permission to engage in offering a public service as a driver, to a publicly oriented business, whether that be for a business outright or a business colorable. It is now undoubtedly and without dispute that to be driving is to be either an employee or a subcontractor or in some instances a sublet. The vehicle operator is the employer/contractor, which creates the contract ; while the driver is the employee/subcontractor/sublet. Let’s use tow trucks, taxi cabs, and moving company's for reference because they are, the three most well known forms of vehicles that transport persons and property for compensation. Each of the three operators usually has a fleet of vehicles a.k.a. motor vehicles, which are owned by typically one company, the employer/contractor. Each of the three operators either lease the"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"vehicle/motor vehicle to subcontract drivers or are driven by employees. There are a variety of factors which determine that relationship. ONE – the operator owns the vehicle and hires [employee] drivers to execute the business transaction with the public. TWO – the operator owns the vehicle but leases it to a subcontract driver assigning an element of risk and a de facto benefit to the driver whereby the subcontract driver would have to insure the vehicle to protect the operators interest. The two examples above should not be considered exhaustive or limiting to establish the relationship. With and for the purpose of this discussion, below is established plausibility for both. Starting with the Constitution of the State of Washington. The state constitution is tantamount to the magna carte, which is, simply stated, a charter. Const. Art. I DECLARATION OF RIGHTS §16 EMINENT DOMAIN. ...No private property shall be taken or damaged for public or private use without just compensation having been first made, ...Whenever an attempt is made to take private property for a use alleged to be public, the question whether the contemplated use be really public shall be a judicial question, and determined as such, without regard to any legislative assertion that the use is public: ... . Const. Art. XII CORPORATIONS OTHER THAN MUNICIPAL §1 CORPORATIONS HOW FORMED. ...all corporations doing business in this state may, as to such business, be regulated, limited or restrained by law. §10 EMINENT DOMAIN AFFECTING. The exercise of the right of eminent domain shall never be so abridged or construed as to prevent the legislature from taking the property and franchises of incorporated companies, and subjecting them to public use the same as the property of individuals. §13 COMMON CARRIERS, REGULATION OF. All railroad, canal and other transportation companies are declared to be common carriers and subject to legislative control . (...) §18 RATES FOR TRANSPORTATION. The legislature may pass laws establishing reasonable rates of charges for the transportation of passengers and freight, and to correct abuses and prevent discrimination and extortion in the rates of freight and passenger tariffs on the different railroads and other common carriers in the state, and shall enforce such"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"laws by adequate penalties. A railroad and transportation commission may be established and its powers and duties fully defined by law. A service is said to be performed when one takes to perform a task or duty for which there is no instruction, guidance or assistance from the party receiving the benefit of said service. However, a service may still be performed if the parties agree that the beneficial party assumes some portion of the risk for consideration. In the case of the taxi and tow truck company, they provide a service and therefore provide the driver. That driver may be either a subcontractor or an employee depending on their agreement. In the case of the moving company, they hold out their business to the public, but they are considered a private contract carrier because they provide a private service and do not hold open their business for the general public at large as would a bus company or ferry service. Moreover, the moving company may provide a driver, his employee, or it may sublet the vehicle and allow the sublet to drive the vehicle or their hired driver. The moving company, like the car rental service below, would agree to sub[let] contract to a person in consideration of a reduced fee for the interest. If a person rents a vehicle from a car rental service company, he will be required to sign a contract agreement to provide a driver, or at a minimum have a driver license (which is the same thing); likewise signing a contract to provide the lessor with his insurance company information or purchase insurance from their insurance provider. If a person provides insurance and a driver he is a sub[let] contractor. If, however, a person purchases the service fully at the lessors proviso then he is merely contracting a service from a private carrier. While the question of contract as to a driver license is settled law, it remains a clever focus of clandestine artifice. The vehicle license actually created a contract, because it is the business. The term contract means to come together and make as agreement; assimilate. To say that one agrees to be bound by the motor vehicle code can be established merely by asking if there are license plates on the vehicle. Here’s why; the individual consented to convey the property (the automobile) to state (legislative) control.

All political power is inherent in the people, and governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed... On the idea of consent, the legal maxim of law is stated thus; Non potest rex subditum renitentem onerare impositionibus; meaning-The king cannot load a subject with impositions against his consent. When an individual voluntarily registers an automobile with the state, he has consented and given a security interest to the state. This can be verified by looking to UCC Chapter 9. The state now has a perfected security interest in the vehicle by issuance of a certificated title of ownership. See, inter alia, UCC 9 et seq. Ownership by corporate standard means only a secured interest. To say governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed is in fact a contract agreement. To further expound this statement, is to look to the following definition; The phrase \"valuable and adequate consideration,\" used in Act Cong. June 30, 1864, c. 173, §132, declaring that if any person shall by deed of gift or other assurance of title made without valuable and adequate consideration, and purporting to vest the estate, either immediately or in the future, convey any real estate, such disposition shall be taken to confer upon the grantee the succession, means either money paid or some present legal interest or estate parted with or charged, or services rendered, to the value of the property received.

As seen below, defined in law, valuable consideration consists of any thing that has value; accordingly everything is assigned value. That does not mean everything has a monetary value, only that some value attaches; for example sentimental value.

( cites omitted ) \"A valuable consideration is one that is either a benefit to the party promising, or some trouble or prejudice to the party to whom the promise is made.

Homan v. Steele, 26 N.

As much may be inferred from the word \"consideration\" as from the word \"value.\" Jackson v. Alexander (N. Y.) 3 Johns. 484, 489, 3 Am. Dec. 517. A \"valuable consideration\" means, and necessarily requires, under every form and kind of purchase, something of actual value, capable, in the estimation of the law, of pecuniary measurement; parting with money or money's worth, or an actual change of the purchaser's legal position for the worse.

It is also called simply \"value,\" ( cites omitted ) In the dissection of constitutional provisions, remember, the people went to them and applied, the state did not come to the people. The state did not per se take the private property. Const. Art. I §16 EMINENT DOMAIN.

We must read the charter colorably. Why? Because the charter tells us the state only attempted ; this is because they threatened statutory sanction and we consented to “fear of the unknown”. The charter also tells us for a use “ alleged ” to be public. See also the section on use of the highway earlier. The question of use is to be judicially determined. However §16 read literally, says, if there is a dispute as to whether the use was public or not, the judiciary shall resolve the dispute; PROVIDED THAT the question is “determined [ as such ] to be public”, regardless of legislative intent.

The term taking used in §10 below, more to the point, declares that equal protection of the law applies to big business which requires an extensive easement across private and/or public land, as is the case of the railway, and shall not be given prejudicial deference over small business, requiring a similar easement. Const. Art. XII §10 EMINENT DOMAIN AFFECTING. The exercise of the right of eminent domain shall never be so abridged or construed as to prevent the legislature from taking the property and franchises of incorporated companies, and subjecting them to public use the same as the property of individuals. For the same reason that doctors, dentists and daycares provide the street address of the buildings where they have their business practice, is why the vehicle is registered, the license plates perpetrate an address for the place of business. If the doctor, dentist or daycare attempted to practice without a license the state would have authority to injunct the premises to prevent further unlicensed practice. While the vehicle [business] has the good fortune of being mobile the state would likely seize the vehicle to prevent unlicensed practice; unless, and with prejudicial discretion on the part of the policy enforcement officer, a licensed driver were to take control of"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"the vehicle. It is not such a reach to suggest that a person, however subtle, may be transporting state persons and state property, for the state, in the interest of community proliferation, exercising and thusly stimulating the economy, for which the state has mutually benefited from a persons travels, having at a minimum collected sales taxes from a myriad purchases from other merchants, now have the expectant obligation to report to the Internal Revenue Service the cash value of those travels as income to the state. Possession of a driver license and a vehicle business license is regulated by a legislative grant of authority under the constitution. The charter gives the legislature authority to regulate “all...other transportation companies”. Vehicles and motor vehicles are, by license, transporters of persons and property, which makes them a common carrier. §13 COMMON CARRIERS, REGULATION OF. All ... other transportation companies are declared to be common carriers... The Congress of the United States and the State Legislature proliferate the dichotomy of inter state and intra state commerce by qualifying and distinguishing purpose and capacity. For instance there are three major divisions of carrier; common, contract and private. Common carriers deal almost entirely with quantum mass public movement; trains ─ of any size or rail, buses, trams and ferries. Contract carriers are transfuse, meaning they can either transport, by contract, a large shipment for a common carrier or a smaller shipment for a private carrier; i.e. moving companies and postal shipping companies. Contract carriers operate for the public benefit by way of private contract. Both common and contract carriers are predominately classified by axle weight, tonnage or prejudice of easement, as of railways or water borne vessels. The private [for hire] carrier is as diverse as it is transfuse. The private carrier is of two calibers: those carrying greater than sixteen passengers and/or 26,001 .lbs, versus those carrying less than those limits. Here the classification being lesser axle weight and/or lesser passenger capacity, the automobile “bottom feeds” on the smaller contracts of the larger counterpart, but"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"still is able to bill itself as a publicly offered common carrier. These types of vehicles are pick-up trucks and small panel trucks and anything from a subcompact two door sedan to a stretch limousine. Tow trucks, taxis, ambulances, postal trucks, ice cream trucks, milk trucks, police cars, dial-a-ride taxis, and plumber trucks. All of these vehicles use the highways as a place of business. It seems obtusely obvious to say that these vehicle businesses could not exist without the highways, because they transport persons and or property upon a public road and they get paid to do it . When taking into consideration the definition of commerce, from com - \"together\" + merx \"merchandise\"; look around while commuting on the roads and visualize the highway as a side walk “marketplace” not unlike the Pike Place Market, with all the vehicle businesses lined up booth to booth to booth, conducting a business hawking their wares. More succinctly the roadways are governed because of the vascular “connectivity”. That is to say that commerce itself, the act of exchange and trade, is done privately, on private property, in private buildings, on private phones. It is “transportation”, after the fact, when the “goods” or “commodities” need to be exchanged, that requires delivery to the purchaser. That delivery, requiring space on the roadways, is incidental to the normal use."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"DRIVING Now as shown infra, the legislature has clearly outlined the parameters of driving as that which is commercial by common carrier, private carrier and private for hire. What is of importance is the type of use. Personal use of the roads does not occasion the need for a license. The legislative body acknowledged a right to beg that does not rise to the level of \"aggressive solicitation,\" or it would have proscribed begging altogether. By expressly proscribing one type of solicitation, the ordinance implicitly allows other types not otherwise proscribed. See State v. Delgado 148 Wn 2d 723, 729, 63 P.3d 792 (2003) (\"'Under expressio unius est exclusio alterius, a canon of statutory construction, to express one thing in a statute implies the exclusion of the other.' \" quoting In re Det. of Williams, 147 Wn 2d 476, 491, 55 P.3d 597 ) City of Spokane v.

The term \" driver \" is a contradistinction to \" traveler ,\" as defined. Therefore, one who uses the road in the ordinary course of life and business, for the purpose of travel, is a traveler. The term “ for hire ” is a rhetorical term, and is defined as a person who holds himself out for payment of a fee or fare in exchange for transfer of some others property or passenger."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Considering the eristic poignancy of this writing, let’s review the charge of DWI. Of the many court room arguments that litigants get into, then relying on judicial discretion for resolve; the argument of “I‘m not a driver” or “I wasn’t driving”, may come up so then the judge would have to consider the definition of driver. Remember though, the judge will always (saving grievous error) favor the state. So, according to the ruling below, in order to actually convict for driving under the influence, it must be established that a person was actually driving . (if one has a license, the presumption is in fact, that one was driving). When analyzing the concept of misconduct, the trier of fact must consider the legal definition in context with the factual circumstances surrounding the conduct at issue.

At that though they usually will divert attention to some other question of fact or law. As much as driving is an element of a statute crime, in arguing civil and criminal litigation, there is almost always more than one issue raised on appeal, and the courts will not address the driving v traveling issue when given another option. Due process requires that the prosecution prove each element of a crime. In re Winship , 397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970).

U.S. v Shive 20 Fed. Dig. 439, Fed. Cas. No.16278, Bald. 510 (1832) As is indicated in definitions at RCW 46.20.040, drive and operate shall mean the same thi ng: to be in actual physical control of a motor vehicle; except that it is shown conclusively herein that driving is not operating. The statutes of the State of Kansas read near word for word identical to Washington statutes; so it was stated in State of Kansas v Kendall 274 Kan. 1003, 58 P.3d 660, that the action of physical control of a motor vehicle is therefore transportation, and therefore the basis of commercial activity. Kansas statutes of 1999. We know that transportation of persons or property is a commercial activity. While the term property is restricted to tangible physical items, to which possession is claimed by title, contract or receipt (bill of sale-bill of lading). The term person is a more broad term and in the transportation of persons the term may be expressed as a rider, quest, or passenger. No matter which phrase is used, or the calibre of vehicle, be it public or private, to transport a person means there is the axiomatic payment for such carriage. A rider does not always pay a fare, in the case of a driver trainee, or husband and wife long haulers, or taking a cameraman along to film an activity, whereby one does the driving and the others presence is merely migratory. Contrastly a rider may pay a fare as a second or third party in a taxi where the initial fare is borne at a stipulated rate or mileage, and the second and/or third passengers pay a “surcharge” as it were, for carriage, having created additional transcendental wear and tear on the vehicle. The term guest is similar to that of rider having much of the same attributes, but moreover is someone who was invited, and as such is a mere invitee. Guests are incidental to businesses that hold their doors open to the public, but the presence of the guest could be non- commercial. A fee charged for service is borne to the user and the guest is welcome at the invitation of the user when the user has paid a bulk rate, as it were, for the service. The term guest is appropriate, when the demand for fare is discretionary, and contingent on the intended"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"use. For instance, a hotel charges a rate for guests who would use a room for staying the night; a hotel would not however charge a fee to a guest who was attending a conference in a hall. As it relates to the highways, a person may hire the services of a limousine company (the operator) and the limousine company would provide a driver, and for that fee, the limousine would take any number of persons on an excursion. Only one person paid the fare and all other riders are guests. The term passenger is quantitatively similar to each of the definitions above for each of the stated reasons. The term passenger is derived from passage; a passenger in a vehicle is one having right of passage upon payment of fare. It is argumentative to say that the actual passenger paid the fare, more certainly because a passenger could have received the right of passage from a third person who paid the fare but is not the passenger. The term passenger ordinarily imports some contractual relation between the parties. Long v Archer et al 221 Ind.186, 46 NE 2d 818; citing; Gale v Wilber 163 Va. 211, 175 SE 739; Bushouse v Brom 297 Mich 616, 298 NW 303 There is involved here, not a common, but rather a gratuitous, carrier. The legal definition of \"passenger\" is two fold. Many definitions may be found for this relationship between the one conveyed and the conveyor. Facts always control in an individual case. When speaking generally upon the subject of common carriers, this court said, in Weber v Chicago, R.I.&P.R. Co. 175 Iowa 358, 151 NW 852. It is not easy to state a general rule, nor to give a definition of the word 'passenger' which would embrace all the essential elements. As said in 2 Hutchinson on Carriers (3rd Ed.), Sec. 997: 'The one usually accepted by the courts, when a definition has been attempted, is that a passenger is \"one who travels in some public conveyance by virtue of a contract, express or implied, with the carrier, as the payment of fare, or that which is accepted as equivalent therefore.\" This definition, however, like all others, is hardly comprehensive enough; for, as a general rule, every person not an employee, being carried with the express or implied consent of the carrier upon a public conveyance usually employed in the carriage of passengers, is presumed to be lawfully upon it as a passenger: First, an undertaking on the part of the person to travel in the conveyance provided by the carrier; and second, an acceptance by the carrier of the person as a passenger. Whether either or both of these elements exist is ordinarily a question for the jury.    Pucket v Pailthorpe 207 Iowa 613, 223 NW 254"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Persons who drive are drivers. So, what is it to drive or be a driver, or do the driving? Firstly, we recall the definition of driver, as being one who is employed, in Bouviers and Blacks Law dictionaries. To expound on that definition the following rulings make clear that drivers and driving is strictly a commercial venture and does not apply to all who use the public roadways. For instance, in the Transportation Law Journal, 27 Trans. LJ 113 (2000), there is lengthy discussion about for hire conduct of taxi cab driver/owners. For purposes of this record, the following excerpts were found to be expositive of the nature of a driver license; \"...the condition of vehicles used as taxi cabs; ...the chauffeurs operating taxi cabs; ...the companies providing taxi cab service.\" The journal article is replete with use of the term(s): taxicab chauffeurs, taxicab license owners, owner/driver taxicab drivers, taxicab drivers, taxicab license holder. It should be stated that while a license to operate a taxicab business is distinct from the license to physically drive the vehicle, there is the axiomatic relationship of owner/driver. The journal article also references, sub silencio, the Florida statute which calls for what is termed a \"for hire license\". The distinctions between owner and driver are discussed further at Wallace v Woods infra. The above journal review is an overtly expositive narrative of how cab drivers may or may not own their own vehicles but would stand to make more money in the exercise of their trade if they did in fact own their vehicles, and were therefore owner/operator, instead of merely employees, then paying the business operator for the use of the vehicle. The journal also discusses the intrinsic relationship of the government then having authority to regulate the business of both the operator and the driver. The most revealing statement of the journal narrative (27 Trans. LJ 113) is stated thus; \"Anyone who owned an automobile could provide taxicab service.\" It is the forgoing quote from the journal that raises, the most litigious concern, the \" presumption \". This presumption is the basis for the police to stop the unsuspecting motorist and issue a traffic infraction and more significantly reproach the general traveling public with the"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"entirety of title 46 RCW here in Washington. It is important to recognize when there is discussion of private carriers we see the term 'vehicle', when there is discussion of common carriers and contract carriers we see the phrase 'motor vehicle'. This is congruent with the federal definitions of motor vehicles and the context of common carriers. Highlighting the discussion in 27 Trans. LJ 113 above, we look to the following cases; Howards Yellow Cabs Inc. v UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 987 F. Supp. 469, 97-2 U.S. Tax Cas.(CCH) P50, 694 (1997); and J&J Cab Service Inc. v UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 98-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) P50, 360. Both cases involve cab company operators . In Howard's , the following language is used by the court (see similarly, dictum at J&J Cab Service ); As found by the magistrate judge, the facts are as follows: ...that the drivers collected money from the cash paying riders; that [plaintiff] gave the drivers “credit” for any contract riders whom they transported; that the drivers “settled up” with the dispatcher by giving him 50% of the money collected from the cash paying riders when such amounts exceeded the amounts due the drivers for the contract riders which they had transported; The Howard court citing Manchester Music Co . v . US , 733 F . Supp . 473 , stated at footnotes; “a payment occurs with the transfer of possession, dominion, or control over money or its equivalent from a person who up to that point had been exercising such prerogatives over the same to another who is due the funds.” The previous citations describe the use of a vehicle, driving the public “for hire”. Below is the description of the use of a private vehicle not for hire yet with the employ of a driver none the less. In the case of Ford Motor Co. v Stella D. Madden et al, 987 F. Supp. 469, there is the distinctive act of driving a vehicle at the direction of an employer because the employer had control of the vehicle. The driver was an employee of Ford Motor Co. and thusly, subsequently, remunerated by a private party to drive vehicles for the purpose of attesting as to the vehicle marketability. In this case, the dealership operated the vehicle although someone else drove it."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"An operator is defined as one who has actual physical control over a vehicle or a motor vehicle. Operating a vehicle is also defined as one who facilitates or augments the movements of the vehicle. In the two preceding cases, the cab company 'operated' the vehicles because they had the authority and/or the ability, to determine when and where the drivers would pick up and deliver or transport passengers to and from. A license to carry on a business or trade is an official permit to carry on the same or perform other acts forbidden by law except to persons obtaining such permit. Hoefling v. City of San Antonio , 85 Ten. 228, 20 S.W. 85, 16 L. R. A. 608. In some cases it is held that where a license is for the protection of the public and to prevent improper persons from engaging in a particular business, and the license is for revenue merely, a contract made by an unlicensed person in violation of an act is void; Bowdre v. Carter , 64 Miss. 221, 1 South. 162; 4 C. B. N. S. 405; Johnson v. Hulings , 103 Pa. 501, 49 Am. Rep. 131; Hustis v. Pickands , 27 Ill. App. 270.

In the regulation of occupations harmful to the public, it is constitutional to require those who apply for a license to pay a reasonable sum to defray the expense of issuing the license and maintaining the Proper supervision. What is a reasonable sum must be determined by the facts of each case; but where it is a plain case of police regulation, the courts are not compelled to be too exact in determining the expense of regulation and supervision, so long as the sum demanded is not altogether unreasonable; Tied.

There is a very distinctly separate function between driving and operating not excepting that the operator could be the driver. It may be easier to understand operator in the context of navigator. When racing cigarette boats and sand rails, there is a driver and a navigator. One person drives, by depressing the accelerator and the brake and turning the steering wheel, and the other person manipulates the vehicle by coordinating and directing its destination. Or, in the case of the hydroplane and stock car, there obviously, is a driver, but the pit crew is the operator because the pit mechanic controls the changing of tires, foils and windshields and has the ultimate responsibility to determine the serviceability of the vehicle and, therefore, determine if it is in an operable condition. However, a driver can be the operator if the vehicle is maintained, navigated, and driven by one individual, as in the case of a sole proprietor business. Another example of driver/operator is N.A.S.A., National Aeronautics and Space Agency. Yes, flying constitutes driving by federal definition of law. The flight crew drives the shuttle to the moon, while the control center “operates” the shuttle by monitoring critical functions and navigation. The Howard's court above, also established the fact that: The “drivers...had personal use of the cabs during the day.” An empowering correlation to Howard's above, are the cases of City of Chicago v Gall 195 Ill. App. 41 and State v Scheffel 82 Wn 2d 872. In the Chicago case it was recognized that simply because there existed a license to operate a vehicle does not mean that any person is fully engaged 24 hours a day in the operation of that business. Equally, it was said in the Scheffel case, that use of an automobile, during certain periods, as a vehicle does not preclude its use as an automobile when not being formally used as a vehicle. To further amplify the distinctive nature that is driving, we find at Transportation Law Journal, 35 Trans. L.J. 1, which is excerpt for brevity, not to lesson the context, more certainly for clarity, as follows;"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"In the motor carrier industry, the “employment classification” determination is frequently critical because of the high incidence of use of “owner- operators.” ( footnote; The term “owner-operator” reflects individuals who lease motor carrier equipment to a motor carrier with driver services. Normally the lessor performs the driver service. ) ...other carriers operate a fleet utilizing driver-employees as well as owner- operators. Driver-employees were utilized and were paid hourly wages. The drivers take upon themselves...to complete a freight movement. ...most drivers, whether employee or an owner-operator, are paid on a “per mile” basis... It is obvious that a driver and owner-operator could increase his “pay” by driving more miles and handling more loads and “overtime” as “dessert” would increase the temptation to do so despite the wear and tear on the equipment and more important, to the health and safe performance of the driver. Significantly, the federal legislators recognized this and felt that two different units of the government and approaches to wage and hour issues should not interfere with each other. “Safety” of the public and the operators won out and thus the Secretary of Transportation, who was presumably more knowledgeable of trucking operations, was given the power to dictate the hours of service which drivers could drive based, in part, of the normal operations of carriers. Historically, the view of the courts, is that the history of a statute is important when attempting to understand evaluate and implement a current version. As shown below, the historical purpose of the statute, as opined by the court, is conducive of the legislative statement in 1965, see section on statutes. This reading is prejudice to the phrase traditional freedoms to which every motorist is entitled, to exemplify that not everyone placing and using their personal automobile on the highways needs a “driver” license, further, by extension and implication, even a numbered “business” license plate on their personal automobile. “The primary rule of construction of statutes is to ascertain the lawmakers’ intent, from the words used if possible; and to put upon the language of the Legislature, honestly and faithfully, its plain and rational meaning, and to promote its object, and ‘ the manifest purpose of the statute, considered historically, ’ is properly given consideration....

The court further explained jurisprudence based on the whole act rule, stated thus; “with a view of determining the meaning of the word 'driver', all provisions of said section must be considered.” Wallace v Woods infra, citing, Bowers v Missouri Mutual Assn . 62 S.W. 2D 1063 Statutory references to driving have always been about compensation. As seen below, the phrases drive , driver , and driving are only for those who receive compensation for their skill. Underlined for emphasis are the key words used by the judiciary, in their own description of driving. “Certainly a driver is only one who drives . A stage coach driver may have had unusual authority on his trips (see Drolshagen v. Union Depot Railroad Co ., 186 Mo. 258, 85 S.W. 344), but we know of no good reason why the word driver would not be commonly and reasonably interpreted to be the person actually doing the driving, whether he was one employed by the owner to drive or whether he was the owner driving. If such terms expressed the purpose of subsequent amendments, there was no reason to change them merely because the statute was being made applicable to situations beyond its original scope. We cannot now judicially know the situation as to how often owners drove their own stage coaches or how many were driven by hired drivers . However, we do know, and we are sure that the Legislature knew, when and after they later inserted the words “motor car” and “automobile” in this statute that many owners of motor vehicles used for public transportation of both freight and passengers did drive them in such service . It seems reasonable to believe that, in all the amendments broadening the scope of the act, there was some purpose in using and continuing to use different terms with respect to railroads and other instrumentalities of public transportation.”  emphasis mine Wallace v Woods 340 Mo.452, 102 S.W. 2D 91 (1937)"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"As one may well establish by the length of this reading that driving is and must be of a commercial nature.

This position would raise fundamental questions, as this position would be diametrically opposed to Constitutional Law. As recognized in this writing, the proper definition of a \" license \" is; \"a permit, granted by an appropriate governmental body, generally for consideration, to a person, firm, or corporation, to pursue some occupation or to carry on some business which is subject to regulation under the police power.\" Rosenblatt v California State Board of Pharmacy 69 Cal. App. 2D 199,158 P.2d 199 Curiosity alone should question the authority of a state to impugn one for not having a public license for travel in the private. What reason could the legislature have, not to include language, and in the history of amended legislation, purposefully delete such terms as 'business', if it were not to confuse, and manifest a clandestine subterfuge of fraudulently created businesses, which then a state could regulate. What the state may not do directly it may not do indirectly.

One court called out the distinction, in discussing the public health and welfare, as that being the use of the highway by travelers is usually a short trip with a single departure point and a single termination point, limiting the amount of time on the highway. Where in contrast, a driver for hire or other occupation or profession, may spend several hours or days traveling public easements with several intermittent stops whereby creating greater liability to other travelers."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"States have a compelling interest in the practice of professions and as part of their power to protect public health and safety and other valid interests, they have the broad power to establish standards for licensing practitioners and regulating the practice of the profession. Lenders Service Inc. v Dayton Bar Asso. 758 F. Supp. 429 Certainly the operation of business on public roads and streets by those individuals who use the highways in excess, should be required to pay a highway or tonnage tax. What was spuriously deleted from the Motor Vehicle Act reformation in the 1960's is the term chauffeur, discussed infra. It is the chauffeur that is the subject of a basic driver license notwithstanding other delivery type occupations. The Latin term n ullum simile est idem, things that are similar are not the same, is the suspect of a claim of void, as to RCW 46.20. See RCW 46.20.055 for similar definitions following; It is necessary, in order to regulate automobiling, to pay the expenses of the department issuing licenses and registering drivers and owners of automobiles. These expenses naturally should be met by the class of persons regulated and licensed. Statutes which regulate the licensing of chauffeurs, contemplate that an applicant for a license shall have received training in that work. Under a statute permitting an unlicensed person over a designated age to operate a motor vehicle “accompanied by a licensed operator”, such training may be possible.

The question may be asked, does a state have authority to classify personal conduct as a part of commerce like that of chauffeurs? NO! Why? Because travelers don't collect a fee, or charge a fare, for traveling to visit the doctor, the veterinarian, the grocer, the hardware store, the beach, the coffee stand, a job, the bank, the school, other family, a restaurant, a sporting event, or to see a movie, or attend a funeral, etc. Ipso facto, if no fee is collected for personal affairs, then the state cannot impose a tax, which is defacto revenue, which is one of several intents of regulation for Title 46 RCW. Earlier, we encountered, at Am Jur 2d Highways, Streets and Bridges §227 and Huddy On Automobiles §26, the term ' incidental '. This term refers to the nature of commerce upon the highways. The courts, in their determination of the phrase incidental, have acknowledged the transpersonal hyperbolic legal reasoning behind licensing statutes. When we look at RCW 46.20, the licensing statute for the STATE of WASHINGTON, we find no notice of the personal private use versus the private for hire use that was formerly a part of the statute. The fundamental risk associated with unbridled license schemes is the inability to detect the extent of the licensing statute in the absence of a narrowly drawn objective and definite standards to guide the licensing authority. Whatever the motive which induced its legislative adoption, lack of strict legislative definition promulgates an overly broad legislative scheme and is therefore void for vagueness. The void for vagueness doctrine, on the front end, necessarily implies that the governmental intent of the statute must be made explicit in the text, not then subject to judicial or administrative construction. see generally 16A Am Jur 2d Constitutional Law §527 However, in order to regulate...the government may impose a permit requirement...so long as the scheme does not delegate an overly broad licensing discretion to an governmental official...therefore any licensing scheme must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest... 16A Am Jur 2d Constitutional Law §527"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"So, the question comes, is RCW 46.20.001 narrowly tailored? No it is not. This writer found the statute to be overly vague, and substantial research was needed to qualify the text and intent of the currently written statute. Ultimately what was determined is that the currently written statute (including those prior, dating back to1968) classifies every single man and woman desiring to use the public highways as a chauffeur a.k.a. driver for hire. RCW 46.20.001 reads in relevant part; (1) No person may drive a motor vehicle upon a highway in this state without first obtaining a valid driver's license issued to Washington residents under this chapter. ... (2) A person licensed as a driver under this chapter: (a) May exercise the privilege upon all highways in this state; (b) May not be required by a political subdivision to obtain any other license to exercise the privilege; and (c) May not have more than one valid driver's license at any time. The interesting similarities between RCW 46.20.001 and the pre-reformation statutes are these; 1) A person licensed as a driver, 2) May not have more than one valid driver's license at any time. These sections as written are expositive of the spurious attempt of the legislature to conceal the actual purpose of the licensing statutes. Licensing statutes must provide notice as to purpose and intent, and the Washington State legislature has intentionally done exactly the opposite. So comes the question, is the state attempting to regulate personal use of personal property? Sure seems like it. Maybe the state would like to license and regulate the type of shoes a man can wear on the public easements. Sure, why not, it is established that many things qualify as vehicles, as in the Laub case of a U.S. Passport. The legislature can in the exercise of its police power, regulate and require the licensure of professionals as it sees fit, but any law in furtherance of the police power must be reasonable and not arbitrary. 51 Am Jur 2d Licenses and Permits §14, citing Auto Reality Service, Inc. v Brown 27 Ohio App. 2d §77, 272 NE 2d 642; see also Ohio AGO 96-045 The means or mode of traveling may be subjected to reasonable regulations.

However, as discussed supra the choice of vehicle is for individual determination and use, not then subject to state li censor ship. The shoes people wear are in fact vehicles, same as an automobile or skateboard and as such are subject to state licensing. The state can no more require a license for the use of shoes than they can require a license to ride a skateboard or use a personal automobile. Commerce is simply defined as payment, delivery, receipt. Intercourse is the giving and receiving of that which is mutually beneficial. What constitutes commerce upon the highways is one of two usual scenarios. One: purchase point of origin-delivery/transport along the highway- and payment/receipt at a terminal point, as is defined of shipping vessels in maritime/admiralty. Two: purchase/hire of a third party vehicle on the highway-for delivery along the highway- payment/receipt [compensation] for use of the third party vehicle on the highway. Commerce consists of commercial intercourse. It must be conceded that interstate travel for pleasure and recreation does not savor of anything commercial. It is not business. It is pleasure and recreation and nothing more. The greater amount of interstate automobile travel is for the pleasure and recreation. Business and pecuniary gain have no connection with it. We will consider briefly in the note the meaning of the term commerce and ascertain if the travel must in some way be connected or related to business, trade or gain. It is the opinion of many persons that Congress possesses no power to take cognizance of the automobile which is engaged in interstate travel for pleasure merely, by legislation directly regulating that kind of travel. See generally Huddy on Automobiles 6 th Ed. § 86; Regulations which might be an unreasonable infringement of the common right to use the highways in the one case would be proper when applying to one seeking to use the highways as a carrier of passengers.

Title 46 RCW Chapter 20 is overly broad because it presumes to notice the public, conversely, the public assumes by the vague language, that all are subject to the statutes licensing guise. What is relevant in this statement is that Washington Courts have ruled on class distinctions several times. “It is well settled that the equal protection of the 14 th amendment to the federal constitution does not take from the State the right or power to classify the subject of legislation; it is only [an] arbitrary and unreasonable classification, classifications to which there is no just difference or distinction between the class affected and others that is thus prohibited.” Huddy on Automobiles 6 th Ed. §137, citing State v Seattle Taxi Cab and Transfer Co . 90 Wash. 416, 156 Pac 837; Allen v City of Bellingham 95 Wash. 12, 163 Pac18; McGlothern v City of Seattle 199 Pac 457 The legislature has ample power to compel the owners of...motor vehicles used for the carriage of passengers for hire to procure licenses.

Every driver license issued after 1968 is issued to a chauffeur or driver for hire, notwithstanding the substitution of the word driver in place of chauffeur. The State of Washington Dept. of Licensing issues thousands of driver licenses every year.

The term chauffeur, French in origin, was deleted and replaced with the English common term, driver. What did not happen , citing from the sources below, is the presumptive all encompassing graft of every man and woman who may use their personal automobile, and subject them to a driver license. Here, once again, deference to RCW 46.20.001 and the language thereto is prudent. Subchapter (2)(c) reads: May not have more than one valid driver's license at any time. Forty years later, this statute bears a striking resemblance to the 1968 Uniform Vehicle Code. The Code was extensively amended in 1968 to form the current § 6-101(c), by eliminating the operator-chauffeur distinction and by clearly applying the one license concept to all licenses issued under the Code . DLLA infra. Valid driver's license. In 1968 the Code abandoned the distinction between operators and chauffeurs licenses and combined these two categories into a single driver's licenses with classifications based upon the type of vehicle the licensee is qualified to drive. Thirty one jurisdictions follow this Code concept by issuing just one basic driver's license and by not making the distinction between operators and chauffeurs. DLLA supra § 6-101(a); [including the State of Washington] The one license concept expresses that every person has but one privilege to drive and that no matter how many different types or classes of vehicles a licensee has been qualified to drive in his home state all types and classes will be noted on one license card.

DLLA supra § 6-104 subsection (b); Every time an executive employee stops, detains, interferes and harasses a traveler on the common highway, that employee invokes and uses commercial licensing policy to coerce the traveler into believing that the personal use of the common highways by personal automobile is illegal and he has authority to deter such further conduct until such time as the policy is complied with. The illusion of the necessity of a license to use a personal automobile is per se banishment from the free use of the public highways. The state police stop people at random for traveling and issue traffic infractions for no valid operator’s license, and arrest people, and impound their personal property for allegedly driving on a suspended license. For purpose of discussion, if an individual should have the unfortunate circumstance of not paying a traffic infraction, and as a consequence, perhaps the driver license is suspended or revoked, consider RCW 46.20.245, driving While License Suspended.

Eggert, supra, citing Vaughan v Bower 313 F. Supp. 37 see also Turner v Fouche infra The people have a Right to travel, uninhibited, the common highways. That Right is prejudicially barred when the state or local armed police stop and arrest based on a statute that is factually designed for compensatory drivers. Theft of a personal automobile is loss of personal property. While the personal automobile is in impound, an individual is forced to use alternate methods and modes of transportation. RCW 46.25 does not have a sub-chapter for the suspension of a commercial driver license. A suspension of a commercial driver license is affected through RCW 46.20.245. This represents proof positive that RCW 46.20 is in fact a commercial licensing statute. Other illustrations could be included but it is readily apparent that when one is deprived of the use of his automobile today, for all practical purposes his mobility is seriously impaired. Admittedly he may be able to locate public transportation, such as a taxi or a bus, but in many instances it will not be available [when needed]. Furthermore, as we have seen, the constitutional right of mobility is an individual, personal right which is not protected but [de facto] restricted if he is forced to use public transportation.

Once a court determines that strict scrutiny must be applied, it is presumed that the law or policy is unconstitutional. The government has the burden of proving that its challenged policy is constitutional. To withstand strict scrutiny, the government must show that its policy is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest. If this is proved, the state must then demonstrate that the legislation is narrowly tailored to achieve the intended result. Here again we have the term 'narrowly tailored'. So, does RCW 46.20 have a narrow state objective as to the licensing of drivers for hire? The answer is NO!

Nowhere. The threshold of the police power, at least as far as statute traffic regulations are concerned, is the public enterprising businesses. Initially, in this section, remember that possession of a driver license and a vehicle registered to the state is a public benefit of business grant from the state. What is the point of challenging a traffic infraction? Perhaps even to challenge personum jurisdiction, or subject matter jurisdiction? What of an effort to challenge the facts that gave rise to the infraction? Perhaps a challenge that the infraction failed to give notice. A citation by definition is a command, by way of writ, from an agency head or a policy dictate, sometimes issued by a court, to compel an officer of the court to do a thing. An arrest warrant is a per se citation. The traffic infraction issued by a policeman is a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. A court is only supposed to resolve disputes and settle claims between litigants, based on the facts brought by either party. As it pertains to a traffic infraction, the judiciary has stepped across boundaries and issued a “citation” commanding the executive branch, to use the courts format for an infraction notice, whereby providing to the executive branch a “pleading” document, intended to perfect judicial appellate jurisdiction. The executive branch citation, a.k.a. traffic infraction, is an executive branch citation; which, on the reverse, gives the option to appeal the infraction to a lower court. The 'appeal' to a lower court is descendant of an executive administrative action. As citations go, look to Infraction Rules for Courts of Limited Jurisdiction 2.1(a) (IRLJ 2.1(a), which reads as follows; Infraction Form Prescribed or approved by the Administrative Office of the Courts. Infraction cases shall be filed on a form entitled \"Notice of Infraction\" prescribed by the Administrative Office of the Courts; ... Notice of Infraction forms prescribed or approved by the Administrative Office of the Courts are presumed valid and shall not be deemed insufficient by reason of defects or imperfections which do not prejudice substantial rights of the defendant. The preceding “citation” is found at the bottom of a traffic infraction. Notice at the"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"bottom of the infraction claim form, the words “WASHINGTON UNIFORM COURT DOCKET”. This 'form' of infraction, or writ , is a command by the judiciary to the executive department of government, the police, to provide the judiciary with all of the jurisdictional information they need to perfect the states claim. Everything that happens in a court room happens at the discretion of the judge. However, be equally assured that the judge will use that discretion to the best benefit of the state; because as the rule above indicates, an infraction is valid so long as it does not “prejudice substantial rights of the defendant.” And a drivers substantive rights will not have been violated, because the driver is presumed to have knowledge of the constructive contract. ( see definitions ) Because several statutory alternatives for meeting that element were based on conduct alone, the statutory scheme created a strict liability crime, requiring no proof of the defendant's intent. State of Washington v. Steven Mertens (2003) The policy enforcement employee is only enforcing a contract that was made to operate a business, and the judge is fully cognizant of that contract. HERES WHY; the infraction contains a certification by the police employee that everything is as true: THE UNDERSIGNED CERTIFIES AND SAYS THAT IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON [your legal person information here] DID OPERATE THE FOLLOWING VEHICLE/MOTOR VEHICLE ON A PUBLIC HIGHWAY AND [your business information here] DID AND THEN THERE COMMITT EACH OF THE FOLLOWING OFFENSES [statute violation(s) here] I CERTIFY UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY..... /S/"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"On the infraction, there are three 'jurisdictional balloons'. The first balloon contains a persons employee driver license number which certifies the person to be a driver. It also contains all identifying information about t legal person. It also contains a block for the identity of the employer of the driver. It also contains several blocks which indicate that the statute violation occurred within the venue jurisdiction of the State of Washington and/or the local jurisdiction. The first balloon gives the court indisputable personum jurisdiction. The second balloon contains all of the business identifiers (as far as the DOL, DMV, and DOT are concerned, saving taxing regulations) necessary to convince a judge, that in fact, there exists a business for the proprietary jurisdiction of the police and the latent jurisdiction of the court. It contains the business name and address as well as the business vehicle identifiers, primarily the license plate number. The license plate number itself is tantamount to a Master Business License; and as such, is a physical address, as it were, of the business vehicle, much like a street address if the business were located on real property. Occasionally a policeman will write “same as above”, in the “owner” box. This is because the owner/operator of the business occasionally is driving his own business. The second balloon gives the court the first element of subject matter jurisdiction, being that the business is conducted within the State of Washington. This third balloon gives the court, the second half of subject matter jurisdiction. This balloon calls for the specific statute code section purportedly violated. The box labeled DV is an acronym for domestic violence. As for wanting to argue facts; when a person checks the box to request a mitigation (appeal) hearing, he is not only acquiescing that he committed the violation, and subsequently wants to negotiate the damages he caused the state (asking for equitable review), he also, in and of his eristic delusion, has voluntarily given the last element of subject matter jurisdiction, which are now the facts in evidence .

There are a good many dicta ─ mostly in older cases —and some holdings to the effect that the occupier of land owes the bare licensee no greater duty than to refrain from intentional, or willful or wanton, misconduct towards him. “Once a person’s presence becomes known, the significance of the classifications largely disappears, and he is owed the duty of reasonable care (as to activities) whatever his status on the land. ... This does not mean, however, that the plaintiff’s status may have no bearing on what conduct defendant may reasonably expect of him.” ( cites omitted ) The occupier is commonly said to owe greater duties to his invitees than to licensees, notably with respect to inspection and discovery of latent dangers on his land. ...The economic benefit theory proceeds on the assumption that affirmative obligations are imposed on people only in return for some consideration or benefit. Any obligation to discover latent dangerous conditions of the premises is regarded as an affirmative one, and the consideration for imposing it is sought in the economic advantage—actual or potential—of the plaintiff’s visit to the occupier’s own interest. “It is not the fact of ‘invitation, nor of the knowledge of the probability of the customer’s presence which this implies which raises the duty, but the purpose of the visit and the occupier’s interest therein.” ( cites omitted ) The invitation test does not deny that “invitation” may be based on economic benefit, but it does not regard that as essential. Rather it bases “invitation” on the fact that the occupier by his arrangement of the premises or other conduct has led the entrant to believe “that [the premises] were intended to be used by visitors” for the purpose which the entrant was pursuing, “and that such use was not only acquiesced in by the owner [or possessor], but that it was in accordance with the intention and design with which the way or place was adapted and prepared....

The occupiers' duty to the invitee is one of due care under all circumstances. If plaintiff is an invitee at the time and place of his injury, the occupier, of course, owes him all the duties he owes to trespassers and licensees. Thus the occupier must use care not to injure plaintiff by negligent activity.... In addition, the occupier owes the duty of care to inspect his premises and to discover dangerous conditions.

If the invitee wishes to come on those terms, he assumes the risk. But here again, the basis of defendant’s truncated duty is not his superior knowledge, but his ownership and control of the unreasonably dangerous condition. Under this rule the occupier’s superior knowledge might properly be called a condition of liability, but it is not a reason or justification either for the occupier’s duty or for the limitation put upon it. Defendant claimed that its only duty was to warn, but the court answered that it did “not recognize it to be a universal rule that an owner who invites the public upon his premises for business or pleasure may, in the absence of reasonable necessity, maintain thereon dangerous agencies, as wires charged with deadly currents of electricity, in such places as to endanger life and limb, and escape liability by maintaining danger signals or otherwise advising the public.” ( cites omitted ) In cases where the invitee’s recovery has been denied, contributory negligence has often played an important role, and is sometimes hopelessly confused with the duty issue. If contributory negligence would always bar an invitee who was injured by a condition of the premises which he knew and appreciated, the confusion would do little practical harm.... Most of the decisions denying liability are rested equally on the ground of contributory negligence. Curtis v. Traders Nat. Bank , 314 Ky. 765, 237 S.W.2d 76 These situations show that the invitee will not always be barred by his self exposure to known dangers on the premises. This means that the Restatement rule will sometimes bar a plaintiff, who has not been negligent, from recovery against a defendant who has acquainted the plaintiff with the condition which would be negligent towards him if a full duty of care were owed. A right to enter also stands on a footing different from the privilege which the occupier is free to withhold or to give by invitation or permission. This does not mean that visitors in their own right should all be accorded the same treatment. They are not, and probably should not be.

It means that the state should take caution to warn travelers that an application for a driver license or an operator’s license moves the traveler from a “free use” category to a full time regulated business category. Conversely, a traveler has an obligation, to make his non-business presence known to the state. The state owes a duty of full disclosure as to the distinction, purpose of, and use for, the application for driver/operator license. When that “free use” traveler distinction is made, the several classifications of vehicles and motor vehicles become irrelevant. The states regulatory authority stops predominately (not entirely) at the regulation of businesses. The state has a duty to protect all travelers as members of the general public; all the while it is surveying the roadways affecting its business regulatory police power. The state cannot force an individual into a business license of any kind and must accept the private traveler on the common highway. Licenses are for the conduct of businesses in commerce and the private traveler cannot be forced by attrition to relinquish or surrender his common law access to the highways for some license to engage in a business pursuit. The state has an obligation to allow private use of the highways. When a policeman stops a traveler, he is trespassing creating a private nuisance; if the policeman issues a traffic infraction, he creates an aggravation of circumstance. Although, the infraction is tantamount to a solicitation, and thusly, an invitation to engage in a secured transaction (saving elaboration), see UCC 1et seq, offering an opportunity to the traveler, to submit to state jurisdiction, and/or admit that someone was actually driving a business. The nuisance theory is reciprocal. It is this nuisance, post trespass, which creates the tort liability of John Doe policeman. The fact that John Doe policeman has impeded the ability to travel, he is the very epitome of an obstruction. Blacks law dictionary defines nuisance as; nuisance. 1. A condition or situation that interferes with the use or enjoyment of property."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"“A ‘nuisance’ is a state of affairs. To conduct a nuisance is a tort. “The right of the public in a common highway is paramount and controlling. This right extends to the entire territory within its limits and an obstruction placed upon any part of it constitutes a public nuisance. Commonwealth v. King , 13 Met. 115.” The Law Applied To Motor Vehicles, Babbitt c.1911; citing Morton v. Moore , 81 Mass. 573 To further define nuisance, we'll look to Washington statutes, to discern, between a public and a private nuisance. First, we find a poignant statement of nuisance, affecting state actors, at RCW 7.48.120, which reads as follows: Nuisance defined. Nuisance consists in unlawfully doing an act, or omitting to perform a duty, which act or omission either annoys, injures or endangers the comfort, repose, health or safety of others, offends decency, or unlawfully interferes with, obstructs or tends to obstruct, or render dangerous for passage, any lake or navigable river, bay, stream, canal or basin, or any public park, square, street or highway; or in any way renders other persons insecure in life, or in the use of property. Emphasis mine Below is the distinction of public versus private. Carefully noting though, that a public nuisance, is when an obstruction affects the whole of the public; as likened to a roadblock or fallen tree, which prevents passage to all people. RCW 7.48.130 reads as follows: Public nuisance defined. A public nuisance is one which affects equally the rights of an entire community or neighborhood, although the extent of the damage may be unequal.    Italic mine Traveling privately is not unlawful ; conversely, police license regulation directed to private travel is not lawful . What concerns the personal private traveler is the following statute. The private nuisance is one that affects an individual interest, and not the whole of the public. RCW 7.48.150, reads as follows. Private nuisance defined."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Every nuisance not included in the definition of RCW 7.48.130 is private. But the policeman is protected by the state, right? No, not in the instance of the personal private traveler. It was found at RCW 7.48.120 above, that a nuisance is, “unlawfully doing an act”. Does the policeman have lawful authority to interfere with private travel? Not according to one hundred ten plus years, of legal authority contained in the breadth of this writing. The state is not in disagreement with this statement. State policy is found at RCW 4.92.070, which says that the state will defend an employee if he is within the scope of his official duties . RCW 4.92.070 reads: If the attorney general shall find that said officer, employee, or volunteer's acts or omissions were, or were purported to be in good faith, within the scope of that person's official duties, The police' official duties are restricted to regulating business's. It is not a public employee defense that a traveler did not apply for an employee driver license and/or convey an interest in the automobile to the state by registering it as a business or even pay quarterly business taxes; it also is not a defense that so many other persons have licenses. While the state has an obvious interest in the money machine that the Dept. of Licensing has allowed to burgeon by way of failure to disclose the true intent of the licenses and yet accept every single license application that crosses the counter; it does not, itself, obviate the individual policeman from liability in tort, for trespass. It is not a defense that the policeman does not know the breadth of the law which is stated in this writing; then he is poorly trained in the law of the highways. A policy enforcement employee who affronts the private traveler, should be trained in the breadth of this legal study. The determination of who is “adversely affected or aggrieved within the meaning of any relevant statute” has “been marked out largely by the gradual judicial process of inclusion and exclusion aided at times by the courts judgment as to the probable legislative intent derived from the spirit of the statutory scheme.” Federal Administrative Procedure Source Book, 4 th Ed. 2008"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"“That the streets of the city are highways of the state, and therefore public roads which every citizen has a right to use, is a valid argument against stopping or unreasonably hindering travel over the streets , but it is no argument at all against subjecting travel over those streets to rules and regulations.” emphasis mine The Law Applied To Motor Vehicles. Babbitt §43 , @112 citing, City of St. Louis v. Green , 7 Mo. App. 468 However, should a person actually possess a driver or operator license, admittedly suffers the contributory negligence “learning curve”. Notwithstanding that, an individual can use a company vehicle without a driver license, according to the Scheffel court ( State v Scheffel 82 Wn 2d 872) ; the fact that a business license is in effect on the vehicle, pugnaciously mandates that a person take up the traffic infraction solicitation and go to court and mitigate the damages, because the alleged driver presumptively falls under the prescript of the statute regulation. People have a right to the use of the common highways, but equally have an obligation to NOTICE the state of that intended use, for the simple reasons that one is simply exercising the existential right to free use of the highways and is not an enemy combatant. Once notice is given the state, by any one or more agencies, of the status as private traveler, the full weight of tort liability, falls on the policeman who has actually engages and detains the personal private traveler.

The notarized request was filled out and sent with these questions;  Please provide to me a copy of the original application for vehicle license on a specific vehicle.  Please also provide a copy of the original application for driver license for a particular person.  Please also provide a copy of the original application for an operators license for a specified person with a known (specified) license number."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Attached as a separate p-d was a question as to the DOL's use of the term “personal driver license”. Which is the term the DOL uses on their disclosure form in response to a state request for a driver abstract, when they suspend the driver license of a driver. Included in this query was the use of the term “private” driver license. The DOL does not know what a private driver license is; “No responsive record found.” See responsive items 11-12 below. In response to the question of a personal driver license, the DOL stated it thus; Finally, in response to your question “is there a specific statute that uses the language 'personal driver license,'” I can only reassert that the statute I provided, RCW 46.20.001 provides the authority for driver licensing: “No person may drive a motor vehicle upon a highway in this state without first obtaining a valid driver’s license .” (emphasis added). As to the question for a copy of the driver license application, a notarized form swearing that the information would not be disseminated was sent, intended, as requested, to protect personal information. A response came back telling me that the information would not be released because it contained personal information and also that the record of question was aged and unavailable. The DOL was asked to provide a copy of a blank form application for vehicle license and a blank form application for driver license. While waiting for a response to the vehicle licensing questions, a p-d was sent asking if the DOL has a form similar to the U.S. FMCSA (federal motor carrier safety act) DOT-150. The DOL' response is that the state does not have a form similar to the DOT-150. In response to the question of application for vehicle license, the response came back with a blank specimen “Vehicle Certificate of Ownership (Title) Application”. Along with that was a computer generated application for driver license.

(1) No person may drive a motor vehicle upon a highway in this state without first obtaining a valid driver’s license issued to Washington residents under this chapter The only exceptions to this requirement are those expressly allowed by RCW 46.20.025. (2) A person licensed as a driver under this chapter: (a) May exercise the privilege upon all highways in this state; (b) May not be required by a political subdivision to obtain any other license to exercise the privilege; and (c) May not have more than one valid driver’s license at any time.

So it is determined, that an application for license plates and an application for registration are the same thing. An application for title, is an application for a business license; which application doubles as the signing over of ownership interest in an automobile to the state; giving the state an interest in personal property which authorizes the regulation of the business that was created . A public disclosure was sent to the DOL, asking them to clarify vehicle license plates. The p-d asked the DOL if it could be correctly determined that that License plate configuration 000AAA was a passenger carrier, and the configuration A00000A as a common carrier. Three responses were received initially, stating that the 000AAA plates are passenger and the A00000A plates are for trucks. To galvanize the certainty in this writing that license plates are business related, these questions were asked of the DOL, but notice below that the DOL has declared the license plates to be an unidentifiable record, and further, will not definitively say yes they are business license plates, neither will they say definitively no they are not business license plates."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"QUERY 1. As it pertains to the license plate configuration, and the relation to the attached disclosure request, could you please state with clarity whether these are in fact license plates issued to \"carrier\" businesses , and in so stating; 2. I would ask that you answer the disclosure request and state with clarity if an application for vehicle title and an application to register a vehicle is in fact registering a business? 3. I am still not clear on the term \"personal\" driver license. Ben attempted to locate the term Personal in statute but could not. I ask again could you please tell me what statute I can find the term \"personal\" as it exists on the attached DOL research document. 4. If the term \"personal\" does not exist in statute authority, could you identify the term as a misnomer or provide statutory authority to issue personal driver license'. RESPONSE We have provided all the public records you requested. Your remaining questions below are not requests for identifiable public records. Since I am with the public disclosure office, I can’t effectively respond to them with the exception of Item 2. The titling and registration of a vehicle is not the same as obtaining a Washington state business license. Our website gives a very nice guide to business licensing at [ website omitted ]. Some business own vehicles and register the vehicles under the business name. Of course, you know from prior communications that state agency staff cannot give legal advice, and will not indulge in speculative interpretations of the law. As seen from the above p-d response, received from the single, sole, and only agency responsible for issuing license plates in the State of Washington; when asked if the license plates issued, are for “carrier” businesses, and in so doing, if applying for title to register a vehicle is in fact registering a business, the DOL’s response, is that they are “not requests for identifiable public records”, and that the DOL “can’t effectively respond to them” because to do so would be to engage in “speculative interpretations of the law”."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"When we resort to the maxim of law, being, the expression of one thing is the exclusion of the other , and then look around on the highways, what is found is that two door and four door sedans, station wagons and smaller sport utility vehicles all adorn the 000AAA license plate. Now if a taxi cab business has this license plate, what does that make the rest of the vehicles? If the answer is passenger carrier business, that's correct. Were the quarterly business taxes paid to the Dept. of Revenue? On the other hand though, notice that the larger sport utility vehicles and pick-up trucks and vans all have the same A00000A license plate that is found on the semi tractor trailer big rigs, and community transit buses. If it is the expression of one thing , that the license plate nomenclature A00000A is a common carrier, does that make “John Doe’s” pick-up truck a common carrier? Absolutely it does! So, to be, the exclusion of the other, or common traveler, no registration, title or license as a business is required. On the computer generated driver license application form that was received from the DOL, after a few requisite questions, mostly questions establishing a legal person and its residence, there is a signature line certification. First it must be sworn that the person applying for the license is the person signing. The second half of that certification reads thus; “I grant the Department of Licensing permission to consider this application with the understanding this permission cannot be withdrawn.” Addressing the above certification, notice the terms grant, permission and consider . First, the signer makes a grant to the state; which is in retrospect, the exact consent which is required, according to the State of Washington Constitution at Art.1 § 1; “by the consent of the governed”, as seen by reference to the definitions below.

At common law, any written instrument that is signed, sealed, and delivered and that coveys some interest in property. A driver license is not, in and of itself, a per se state business, moreover because the driver license is simply an identification of an employee's particular task. However, the spurious fraudulent act that the State of Washington has committed is to combine, by statute definition and purpose, RCW 46.20.040, the operators (business) license with the driver license, whereby the grant to be considered is not simply a request for a driver license but that the state has created an operator paradigm business without noticing the applicant of that action; that act, or deed , is the consideration language of the application, where the right to travel was conveyed, and converted to the operation of a business privilege granted by the state. Ipso facto the driver license is a sole proprietor business."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"To further invoke the notion of constructive fraud, of special note here, is that the application for driver/operator license only contains line space for identification of an individuals name; if it was only the operator (business) license, and not the driver license, that one sought to make application for, there is no separate line space to identify a business proper. Also noteworthy, is a reference to the application for title. For succinct purposes here, we only need address two lines on the application for title; one, is the line space asking for a name and the other asking for an address. The address line reads thus: Washington State primary residence street address (if an individual) or Washington State principal place of business street address (if a business) bold mine The name line only asks for a name, without distinguishing an individual from a business, while the business can be at either of two addresses. Interestingly though, saving discussion on the difference of The State of Washington versus Washington State. What is relevant here is the play on words; for example, primary and principal are each synonyms of the other; and the business is the res-ident (latin, meaning- identity of a thing; in this case, it is the business). There is no separate line to identify an actual business. This coy illusion is unnecessary because all the DOL needs, by statute authority, is an address for the res-ident . Each of the two preceding paragraphs should be read consistent with the section on statute history, earlier herein. When an individual assumes application for a driver/operator (business) license is mandatory, the applicant then assumes he must register his automobile. An automobile purchased from a private sale comes with a bill of sale ; the bill of sale is a deed of Right of possession. When the automobile is registered, the DOL asks for the bill of sale, two things happen; one- the possessor conveys to the state a partial, priority interest of right of ownership; and second-grants to the state a consideration for the business that was created."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The bill of sale that was freely given over to the state will never be seen again, because the right of possession has been conveyed, and title was claimed by the state. The applicant has now consented and authorized the state police to stop him for any one or more of the statute violations, enumerated in the miscellaneous motor vehicle codes. Produced also from this research, were two applications for a license, more appropriately two parts of one application. The first, is a “general” license, and the second a commercial driver license. The first, general license (simple) application having the above described terms. The second, a commercial application which has the intrinsic information contained in the simple license but also has curious attributes. The commercial application asks four qualification questions. Three are highlighted here; 1. Do you drive a vehicle in interstate commerce? 2. Do you meet all the requirements in the code of federal regulations part 392.11 and 383.51? 3. Do you have a driver license from more than one state or licensing jurisdiction? According to question number one, if a person can drive a vehicle in interstate commerce, (which is federally regulated) he is automatically under the states authoritative mandate to possess only one license. If the state only allows one license, and this one is commercial, then by what authority is there issued a non-commercial license? The answer, is none, every license is commercial. The second question is vague. It points to “code of federal regulation part [* * * ].” What title of the code of federal regulation? To be ironically certain, Title 49 Code of Federal Regulation--Transportation. The third curious attribute to the commercial application is the class certifications list, and the signature certification, which reads in relevant part here; “...the vehicles I drive are representatives for the class marked above.”"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"For purposes of this writing, it is the first class which concerns the bulk of the private vehicles that are licensed. The diagram below is shown as it appears on the license application (that was provided); the classes of vehicles, and drivers thereof, are as follows; CLASS ‌ ENDORSEMENTS AND / OR RESTRICTION TEST NEEDED  ׀ ‌ Passenger/Bus __Hazardous Materials ‌ ׀ __Double/Triple Trailer __School Bus ‌ ׀ __Tank Vehicle __Air Brakes Restriction Note that a passenger vehicle is first on the list, of classes of vehicles and drivers thereof. What is interesting about this is that, a) this class appears on the commercial application, not the general application; b) the passenger classification does not have a demarcation line; c) the applicant swears the vehicle is representative of the class marked above. Of the types of vehicles shown, a passenger vehicle, by statute, RCW 46.25.080, is a class “C” commercial vehicle. This means that JOHN DOE has sworn that, for example, a Honda Civic, is representative of a class “C” vehicle. It is a standing rule of law that silence is acquiescence. The passenger class, being absent the demarcation line, is a technical silence as to the applicable choice. However, this absence does not prevent the DOL from making some type of sign or mark indicating the passenger class, thereby “assuming” this to be the correct class, for the type of vehicle registered. It is, for all intents and purposes, a free for all default selection. So, this “void”, is itself representative of an unidentifiable public record which cannot be effectively responded to, as it presumes speculative interpretation of law. Remember there is only one license authorized by statute and it is issued by authority of RCW 46.20; the special license at RCW 46.25, called “commercial”, only authorizes the extension of specific performance or circumstance, concerning weights, capacities, and cargo's. And every vehicle bearing license plates is a business, registered to some person."}]
