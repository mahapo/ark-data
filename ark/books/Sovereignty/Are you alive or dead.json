[See 28 U. S. Code § 3002] This is not an opinion, it is a FACT! The U.S. President is the CEO of the \"Federal corporation\". On August 10, 1999, CEO Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13132 - Federalism. Section 2 states: “(d) The people of the States are free, subject only to restrictions in the Constitution itself or in constitutionally authorized Acts of Congress, to define the moral , political , and legal character of their lives.” According to the legal dictionary of thefreedictionary.com [1] character means: character (An individual), noun being, body, figure, human, human being, man, mortal, party, person, personage, personality, self-determined being, somebody, someone Moral Character One key to defining one's moral character can be whether or not one fulfills his/her obligations or lives up to his/her promises or oaths. An honorable and moral man or woman does both. However, there is one ethnic group that frequently and secretively says a prayer - called the Kol Nidre - each year voluntarily releasing themselves from their obligations or oaths. They choose to define their character as amoral. \"All vows we are likely to make, all oaths and pledges we are likely to take between this Yom Kippur and the next Yom Kippur, we publicly renounce. Let them all be relinquished and abandoned, null and void, neither firm nor established. Let our vows, pledges and oaths be considered neither vows nor pledges nor oaths.\" 1 Political Character The key to defining your political character can be found in 28 US Code § 1746.

Executed on (date). (Signature)”. 2 Legal Character The key to defining your legal character is the word \"person\". Statutes passed by elected officials and regulations created by 'agencies' are all written for legal \"persons\". Therefor e it is crucial that we understand what a \"person\" is and what it is not. Here are examples of their definitions: Federal Register Act [of the UNITED STATES] (1935) https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/laws/federal- register/1501.html ''person'' means an individual , partnership, association, or corporation (3 legal constructs - not one a living being!) 2 2 https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1746"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"California statutes: Government code Section 1-26 17. “Person” includes any person, firm, association, organization, partnership, limited liability company, business trust, corporation, or company (8 legal constructs - not one a living being!) Ohio statutes: Statutory definitions 1.59 (C) “Person” includes an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, and association (6 legal constructs - not one a living being!) UCC Article 1 - General Provisions Sec 1-201 General Definitions https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/1-201 (27) \"Person\" means an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, association, joint venture, government, governmental subdivision, agency, or instrume ntality, public corporation, or any other legal or commercial entity. (14 legally created entities - not one a living being!) Legal \"persons\" are not flesh and blood living men and women. Proof that our laws/statutes are written for legal fiction \"persons\" and corporations - not for flesh and blood living men and women - can be found in the legal process by which courts interpret and apply statutory legislation. Sometimes the words of a statute have a plain and straightforward meaning, but in many cases, there is some ambiguity or vagueness in the words of the statut e, such as \"person\", that must be resolved by a judge. To determine th e meanings of statutes, judges use various tools and methods of stat utory interpretation, including traditional canons. The judiciary may apply rules of statutory interpretation both to legislation enacted by the legislature and to delegated legislation such as ad ministrative agency regulations. Here are three rules considered by judges when they interpret the applicability of statutes/rules: 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"1) ejusdem generis - rules only apply to persons or things of the same kind or class. http://thelawdictionary.org/ejusdem-generis/ Of the same kind, class, or nature. In statutory construction, the \"ejusdem generis rule\" is that where general words follow an enumeration of persons or things, by words of a particular and specific meaning, such general words are not to be construed in their widest extent, but are to be held as applying only to persons or things of the same general kind or class as those specifically mentioned. 2) expressio unius est exclusio alterius - one thing having been mentioned, the other is excluded http://legal- dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/ex pressio+unius+est+exclusio+alterius Is a rule of construction, applying both to statute and legal writings, that states that one thing having been mentioned the other is excluded. Thus, following this rule, ‘no dogs allowed’ means that lions are allowed but guide dogs are excluded. 3) noscitur a sociis - meaning understood from accompanying words http://legal-dictionary.thefreedi ctionary.com/noscitur+a+sociis Means comprehended from a ccompanying words, perceived from accompanying words, realized from accompanying words, recognized from accompanying words, understood from accompanying words If any or all of these rules are applied to federal regulations, state statutes and the Uniform Commercial Code, it becomes even more apparent that they are not written for living men and women - unless we are tricked into consenting. In America the states have authority over relevant matters in their respective jurisdictions, unless the st ate's definitions of their statutes conflicts with those recognized federally. This explains why both California and Ohio define \"persons\" almost identically with the Federal Register. While the term \"character\" includes both men and persons, the way the term \"person\" is used in statutes - preceding a list of non-living 4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"legal entities - precludes it from referri ng to living men and women . . . unless the Uniform Commercial Code rule regarding \"presumptions\" is applied!

HIDDEN HISTORY: BIRTH OF THE \"PERSON\" 3 When the UNITED STATES went bankru pt in the 30s because of the banksters orchestrated \"great depression\", so-called \"federal\" government representatives pledge d (hypothecated) the future earnings and productivity of the American people to the international central banksters as payment of the debt.[2] From the Congressional Record of 3-17-93 submitted by Rep. James Traficant: \"In 1933, the federal United States hypothecated all of the present and future properties, assets and labor of their \"subjects,\" the 14th Amendment U.S. citizen, to the Federal Reserve System\" ; hypothecate: to pledge to a creditor as security without delivering, as property. http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hypothecate 5 3 While many researchers have demonstrated that the Federal \"person\" was created with the passage of the 14th Amendment, it wasn't until Birth Certificates became required that the system in place today was perfected."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (F DR) was put in office in 1933 to administer this new system of government/economics. It was called The New Deal and sold both to Congress and the American people as an emergency solution to a national economic nightmare. The national state of emergency declared at the time - giving the office of the President unconstitutional authority - has b een maintained ever since.[3] Also in 1933 The people's gold wa s confiscated and they were given a new currency to use called the FEDERAL RESERVE NOTE, the scrip of the privately owned central bank, the FEDERAL RESERVE. The creation of the US Dollar/FEDERAL RESERVE NOTE actually brought in Rothschild's New World Order and it was displayed on the one dollar bill in 1935 for all to see: The motto inscribed beneath the pyrami d in the Great Seal of America is \"Novus Ordo Seclorum\" which is Latin for \"New Order of the Ages\", and synonymous with the \"New World Order\". We need to remind ourselves that the FEDERAL RESERVE NOTE (the US Dollar) is the currency of the private Federal R eserve banking cartel . . . not the currency of a sovereign nation. The hypothecated population's earnings had to be tracked and taxed, so UNITED STATES citizens were encouraged to sign up for \"federal\" Social Insurance aka Social Security . The Social Security Act - part of FDR's New Deal - was passed in 1935. [Note: today it is almost impossible to work or open a bank account without presenting a Social Security number. Social Security numbers have been automatically assigned to each Birth Certificate since the late 80s, ] THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE Fairly soon afterward, the Birth Certificate tracking system was created and mothers were strongly urged to sign a Certificate of Live Birth as 6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"soon as they named their newborn infants. Unbeknownst to the baby's Mom and Dad, this document creates a brand new fictitious \"person\" that is recorded, and tracked through thei r Social Security number from then on.[4] The legal \"person\" is named JOHN DOE (in all caps) to coincide with the baby's family-given name John Doe. President Woodrow Wilson's private papers exposed this admission of Colonel Edward Mandell House: “Very soon, every American will be required to register their biological property in a National system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient system of pledging. \"By such methodology, we can compel people to submit to our agenda, which will affect our secu rity as a charge back for our fiat paper currency. Every American will be forced to register or suffer not being able to work and earn a living. \"They will be our Chattel and we will hold the security interest over them forever, by operation of the law merchant [5] under the scheme of secured transactions. Americans, by unknowingly or unwittingly delivering the bills of lading to us will be rendered bankrupt and insolvent, forever to remain economic slaves through taxation, secured by their pledges.\" This has all been done by subterfuge via the complicit, perhaps unaware, BAR Association's army of attorneys. This scam is - and always has been - a fraud against all Americans. UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE It is important to understand that the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) - applies to all commercial transactions in America. In the 50s and 60s the UCC was installed across America to make all statutes and commercial contracts more uniform.[6] Quote from UCC GENERAL PROVISIONS § 1-103 : “The Uniform Commercial Code must be liberally construed and applied . . . to make uniform the law among the various jurisdictions.” 7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Some call this legal system statutory law; some call it law merchant; and others refer to it simply as contract law. New laws are deceptively presented to us as Constitutional - under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Commerce Clause describes an enumerated power listed in the United States Constitution (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3). The clause states that the Un ited States Congress shall have power \"To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\" Commerce is a term which means a ll the activities which start from production and end at consumption. The system includes legal, economic, political, social , cultural and technological systems that are in operation in any country or internationally . 4 Dispute exists within the courts as to the range of powers granted to Congress by the Commerce Clause. As noted below, the clause is often paired with the Necessary 5 and Proper Clause , the combination used to take a broad, expansive perspective of these powers. During the post-1937 era, the use of the Commerce Clause by Congress to authorize federal control of economic matters became effectively unlimited.\" 6 The fact that the federal governmen t corporation now controls commerce was exposed in 1973 in Senate Report 93-949. On page 2, this report states that during a national state of emergency - which the report admits has been ongoing since 1933 - the following powers are assumed: This vast range of powers, taken together, confer enough authority to rule the country without reference to normal Constitutional processes. 8 4 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce 5 Laws of necessity refer to the permanent state of national emergency that was started by FDR in 1933. See: Senate Report 93-549. 6 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Under the powers delegated by these statutes, the President [or his agencies] may: seize property; organize and control the means of production; seize commodities; assign military forces abroad; institute martial law; seize and control all transportation and communication; regulate the operation of private enterprise; restrict travel; and, in a plethora of particular ways, control the lives of all American citizens. This was done, without the knowledge or consent of the American people who still believe the US Cons titution is the law of the land. The reality is that they have been tricked into becoming tax and code slaves by the Rothschild international banking cartel and its BAR, which in the United States is the American BAR Association. . This nefarious system stays in place due to the \"presumption\" [7] that we are all volunteering to be dead le gal \"persons\". According to UCC General Provisions [8], presumptions remain valid unless evidence is provided to the contrary. Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, defines “presumption” as follows: A presumption is a rule of law, statutory or judicial, by which finding of a basic fact gives rise to existence of presumed fact, until presumption is rebutted. A legal device which operates in the absence of other proof to require that certain inferences be drawn from the available evidence. NOTICE OF CONDITION PRECEDENT [9] The first step to rebutting the presumpti on that we have volunteered to be a legal \"person\" tax and code slave is to recognize that President Bill Clinton presented us with another opti on in his Executive Order 13132 in 1999: Federalism Section 2 Fundamental Federalism Principles (d) “(d) The people of the States are free, subject only to restrictions in the Constitution itself or in constitutionally authorized Acts of Congress, to define the moral, political, and legal character of their lives.” 9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Unless we define our political characters as non UNITED STATES Corporation [10] \"citizens\" and our legal characters as living men and women, we will continue to be obligated under all of the thousands of onerous, inane, and many times undisclosed codes and statutes passed by federal, state and local corporate governments.

Black’s Law 4th Edition – condition precedent: ” . . . it is a condition referring to a future event, upon the happening of which the obligation becomes no longer binding upon the other party, if he chooses to avail himself of the condition.” In other words, once you implement a legal notice (see UCC § 1-202.
